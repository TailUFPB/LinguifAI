this may shock you  but michelle obama wears clothing  in fact  sometimes she wears very nice clothing  like the naeem khan dress she wore to the nordic state dinner on friday  the washington post reports michelle obama is standing out in a sea of black tuxedos in a blush colored  strapless  floor length gown at the nordic summit dinner the first lady chose a dress by indian born designer naeem khan for the white house dinner honoring the leaders of sweden  iceland  finland  denmark and norway  she finished the look with gold jewelry and a wispy chignon while state dinners typically celebrate a single head of state   and mrs  obama often wears a gown by a designer from the country being honored   the nordic party was a twist on typical white house protocol the president did  indeed  step on his wife s dress  the first lady feigned outrage  then the couple had some fun with the situation  she looks good   barack said when the two paused for photographs   he stepped on my dress   michelle followed up  the president then put a finger up to his lips  playfully  shushing  as though the incident was to remain a huge secret  it was a very human moment for the first couple  naturally  conservatives had to jump in to share their thoughts on the  apes  in the white house  you can put lipstick on a monkey  but you still have a monkey   one commenter on abc news  facebook page wrote  one person wondered if  his   michelle s   fake booby  popped out of the dress  others lamented that she did not fall and harm herself  while some chose to simply call her a  pig  and a  gorilla                      the unbridled hatred leveled at the first family is unprecedented  recently  upon learning that malia obama had gotten into harvard  fox news fans took time out of their busy day of huffing paint fumes and masturbating to donald trump s photograph to inform everyone they thought she was a  n gger  barack and michelle obama have weathered a nonstop barrage of racist comments since before the president was elected the first time  but conservatives have not been remotely content to leave it at that  they genuinely believe that black people living in the white   white  is  after all  in the name  house is a crime against nature barack obama has been arguably the best president in decades  perhaps in our country s history  and will probably be the best for at least decades to come  michelle obama is a classy woman whose strength has enabled the president to be all that he is  their children are impressive young ladies who will certainly make an impact on the world  the problem is that our frenemies on the right are incapable of seeing anything more than a skin color they hate watch this deeply human event unfold below featured image via screengrab
