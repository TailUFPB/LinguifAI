before senator bernie sanders popularized stepping up to the democratic establishment  which has been overrun by corporate and big money influences  zephyr teachout made waves in new york state by challenging democratic incumbent  governor andrew cuomo  to a primary race in   despite being heavily out funded by governor cuomo  who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests  ms  teachout received  percent of the vote  including winning many counties in the state  including albany county  home of the state s capital  although she lost  her campaign  the first she ever ran  was a blow to the myth that elected officials  particularly incumbents  are invincible in elections from their own political party in january   ms  teachout  currently as associate law professor at fordham university  announced she is running for new york s  congressional district seat  i m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics  i think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress  and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money   said ms  teachout in a phone interview ms  teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress  is campaign finance reform  especially in regards to overturning the scotus citizens united ruling in   i ve already been working in the last several years to promote congressman john sarbanes   d md  bill  which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in new york city   she said   congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend  percent of their time raising money  a public financing system like what congressman sarbanes has proposed  the government by the people act  would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters  i think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential  in tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations  the trans pacific partnership has received a lot of criticism from republicans  independents  and democrats  including ms  teachout  for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments  the tpp is a continuation of nafta ad even worse than nafta   said ms  teachout   instead of changing direction and building towards a  century trade policy  the tpp doubles down on failed trade policy  negotiations over trans pacific partnership between the united states and  other countries began during the bush administration  and has been pushed by the obama administration  both democratic presidential candidates  hillary clinton  and bernie sanders have opposed the agreement  while republican presidential candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it  with donald trump and ted cruz against it  but governor kasich in favor  ms  teachout added  i m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it  i think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down   but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from republicans  democrats  and independents all across the board against it  people are saying this is the wrong direction  we actually want more made in america  we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process  one of the real problems of the tpp for me is it shuts you out of the process  and that is fundamental  instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems  its making policy in the backroom  and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country  new york s  congressional district includes sullivan  ulster  delaware  otsego  schoharie  greene and columbia counties and parts of montgomery  rensselaer and dutchess counties  current representative of the district  republican chris gibson announced he is retiring  leaving the seat wide open  ms  teachout is currently a favorite to win  she won almost every county in the district against governor cuomo in   in the democratic primaries  she faces challenges from john kehoe  a  year old self described moderate democrat who runs a recording studio in the hudson valley  and will yandik  a town councilman from columbia county  though popular consensus in the district s local democratic parties favor ms  teachout  according to the poughkeepsie journal the democratic primaries take place on june     on the republican side  it will be a toss up mainly between andrew heaney  a small businessman and graduate from harvard business school  and john faso  a former new york state assemblyman  mr  faso  who has hired bill o reilly as a communications consultant  has criticized heaney for donating to president obama s  campaign  mr  heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a super pac he created  the new york jobs council as progressivism has made its mark on the  presidential election from the popularity of senator bernie sanders  campaign  it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms  ms  teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate  as she did in  against governor andrew cuomo  spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people  not in a closed room listening to donors  there s an extraordinary strength in the deep american grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people  featured image via flickr
