it s not surprising that donald trump would pay his female staffers less than his male staffers  he s sexist  so that s to be expected  what is surprising  though  is just how bad it is  on average  in the u s   women are paid about    for every dollar men are paid  even for the same work  trump pays the women working on his campaign about    for every dollar his male staffers make now  some will make the argument that we don t necessarily know what his female staffers are doing versus what his male staffers are doing  there s a possibility  those people would say  that the men are getting paid more because they all hold higher  more difficult positions  or they work more hours  or they do better work in general  or all of the above that s still blatantly sexist for april  the women on trump s staff earned about     while the men earned about     that s a  percent difference  which is egregious  even for him  supposedly  he believes in equal pay  but says it s too complicated an issue for legislation  too much can go into whether men and women are really doing the same job or not  he says so  what  we re supposed to assume that he s paying all his staffers exactly in accordance with the jobs they do  and how well they do them  please whichever way we look at this  trump s campaign is set up in a traditionally sexist manner  which is at odds with his assertions that he ll be so good for women  and black people  and latinos  etc   once he s elected  that  in and of itself  is laughable considering how badly he treats women  and some of the misogynistic comments he s made about women  for him to make that claim while allowing a pay gap that s much worse than even the national gender pay gap is ridiculous compare all of that to how hillary clinton is treating her staff  and the differences are stark  of the  highest paid staffers on her campaign  eight were men and seven were women in april  men earned about     while women earned about     there s still a gap there  but it s extremely thin  when it comes to women s equality  hillary knows she has to set an example with how she runs her campaign trump loves talking big  that s his whole game   talk big  do what he wants even if it makes him a huge hypocrite  but since he thinks letting women work is a bad idea anyway  then maybe he s not such a hypocrite  just a disgusting  sexist prick featured image by spencer platt getty images
