as is typical for the nra whenever there s a high profile shooting  they waited days before issuing a real statement on orlando  they likely do this so they can craft a statement that makes themselves and all gun owners out to be the real victims  instead of calling the shooting what it was and using their considerable clout to work on doing something real about it in the case of the orlando massacre  they re saying obama s politically correct refusal to actually go after radical islamic terrorists is what caused this  chris cox  executive director of the nra s institute for legislative action  nra ila   wrote an op ed that was published in usa today about the whole tragedy  as expected  he toed the party line instead of saying something of substance  but the real gem was the second paragraph  the terrorist in orlando had been investigated multiple times by the fbi  he had a government approved security guard license with a contractor for the department of homeland security  yet his former co workers reported violent and racist comments  unfortunately  the obama administration s political correctness prevented anything from being done about it  funny thing is  he just debunked the nra s whole argument that this is obama s fault right there  by mentioning how omar mateen was on the fbi s radar for possible ties to terrorist groups  cox completely destroyed his own argument  mateen was able to get his guns legally despite having been the subject of two fbi investigations for ties to radical islamic groups because of the nra  not obama  and certainly not  political correctness  mateen had no criminal record and already had a concealed carry permit as a licensed security officer  it s not clear whether he was on any terror watch lists  but even if he had been  he may still have been legally able to buy guns  senate republicans might have been able to stop this  but instead  they killed a bill that would have prevented suspected terrorists from buying guns last year  on the grounds that it would only hurt innocent americans who happen to end up on that list for no reason they ll do anything to maintain their a  ratings with the nra  who cares who dies  the nra s blessings are the only things that matter here for its own part  the nra ila once wrote about a study saying criminals don t get their guns legally anyway  the implication there is that we can t stop criminals from getting guns  so everything we could do to prevent even some criminals from getting guns is pointless in fact  the nra s policies actually serve to arm criminals  potential terrorists and other violent people more easily  john fugelsang said it perfectly with this tweet guns don t kill ppl  but nra ppl who own congress ppl make it very easy for deranged ppl to get guns   kill innocent ppl   john fugelsang   johnfugelsang  june    we don t need a tweet to prove this  the coalition to stop gun violence has a list of all the ways the nra s work actually arms dangerous people for details on just how the nra accomplishes each of these items  click on the link above the laxness that allowed mateen to get his guns exists because of the nra s  more guns everywhere  crusade  the massacre at the pulse nightclub didn t happen because obama is too weak and politically correct to do something about radical islamic terrorism  it happened in large part because the nra created the very environment that allowed mateen to get his guns  to blame obama and his  political correctness  is a gross and disgusting insult to everyone who has died at the hands of someone with a gun  guns don t kill people  people kill people   is what the nra s entire agenda boils down to  but a gun makes it far  far easier for a murderer to murder  the nra is cold and callous  and cox s attempt to twist this into a problem of  political correctness  is absolutely vile featured image by justin sullivan getty images
