the gop is notoriously hostile to the lgbtq community  generally  we reject gay republicans  and the former leader of gay gop group goproud actually denounced his membership in the gop  and obviously with good reason  in the wake of the horrible attack on our community in orlando  many gop politicians continued to erase us from our own tragedy  prompting rightful and renewed outrage from the lgbtq community and our allies  i myself wrote a scathing indictment of the gopers offering thoughts and prayers while still legislating hate  however  there is one member of that party who  once a homophobe  is a million percent on our side now  and he deserves to be recognized for that  utah lieutenant governor spencer cox taking to the stage at a salt lake city vigil in honor of the  victims of the orlando shooting monday night  cox showed that his words were not empty  that they were heartfelt  first  he apologized for treating lgbtq people poorly in the past  from vox cox started off saying that he had  an admission and an apology  for the vigil attendees   i recognize fully that i am a balding  youngish  middle aged straight  white  male  republican politician   many in the crowd burst into laughter at this   with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels  i am probably not who you expected to hear from today  after that humble introduction  cox went on to say  i m here because yesterday morning   americans were brutally murdered    i m here because those  people were gay  i m here because it shouldn t matter  but i m here because it does  that is perhaps  to me as a gay american  the most moving part of the speech  period  it shows that he isn t erasing us  that he understands that no amount of rallying in the streets  pride parades  people coming out in support of marriage equality  or anything else changes the fact that this community has suffered terrible amounts of violence  indignity  disrespect  and despair  all for the simple  crime  of existing  cox went on to address the problem of straight splaining  and admits that while he stands with us  he cannot know what it is like to walk a mile in our shoes  i am not here to tell you that i know exactly what you are going through  i am not here to tell you that i feel your pain  i don t pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now  but i do know what it feels like to be scared  and i do know what it feels like to be sad  and i do know what it feels like to be rejected  and  more importantly  i know what it feels like to be loved  the speech went on to call the victims  beautiful  amazing people   and cox was tearful throughout  this speech is not the only thing cox has done to show his allegiance and support though  he was a vocal supporter of a utah law that forbade discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity there is so much more than what i have written here in this beautiful  moving   speech  i urge you to listen to every word  take it in  i hope it makes it to the computer screens of lt  gov  cox s fellow republicans  perhaps some of them will be able to have a similar change of heart watch this amazing speech below  featured image via kuer org spencer cox
