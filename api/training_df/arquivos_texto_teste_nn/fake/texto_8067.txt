stephen colbert left his comedy central  character behind to replace david letterman on the late show  and he has been absolutely phenomenal at it  therefore  it was inevitable  and only fitting  that he gave an amazing tribute to recently deceased supreme court justice antonin scalia however  unlike what would have likely been expected  colbert did not mock scalia  the man was universally despised by many decent human beings due his outrageous homophobia  misogyny  and other various bigotries  but  apparently  there was a good side to him that most of us never got to see  colbert  instead of using scalia s death as a point of comedy with which to insult his memory  chose to humanize the man most of us are glad to see go from both the supreme court and the planet colbert recalled his one meeting with scalia at a white house correspondents  dinner  in which scalia revealed that he had a dazzling sense of humor  the late show host also pointed out that scalia had an amazing friendship with his fellow  and notoriously liberal  supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg i ll never give scalia or any other awful right winger a pass on bigoted behavior  however  amidst all of the hatred we are rightfully slinging scalia s way  and at the glee we feel now that he can no longer sully the supreme court with his disgusting ideas  colbert s tribute was refreshingly touching watch the video below featured image from youtube screen capture
