republican lawmakers hate obamacare  but it s saving the lives of republican voters even though brent brown hated the affordable care act and refused to vote for president obama in  and   the lifetime gop voter from wisconsin wrote a letter to the democratic commander in chief apologizing for all the bad things he said and thanking obama for saving his life brown thanked president obama because the affordable care act allowed him to finally access the medication he needs to  stabilize my condition  prior to the passage of the landmark healthcare legislation  brown had been denied health insurance because of a pre existing condition  but because obamacare requires insurance companies to cover people with pre existing conditions  brown was able to get the care he needed so he wrote a heartfelt letter to president obama in june  which the white house posted online  thanking him for saving his life and  for being my president   brown also admitted that he was wrong about the healthcare law here s the full letter via the white house to my president i sincerely hope that this reaches you  as far too often praise is hard to come by  apologies to people who deserve it perhaps even less so i did not vote for you  either time  i have voted republican for the entirety of my life  i proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my republican loyalty  i was very vocal in my opposition to you particularly the aca before i briefly explain my story allow me to first say this  i am so very sorry  i understand written content cannot convey emotions very well but my level of conviction has me in tears as i write this  i was so very wrong  so very very wrong you saved my life  i want that to sink into your ears and mind  my president  you saved my life  and i am eternally grateful i have a  pre existing condition  and so could never purchase health insurance  only after the aca came into being could i be covered  put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this  i would not be alive without access to care i received due to your law  so thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets  thank you for serving me even when i didn t vote for you thank you for being my president honored to have lived under your leadership and guidance brent nathan brownin a follow up letter  brown updated president obama on how he is doing thanks to the affordable care act the affordable care act saved my life  i can now say  after several surgeries  that i m in recovery from what was a serious autoimmune disease i was finally able to receive the quality of care that had eluded me for years  i was able to consult the top surgeon in my state for the particular surgery i needed  i was able to receive the stabilizing drug that was always hidden behind a doctor s apology   i m sorry  mr  brown  we have to take your financial consideration into account   i was able to stay at one of the best equipped hospitals in my state for as long as i needed  without having to worry about checking myself out early because of cost concerns  i had hope if republican lawmakers have their way  people like brent brown would lose this hope  they would be stripped of the newly found healthcare that they have waited years to finally receive  this letter is not only a testament to how obamacare is helping millions of americans  it s a warning to republicans that they would be hurting their own voters by repealing the aca brent brown is a shining example of the affordable care act s success and necessity  and he had the courage to say he was wrong and thank president obama for fighting for him  it s too bad other republicans refuse to do the same featured image  flickr
