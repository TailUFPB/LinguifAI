the billionaire class is getting very scared of two things  the fight for  movement and bernie sanders the grassroots movement to elect bernie sanders and the movement to elect bernie sanders are very much fueled by the same thing  a drive to make the united states a nation  that once again  allows for all people to live a dignified life here is the ad of course  the billionaire class is not having any of that nonsense  that s why the future  super pac is running an ad that tries to take out two progressive birds at the same time  the intercept reports that future  is being run by brian o  walsh  he is a major player in the conservative dark money network  that works to bash left wing candidates and issues future  appears to be primarily funded by two hedge fund managers that are supporting the republican candidate  marco rubio while this may seem troubling to those who support raising the minimum wage  or those who support bernie sanders  or both  this could be taken as a good sign  as hillary clinton likes to point out  she has faced a major brunt of negative attack ads from republican superpacs  they fact that they are now attacking sanders means that they are taking him seriously i m not exactly sure who the ad for is for  though  the claims in the ad are the usual  raising the minimum wage will kill jobs  nonsense that comes from the right  they attack sanders  saying that he will raise taxes  they fail to mention who would be paying the vast majority of those taxes   billionaires like the ones who created the ad   is future  trying to sway voters to vote for clinton because she will be much softer on wall st  than sanders  or are they just trying to fill conservatives  heads with talking points for the general election either way   both the fight for  movement and robin hood tax movement  which inspired sanders  plan to put a micro tax on wall st  speculation  are two pragmatic progressive ideas whose time has come featured image from video screenshot via youtube
