one thing has been made abundantly clear  republican presidential front runner donald trump has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to foreign policy and diplomatic leadership  and whoever is in his ear and or writing his speeches clearly doesn t either after trump made his  foreign policy  speech on wednesday  not only did america react  but so did the rest of the world  with a number of foreign dignitaries speaking up and out against the real estate mogul s ineptitude germany s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said  i can only hope that the election campaign in the usa does not lack the perception of reality the world s security architecture has changed and it is no longer based on two pillars alone  it cannot be conducted unilaterally  no american president can get round this change in the international security architecture    america first  is actually no answer to that  former swedish prime minister carl bildt believes trump s speech is  abandoning both democratic allies and democratic values   also adding   trump had not a word against russian aggression in ukraine  but plenty against past u s  support for democracy in egypt  former south korean vice foreign minister kim sung han seems outright terrified viewing trump as  the first isolationist to be u s  presidential candidate  while in the post war era all the u s  presidents have been to varying degrees internationalists   adding  saying the u s  will no longer engage in anything that is a burden in terms of its relationships with allies  it would be almost like abandoning those alliances  it will inevitably give rise to anti american sentiment worldwide  then there s the u s  and americas programme at britain s chatham house think tank s xenia wickett  who said trump s rhetoric  it  suggests trump would make america s allies less secure rather than more  he talked about allies being confident but all of his rhetoric suggested that america should be unpredictable and that america s allies needed to stand up for themselves  this has been the sentiment internationally for quite some time now from every corner of the globe  a trump presidency would be bad news for everyone  not just in the united states  but worldwide  he simply has no idea what he s doing  if he were to become president  the damage made from his incompetence and inexperience in regards to foreign policy and international diplomacy could be so severe it could damage ties for decades to come  we cannot allow this to happen trump talks a good game to his imbecilic group of followers because  quite honestly  they don t know any better  and sounding big  tough and filled with nationalistic isolationist pride sounds good to them  mostly because most of them don t even know the world beyond their front porch america is strong when is stands together with its allies  isolating ourselves is not only dangerous  but stupid  saying our military is going to be the strongest ever in the world isn t only dangerous  but stupid  making false claims about our international allies isn t only dangerous  but stupid  and stupid is as stupid does and stupid votes trump we must make sure we do all we can to make sure donald j  trump doesn t get anywhere near the oval office   no matter who  vote blue  not only for yourself and the nation  but the world featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
