facebook ceo mark zuckerberg has had about enough of the blatantly racist antics happening right within the walls of the company s menlo park  california offices  in an internal memo obtained by gizmodo  zuckerberg is outright furious over some employees going to the famous  wall   where everyone is free to write what they want  and crossing out  black lives matter  to replace it with  all lives matter   zuckerberg seems absolutely disgusted by this continued disregard for others  and reprimanded those culpable here s what he wrote  there have been several recent instances of people crossing out  black lives matter  and writing  all lives matter  on the walls at mpk despite my clear communication at q a last week that this was unacceptable  and messages from several other leaders from across the company  this has happened again  i was already very disappointed by this disrespectful behavior before  but after my communication i now consider this malicious as well there are specific issues affecting the black community in the united states  coming from a history of oppression and racism   black lives matter  doesn t mean others lives don t   it s simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve we ve never had rules around what people can write on our walls   we expect everybody to treat each other with respect  regardless of the content or location  crossing out something means silencing speech  or that one person s speech is more important than another s  facebook should be a service and a community where everyone is treated with respect this has been a deeply hurtful and tiresome experience for the black community and really the entire facebook community  and we are now investigating current incidents i hope and encourage people to participate in the  town hall on   to educate themselves about what the black lives matter movement is about  via gizmodohopefully those over at facebook are able to find out who s been doing this malicious behavior and it stops immediately  zuckerberg is spot on in his memo  and this sort of behavior is not only unprofessional  but outright racist featured image  greeneggsandlam wikimedia
