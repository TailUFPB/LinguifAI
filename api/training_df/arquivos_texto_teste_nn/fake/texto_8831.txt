let s face it  obama s second term has been so wildly successful  the only thing republicans can do to prevent him from being the greatest president in modern history is to block everything  this even includes things that republicans keep screaming are necessary for the safety of the nation if you need evidence of this  just look at mitch mcconnell s recent statement regarding isis  and why he claims he won t allow obama s request for congressional approval for war come up for a vote well  the problem with what the president submitted for authorization to use military force restricted what he could do  i can t imagine that i would be voting for an authorization for the use of military force that barack obama would sign because the one he submitted for us to take a look at restricted his activities  what he could do based upon conditions on the ground look  i don t want to tie the hands of the next president  the next president may want to actually defeat isil  and i think an aumf  an authorization to use military force  that ties the president s hands behind his back is not something i would want to do to a new president who s going to have to clean up this mess  created by all of this passivity over the last eight years mcconnell s obama derangement syndrome is so bad that he is literally refusing to allow obama to go to war with  of all things  isis  it would be hilarious if it was another nation doing this mitch mcconnell is officially afraid that obama will be able to defeat isis before he leaves office  the obama coalition has already liberated about forty percent of previously held isis territory and has prevented any gains by them since may of   if mcconnell holds a vote for authorization for war against isis  every republican would have to vote yes to approve obama s actions  if they didn t  the knives would come out for every one of them in the next election cycle  if they vote yes  they would be seen as cooperating with the president  if obama made significant progress in the fight against the terror group  republicans couldn t run on isis in  and   if something bad happened  every republican would get challenged for supporting a  failed democratic president  the only way republicans can stay safe is by doing absolutely nothing to fight what they would otherwise call the greatest threat to america  that is just plain cowardly featured image via barefoot and progressive  altered
