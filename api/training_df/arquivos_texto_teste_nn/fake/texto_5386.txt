we all knew the  republican national convention would be a hillary hate fest  for the past three days  republicans have given the voters not one reason to vote for them  but many reasons why they shouldn t vote for hillary clinton no substance  only an us against them mentality  this shouldn t come as a shock to anyone but what has come as a shock is that the rnc has crowned itself as the de facto judge and jury of america  not only was it a hillary hate fest  it was a hyper partisan witch hunt that transcends anything we ve seen in presidential politics while their presidential candidate  donald j  trump  paints himself  humorously  as the  law and order  candidate  speaker after speaker  from general michael flynn  to patricia smith  to chris christie  have decided to take the law into their own hand  and convict hillary clinton of egregious crimes  they are  in their minds  the judge and jury that will convict hillary clinton  courts be damned no matter how many times they scream  guilty    lock her up   or  hillary for prison   they know  as much as anyone else  that clinton is innocent  since the   when ken starr and his band of ideological thugs  including newt gingrich   republicans have never been able to successfully pin anything on hillary clinton  not rose law firm  not whitewater  not benghazi  and not her emails  yet they have convinced themselves that they know better than the law  and they know better than the judges  juries  prosecutors and special counsels that have spent countless hours   no  years   trying to find something  anything  to convict hillary clinton of republicans know what they re doing  it s pure political theater  it s tidbit soundbits that stick in voters  minds and fester until election day  polluting the electorate s ability to look at the facts in an objective  impartial manner  they know they can t really convict her  but if they can convince the people that they re right and the law is wrong  that s good enough for them but in the eyes of the republicans  whose only goal is to win and not govern  the court of public opinion is mightier than the courts that uphold the rule of law there is no law and order with republicans  that s just a talking point they use when they want to stop black people from having their voices heard or when they don t like the supreme court granting marriage rights to same sex couples these instances  coupled with their sophomoric chants at their coveted convention  shows one thing  republicans do not respect the law  they do not respect the institutions thatal franken is right   lock her up  has become a banana republic for the gop  they have no substance to run on  hillary clinton is their main topic  and their world s revolve around her  it s actually quite pathetic not just on the surface but also deep down  they know they can t win with their ideas  so they must rely on smearing others the democratic convention can t come fast enough featured image via jeff j  mitchell getty images
