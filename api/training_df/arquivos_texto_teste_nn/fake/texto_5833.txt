as republicans stand firm about doing nothing to curtail gun violence   even if that means letting terrorist suspects on watchlists purchase firearms   they are sending a strong massage to the public at their  convention in cleveland  while your sons and daughters are being killed everyday  we will be safe and sound the republican national committee will be banning firearms  and anything resembling such  from the grounds of their convention  so while they go on and on about how dangerous  unconstitutional  stupid and lawless gun free zones are  they are instituting just that here s a full list of what the rnc will be banning  not only are guns banned  but so are  whistles  noisemakers  strollers  sorry moms with children   umbrellas  flashlights  backpacks  binoculars  alcohol  drones  wi fi signal grabbers  mace  tasers and so forth so while republicans  at the behest of the nra  stall the conversation about curtailing the dangers of guns in society  they will be conducting business with armed guards while no one  not even the most ardent gun rights supporters  will be allowed to bring their precious weapons if there is ever any evidence that the republican party is full of rank hypocrites  this certainly takes the cake  conservatives love to chide liberal politicians who have armed security but can t see what s going on right in front of their faces  republicans don t care about their lives  only their own  if that wasn t the case  republicans would be supporting every gun measure by the democrats while keeping their convention gun free so it shows that the nra  which has dolled out tens of millions of dollars to the republicans  really calls the shots  their donations stall progress for all americans  republicans continue to protect themselves in their cozy arena  no doubt the issue of gun control will be uttered by their speakers  and the crowds will cheer and boo  but while those cheers and boos echo on primetime  they can rest assured they will be safe  but the  people who die everyday of gun violence  not so much thanks for showing us your true colors  republicans featured image via scott olson getty images
