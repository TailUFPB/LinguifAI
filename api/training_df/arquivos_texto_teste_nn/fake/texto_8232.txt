in what is considered a massive set back not just to obama s environmental policy  but to the very planet we live on  the supreme court just killed the best chance america had to combat climate change in the foreseeable future  and if you think this wasn t politically motivated   the five justices responsible all come from the right side of the bench in a   ruling  the supreme court ruled to stay the requirements that energy companies needed to rein in the ludicrous amount of carbon that they were pouring into the atmosphere  for decades  scientists have warned that this carbon is among the number one contributors to global warming  obama had hoped to address this with a landmark move to curtail these emissions with an initiative he named the  clean power plan  with strong but achievable standards for power plants  and customized goals for states to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate change  the clean power plan provides national consistency  accountability and a level playing field while reflecting each state s energy mix  it also shows the world that the united states is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change or not instead  america s right wing showed the world once again that it is not remotely serious about trying to combat climate change  naturally  this lack of initiative gives other major polluters like china a fantastic excuse to not curtail their own emissions  we will  when you do  they might say for now  the oil and gas companies get to ignore the rule  this is a major victory for the corporations that are most responsible for polluting in the first place  the koch brothers  of course  were vehemently opposed to the new plans  so too were the republican politicians they sponsor  how desperate were republicans to let their pollution heavy friends off the hook  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell broke with all existing protocol to deliver a letter to all  united states governors telling them to simply ignore obama s epa requirements altogether the four liberal justices   ruth bader ginsburg  stephen breyer  sonia sotomayor  and elena kagan   all wrote that they objected to the stay but if all of this shady monkey wrench tossing is giving you a sense of hopeless  the silver lining is this  all that is standing in the way of bold new plans like this becoming law are five aging conservative members of the supreme court  it s expected that the next president will get to appoint at least two new justices  the ability to change the course of not just america s  but the world s climate rests with who americans chose as their next president this year  that s a lot of power  let s use it to elect a person who has our interests in mind  not the koch brothers feature image from youtube
