you know things are getting bad on the campaign trail when you have to appeal to the child in everyone by offering french fries for everyone  well  that s exactly what happened at a rally in iowa over the weekend while presidential hopeful ted cruz was apparently trying to appeal to the future voters of america  this is the stuff you have to do when you don t really have any accomplishments to speak of besides shutting down the government and pissing people off in a lame attempt at throwing first lady michelle obama under the bus  ted cruz decided healthy food is for suckers  we need to bring back all the stuff that makes our kids fat and lazy  so cruz says  let me say something to the school aged kids here  when heidi s first lady  french fries are coming back to the cafeteria the last i checked the cardboard was supposed to be on the tray and not in the food  yeah  when ted cruz is president  it ll be french fries and sugary soda for everyone   yeah   then recess all day  and no more homework cruz honestly sounded like he was running for student body president of the  grade  which probably isn t completely dumb  considering that the average republican voter hasn t gotten past that reading and maturity level so  everyone   a vote for cruz is a vote for french fries  yeah video featured image from vine
