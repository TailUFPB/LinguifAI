it was appalling but not exactly surprising to see the way republicans responded to the sudden death of supreme court justice antonin scalia  the party that has increasingly defined itself solely on its opposition to president obama once again immediately declared that they would not allow him to fulfill his constitutional obligations of appointing a new justice obama  no doubt tired of this obstructionism after seven long years of it  basically told them to shove it  he would be nominating a justice whether they liked it or not however  in the coverage of this potentially era defining new appointment  cnn managed to stick its foot so far into its mouth that it s a wonder they didn t just cut to commercial and never come back dana bash was discussing the republican opposition to a new nominee appointed by president obama and in her rush to be  fair  to  both sides   she wound up feeding right into the right wing talking points that serious journalists might scoff at  when asked about president obama s decision to go ahead with a nomination  bash remarked that s right  and as we were talking about last hour  that is not surprising in the least  since he clearly feels that it is his constitutional duty to do so  that he is the president of the united states  it is his job to nominate somebody he  clearly feels  it s his constitutional duty  what  it is his constitutional duty to appoint new justices  that s put in simple terms in constitution itself  saying this is obama s opinion is disingenuous  but bash was only just warming up he still will be technically the president of the united states for the next  months  which is a very  very long time  yes  we are in an election year  but we are barely into this election year of   so you have republicans coming back  not just mitch mcconnell who you just mentioned  but the republican chairman of the senate judiciary committee saying that he believes that it is standard practice to not deal with such issues in an election year  technically  he will be president of the united states  technically  you might want to tell that to the people who voted for him for a full four year term needless to say  the internet was not pleased  cnn may have wanted to avoid offending conservatives  but they managed to offend nearly everyone else  he still will be technically the pres  of the us for another  months     cnn  technically   john aravosis   aravosis  february    ll accept this definition if cnn s talking heads state that they re  technically  reporters  https   t co   ferrett steinmetz   ferretthimself  february    cnn actually say technically president  did they really  https   t co   anthony     february     cnn he s not technically the president  he s actually the president  stop parroting right wing stupidity   ben cisco   bencisco  february    issue wasn t just a slip of the tongue  it was that cnn was pretending that the republican beef with obama s nomination had to do with anything other than political point scoring  for many years  the policy of mainstream media outlets has been to tread lightly on partisan issues to avoid alienating viewers  this might help keep ratings up  but it s not a way to accurately report the news  there are times when things are just wrong in the case of republicans now saying obama can t appoint a justice because it is an election year  history and the law say otherwise  it s time for reporters to own that by contrast  debate moderator john dickerson stood up to sen  ted cruz when he tried to flat out lie about supreme court appointments  asked to back up his claims with facts  cruz was left speechless  the republican audience booed dickerson  but the american people were informed  it was a highlight of the election feature image via youtube
