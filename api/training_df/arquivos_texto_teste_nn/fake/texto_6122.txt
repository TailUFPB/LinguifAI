former gop presidential candidate marco rubio made several startling comments in a truly humiliating interview on sunday  in which he actually defended his least favorite republican rival  donald trump but it wasn t just rubio s support that was baffling  considering that their vicious battle to win the nomination was full of insults  it was actually what rubio said about trump s racist  grotesque anti immigration statements that raised eyebrows  instead of criticizing those vulgar comments  rubio defended trump during the interview  cnn s jake tapper brought up the fact that trump had been gaining the support of  some scary dudes  from  hate groups   rubio insisted that trump was not a white nationalist  and remarked that the support from racists has been unfortunate  it s offensive  and not just against me  but the fact that elements like that are still involved in american politics  and traditionally a candidate would disavow that and say   i want nothing to do with it  i don t want them as part of my campaign  tapper was quick to note that trump didn t distance himself from his controversial following at all  rubio replied  and i didn t like that  and i said that at the time  and you know  it is what it is  obviously  i don t believe donald trump is a white nationalist  i don t believe that those are his views  but i do think that it s unfortunate that people like that have found the ability to express themselves in this way in a campaign  and i didn t like it  i just don t really think that there s a place for that in our party and our country  rubio then tackled the fact that trump had made his own racially charged statements  like the time he called mexicans  rapists   rubio said it was an  offensive comment  and  highly inaccurate   but ultimately gave trump  credit  for being able to expertly manipulate the media through offending people  here s the trap you re in  if you respond to it   is getting what he wants  that s why he s sometime saying this  to dominate the  cycle  i don t give him credit for what he said  but i give him credit for the way that he understands this stuff media is a business and it s driven by ratings  and based on your ratings is what you can charge your advertisers  and so  this content is interesting content  it s different  and it s over the top  and it draws eyeballs and ears to hear what people are saying and see it  donald understood that  absolutely disgusting  being a racist should never be used as a ploy to attract media attention  and supporting this childish tactic is even worse  shame on you  rubio  for not only selling out but for encouraging such behavior you can watch rubio come to trump s rescue below during the same interview  rubio also apologized for his attacks on trump while they were facing off for the nomination  particularly the insults that trump was most sensitive about   his tiny hands this defense of trump from rubio is so pathetic and disappointing  especially because for a while the florida senator seemed like he was the only gop candidate that had enough spine to actually go after trump and give the business mogul a taste of his own medicine  now rubio is no better than ben carson and chris christie  who were both former candidates that took the humiliating leap to endorse trump featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
