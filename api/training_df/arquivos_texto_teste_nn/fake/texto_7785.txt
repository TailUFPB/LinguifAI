katrina pierson is a black woman  she is also a top spokesperson for unabashed racist donald trump  she apparently buys into trump s horrible ideas and rhetoric  though  as she defends him at every turn  hell  she might be just as crazy as he is  as she even went so far as to appear on national television wearing a necklace made out of bullets in order to tout trump s staunch support for the second amendment however  it is about time someone took this black woman to task for her blind support of a clear racist  and  finally  cnn pundit and gop strategist tara setmeyer did so  the pundit absolutely blasted pierson  and said that she is simply  one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television  when setmeyer pointed out how trump is under fire for refusing to firmly toss aside an endorsement from former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke  pierson dodged the question  saying  mr  trump said  look  i don t even know what you re talking about  so  i think this has really been blown out of proportion  and it really does highlight more media bias when no one has asked barack obama to disavow sen  robert byrd  who was not just a klans  member  but a leader in the klan when he endorsed him in   the thing is  though  pierson  like so many ignorant trump supporters  failed to notice the fact that byrd had a big change of heart a hell of a long time ago  according to a book he wrote  so  completely different kettle of tripe entirely  as duke is still very much an avowed racist setmeyer pushed pierson  and plowed on  he brags about how he can manipulate folks  we sit and we watched this play out over the weekend  where donald trump took five different positions because he got pressured into having to actually admit to what was going on  david duke absolutely came out and said it s against your heritage if you don t vote for donald trump  okay  that s an endorsement  give me a break  and then to say  i couldn t hear what was going on  they gave me a  earpiece  anyone who watched the interview with jake tapper  donald trump clearly heard everything that jake tapper said  he responded to it  he didn t say   oh  i can t hear you  this isn t a good earpiece  clearly getting angry  pierson yelled at the hosts  the democrats have called the tea party racists  should we have him disavow the tea party too  absolutely not  but setmeyer  in the end got the best of pierson  and called her out for what she is  we aren t even talking about donald trump s questionable history with race back to when the doj sued the trump organization for racial discrimination  or when donald trump came out and said how much he loves   quote    the blacks  or we can go down the list of very questionable things donald trump has said  but i don t know  maybe katrina pierson is one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television  and that s just it  trump is fine with black folks  just since they bow  turn their backs on their own race  and go  yassa massa   when he comes running  they help assure the ignorant and blind people that he is somehow  not racist  no matter what he says of course  in the end  pierson lamely went back to what trump and all of his supporters say  he s winning  that s all that matters  he s winning  the sad thing is  though  is that katrina pierson  and so many other trump supporters  seem to actually believe that watch the video below via raw story featured image via video screen capture
