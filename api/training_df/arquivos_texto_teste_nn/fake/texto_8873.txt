ted cruz again showed that his campaign is weirder than previous conservative republican efforts by publicly fantasizing about spanking former secretary of state hillary clinton cruz revealed his spanking fantasy while rehashing the favored conservative conspiracy theory about clinton doing something nefarious with her emails  in this iteration  cruz echoed earlier conservative claims that clinton was involved in a wide ranging cover up of the benghazi terrorist attack in libya in response  cruz said  clinton deserved  spanking  for supposedly covering up what happened on the fateful night of the attack a woman in the audience had asked   for three and a half years people in washington have been skirting around benghazi and no one has been held accountable  i want to know what you would do  someone needs to pay  ma am you are exactly right  what happened in benghazi is a national disgrace  four americans were murdered  we lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the carter administration   cruz said   the immediate response of barack obama and hillary clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception  obstruction and cover up  they began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video  but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again  keep us safe  cruz  added   we do know hillary told her daughter chelsea  well gosh  i knew it was a terrorist attack  while we were out telling the american people it wasn t  you know i ll tell you  in my house  if my daughter catherine  the five year old  says something she knows to be false  she gets a spanking  in addition to lying about the obama administration response to the attack   president obama referred to it as an  act of terror  almost immediately after the event   cruz s conspiracy echoes other sexist belittling of clinton that has become mainstream on the right she has often been compared to lady macbeth and other infamous women who have orchestrated events as conservatives have often been flummoxed in their quest to attack her and tie her in to one conspiracy or another cruz is doing well in iowa  and could consolidate enough of the fundamentalist right wing  christian  vote their to achieve a victory  but his har right persona is almost guaranteed to face electoral failure everywhere outside the solid red enclaves of the south  indulging in a public fantasy about spanking clinton will not help that cause featured image via flickr
