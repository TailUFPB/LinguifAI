donald trump doesn t have much foreign policy experience  but he loves his golf courses  especially the ones overseas  he s no longer associated with miss universe  but surely that prepared him for foreign policy and running a country  just as his golf courses in scotland did  president obama s labor secretary  tom perez  took trump to the cleaners over this during an interview on meet the press  because perez knows that trump doesn t know foreign policy at all host chuck todd asked perez how he would describe his own foreign policy  and perez replied with a smirk and razor sharp sarcasm  well  i haven t run a ms  universe pageant  and i don t own any golf courses in scotland  chuck  so i don t have what donald trump has  and i m very sorry about that  that hits king dunce right where it hurts  because king dunce doesn t know how to take advice  let alone actually learn anything  remember  king dunce the man who gave us this little nugget of disease ridden feces  i m speaking with myself  number one  because i have a very good brain and i ve said a lot of things i know what i m doing and i listen to a lot of people  i talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time i ll tell you who the people are  but my primary consultant is myself and i have a good instinct for this stuff  he has a touch of instinct for business  and that s it  he thinks government  and particularly foreign affairs  are just like business and he can treat them with strong arm tactics and threats of lawsuits   oh wait  war  if they don t give in king trump s foreign policy sounds great to ignorant voters who can t think for themselves  it s all about  america first   it s a lot of the same mentality that led to brexit  and it s true that world s uppermost caste has left working class people in the dust in the pursuit of their own black and vile greed  however  trump wants to bully and muscle other countries into doing what he wants  he doesn t want actual negotiations it wouldn t be surprising to discover that his royal narcissist thinks that his  me first  mentality is the same as having an  america first  mentality  his confidence in his own greatness is part of why he talks about all his businesses  including his golf courses  as though they ve given him all the experience he needs to run one of the most powerful countries in the world as perez explained  trump the dump is all about himself and his own profits and glory rather than america first  because otherwise  he wouldn t fight labor unions and he wouldn t have his clothing and campaign gear made in the very foreign countries he demonizes regularly on the campaign trail perez nailed him to the wall on this featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
