most republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in oregon   but not tennessee state rep  andy holt despite that this group of yee hawdists made tear filled  goodbye  videos in case they died in a shootout with the army   occupied the malheur national wildlife refuge  or  as abc said with plenty of sugarcoating  engaged in an  action  after a peaceful protest   and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause  all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation  protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land    the very definition of terrorism   we don t even see   of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality holt tweeted   and deleted   what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to vanilla isis holt compared the armed militia  which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to  kill or be killed  with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in ferguson or baltimore  while holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which african americans are standing up for their rights  he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation state by force the tenth amendment  of course  does not authorize a mob of right wing terrorists to occupy anything  by force or not   nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government  however  as one democrat  chattanooga city councilman chris anderson   pointed out  holt s offer to help the bundy terrorists may constitute treason while holt may think he understands the  amendment  he doesn t quite grasp article iii of the constitution  which states treason against the united states  shall consist only in levying war against them  or in adhering to their enemies  giving them aid and comfort  no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act  or on confession in open court the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason  but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood  or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted in fact  u s c s  covers insurrection quite nicely  as well whoever incites  sets on foot  assists  or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof  or gives aid or comfort thereto  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years  or both  and shall be incapable of holding any office under the united states anderson has asked the justice department to investigate  holt  of course  dismissed anderson s concerns with the tried and true  yeah  well you re gay  response he says that he deleted his treasonous offer  so liberal loons will quit responding  but whines that  more liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate   get off twitter   read the constitution  kids   he said  ironically perhaps anderson is right that holt   who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government   should be investigated for treason featured image via screengrab youtube
