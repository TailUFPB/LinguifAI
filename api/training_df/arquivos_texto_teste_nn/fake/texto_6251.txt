while much of the focus of the election year so far has been on bernie sanders  hillary clinton and donald trump  understandably  there has been a major change with regards to one of the key political figures in america and it has the potential to be a huge factor on the election since january of this year  president obama s approval rating has seen a double digit increase  he is   higher now than he was then but over the course of the year  obama s approval numbers changed   quickly  and a lot  in gallup s most recent weekly average  obama is at     the exact opposite of where he was on jan   and a  point swing since then  he s been at  percent or higher in every week since march   save one looking at quarterly averages of obama s approval  you can see how stark the improvement has been by party  democrats have slowly looked at obama more favorably since the beginning of   but independents have begun to look at obama much more favorably  after a sharp slide following his reelection  independents turned their opinions of obama around at the beginning of   over the past year  that s escalated  and since ratings from democrats and republicans are more stable  that shift by independents moves the needle a lot multiple factors probably account for the dramatic change  but the improving economy and the contrast between donald trump s buffoonish style and obama s leadership have to be considered  trump is definitely having an effect among latino voters  where obama is up even higher than the average   almost     trump calling for a wall on the u s    mexico border and describing mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists is not a good look for the republican party obama has already said he will be out on the campaign trail for the democratic nominee   most likely hillary clinton   and it has been decades since a sitting president used his office to campaign for his chosen successor  gore pushed clinton away in   and reagan was too ill to campaign for bush in   while george w  bush was enormously unpopular in  and mccain wanted nothing to do with him  a popular president who appeals to both independents and the party base is a huge asset going into an election against an opponent who is both historically unpopular and who has built his campaign based on offending key members of the democratic coalition  women  latinos  obama  and biden  won t be a drag on the democratic ticket  they could be the key to a huge victory featured image via flickr
