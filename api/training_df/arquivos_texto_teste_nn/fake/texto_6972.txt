ohio governor john kasich has had a pretty difficult time getting his message out during the republican race for the white house  many of us assumed it was because he is being overshadowed by trump and cruz  but apparently this is a problem that he is facing in his own state as well   and it is quite embarrassing last week  the governor gave his annual state of the state address and laid out his plans for the state  instead of republican lawmakers rallying behind their leader like you would expect them to   especially since he is running for president   they brushed him off just like voters have nationwide  according to the columbus dispatch  after he called on legislators during his state of the state address last week to revamp the way ohio s congressional districts are drawn  his fellow republicans who lead the general assembly panned the proposal senate president keith faber   who represented the kasich campaign this weekend in michigan as gop convention delegates were picked   said the legislature has higher priorities   even on modest kasich proposals  such as altering state income tax withholding tables that would get money to ohioans faster but not provide an overall tax cut  the republican leaders  biggest commitment was that they would consider his ideas ouch  that s rough  the republican legislature apparently has no interest in listening to their leader  kasich has spent his entire campaign telling the american people what an effective governor he has been  but if that were true wouldn t ohio lawmakers be a little bit more enthusiastic about his proposals  instead  they are like  nah bro  we got this  go away  not only are lawmakers in ohio wondering what the hell he was doing there  but donald trump and ted cruz are treating him the same way in the race for the white house  both of his fellow candidates have been very vocal in the last week or so about their desire to see him drop out of the race  but kasich said that isn t going to happen  instead  the governor is continuing to sell himself as the  adult  who will be able to get the job done in the white house i m not entirely sure how he expects to get anything done if he is president when he can t even get the republicans in his own state to work with him  if his own party in his own state treats him like an annoying gnat  imagine how ineffective he d be in the oval office  this is just further proof that all of the gop candidates would be horrible for the country and we need to vote blue in november  featured image via andrew renneisen getty images
