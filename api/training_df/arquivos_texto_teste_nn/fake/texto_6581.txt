donald trump hasn t even secured the nomination of his party yet and already his anti hillary clinton misogyny is on full blast while all but ignoring his own republican opponents  trump used an indiana rally on the eve of the primary to once again criticize clinton for talking too loudly  the painful irony  while describing how off putting her  screaming  is  trump was yelling his voice hoarse it s almost as if there is a double standard here just donald trump screaming his criticism of hillary clinton screaming pic twitter com   andrew lawrence   ndrewlawrence  may    and i would say that she started screaming at the teleprompter   trump yelled   but i m not allowed to say that   breathing heavily into the microphone  he added   you know why  now if she was a man i could say it  but as a woman  ladies  i m sorry  i m not allowed to say it  which  of course   as a man   nobody will bother criticizing trump for yelling at this rally or any other  nor has hillary clinton s gender stopped trump  or other conservative pundits  from feigning concern about how loudly she talks  not only do they feel they are  allowed to say it    they say it all the time  endlessly  in fact  at high volume the general election hasn t even begun and already the battle lines are being drawn  donald trump is already signalling that his campaign is going to be one primarily based on sexist attacks  he has avoided going after her experience  her ability  and her accomplishments  none of which trump can say he has a strong counterargument against   and instead has repeatedly hit her for playing the  woman card  if hillary clinton were a man  i don t think she d get  percent of the vote  the only thing she s got going is the woman s card  is it working  it doesn t appear to be  for trump s largely male crowd  it might elicit fist bumps  but the rest of the country is horrified  trump s original  woman card  comments drove a record setting    million in donations to clinton s campaign  meanwhile  trump s popularity with female voters   not good in the first place   has been steadily tanking further what trump s sexist comments do accomplish  however  is to remind america of just how adrift the republican party is from our modern society   is awfully late to be arguing women shouldn t be allowed to speak passionately in public  perhaps the party needs an update featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
