ted cruz is not handling sarah palin endorsing donald trump very well at all  although  he s trying  he probably thought he had her support in the bag  but she took her endorsement elsewhere  after all  the reality television star loves screen time  and donald trump has definitely been getting the most out of anyone running from either party tuesday morning when the palin s endorsement seemed imminent  cruz s communication director rick tyler made a comment on cnn that may have really shown how cruz was feeling at the moment  tyler said of palin endorsing trump  i think it  be a blow to sarah palin  because sarah palin has been a champion for the conservative cause  and if she was going to endorse donald trump  sadly  she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life   bristol palin didn t take kindly to that at all i like  tedcruz  but maybe this why people don t  https   t co   realdonaldtrump  sarahpalinusa  bristol palin   bristolsblog  january    wrote  after hearing what cruz is now saying about my mom  in a negative knee jerk reaction  makes me hope my mom does endorse trump  cruz s flip flop  turning against my mom who s done nothing but support and help him when others sure didn t  shows he s a typical politician   how rude to that he s setting up a false narrative about her america doesn t need that   we need someone who has a vision for economic prosperity  who won t let us get kicked around in the world  and who will fight for our future i didn t go to harvard law school  but i know this   you can like two people in a race  but there will only one president the audacity to suggest that because she chooses one over the other will somehow  damage  her just shows arrogance  however  once the sad wore off a little bit and the shock of the break up wasn t so raw  cruz took to twitter to let palin know that even though their romance is no longer  he ll still think of her fondly from better days cruz tweeted out sans heart emoji  i love sarah palin  without her support  i wouldn t be in the senate  regardless of what she does in   i will always be a big fan  i love  sarahpalinusa without her support  i wouldn t be in the senate  regardless of what she does in   i will always be a big fan   ted cruz   tedcruz  january    s got to be tough to see someone who you thought you could rely on run to another  maybe cruz s crazy wasn t enough for her  maybe she needed the added splash of extra racism  racism that trump is all to eager to dish out at every rally  who knows  really  all we can hope for is that palin brings the same luck she brought for john mccain featured image  gage skidmore  flickr flickr
