christian fundamentalists picked on the wrong restaurant to leave their fake   tips for quite some time now  christian fundamentalists have been angering waiters and waitresses by leaving religious messages disguised as   bills as the tip the notes say that they can have something more valuable than money  which they claim is a belief in jesus but to the servers who receive such a tip  it s nothing more than a dirty trick that angers them  they worked hard attending to their customers in an effort to receive a well earned tip that will help them pay the bills and put food on the table  a plain piece of paper masquerading as a   bill doesn t help at all  if anything  it makes religious people look like a bunch of jerks well  one restaurant manager chose to fight back after a similar trick was cruelly played on one of her employees according to wcnc in north carolina penny craver  general manager of dish in plaza midwood  says one of her employees  who s also a student  was really upset on saturday after receiving a religious pamphlet from her guests and a less than  percent tip instead of just being angry  craver actually did something about it  she looked up the church named on the fake    harbor baptist church in charlotte  and fired off an email to the pastor condemning the action and suggesting a sunday sermon about fair monetary exchange here s the email in its entirety via wcnc pastor simmons i am the general manager of dish  restaurant  in plaza midwood  imagine one of my server s surprise when she received a small pamphlet  every one of us will face eternity one day  instead of a tip when she served what i assume was one of your congregation  her particular religious beliefs are not discussed at work  however  i do know that this pamphlet can not pay her mortgage or her electric bill  it concerns me that someone would consider a pamphlet fair monetary exchange  suppose your congregation felt it was sufficient to tithe their personal writings instead of   of their income  your church wouldn t be paying their bills for very long  i think it would be great if you used this in a sermon  pride  one of the  deadly sins  is considered  on almost every list  the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins  the source of the others  it is identified as believing that one is essentially better than others  failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others  and excessive admiration of the personal self  especially holding self out of proper position toward god   i think it could be educational for at least one member of your congregation  thank you very much for your time and it seems to have worked  pastor simmons has allegedly spoken to the congregant who left the crappy tip and says it won t happen again  and if it does  the church will make it right  craver certainly hopes the church keeps their word  especially since this has happened several times in the last few months featured image  twitter
