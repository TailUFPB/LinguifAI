msnbc host rachel maddow found the perfect way to simultaneously report and mock the conservative movement s collective freak out that they saddled themselves with donald trump as a presidential nominee  she looks their actual words  turned them into spoken word poetry and performed them live on air maddox introduced the segment by claiming she was taking a moment to honor the concerns  of republicans across the country who  after several years of swinging to the right  landed there with trump  the sarah palins  rick perrys and chris christies of the party might well be happy to pump trump  but far greater numbers have simply refused it speaks volumes about how far the gop has fallen  that george w  bush  considered at home and abroad one of the worst and extremist presidents in us history   is now looking like the moderate wing of the party  both george w  bush and his father and former president george bush sr have announced their refusal to back trump in his campaign to be the next president of the united states not only does dubya appear moderate next to trump  he appears articulate too  explaining his reasons for rejecting the trump campaign  he said  i understand that americans are angry and frustrated  but we do not need someone in the oval office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration  the former presidents have since been joined by paul ryan  mitt romney  and benn sasse   with other big names in the gop yet to make their position known it was all too much for maddow  who decided to turn this unholy mess into art   and make a seriously hilarious skit out of it all  she takes verbatim quotes from republicans freaking out about trump and performs them with all the sincerity of a performance poet  enjoy https   www youtube com watch v  image via screengrab
