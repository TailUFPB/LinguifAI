ivanka trump s stab at using her dad s name to sell cheap products made in chinese factories isn t going well  not only is it only highlighting the hypocrisy of donald trump claiming to bring back jobs from china  according to a new recall order  at least some of the clothing can literally kill you the consumer product safety commission  cpsc  is begging hapless consumers to return the nearly   ivanka trump brand scarves they have have purchased recently  they do not meet the u s  flammability standard and pose a serious  burn risk  if exposed to heat  in other words  the scarf around your neck could combust  making your head into a terrifying fireball  death by trump product the cpsc s spokesperson didn t mince words  this is a dangerous product  he urged customers to get rid of the scarves immediately  trump s business partners at global brands group said it was complying with the recall donald trump has run his campaign on frequent attacks on china and a promise to bring jobs back to america  he has several times expressed the desire to launch a trade war with the country  despite economists warning it could hurl the world back into a global recession  and possibly lead to something approaching armed conflict  experts don t know whether to laugh or cry  i think in order to qualify as a coherent set of policies  the policies have to not be cartoonish and the policies have to stand some chance of being actually enacted  and i just don t think mr  trump s trade policies meet either of those criteria   said michael strain  resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute but while spiraling the world into economic ruin  trump will no doubt continue to have personal business dealings with chinese factories  after all  he s made a lot of money by paying chinese workers next to nothing to manufacture cheapo clothing he can sell in american stores  his entire business model depends on it this recall is a reminder that trump s fans are getting what they pay for  a product made to look classy  but really a cheap imitator with little quality and could quite possibly kill you  you might even say there is a good metaphor in there somewhere featured image via joe raedle getty images
