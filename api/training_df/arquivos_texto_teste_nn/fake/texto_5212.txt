it s no secret that conservatives and republicans  not all  despise president obama simply because he is black  after years of insisting he s an  arab   from kenya  a muslim  or anything else you can name  it s telling that some americans hold him to a completely different standard simply because he s black now take hillary clinton  who is on the cusp of making history as the first female president of the united states  just as barack obama did as the first african american president  for years  clinton has been in the public eye as a governor s wife  a first lady  a senator  a secretary of state  and now a presidential candidate  but like their hate for president obama simply because he is black  there are those on the right who hate her simply because she is a woman  like the dog whistle politics that follow president obama  conservatives have unleashed their own dog whistle on clinton   and they are even louder whether it be the sound of her voice  her boisterous laugh  her  vagina politics  or making an honest woman  of herself  hillary clinton has been besmirched by the right based not on her policies  but by her gender don t believe it  the commentary speaks for itself  throughout her career  the attacks have become worse  but yet here she is  making history  yet again   not brought down by the good old boys  club this is why hillary clinton is the epitome of what it takes to be president  no matter what is thrown her way  she stands tall  and never relents  unlike another presidential candidate  clinton also doesn t take it personally  instead focusing on the real issues th sexist attacks will continue should clinton win the presidency  and it may hamper some of her legislative hopes in a congress that is still disproportionately republican male  but like president obama  clinton will make us proud  should she stick to her campaign promises  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
