after a shaky jobs report in april  may had a downright terrible showing  on which republicans have already pounced as evidence of supposedly  failed  democratic policy  they re busy going after both obama and hillary clinton for this dismal report as hard as they can  in fact  gop chairman reince priebus tweeted devastating jobs report showing weakest hiring in  yrs is sign we need to move away from failed obama policies clinton is promising to keep  reince priebus   reince  june    trump  never one to pass up an opportunity to pretend he knows everything  pounced  too  tweeting  terrible jobs report just reported  only   jobs added  bombshell   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    obama has been working hard to polish his image on the economy  and this report could very easily tarnish and dent it  that s especially true with the paradox of a falling unemployment rate paired with an abysmal jobs report  the falling unemployment rate is almost entirely due to more than   people dropping out of the labor force in may  that makes it a misleading statistic  and therefore  a black eye for obama  right wrong  there s evidence suggesting that someone else could be to blame for this  like donald trump and his supporters uneducated white people a k a the average trump voter had ten times the impact on the unemployment rate that they should have  given the size of their demographic compared to the overall population  it s true that employment in this demographic has been destroyed by globalization and automation  which is why they support trump  they like his protectionist mentality and his business credentials  if  indeed  they can be called that  while yes  exit polls during certain states  primaries showed that trump s voters may actually be better off economically than their democratic counterparts  some of that may be due to the fact that republican voters tend to be wealthier than democratic voters  they also tend to turn out for primaries far more than democratic voters other analyses have found that trump s main demographic is  in fact  the poor  white  uneducated  working class male  despite what exit polls from state primaries said  trump solidified his hold on the gop s nomination in may  and his job creation rhetoric resonates heavily with this group  could his promises of bringing jobs back be making people drop out of the labor force the jobs report showed serious declines in both construction and manufacturing  which are two of the main industries in which these people tend to work  trump keeps promising he ll bring their jobs back from overseas  and he ll spur all kinds of economic activity here  and these voters eat it up like candy dropping out of the labor force and voting republican implies that these voters think others should just pick themselves up by their bootstraps  finish high school  get a degree  learn a new trade  etc   but they themselves shouldn t have to  they can sit and wait until trump is elected  and then their jobs will come flowing back  they ll be working again  and all will be right with the world there s no way to know for sure whether this is true right now  but trump s outsized influence over these people could easily have convinced them to drop out of the labor force and just wait for him to get elected and solve their employment woes for them featured image by clyde robinson  licensed under cc by   via flickr
