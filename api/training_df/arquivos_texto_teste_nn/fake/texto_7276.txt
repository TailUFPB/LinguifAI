because idiots haven t harmed america enough yet an anti vaxxer propaganda film will be screened at the tribeca film festival in april  and you can blame robert deniro for the resulting drop in america s overall iq and the outbreak of preventable disease deniro is a legendary actor who is apparently willing to torpedo his reputation and career by allowing disgraced british medical doctor andrew wakefield to screen his so called  documentary  vaxxed  from cover up to catastrophe at the festival that had been an annual event since  wakefield published a paper in  claiming that there is a link between autism and the mmr vaccine  but as it turns out  wakefield s study was bogus and has been thoroughly debunked by scientists and medical professionals who then booted wakefield out of the medical field for professional misconduct celebrities such as jim carrey  jenny mccarthy  and kristin cavallari have jumped to wakefield s defense in recent years  which has caused thousands of the fans among others to hold back from vaccinating their children  and as the anti science movement continues to grow  the public health becomes more and more at risk just last year  a measles epidemic hit the united states for the first time since the disease had been largely eradicated from our shores in   causing the first death of an american by measles in  years even fox news  own medical expert roundly condemned the anti vaxxer movement  let me be clear on this  i see no debate whatsoever   nyu langone medical center associate professor of medicine marc siegel said  this is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines  you know we stamped out measles in the united states in   it was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man  if you had measles there would be a  percent chance that i would get it by sitting next to you if i weren t vaccinated  it s so much more contagious than the flu  we were talking about ebola  this is a million times more contagious than ebola  but robert deniro wants to have that debate anyway even though it will just give credibility to a moronic movement that deserves none whatsoever  and the backlash has been so great that deniro released a statement on facebook defending the screening  grace and i have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined  in the  years since the tribeca film festival was founded  i have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming  however this is very personal to me and my family and i want there to be a discussion  which is why we will be screening vaxxed  i am not personally endorsing the film  nor am i anti vaccination  i am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue  no  mr  deniro  all you are doing is giving an open platform to anti vaxxers to spread their misinformation and scare more parents into not getting their kids vaccinated  you are perpetuating their lies and anti science views and you should be ashamed of yourself for it  america is already witnessing the return of viruses such as whooping cough  measles  rubella  and many others because a growing number of parents ridiculously believe their kids will get autism if they get them vaccinated even though there is zero scientific evidence linking autism to vaccines wakefield s goal with this propaganda film is to assert that the government and scientific community are  covering up  the link and that vaccines have caused an autism  catastrophe  in this nation because of it  there is no true debate in this film and there won t be a real conversation after it is screened  it ll just be one big echo chamber designed to indoctrinate more believers into the anti vaxxer movement  which deniro looks to be apart of despite his claims otherwise  and when children die because of his stupidity  their blood will be on his hands featured image  wikimedia
