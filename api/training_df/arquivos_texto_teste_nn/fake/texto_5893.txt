here s what we know about the orlando shooter  the fbi was watching him very closely because of alleged terrorist sympathies  even though he was on the government s radar  he was able to purchase his weapons legally just days before he killed  people and wounded  others some americans are just now learning  for the first time  that individuals on watchlists  or who are being monitored by the fbi  can legally buy a gun  no problem  and they cannot be stopped  this is also known as the  terror gap   and like the charleston loophole  which allowed dylann roof his gun used to kill nine black churchgoers   it exposes fatal cracks in our system but just  days before the orlando shooting  president obama warned the people that this fatal crack was detrimental to our national security  and no one paid attention when asked by a gun owner at a pbs news hour discussion why he wants to  control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers  gun owners and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us  the good guys   and not the bad guys  president obama responded with what i have said is precisely what you suggested  which is  why don t we treat this like every other thing that we use  i just came from a meeting today in the situation room in which i got people who we know have been on isil web sites  living here in the united states  u s  citizens  and we re allowed to put them on the no fly list when it comes to airlines  but because of the national rifle association  i cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun this is somebody who is a known isil sympathizer  and if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much   as many weapons and ammo as he can  nothing s prohibiting him from doing that  even though the fbi knows who that person is and  days later  an isil sympathizer walked into a nightclub with his legally bought guns and unleashed the worst shooting in american history in december  a simple bill in the senate was shot down by republican lawmakers  it s purpose  anyone who appears on watchlists or is being flagged by the government as a terrorist sympathizer may not purchase gun  every republican  and one democrat  voted no  republicans are so beholden to the nra that they couldn t even ban potential terrorists from having access to weapons so the next time republicans want to blame president obama  remind them that  he tried to warn us  and that our republican senate has blood on their hands featured image via alex wong getty images
