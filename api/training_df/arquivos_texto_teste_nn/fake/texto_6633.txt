if trump thought he could attack hillary clinton for being a woman without being smacked down by elizabeth warren for it  he was wrong earlier this week  the republican frontrunner capped off his sweeping victory in several states on tuesday by accusing the democratic frontrunner of  playing the woman card  and that her gender is the only thing she s got going for he in this election  if hillary clinton were a man  i don t think she d get five percent of the vote   trump declared   the only thing she s got going is the women s card  and the beautiful thing is  women don t like her  okay  and look how well i did with women tonight  here s a video of his remarks via youtube despite his claim  a recent gallop poll shows that  percent of women hold an unfavorable view of trump compared to  percent who somehow hold a favorable view count senator elizabeth warren as part of the  percent during an interview with the boston globe on thursday  the popular senator from massachusetts hammered trump for doing  what weak men do  donald trump clearly feels threatened by secretary clinton s qualifications to be president so he s attacking hillary clinton for being a woman   warren said   that s what weak men do  it is an old story  and i don t think the american voters will fall for it  we need someone in the white house who isn t afraid to fight for equal rights for women   warren continued   that person is not donald trump  warren went on to express disappointment that the globe didn t ask her if she thinks trump is a sexist and she provided an answer anyway and took a shot at trump s hair in the process  that s like asking if he has bad hair  he wears the sexism out front for everyone to see  this is nothing compared to the shellacking she gave ted cruz  however  earlier this month  ted crus begged for money in an email by complaining about the  sacrifices  he has made to run for president  boo hoo   warren wrote on facebook   he whined about facing constant attacks  nonexistent family time  his limited health and sleep  and having no personal time  are you kidding me  we re supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard   after listing the sacrifices the american people make every day  she suggested cruz start doing his job to help them  senator cruz   you chose to run for president  working people don t get a choice  maybe you should spend less time complaining about your  significant sacrifices    and more time trying to do something about theirs  it s too bad warren didn t run for president this year  it would have been amazing to watch her crush these two republican men day after day throughout the campaign featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
