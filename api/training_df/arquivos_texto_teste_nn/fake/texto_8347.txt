it can be said that donald trump was less than pleased that he came in second to ted cruz in the iowa caucus  however  that s putting it mildly  from his expressionless concession speech  to his next day blame game  to his temper tantrum against cruz  he s been pretty much a loose cannon although  leave it to jimmy fallon to show trump s true reaction to coming in second place that likely happened in a dream on trump s flight from iowa to new hampshire  on wednesday s edition of the tonight show  fallon donned the infamous trump wig and did his spot on impersonation once again to have trump declare he s  the winner and champion   of second place  he then tells everyone   in case you re wondering  the  j  stands for genius   then after declaring victory  he says  it s just like children say  first is the worst  second is the best  third is the one with the hairy chest   marco rubio get that taken care of  i wouldn t want your hair to make you look ridiculous  fallon then goes through how many wonderful things in life have the number two in them or come in twos  thus making him equally as spectacular  of course he ends by telling everyone  from now on  when you think donald trump  i want you to think yuge no    so watch out new hampshire  because the deuce is loose  and it s true  trump often does appear to be a giant piece of sh t more often than not  so it fits it will definitely be interesting to see what happens in new hampshire after their primary vote next week  will trump still be the champion of second place  or will he be able to finally declare a true victory  we ll just have to wait and see  video featured image from youtube
