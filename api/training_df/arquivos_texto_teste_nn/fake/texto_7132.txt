the republican election commissioner of jefferson county arkansas showed how easy it is for a white man in a red state to pull a gun on an unarmed black man  say he  felt threatened  and walk away scot free  stu soffer  the white man in question  decided to insert himself into an argument when he was told in no uncertain terms by former democratic election commissioner ted davis that nobody was talking to him  davis  who never makes any threatening gestures towards soffer  was then told to step back by another white guy intervening on first white guy s behalf sorry for the lack of names  but by this point all these white guys shouting allegations and preparing for a stand your ground defense start to look alike  and i m a white guy it s at that point that soffer pulls a small handgun from his pocket and holds it at his side  he puts it back in his pocket a few moments later but doesn t remove his hand from the pocket until the police arrive several minutes later  before that happens he can be seen advancing towards davis at one point and defending his idiocy when a woman calls him out for pulling a gun  i was in fear for my life  i m  years old and i was in fear for my life  it should be noted that the scary black man looks to be about the same age and was unarmed with the exception of a pretty nice three piece suit  what soffer probably should have said was   this is arkansas  where i can kill a black man with my spiffy argument winner and get away with it   the argument itself was over a public meeting of the election commission  where the meeting was adjourned while a democrat was speaking  cutting him off mid sentence soffer told the arkansas times that he retrieved his gun from his car because he  didn t have a good feeling  about things  that davis approached him with a  weird look on his face   he said davis appeared to be in a  trance   in other words  the scary black man was black  and in the spirit of how black men were convicted across the south for a century for crimes they didn t commit  soffer claimed he took steps to protect himself kill a man who was definitely black enough to be black and scary and black watch the incident unfold for yourself and see if you think soffer was justified in his close call with the use of deadly force featured image from screen capture
