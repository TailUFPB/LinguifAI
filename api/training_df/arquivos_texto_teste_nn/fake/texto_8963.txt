with the republican primaries less then a month away  donald trump has started to spend millions on his campaign  while the billionaire can throw plenty of money at trump style racist and crazy television ads  he s already received lots of free media attention and leads in most polls  however  late night talk show host seth meyers isn t convinced  myers said  but here s the thing about those polls  there s reason to think they might not really mean anything  one reason is that people hate talking to pollsters   the response rate has fallen from  percent to a dismal  percent  according to one study  which is a lower response rate than student loan collector and mother in law  meyers said that there s a correlation with trump saying  outrageous and offensive things  and the media coverage he receives  the enormous attention he s getting  in combination with these polls makes it seems like trump is the winning horse  but meyers isn t buying it  rudolph giuliani had a three point lead for the republican nomination and howard dean had a whopping  point lead and both went on to fade  for all of us very concerned folks out there that trump has a shot at the presidency  here are more examples that give us hope that trump will also fade in   hillary clinton was the clear front runner  polling ahead of john kerry and john edwards and she had a huge advantage over barack obama by  points from january all the way through june  in   joe lieberman led in most polls of the democratic primary but he lost to john kerry so  it all comes down to the people who go out and vote and not the polls that precede an election  in one of his speeches that meyers broadcasts  trump says   if i don t win  i will consider this  and i mean it  a total and complete waste of time   as meyers said and as i m sure most of the readers out there also think  trump   you are not alone  featured image via video screen capture
