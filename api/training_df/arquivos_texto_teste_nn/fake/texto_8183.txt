clearly  one big goal of the conservative  christian  base is to one day strip women of their right to vote and confine them solely to the home and that s exactly what arizona pastor steven anderson of the faithful word baptist church preached to his congregation in a video he uploaded to youtube in this latest rant  anderson goes full misogynist  whining about women being able to divorce their husbands  having the right to vote  and having a job outside of the home  all of which he believes only men should have the ability to do  you know what they mean    anderon asked his flock  the right to divorce your husband is what they mean  you know what they mean  the right to rebel and disobey your husband  the right to divorce him  the right to go out and get a job and make your own money  the right to tell him what to do  the right to go vote for our leaders as if women should have any say in how our country is run when the bible says that  i suffer not a woman to teach  not to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence  i am quoting the bible right now but it s old fashioned here s the video via youtube this isn t the first time anderson has been a total dick towards women  he once went on a rant about how women shouldn t be allowed to read  talk  or leave the house without permission from a man  he has even demanded that women keep their mouths shut in church  which makes one wonder how any woman can stand being around this asshole and he is hardly the first conservative  christian  hero to call for banning women from voting  fake historian david barton has also said that women should be barred from voting because the bible says that only the head of the household should be allowed to vote on the family s behalf  regardless of what policies or candidates the rest of the family supports and republican presidential candidates  from ted cruz to trump to rubio to kasich  haven t exactly made it a secret that they have a general disdain for women  all of them have made it clear that women s rights will suffer should any of them become president  and it s because of preachers like anderson on the christian right that republicans have adopted such medieval beliefs about women  which is why it is even more important than ever before that every woman in this country exercise their right to vote  because if they don t  they may not have that right much longer if conservatives have their way featured image  screenshot
