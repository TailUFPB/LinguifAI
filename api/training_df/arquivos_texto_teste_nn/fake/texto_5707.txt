senator elizabeth warren continued her crusade against donald trump on monday and she she did not hold back upon voting to exit the european union last week  britain sparked a    trillion loss across global markets as the republican nominee cheered  and warren did not like that one bit  because the financial downturn will affect ordinary americans more than it affects him so during a stop in ohio with hillary clinton  warren tore into trump in defense of all the americans who may experience setbacks of their own due to the brexit vote  donald trump says he ll make america great again   she began  it s stamped on the front of his goofy hat  you wanna see goofy  look at him in that hat  when donald trump says  great   i say   great for who  exactly   for millions of kids struggling to pay for an education  for millions of seniors barely surviving on social security  for families that don t fly to scotland to play golf   she asked rhetorically   when he says  make america great  he means make it great for rich guys just like donald trump  great for the guys who don t care how much they ve already squeezed from everyone else  great for the guys who always want more  because that s who donald trump is  the guy who wants it all for himself  and watch out  because he will crush you into the dirt to get what he wants  and then she blasted him for being happy about financial crises that hurt millions of americans  donald trump cheered on britain s current crisis which has sucked billions of dollars out of your retirement accounts because he said it might bring more rich people to his new golf course  he cheered on the  housing crash because he could scoop up more real estate on the cheap  and he cheered on students desperate enough to sign up for his fake university so he could bleed them dry and turn a profit for himself  what kind of a man does that  what kind of a man roots for people to lose their jobs  to lose their homes  to lose their life savings  i ll tell you what kind of a man  a small insecure  money grubber who fights for no one but himself  a nasty man who will never become president of the united states  she then introduced hillary clinton to thunderous applause  thus making it clear that she would be a great choice if she is picked as hillary s vice presidential running mate here s the video via youtube hillary clinton would be wise to choose warren as her vp  not only would it be an all female ticket  it would help solidify her status among progressives who haven t fallen in line to support her  and if this speech foreshadows anything it s that donald trump is about to get his ass handed to him in november by two women instead of just one featured image via screenshot
