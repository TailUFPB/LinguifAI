donald trump has been gallivanting across america for months now talking about his own popularity and boasting about poll numbers  he gave the impression that he was invincible and his bid for thew presidency infallible  there s one thing you can t take from donald trump  he s extremely confident regardless of how he performed in the polls up until about a week ago  trump made a mistake that an unlikely enemy to a republican  fox news  couldn t help but gloat over  whether you call it ego  narcissism  pride or the delusional rantings of a bloviating blowhard  trump s decision to boycott the last gop debate may have just jumped up and bit him on the ass it was just the donald missing in south carolina  it was his supporters  the idiots who will clap and shout for him no matter how stupid he sounds  creating a mob mentality and increasing his popularity among the fools who vote republican in this country  in his absence  ted cruz and his supporters were able to steal the show  catapulting his campaign to a win in iowa monday night fox wasted no time gloating about the fact that trump s little bout of butcher is most likely what handed him his first taste of defeat  fox correspondent john roberts told anchor bret baier that marco rubio s surge with people who were later in deciding who to vote for showed that trump s refusal to be in the same room with megyn kelly probably cost him the win baier  being the good little puppet that he is  ran with that theory and began polling other fox actors and actresses how they felt  charles krauthammer was hesitant to give all the credit to the skipped debate  adding that rubio s performance was worthy of a bump  meaning he was watching a different debate than people who live in the real world  rubio did nothing but yell generalities at the crowd in an attempt to seem less timid other fox hosts were more eager to give their network at least some of the credit  according to talking points memo baier floated the idea to conservative radio host laura ingraham  asking her to look  at the numbers and the surge that perhaps other candidates  ted cruz  rubio had   and weigh in on  the debate had any effect on these numbers  baier presented the question to fox news contributor stephen hayes as well  asking him if  can we definitively say that not going to the debate hurt trump  a strategic error  that close  pundit kirsten powers suggested that  trump missed an opportunity to make his closing arguments  and  it looks like he s paying a price for it here  fox news commentator dana perino argued that two polls that showed rubio gaining traction were a  direct result  of the debate  comparing it to the last cycle  when   percent of people decided after the last debate in   i think that looks like it could be true this time as well   she said while skipping the doom and gloom of a fox news debate may not seem like a big deal to normal people  it certainly doesn t seem to have helped donald trump out at all featured image by media matters screen capture
