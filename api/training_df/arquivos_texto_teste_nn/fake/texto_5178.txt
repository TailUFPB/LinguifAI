there s an age old saying  not all republicans are racist  but all racists are republicans  for quite sometime  the gop has been pushing back on that notion  playing the victim card in the process  while simultaneously putting steve  cantaloupes for calves  king and ann  peasant culture  coulter on their national stages  and who could forget rep  don  wetbacks  young then donald trump came along  and it was all a ok in the republican mainstream it s been well documented that trump supporters have higher feelings of racial prejudice than the average republican   and indeed the average american  we ve seen how they talk about black lives matter  we ve seen them sucker punch black protesters  we know trump got the support of david duke but the most telling slice of bigotry comes from a newly released uncensored video from the new york times  taken deep in the midst of multiple trump rallies  from maine to arizona  that shows just how vile his supporters can be screams of  kill them all   the n word   f g   and other racial expletives that are used only to dehumanize people echo all around  and no one says a thing about it and the best part  they re all committed by white  overweight  uneducated  sunburnt  unkempt hillbillies who probably think olive garden is a fancy dinner  the same people that decry political correctness are so easily offended when their hate and bigotry is put on blast trump supporters deny the existence of these people within their camp  the republican party denies it  or blatantly ignores it  the proof is out  and no one can say it isn t true  because it is  this is what we are faced with filled with anger  hate  violence and rage  these people  unhinged  will be voting for their preferred candidate  who is equally if not more unhinged  now people will say  but these are his supporters  not trump himself   if you ve watched trump at his rallies before  he closely pays attention to what people are saying in the crowds  his failure to disavow the racism  sexism  xenophobia and sheer violence at his rallies says everything you need to know these people are voting in november  are you featured image via john moore getty images
