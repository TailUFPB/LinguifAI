republican front runner donald trump does a pretty amazing job making himself look like a complete moron  but he s given us so much material that impersonating such a ridiculous candidate has never been more fun trump s a character that almost seems too insane to be real  from his accent to his hand gestures and facial expressions  we ve never had a more animated presidential candidate   and that might not be a good thing  he s become loathed by not only every logically thinking american  but by nearly every politician   even members of the republican party because of his distinct  and revolting  personality  trump has been impersonated by comedians  talk show hosts and more  mimicking this candidate is so entertaining that even politicians   his own rivals   can t help but get in on it  here are some epic impersonations that have been done by the other candidates  at trump s expense hillary clinton  starting at the   mark we think clinton took the prize here  doing a dead on impersonation of the annoying yet unforgettable way trump speaks  she even got some of the facial expressions right following clinton are the impressions done by trump s gop rivals  who are understandably less charismatic and less intelligent than clinton  but they still deserve some credit for trying   even if you end up laughing at them instead ted cruz  at the   mark ted cruz is creepy as ever  but he does a good job at summing up what trump does during debates while at the same time mocking him for skipping one jeb bush  at the   mark you can tell that jeb bush  who recently dropped out of the presidential race  isn t used to being funny   but even he could barely contain his laughter as he tried to capture trump s personality in a few seconds for stephen colbert rand paul  at the   mark ex candidate rand paul actually tried to mimic trump s voice  and it was pretty disastrous  however  he did a great job reflecting trump s misogynistic attitude toward women  as well as the front runner s inflated ego chris christie another former candidate  chris christie  takes a stab at trump s voice as he bashes him during a speech  interestingly enough  christie has now endorsed trump and was recently embarrassed tremendously by the business mogul   probably for this horrible impression while these politicians should have probably left the impersonations to the comedians  we can t blame them for wanting to make fun of everyone s least favorite person  we can only imagine what it s like to work so closely with someone as irritatingly awful as trump   so these candidates can blast him all they want  but in closing  we ll leave you with this epic trump impersonation from jimmy fallon  who absolutely nailed it featured image is a screenshot
