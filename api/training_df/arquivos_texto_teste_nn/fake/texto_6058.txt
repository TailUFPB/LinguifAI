somebody alert mike rowe  the dirtiest job in america is being the republican national convention s hispanic media director under presumptive nominee donald trump already tasked with building inroads with a group of people whom many of your fellow republicans view as  less thans  or criminals  the job of appealing to hispanics under the leadership of donald trump is a near impossibility  how demeaning is it to be a hispanic woman working for trump s republican party  the current and long suffering hispanic media director ruth guerra resigned  when some republicans heard the news of ruth guerra had quit  they didn t feel betrayed  they felt relieved that her misery was over  i m so proud of her  for leaving  one hispanic republican said wednesday night when told the news   i don t know how she held on for this long  the woman tasked with taking her place has had the job for less than  hours and already had to take a humiliating first step  purging her social media accounts of any criticisms of trump  of which there were many  hours before the announcement that helen aguirre ferr  would be stepping into the role of working with spanish speaking media outlets and coordinating hispanic outreach  she quietly deleted many of her tweets of the trump bashing she used to regularly post  unfortunately for her  the internet never forgets  buzzfeed quickly found a cache of old  deleted tweets in which ferr  seemed to have been a  never trump  republican and had publicly sided with trump rival ted cruz during the primaries  ferr  now gets to be the party face of a man who actively hates both her ethnicity and gender  trump may adore taco bowls  but his view towards hispanic and latinos is casually racist in a way that should be appalling to anyone living in the  century  having launched his campaign by accusing mexico of sending rapists and murderers across the border  trump is also a big fan of using the word  mexican  as an insult  recently  he attempted to smear the judge presiding over his trump university lawsuit as a biased  mexican  incapable of doing his job  he similarly slammed new mexico s republican governor   her crime  she didn t endorse him  ferr  has to watch as her ethnicity is repeatedly disparaged  while actively working to get the man doing so elected  and worse  she was forced to cleanse her own misgivings from the public s view   even many that were and still are valid criticisms  whether that s a sign of lack of personal integrity on ferr s part or a sad statement about just how desperate hispanic republicans are to get any voice at all in the party is open to interpretation  whatever the case  ferr s job is very  very dirty featured image via twitter
