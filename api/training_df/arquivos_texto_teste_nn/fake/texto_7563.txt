enough is enough  it s time for donald trump to condemn this racist violence or be forced to end his campaign for the second time in a week  video footage has revealed yet another incident of violent racism at the same trump rally in north carolina where an old white redneck sucker punched a young black protester in the head as he was being escorted out the building by police  year old john mcgraw has since been arrested by law enforcement  but now it looks like police are going to have to hunt down and arrest another white racist who assaulted a different black person who  despite not doing anything wrong  was escorted out with other african american attendees by officers who roughed some of them up for no reason east carolina university student adedayo adeniyi caught the terrifying experience on his cell phone camera on wednesday as officers began scuffling with other black people in the stands around him  hey that s not me  that s them   adeniyi says on the video in reference to being told he has to leave even though he wasn t even protesting   i don t even know them  the cops  who are white  wrestle one protester to the ground and cuff him before leading him off  as adeniyi is also led off down the aisle  an old white kkk wannabe tells him  hey  f ck you  baby  f ck you   and then physically assaults him by slapping him  and police didn t seem to care about that at all here s the video via youtube afterwards  adeniyi remarked that the incident made him fear for the future of america because it definitely looks like the country is embracing hate and bigotry  these are presidential candidate rallies   he told the new york daily news  i m not at a kkk rally  the fact that i experienced hate at a candidate rally tells you everything you need to know about donald trump and the people that support him  people will act more hateful and racist in environments that they feel not only encouraged to do it  but accept it as normal  the man at the end of the video is a moment i ll never forget  the hate in his eyes  the words  the hate in those words  the slap  it was disgusting and sad  at that moment i believed that america will stay and continue to be a hateful and bigoted country  donald trump s rallies are nothing more than glorified white supremacist rallies that are an embarrassment to this nation and those around the world  the fact that any candidate for political office here in  century america actually condones and encourages violence and racism against black people is sickening the fact that the police are serving as trump s own personal guard and are allowing these acts of violence to occur and in some cases even joining in is just as disgusting  this is not the america any of us should want  but it s the one we ll get if people do not vote in november featured image via flickr
