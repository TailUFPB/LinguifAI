republican house speaker paul ryan has been getting slammed ever since the moment he announced his endorsement of donald trump   and that s not going to stop anytime soon on friday morning  morning joe s mika brzezinski didn t hesitate to rip ryan a new one for being  pathetic  and  weak  enough to cave in and support the disgraced presumptive republican nominee  a visibly frustrated brzezinski said   yet another republican goes down  for no reason  with no actual information about what convinced him  guest panelist mark halperin tried to defend ryan against brzezinski s wrath by saying that ryan basically  had no choice   but brzezinski wasn t having any of it  she went right into a scathing rant about what a bad move it was  she said  to your line about ryan had no choice  which is pathetic  because this election is unlike any other  the rule book has been thrown out  so that no choice thing  put it back into the  s and  s and early  s  because there are new rules this is just so sad  paul ryan   the guy who i think is the republican s great hope   is an honest  good  principled man of character  what is he   if he had a good reason  i m all for it brzezinski criticized ryan for not being able to  live by his principles  and had a very special message for the house speaker  paul  he s not going to do anything for you because you did this  he s not going to pay you back  it s pathetic  he sold out  i m sorry  he did have a choice and he made one that was weak  you can watch brzezinski tear ryan a new one below this is a definite change from morning joe s history of supporting trump  earlier this year  the hosts were humiliated and exposed when leaked audio was circulated of brzezinki and co host joe scarborough expressing their support and fawning all over trump during commercial breaks when he was on their show  perhaps that s changed now  unless this is just another facade   but judging from trump s reaction  it might have been real  when trump caught wind of brzezinki s comments  he attacked the show featured image via paul morigi and alex wong   getty images
