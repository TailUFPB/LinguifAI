donald trump just can t seem to make up his mind about abortion laws  but his latest stance is going to make pro life republicans really angry in the last week  the republican frontrunner s opinion about abortion laws have changed more times than i have changed my clothes  on wednesday  during a town hall discussion with msnbc s chris matthews  trump told the host that he believes the roe v  wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned  when the medical procedure is banned he said that women who get an abortion should be punished  it all went downhill from there shortly before the interview was set to air  trump said the abortion issue should be  left to the states   when he realized that people were still pretty pissed off  he said that he meant women who have abortions are  victims  and if he has his way he will punish the doctors who perform them  but now  he is once again changing his tune and is going full on pro choice liberal during an interview with cbs  john dickerson  set to air sunday  trump was asked about his position on abortion laws and he responded  i would ve preferred states  rights   he added   i think it would ve been better if it were up to the states  but right now  the laws are set  at this moment  the laws are set  and i think we have to leave it that way  dickerson was clearly surprised by his obvious liberal position and asked  do you think abortion is murder   trump replied  i have my opinions on it  but i d rather not comment on it  right now  the current laws make abortion  percent legal and he is saying that he does not believe they should be changed  that means that he is not pro life  but instead pro choice  which  by the way  is the position he always had until he realized that he could appeal to america s ignorant imbeciles and changed his long held position after this clip from the face the nation interview was aired and the media reacted  trump s campaign once again scrambled to  clarify  his statement  saying  mr  trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now   until he is president  then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn  there is nothing new or different here  that s actually not what he said at all  but it s funny that they are trying to spin it again watch the clip below featured image via tom pennington getty images
