if there is anyone who is as big a bully as donald trump  it is fox news  bill o reilly  whenever he has a guest on his show that has a differing opinion than him  he cuts them off  yells at them and all around treats them like shit  in addition to the way he treats his guests  he lies all the time to his audience and makes inflammatory claims about democrats and liberal organizations  his love for outrage was showcased on the wednesday night episode of the o reilly factor where he accused black lives matter of  killing americans  o reilly introduced the  talking points  segment of his show by saying  how black lives matter is killing americans  that is the subject of tonight s talking points memo   he went on to say that the movement is a  violent subculture  within the african american community  yes  because fighting for the rights  through protests and demonstrations  is super offensive and violent  he claimed  the media will not spotlight that much of the violent crime in america is being committed right now by young black men  blacks of all ages commit homicide at a rate of  times higher than whites and hispanics combined  conclusion  there is a violent subculture in the african american community that should be exposed and confronted  i would love to know where bill gets his statistics from  obviously  it s the bullshit center for white supremacist studies  this tired old narrative that black people commit more crimes than white people is  exactly that  bullshit  according to fbi statistics  african americans were arrested more than whites for murder and manslaughter  but the numbers varied by one percent however  white people committed far more violent crimes than african americans  sixty five percent of the people arrested for  forcible rape  were white  that s double the  percent that were black  aggravated assaults    percent were committed by whites   percent by blacks  burglaries    percent were committed by whites    percent by blacks  the fbi found that   percent of all violent crimes were committed by white people and   percent by african americans table via fbi govdon t expect o reilly to amend his false claims  though  he needs to keep his audience nice and outraged  he needs his viewers to believe that black  thugs  are murdering  raping and robbing  the republican party needs him to spread this racist  bombastic nonsense because the more fearful white folks are of black people  the more likely they are to vote for people like trump who are promising to take the country back  they hate that a black guy has taken up residence in  their  white house and they want to make their oval office white again  o reilly and the gop know that this is how their vapid base feels so they are fear mongering hard featured image via ilya s  savenok getty images
