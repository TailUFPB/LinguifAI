we all know what an absolute shitstorm is happening with regards to lgbt rights in north carolina right now  everyone is focusing on the idiot gov  pat mccrory and his bullshit lawsuit against the department of justice over his anti lgbt hate bill    however  there is another side to what brought this on  and full frontal host samantha bee is pointing it out  you see  when an election has high voter turnout  democrats win  when it s a low turnout  we get imbeciles like pat mccrory elected  bee began her tirade  boycotts are a powerful tool   but you know what is a more powerful tool  not electing a bunch of transphobic numbnuts who are going to wreck the state economy to catch a nonexistent criminal  bee is right  of course  thanks to the homophobic and transphobic   bunches of businesses and musicians have pulled out of north carolina  bee insists that what we are seeing right now is a direct result of democrats not voting in the  election  she continues  referencing times prior to that fateful election night  it was a blue state dream  democrats controlled the governor s mansion and legislature  welfare checks grew on trees and there was an abortion in every pot  but all that changed on election night   bee then went on to show tape of references to the newly gop controlled north carolina legislature slashing education funding and said  you know north carolina s world class public university  f ck that place  bee then goes on to remind everyone that it could be progressive college students who would vote these morons out  but there s just one problem with that  right wingers have used their time in office to suppress the votes of college students by making laws that take polling places off campuses and deny students the right to use their student identification cards to vote  i bet unc students can t wait to vote those right wing boobs out of office  well  sorry  those boobs are actually way ahead of you on that  the host then points out the fact that the gop now controlled more states than they have since   and as a result  their insane laws have swept the nation in more than just north carolina  she goes on to say  after the  landslide  policies started happening to states the way sex happens to people who drink with bill cosby  no wonder democrats are so hung up on appointing the next supreme court justice  they need him to strike down all the sh tty state laws that might not have passed if they d bothered to vote in   bee s closer is absolutely brilliant  and oh so true  look  i know state elections aren t fun  they don t have cool concerts or dank memes  but  voting in them is important  just think of it like a mammogram  it s painful and inconvenient  but you gotta do it  because early prevention prevents a lot less than late stage treatment  samantha bee is spot on with this one  liberals didn t vote in midterm elections  and therefore the gop has been able to go on a nationwide right wing tear the likes of which we have not seen for many decades  listen to this wise woman  people  when democrats don t vote  this dangerous  regressive nonsense is what we all must suffer through  remember   vote blue  no matter who watch the video below  and please heed the advice featured image via video screen capture
