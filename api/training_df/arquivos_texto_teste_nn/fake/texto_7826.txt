during the most recent republican presidential debate  donald trump proposed getting rid of the environmental protection agency altogether  a government agency founded in  by republican president richard nixon  trump s skewed logic was the agency s   billion budget is wasted and should be reallocated to the states in response to rubio s pressing of trump for what his plan is to cut taxes and balance the federal budget  trump replied  environmental protection   we waste all of this money  we re going to bring that back to the states  we are going to cut many of the agencies  we will balance our budget and we will be dynamic again  the radical proposal of trump defies anything remotely close to being realistic  trump has also accused the epa of creating more damage than they protect and making it impossible for the country to compete  his rhetoric is part of the mode of thinking many of his supporters have  that the government somehow is impeding their ability to improve their lives  and the solution is de regulating everything in order for a free market of competition will solve everything  in reality  dissolving the epa  which would involve repealing many environmental laws  would leave environmental protection up to the states  where most do not have the resources to enforce meaningful environmental regulations  this would also cause a vacuum of competition where states would try to appeal to hazardous industries to come to their state by downgrading environmental regulations because the entire republican party has lost their minds  trump s proposal is one that has also been adopted by senator marco rubio and senator ted cruz  this past january  rubio dubbed the epa  the  employment prevention agency   adding the agency s regulations are out of control and hurt our economy cruz  who already is notorious for wanting to repeal all federal climate change regulation and the clean air act  told breitbart news in    i think states should press back using every tool they have available  we ve got to rein in a lawless executive that is abusing its power   in response to a question as to whether states should comply with epa coal regulations the proposal to get rid of the epa would be disastrous for the environment and the daily lives of every american  the endemic species throughout this country and the ecosystems they inhabit are already under insurmountable stress  and the science overwhelmingly shows environmental regulations  caps  and oversight are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and other environmental influences dissolving the epa is just one of the many dangers the republican presidential candidates pose to the american public if elected  and if they were ever successful in doing so  the damage incurred could potentially destroy parts of the country indefinitely with hazardous sites  toxic waste pollution  and increasing emission rates becoming more of the norm  if anything  the epa s funding needs to be increased  and the agency improved by making it more effective  because the stakes couldn t be higher  america cannot afford a president who doesn t understand action needs to be made to combat climate change  not worsen it featured image via screen capture
