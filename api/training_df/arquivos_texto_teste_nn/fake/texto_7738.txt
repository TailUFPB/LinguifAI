conservatives are going to be seriously shocked about this one ben stein is a conservative economist who served as a speechwriter under presidents nixon and ford in the   and he s been a republican his entire life as well as a harsh critic of president obama stein has always supported the republican nominee in every election  so one would think he would do the same in   especially since president obama s former secretary of state is running  not so fast like other republicans  stein is troubled by donald trump  and after being asked who he would support during an interview on cnn  stein professed that he could see himself supporting hillary clinton or bernie sanders  the two democrats in the race  because trump is dangerous  i went to law school with ms  clinton so i ve always had a kind of fondness for her  she was always a very nice young woman  i admire the fact that bernie sanders has a single payer national health plan  when i worked for mr  nixon as a speechwriter  i wrote the message that sent up mr  nixon s proposal for single payer health plan  but i would like to see it be a republican  i ve never voted for a democrat  but mr  trump  i think  is dangerously misinformed  i like him  but he s dangerously misinformed  here s the video via youtube this is an explosive sign that republicans are in a hell of a lot of trouble if donald trump manages to capture the gop nomination  which he is well on track to achieving  trump s nasty and hateful rhetoric and association with members of the kkk and other white supremacist groups is terrifying the gop establishment because it could not only cause republicans to lose another presidential election  it could doom their effort to keep the house and the senate from falling into democratic control to underscore that point  nbc s chuck todd reported on tuesday night that a sitting republican senator is preparing to endorse hillary clinton if trump wins the nomination clearly  donald trump is ripping the republican party to pieces and it sounds like it s only going to get more entertaining as election season continues featured image  wikimedia
