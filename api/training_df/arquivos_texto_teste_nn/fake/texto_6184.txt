donald trump s best efforts to smear democratic front runner hillary clinton have just been ruined and exposed   thanks to the carelessness of his own campaign on wednesday  politico reported that trump s campaign was planning to roll out several attacks against the former secretary of state  focusing on her involvement in the whitewater real estate scandal   which would be an entirely new strategy  considering that all trump has been doing over the last few days is going after the sexual history and rape allegations of hillary s husband  former president bill clinton trump s latest attack blueprint was revealed in an internal trump campaign email  after campaign adviser michael caputo sent a request for a republican national committee researcher to work up information on hrc whitewater as soon as possible   stating that  this is for immediate use and for the afternoon talking points process   in the process of getting the information together  these plans were accidentally sent to an journalist  how does the trump campaign f ck up this badly  it s an interesting story  according to politico  the email was obtained by politico when trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks  who  copied on his request to the rnc  accidentally responded instead to marc caputo  a politico reporter who is not related to the republican consultant  and trump s anti clinton strategy wasn t the only thing hicks let slip through the cracks  she also gave away the fact that rnc staffer michael abboud could possibly be jumping ship and joining the trump campaign  hicks said  he is still an employee of the rnc and we need to be sensitive to that until he comes over to our team full time  hilariously  hicks didn t realize how badly she d screwed up until about  minutes later   and all she did to rectify it was send the journalist another email  the email s subject line read   wrong email  obviously  and the message contained one pathetic word   apologies  featured image via joe raedle   getty images
