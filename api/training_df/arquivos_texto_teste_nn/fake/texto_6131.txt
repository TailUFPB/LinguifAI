donald trump has supposedly been self funding his campaign  sort of   and he loves bragging about how he s not beholden to anybody because he s not taking the big donations that inevitably come with conditions attached  that all may be coming to an end for him now  one of his top advisers  paul manafort  spoke to senate republicans about the state of his campaign s finances  and admitted there isn t enough money to mount a serious challenge to hillary clinton going into this summer s conventions oh  the horror  what happened to all that money trump claimed he had  supposedly he s worth   billion  oh  that s right  most of that isn t actual cash  and he s been loaning what cash he does have to the campaign  now the campaign owes him tens of millions of dollars and is finding itself broke anyway without campaign money  trump will have trouble running television ads during june and most of july because he won t have access to any of the rnc s funds until he s officially accepted their nomination  he can t do that until the convention near the end of july  what a crying shame trump supposedly already has a fundraising agreement with the rnc  and some of his allies are worried that the rnc is going to take advantage of him if he ends up trailing hillary going into the fall  the rnc could decide to use those funds to help other republican candidates win their races  and leave trump in the dust  trump supposedly fully supports something like that  but with his history of crying foul whenever the rnc doesn t do exactly what he thinks they ought to do  no matter what he s said out loud   who knows how he ll actually react if he loses the general election he might have to  gasp   start taking donations  and courting more of the gop s major donors  he has a fundraising goal of   billion before november  but that will be exceptionally difficult if some of these donors don t get on board with him  so far  only nine of the gop s top  donors have committed to donating money to trump  the campaign is confident more donors will fall in line  though any donations at all  though  will make him beholden to them  which will give the lie to his insistence that he ll remain on the side of the little guy once he s in office  so much for his being the  everyman  candidate  pardon us while we snicker at his plight featured image by spencer platt getty images
