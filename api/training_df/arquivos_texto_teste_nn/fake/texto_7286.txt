every parent s worst fear is that a teacher will abuse their child  this fear is even greater for parents like myself with special needs children that won t be able to tell us when a teacher like amelia stripling is hurting them  fortunately for sarah patterson  the mother of a  year old student at tift county pre k center in tifton  georgia  the school has cameras and someone willing to speak up according to sarah patterson  the mother of the boy  her son just turned  years old on wednesday  days after stripling casually walked around an open classroom door and shoved her knee in the boys back without warning  causing him to lurch forward and to the ground stripling then helped the boy up with the help of another adult before giving him a shove into the classroom it s easy to see that stripling was trying to get him to move into the classroom  but it s also clear that she was completely unconcerned about how rough she was and only mildly concerned that her student might have hit his head on the ground  if the whole incident had not been caught on tape and reported  stripling would almost certainly still be working with special needs kids here s the video  walb com  south georgia news  weather  sportsthe united states is staring down the barrel of an educational crisis that will guarantee more scenes like the one above  never mind the fact that there s a concerted effort underway to gut public education  stripping resources and talent and giving them to  charter schools  that waste billions with worse results  an even greater emergency is the rapid rise of autistic students and the complete failure of our school systems to prepare for them my family is lucky  we lived first in new york city  which takes early intervention for special needs children very seriously  the earlier they get help  the better off they ll be   then we moved to northern virginia  the very liberal part that turned the state purple  and they also take special needs education very seriously  compare that to southern virginia  the inbred redneck to our hippie liberal  where they refuse to officially diagnose my clearly autistic nephew and told his mother that they can t be bothered helping him learn to tie his shoelaces so she should just get him velcro sneakers there s going to be a lot more of southern virginia than northern virginia in this country as millions of kids with special needs move through an educational system that doesn t know how to help them  they can barely handle what they already have and all too often resort to the kind of abuse that stripling does  sure  parents with money will be able to afford the expensive services their kids will need but even middle class families will unable to cope  and the working poor  tough luck  have fun sending your kid off to a school with a staff that s untrained  uncaring or both featured image via video screen capture
