for the second time in the last ten days  slimy and loathsome ted cruz totally botched another painful impression of the late president kennedy you might recall how cruz first performed a painfully awkward rendition of the  miracle max  scene from the beloved film the princess bride  thus nearly ruining the film for all time  there s something wrong in the universe when someone as repugnant as cruz likes such a fantastic movie to the point where he can recite entire passages in the voices of the characters  the voices were  of course  terrible and he got many of the lines wrong  which once again verified that most conservatives shouldn t bother trying to be funny  they re never funny  even when the source material is stellar then  earlier this month  cruz entertained a small crowd of iowa yokels with a flop sweat inducing jfk impression  just after suggesting kennedy would be driven out of the modern democratic party for being too conservative  regarding the latter  no  first  kennedy was arguably more liberal than most democratic leaders of   second  there are moderate and conservative democrats who continue to be welcome in the party  including presidential frontrunner hillary clinton it s also worth noting that cruz fumbled the quote  the line he attributed to jfk was actually said by robert kennedy years after jfk was assassinated  rfk s line  which was cribbed from george bernard shaw  by the way  went   some people see things as they are and say why  i dream things that never were and say why not   and this is the line cruz used for his john kennedy impression he did it again on monday cruz s verbatim line  during the   i will point out that one of the most powerful  eloquent defenders of tax cuts was john f  kennedy  as jfk said   some men see things as they are and ask  why  i see things that never were and ask  why not   these are the principles that work  once again  it was rfk who popularized the line  not jfk  and no one noticed cruz also said that jfk was a champion of tax cuts  this  believe it or not  is mostly true  kennedy proposed fairly deep cuts to the marginal tax rates at a time when the top bracket was nearly three times higher than it is today but that wouldn t have forced him out of today s democratic party  how do we know this  president obama is responsible for the biggest middle class tax cut in american history  that s no exaggeration  the infamous  stimulus  bill  which almost entirely helped to keep the economy from sliding into a depression  included   billion in tax cuts  as a point of comparison  president bush s tax cuts amounted to roughly   billion  obama s tax cut was also larger than reagan s cuts so  mr  cruz continues to lie to his people  assuming they re too ignorant to know the difference between jfk and rfk  or the difference between obama and kennedy on tax cuts featured image via video screen grab
