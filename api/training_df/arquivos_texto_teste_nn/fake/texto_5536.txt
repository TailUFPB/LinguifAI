it looks as though two police officers in memphis  tennessee think it s hilarious to take a picture of themselves pointing their gun down a hallway pretending to shoot a black person running  this  after countless people of color have been killed by the police  including several this past week the officers have yet to be identified  but according to the daily mail  the two unidentified memphis police officers were suspended friday for a picture on snapchat showing a white person pointing a gun at a cartoon of a young black person  memphis police department interim director michael rallings said  at this point two mpd officers have been relieved of duty  the image is disgusting and will not be tolerated  we will conduct a thorough investigation and the individuals responsible will be held accountable  i just spoke to a group of young people at lemoyne owen about decisions and we are responsible for the decisions we make and we are held to a higher standard  he added  we will not stand for this  here is the image via facebook  the daily mail it s absolutely unbelievable  yet  sadly believable  that this would be what anyone would post  let alone from a law enforcement officer who is paid to protect and serve the people  all people  it is clearly racist imagery  and hopefully the officers involved will be properly scrutinized and given the proper consequences featured image via facebook
