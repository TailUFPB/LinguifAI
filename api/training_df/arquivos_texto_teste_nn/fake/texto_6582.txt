the trend of tragic gun violence in america s schools continues  this time with a child from dallas  texas who brought a gun to school and shot himself  the kid was  years old  and he was at the school outside of school hours for a conference  according to dallas independent school district s police chief  craig miller  the reason the gun was not detected on the school s metal detector was because it wasn t being checked the way it usually is during normal operating times  the metal detectors are monitored differently after school starts  with this incident  perhaps they should rethink that policy  the lucky thing is that the kid s injuries are not life threatening  and the shooting was accidental  the   caliber pistol was apparently on his person in his first period class  and it went off  shooting him in the arm and leg  causing  serious  but not life threatening injuries   the school tweeted out the following statement regarding the shooting the student was injured when he inadvertently shot himself with a single shot revolver after the first class period had ended the student arrived at school today with this for  an  unplanned conference with school administrators  because of the circumstance  the procedures for the metal detectors was not applied the school was then placed on lockdown  and everyone on the scene was ordered to  shelter in place   according to local officials  that term means the following  shelter in place  means to take immediate shelter where you are at home  work  school  or in between  the lockdown was taken out of effect that afternoon  but many questions remain as to why and how a gun got onto that campus and into that school  when asked for answers by understandably concerned parents  craig miller said  i really don t know right now  it s part of the ongoing investigation  everyone involved was lucky this time  next time  that may not be the case  who the hell knows what kind of plans that kid had when he chose to carry that pistol into his school  considering the history of that  this quite disturbing  it seems that chief miller and other local authorities need to update their policies  further  this is just another incident that shows how much we need stricter gun laws watch a news report on the incident below featured image via wikipedia
