a little more than  years ago  the new york times ran its first profile on barack obama  reading it now  it is stunning just how much has changed  and how much has not the nyt was writing up  year old columbia university graduate barack obama for becoming the first black president of the harvard law review  looking at this piece today  it is difficult to understand how just  years later  he would become the first black president of the united states let s start with the headline  first black elected to lead harvard law review  frankly  it made us think of the recent headlines about chimpanzees reaching the stone age   but despite the tone of the piece  in which the tone of paternalism wafts out of the pages even a quarter of a century later  obama is notably chill  he makes a point in  that he continues to make  and is just as relevant  today  he told the times  the fact that i ve been elected shows a lot of progress  it s encouraging    but  he added   it s important that stories like mine aren t used to say that everything is o k  for blacks  you have to remember that for every one of me  there are hundreds or thousands of black students with at least equal talent who don t get a chance  there are the same fears of tokenism in  and there were in   nowhere is this more apparent than in our systems of education  saw and justice the u s  has the highest incarceration rate in the world   this means a higher percentage of u s  citizens pass through the prison system  than any other country on the planet for most countries with comparable demographics to the us  there will be  prisoners per every   population  in the us  the rate is five times this at  per    but black men in the u s  are incarcerated at an eye watering rate of   per   this is not because black men are somehow genetically more pre disposed to crime  but thanks in large part to the school to prison pipeline   the average state prisoner has a  grade education  and about   have not completed high school  the u s  education system delivers disadvantaged children over to prisons for profit the american civil liberties union described the school to prison pipeline of the u s  education system like this  a disturbing national trend wherein children are funneled out of public schools and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems  many of these children have learning disabilities or histories of poverty  abuse or neglect  and would benefit from additional educational and counseling services  instead  they are isolated  punished and pushed out   zero tolerance  policies criminalize minor infractions of school rules  while high stakes testing programs encourage educators to push out low performing students to improve their schools  overall test scores  students of color are especially vulnerable to push out trends and the discriminatory application of discipline  the school to prison pipeline starts with underfunded public schools  the schools are generally overcrowded and lack funding for qualified teachers  counsellors  special educational needs resources and even textbooks   the children are clear from the get go that their education is not being invested in   and these schools are normally in disadvantaged areas in the first place  there is no hope  no aspiration  no encouragement  no learning the implementation of  zero tolerance  policies in schools have turned minor infractions into criminal offences   this saw suspensions treble between  and   rising from   to    and disproportionately impacting children of color a combination of major under resourcing and fear of school based shootings has seen an influx of police in schools  instead of teachers  many u s  schools now have  school resource officers patrolling the hallways  criminalising standard misbehavior  again  children of color are disproportionately represented in the statistics   making up   of school arrests made  so  what were these children arrested for where children should be being educated about positive and negative behaviours  they are being criminalised as young as six years old  their educations are being suspended or ended due to these punishments and they are gifted to the prison system the truth is  disadvantaged children in the u s  have become a source of profit for the private prison industry   over the past four decades that private prisons were rolled out across the us  there has been a simultaneous explosion in crime  did citizens suddenly become more criminal  no  poverty was criminalised  and it made its way all the way into the school system so  while it is shocking to see the nakedly paternalistic language of the ny times profile from   and think how much has changed   the situation remains staggeringly similar to the majority of the black community of the united states featured image from vox
