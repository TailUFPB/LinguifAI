the catholic church has a decades long   and likely even longer than that   history of covering up child sexual abuse  they even looked the other way when child pornography was found within the walls of the vatican itself  and now  despite pope francis s declarations that he would put a stop to this  recent actions and statements by the church strongly contradict that times live reports that a set of guidelines drawn up to train newly ordained bishops says the following  according to the state of civil laws of each country where reporting is obligatory  it is not necessarily the duty of the bishop to report suspects to authorities  the police or state prosecutors in the moment when they are made aware of crimes or sinful deeds  so  in other words  these people are telling their new bishops that they don t have to go to the cops if they find out someone in their charge is molesting kids  that is in sharp contrast to pope francis s earlier statement  which said  everything possible must be done to rid the church of the scourge of the sexual abuse  well  your words are high minded  pope francis  but the guidelines regarding this issue are not  nothing has changed  you people might be pretending to be concerned about the continued victimization of the children within your parishes and under the charge of your priests and bishops  but you aren t  really  all you care about is the church s image  and getting butts in the pews and cash in the collection plates there is absolutely no defending this one  they are  essentially  grooming new bishops to continue covering up these heinous crimes  and hiding behind religious freedom and privileged communication to do so word to the wise  parents  the last people you should ever trust your children with without question are these priests and bishops  there s no telling what will happen to them featured image from donkey hotey on flickr
