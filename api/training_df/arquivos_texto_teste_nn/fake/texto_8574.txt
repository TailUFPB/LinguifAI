as a general rule  militia groups do not side with liberals on anything  but as michigan reels under revelations of conspiracy and collusion at all levels of republican governor rick snyder s administration  militia members have added their voice to the chorus of citizens calling for snyder s arrest as reported by the detroit free press  the genesee county volunteer militia will be staging a protest in the city of flint  demanding answers from state officials regarding the city s poisoned water  the protest will be held on january   just one week after filmmaker and activist michael moore staged a similar protest in the city in a press release concerning the upcoming protest  the genesee county volunteer militia stated  it is nothing less than shocking that our elected officials would try to hide the hazards that residents are being subjected to just by drinking a simple glass of tap water    on its facebook page  the militia group has also issued a call for the state s emergency manager law to be overturned by the michigan legislature  this echoes the sentiments of an overwhelming majority of michigan citizens  many who voted to repeal the law in  following the voter repeal  the state legislature  which is almost entirely controlled by republican and tea party representatives  simply rewrote the emergency manager law and passed it again  this time with a rider to ensure it could not be repealed by voters image  scree capture  genesee county volunteer militia   names redactedlike other militia groups around the state  the genesee county volunteer militia displays the tea party flag on their facebook page this week it was widely reported that governor snyder has hired two out of state pr firms to try to help him with his public image no doubt snyder was hoping to paint the flint water scandal as a  leftist  attack  the trouble with that narrative is that michigan militia members are the furthest thing from  leftist  as you can get when the pro gun militia stands shoulder to shoulder with the producer of the anti gun documentary  bowling for columbine   you ve got the kind of problems not even two hundred pr firms can fix dave mckellar  a member of the genesee militia group  told the detroit free press that the group not only agrees with michael moore  but that they are trying to coordinate protests with the filmmaker  so that they do not stop to be clear  we re not saying that we think the militia should bring out their weapons and march through the streets of flint  to be clear  there hasn t been any indication that sunday s protest will be an armed protest still it is very significant that even far right groups like the volunteer militia  which have consistently voted for and defended michigan s republican tea party legislature  are now turning against the people they helped put in office image credit  screen capture genesee county volunteer militia
