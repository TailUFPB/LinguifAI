a tennessee republican has quit his job after he flipped out on a reporter who wanted to know why he was spending taxpayer money on lavish treats for himself ron buchanan  the gop election commission chair for davidson county had a run in with wsmv tv reporter alanna autler  last friday  the reporter asked him to explain a   dollar charge for a dinner in nashville last june  buchanan  clearly not happy that he was being called out for his spending said  that charge was for a business meeting to discuss the budget on june  when the budget was approved july  and it was a very legitimate purchase  autler asked him why he didn t go to a less expensive restaurant and he replied  that s it   and started to walk away  unperturbed by his briskness  the reporter asked about a large picture frame that was bought with the county credit card  can you explain the picture frame that was    this is when the republican got really pissed off and responded by calling her a vulgar name  that s it  that s exactly the b tch i thought you would be  autler asked him to repeat himself  you want to say that again  mr  buchanan   when she asks him that  a commission spokesperson gets in between the two   she asks  do not touch me  do you want to say that again for the camera  buchanan then storms into another room to get away from her  after the interview was aired the republican  apologized   but not really  i should not have used that terminology  but as the media has the freedom of press  individuals have the freedom of speech  and i can tell her what i think about her  and i did that  and i don t apologize for it  there are people that don t think i should have done it and that it hurts politics in this area  and so be it  the irresponsible  abusive man resigned shortly after and nashville mayor megan barry  d  has revoked the county credit card until an audit can be performed republicans pride themselves on their fictional  fiscal conservatism   so it s always amusing when they are exposed for the liars that they really are  this jackhole was so angry that he was called out for his exorbitant spending that he had an on camera temper tantrum  it reminds me of when congressional republicans complain about social programs while funneling trillions of dollars into the military industrial complex  it s obvious that the gop sucks at governing on every level watch the interview         gt
