a voting scandal has erupted in florida again  democrat vote ballot boxes were allegedly found at the bottom of a closet  after democrat voters were turned away from the polls first  it is alleged that democrat voters in the polk country district were being turned away from the polls by and informed them that the vote was for republican candidates only  theresa wibert told local media  the boss came over and said we could vote for republicans only  i couldn t believe it  i told them i wasn t leaving   it sure wasn t politically correct  there were also confirmed reports from a third voter in winter haven precinct also being turned away on the same false pretext  all three voted because they were clear on the schedule  they wondered how many people would have been disenfranchised by the move  we would have been turned away if we weren t forceful about it   wibert said polk county has since confirmed that the exchanges described by wibert did indeed take place  stating that it was simply a  mistake  that will not be repeated  according to polk county  no harm was done as wibert and her husband got to vote but although they voted  wibert spotted something later which makes her doubt that the ballots cast by democrats in her precinct ever made it to the count  as she told the ledger  we pushed it a little further and the lady called a few people  finally  she looked in the bottom of a closet and found a box with the democratic ballots  then they fixed it  so we were able to vote for our candidate  this means that we do not know how many democrat voters cast a vote for the gop in the absence of other candidates  or how many simply didn t vote at all  as wibert states  i think it s terrible  and i think people that aren t educated or don t know what s going on  might have just voted for whoever  it s suspect  as the state which made the  hanging chad  infamous after it s last voting scandal which lifted george w bush to the white house in   florida will have to work hard to reassure voters that this is not another attack on the democrats featured image via flickr creative commons
