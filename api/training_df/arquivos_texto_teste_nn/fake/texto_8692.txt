it s about time someone came out and said it directly  one of the moderators from the recent cnn debate  right wing talk radio host hugh hewitt  finally blurted it out during a segment on cnn  republicans don t care about facts or accuracy the rest of us have been aware of this problem for quite some time now  but it s nice to hear it articulated by one of the most prominent republican talkers from the conservative entertainment complex  gop voters  he said  aren t concerned with fact checking the candidates  all they care about is who managed to fire off the best zingers while chatting about the fox business debate and fireworks between candidates marco rubio and ted cruz  hewitt said hewitt  using my boxing analogy  in the  round  marco rubio laid one on ted cruz  but here s the deal about fact checkers  nick kristof  a terrific columnist for  the new york times   tweeted out that donald trump said  in fact  in his hearing that he wanted a  percent tariff  fact checking doesn t matter in these things  what matters is personality  an aura and your command presence  and of all those two  the best command presence last night was donald trump and marco rubio  and i keep marveling at how donald trump can dominate a television screen  he reaches through the screen sometimes  and you know  you re back on  celebrity apprentice   it s an amazing skill set so  basically  the republicans can say anything they want with impunity   just as long as they say it with a commanding presence  got it  well  this explains a lot  by the way  it s not entirely unique to the  race  either  mitt romney used this fact free strategy against president obama in   you might recall how romney more or less trampled obama during the first debate  but it was only   and i mean only   because romney blurted out any old nonsense that popped into his head  and he said it with authority  leaving obama somewhat confounded as to the best way to counterattack romney s fabricated gibberish knowing all this  and now that the cat is out of the bag  the next gop debate should be especially chaotic watch the video below via crooks   liars featured image via video screen grab
