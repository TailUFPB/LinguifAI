on tuesday  republican front runner donald trump made the horrendous mistake of dissing leading democratic candidate hillary clinton  saying that she was unqualified to be a candidate and that she only had the  woman s card to help her win over voters specifically  trump had said  the only thing she s got going is the woman s card  and the beautiful thing is  women don t like her   he also added that if clinton were a man  she would only get   percent of the vote   obviously  trump has forgotten about all of these qualifications and accomplishments clinton has worked for over the years  later that day  nbc host rachel maddow properly ripped trump for his comments  pointing out what an idiot he was for continuing his long history of misogynistic  sexist comments and pushing female voters even further away  maddow told co host brian williams  as our colleague and friend nicolle wallace pointed out earlier this evening  donald trump does have a general election problem  even if he gets this nomination  even if everything goes the way it has been for him during the primary as he heads toward the general election  he brings with him a big problem with women voters to say about the woman that you re running against that the only reason she s in the race is because she s a woman   that her achievement is basically the result of some sort of affirmative action  some favor being paid to her as a woman   and that as a human being she is patently unqualified when she is the former two term senator from new york and the former secretary of state and has the experience that she s had  i do think that even a lot of republican women will read that wrong  it s literally baffling and somewhat amusing to think that trump believes that female voters would connect with a sexist  misogynist candidate like himself  what trump may not realize is that women actually hate him way more than they dislike clinton  according to a survey by morning consult  a nonpartisan firm  only   of women view clinton unfavorably  compared to a whopping   for trump you can watch maddow blast trump below featured image via screen capture
