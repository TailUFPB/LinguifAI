no one is happier to see sarah palin back in the news than stephen colbert  following the former alaska governor s endorsement of donald trump for the republican nomination  colbert now has plenty of material to make fun of the woman he called  the original material girl  god i have missed you  it s like a magical eagle made a wish on a flag pin and it came to life   colbert said of palin s reappearance   which is great  for me   he said   because while trump  admittedly  has given me so much material to make jokes about  nobody compares to the original material girl  colbert played some of palin s so called  greatest hits   referring to bizarre statements palin made about  community organizer  obama   drill  baby  drill  and  we re gonna kick isis s ass   colbert said   sarah palin just guaranteed donald trump the evangelical vote  because i think she was speaking in tongues  while donald trump has been a frequent target of colbert  no one has come close to the original  material girl   palin was a primary target of colbert s during his  year run of his colbert report on comedy central there s truly lots to make fun of  it seems that palin has gone off the deep end lately more so than ever before  she even had the nerve to blame the president for her son s delinquency and her rambling speeches give a clear impression of someone that doesn t seem to have things together in any case  trump  who apparently is excited about palin s endorsement  said that he would have a position for her in his administration  possibly vice president  it all sounds quite frightening  but for now let s laugh at these two featured image via youtube screenshot
