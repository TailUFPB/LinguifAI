george bush s former cia director  michael hayden  has always had a very uncomfortable position on waterboarding  at times he seems to acknowledge that the technique which  as described by human rights groups  is best summed up as  simulated drowning   is inhumane and constitutes torture  he recently told donald trump  a yuge fan of waterboarding  if he wanted to reinstate the practice that he would have to  bring your own damn bucket  because the cia  wouldn t go down that road again   on the other hand  hayden s tenure as bush s cia head meant he oversaw extensive use of the technique on terror suspects  how do you square that round peg  stunning levels of cognitive dissonance  of course hayden was put on the hotseat in an interview with al jazeera  in which reporter mehdi hasan effortlessly walked through the former intelligence officer s walls of hypocrisy to get at the kernal of truth at the center  hayden isn t stupid  and he knows that waterboarding is torture how do you get a man who has spent the last seven years denying he did anything wrong to admit that he did  flip the question around and ask whether other people should be using waterboarding  hayden admits in that case it s  completely different  hayden  i m not giving an answer hasan  okay  if  president assad waterboards syrian rebels  you will not call that torture hayden  oh  that s completely different hasan  why  so if america does it it s fine  but if syria does it it s bad hayden starts getting very defensive  arguing that syria wouldn t waterboard safely  there s an oxymoron  and that when the cia does it  they do it the proper way  which he then describes  hasan isn t impressed  good point   hasan deadpans   series of near drownings  bubbles rising through open full mouth  that is not torture in your view  hayden concludes by saying the  legal opinion at the time  was no and that america had a right to use the method because they were careful  so for those keeping score at home  the logic is  america s use of waterboarding during the bush presidency was not torture  but any use of waterboarding by other nations or by a current or future american president is torture  spoken like a true member of the bush administration   it s never bad when we do it  was their unspoken motto         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt is waterboarding torture  do you think  is torture     mehdi hasan asks former cia director michael hayden  watch the full episode  aje io  by upfront on thursday  march    image via al jazeera screengrab
