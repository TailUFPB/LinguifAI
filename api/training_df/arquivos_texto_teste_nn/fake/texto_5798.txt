after the orlando massacre we ve once again seen republicans   led by donald trump   blame all muslims for the action of one person or group of people  they insist  while not citing any actual evidence  that muslims in america are not helping law enforcement to prevent terrorists in their midst  who are operating in their communities it isn t true  and now someone is speaking out  mohammed a  malik actually flagged orlando shooter omar mateen to the fbi  and after hearing trump slander him and fellow muslims  he s had enough in an essay for the washington post  malik told his story first hand donald trump believes american muslims are hiding something   they know what s going on  they know that  was bad   he said after the orlando massacre   they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad    but you know what  they didn t turn them in  and you know what  we had death and destruction  this is a common idea in the united states  it s also a lie  first  muslims like me can t see into the hearts of other worshipers   do you know the hidden depths of everyone in your community   second  trump is wrong that we don t speak up when we re able malik goes on to explain that after learning that mateen had been watching videos put out by terrorist propagandist anwar al awlaki   i contacted the fbi again to let them know that omar had been watching awlaki s tapes  he hadn t committed any acts of violence and wasn t planning any  as far as i knew  and i thought he probably wouldn t  because he didn t fit the profile  he already had a second wife and a son  but it was something agents should keep their eyes on  why did he do this i had told the fbi about omar because my community  and muslims generally  have nothing to hide  i love this country  like most muslims that i know  i don t agree with every government policy  i think there s too much money in politics  for instance   but i m proud to be an american he concludes with a direct message for the republican nominee for president of the united states   trump s assertions about our community   that we have the ability to help our country but have simply declined to do so   are tragic  ugly and wrong  featured image via flickr
