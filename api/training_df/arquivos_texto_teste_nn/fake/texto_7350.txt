president obama s response to the attacks on belgium were dignified and hopeful  and it was exactly the opposite of the divisive and racist rhetoric of donald trump and ted cruz  who took turns describing the frightening things they would do to muslims if one of them is elected president  at a baseball game in cuba  the president said  it s always a challenge when you have a terrorist attack anywhere in the world  particularly in this age of   news coverage  you want to be respectful and understand the gravity of the situation  but the whole premise of terrorism is to try to disrupt people s ordinary lives and one of my most powerful memories and one of my proudest moments as president was when i watched boston respond after the marathon  unlike the president  ted cruz s response was venomous and hateful and he had a sickening new plan  calling for muslim neighborhoods to be under police watch  he said  we need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al qaida or isis presence  we need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized  we need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration  and we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy isis  then of course there is the crazy donald trump  instead of sending condolences and creating unity  here s what he had to say  i ve been talking about this for a long time  brussels was a beautiful place  zero crime  and now it s a disaster city  it s a total disaster and we have to be very careful  as to who we allow into this country  as usual  nothing but opportunistic republican politicians looking to cash in on a tragedy  but the president s words resonated hope  he continued by saying  they cannot defeat america  they don t produce anything  they don t have a message that appeals to the vast majority of muslims or the vast majority of people around the world  what they can do is scare and make people afraid and disrupt our daily lives and divide us and as long as we don t allow that to happen  we re gonna be okay  cruz and trump are clearly falling into the trap of what terror is designed to do   let s hope they don t succeed because if they do  that means that terror has succeeded watch video here  featured image via wikimedia commons
