life is hard  we get it  every one of us has had a tough time for one reason or another  however  trump fans seem to want us to believe that the world is especially cruel to them just because they re trump fans  while they make a point about how stereotyping is bad  they made the choice to support a racist  sexist  narcissistic prick  even if they don t see themselves that way that s literally what they re saying in this video  posted to the new york post s website  one woman says  i think that we are portrayed as the same things as donald trump  racist   we don t like people coming into this country who aren t the same race as us  that s not the case at all  and a man says  you always have to be fearful  like the stasi is going to come and grab you because you re a trump supporter  oh  well  gee  pardon us  and really  the stasi  come on  it s kind of hard not to see trumpkins this way when many of his biggest policy positions are blatantly racist  and will harm pretty much everyone who isn t straight  white  and cisgender while one man said   please  sit down  let s have a rational conversation   the problem there is not trump s supporters  per se  it s trump himself and his supporters by proxy  trump is not rational  so having a rational conversation about him is useless  yes  it s true that one can support a candidate without having to agree with every single position that candidate has  however  when something is a huge part of what they stand for  it s almost impossible to separate the supporters from their candidate watch the video below when you look at the people who attend trump s rallies  it likewise gets more difficult not to lump them all in together as racist  hateful bigots  so  to these particular supporters who don t want to be seen this way  how about you people start really pressing your candidate  and the republican party  a lot harder to get him to tone it down until you do  our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for a plight of your own choosing featured image via screen capture from embedded video
