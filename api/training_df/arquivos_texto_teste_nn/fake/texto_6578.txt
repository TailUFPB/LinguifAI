donald trump can barely go a day without saying or doing something truly offensive to women  further pushing away women voters  as he has been successfully doing during his entire campaign   trump decided to make light of sexual abuse over the weekend by comparing the united states  relationship with china to rape trump made these misogynistic comments at a rally on sunday  where he said  we can t continue to allow china to rape our country  and that s what they re doing  it s the greatest theft in the history of the world  hardly an appropriate comparison  the  rape  trump is talking about is the trade deficit between the two countries   and anyone could agree that a sexually violent act is a truly disgusting way to describe an economic relationship between nations  nearly as soon as trump spewed those shameful  disrespectful words  he began receiving massive backlash from advocates against sexual violence sen  barbara boxer  d calif    who has been heavily involved in addressing rape on college campuses and introduced the international violence against women act  was one of the first to shut the republican frontrunner down  she said  when you use a violent and heinous crime like rape as a metaphor  it is an affront to all sexual assault survivors  donald trump should find another way to express himself  colleen daly  a spokeswoman for the group end rape on campus  added  using the word  rape  to describe anything other than sexual violence trivializes the experience of survivors  the statement perpetuates our cultural indifference to rape and desensitizes us to all forms of sexual violence  in just one sentence  trump has disrespected   people   that s roughly how many people are sexually assaulted in the united states every year  this isn t even the first time trump has been completely insensitive about rape  trump has previously been accused of raping his ex wife ivana  and his lawyer defended the donald by making the despicable and completely false argument that you cannot rape your spouse   the truth is that over half of all women that report being raped say that their partner was the perpetrator   and trump and his lawyer single handedly tried to invalidate that reality you can watch trump make his disgusting  rape  comments below it s no secret that trump  with his long history of being a misogynist and disrespecting women  is having trouble winning over women voters  if his sexist comments about democratic frontrunner hillary clinton  playing the woman card  didn t turn more female voters away  his comments about rape surely will  rep  jan schakowsky  d ill   pointed out trump s problem with women perfectly  whether it s attacking women or minorities his vulgar remarks have no place in our political discourse  women are watching and they don t like what they see  hopefully women will continue to show trump that misogyny will not be tolerated by refusing to vote for him featured image via joe raedle   getty images
