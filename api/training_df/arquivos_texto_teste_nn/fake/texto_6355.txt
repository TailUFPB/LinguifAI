the mere fact that donald trump is the presumptive nominee for president of the united states is quite comical in of itself   not only because it s donald trump  but alsobecause he s been able to basically destroy the republican party  how much more damage can the billionaire demagogue possibly do  well  plenty if you count the people and more specifically that one person he has on his short list for vice president  the king of the disintegrating republican party may anoint a queen  that s right folks  sarah palin is on the short list of candidates for trump s vice president according to the washington post  ben carson  who is now the head of trump s vice presidential search committee  was driving on his way to a television interview when he accidentally revealed the list to a reporter who was riding in his car  the list included sarah palin after the mellow and weird doctor told the reporter that he would not behave in the same way as dick cheney when cheney headed bush s vice presidential search committee but nominated himself  carson s wife  candy  pointed out that a poll had carson as the top choice to be trump s running mate  carson was told that john kasich  marco rubio  ted cruz  sarah palin  and chris christie had also been named in the poll that s when he revealed the names   those are all people on our list   carson said   well  not you   his wife said it sure would be hilarious to watch yet another trump victim start working for trump  ben carson  who prior to his gop run was a respected doctor and human being  was compared to a child molester by trump but is now his defender on every news station imaginable  chris christie  who was also obliterated by trump became his lackey  who could forget the time when christie stood stone faced behind trump like a deer caught in headlights  then of course there s ted cruz  or as trump referred to him   lyin ted   who was dragged through the mud by trump  we also can t forget  little marco  rubio  the golden boy of the republican party  but who was also humiliated by trump however  the match made in heaven or should i say hell would be a trump palin ticket  the hope is she ll help bring trump down in the same way she helped bring down john mccain  it would be quite a surprise for trump to pick palin but with these republicans  you just never know update  donald trump released a tweet disavowing carson s list  despite carson at one time being assigned to help pick the vp   saying  most  of the names on the list are wrong and specifically marco rubio the  washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong  marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    image via wikimedia commons
