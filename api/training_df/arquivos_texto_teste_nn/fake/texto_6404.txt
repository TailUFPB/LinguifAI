donald trump s son eric recently claimed that the hispanic population is basically fawning over his father and counting down the days until trump moves into the white house earlier this week  eric appeared on irish radio s rte  s drivetime to spew false information about one of the groups of people that trump has insulted and offended the most  spreading lies about hispanic people approaching him to tell him just how badly they want his father to be the next president of the united states  the younger trump said  people often talk about hispanics  you know  i have more hispanics come up to me telling me   listen  i can t wait for your father to be president  he s going to bring jobs back to the united states  he s going to end the nonsense  he s going to create good trade deals  he s going to create better education  he s going to create a better family structure  eric also assured listeners that they can t believe everything they see on tv  despite what the news is reporting  eric insists that hispanics are overwhelmingly supportive of the donald  i see so little of the divisiveness  which is interesting  you watch it on tv  but you see so little of it out in the field  you can listen to this idiotic interview below i m not sure what world eric is living in  but it can t be this one  according to current surveys  trump has basically no chance with hispanics   a poll by america s voice and latino decisions discovered that   of hispanics do not like trump  and who could blame them  trump is the candidate that kicked off his presidential campaign with one of the most racist statements ever made when he claimed that mexico was sending  people that have lots of problems    they re bringing drugs  they re bringing crime  they re rapists  and some  i assume  are good people  and that was just the beginning  since then  trump has made several more outrageous  anti latino statements  threatened to deport all immigrants in the country illegally  and even p ssed off mexico s most prominent leaders with his ridiculous border wall comments  trump s made it perfectly clear that he has extreme prejudices against hispanics and all of his words and actions back this up  eric should probably spend some time educating himself  because more hispanics than ever have registered to vote in this election   so they can vote against trump  republican media consultant lionel sosa explained this phenomenon perfectly when he said  when you take a whole group of people and you call them murderers and rapists  it s a personal affront  sure  they are going to register  and it s going to be an anti trump vote  sorry eric  but daddy can t fix this featured image via ethan miller   getty images
