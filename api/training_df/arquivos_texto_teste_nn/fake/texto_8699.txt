donald trump continued to unload on rival ted cruz as the reality star once again went on the attack on sunday appearing on abc s this week  trump talked about just how unlikeable cruz is  nobody likes him  nobody in congress likes him  nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him   trump said in an interview airing on abc s  this week  trump also hit cruz over his secret dark money loan that he secured from goldman sachs in order to win his senate race  cruz failed to disclose the loan on forms submitted to the federal elections commission  he wants to look like robin hood   trump said   that he s the one protecting the people from the banks  while he s actually borrowing money and personally guaranteeing it and not disclosing it  which is illegal  for months trump and cruz refused to directly attack each other  preferring to aim their arrows at other republicans like jeb bush and marco rubio  but now as cruz has started nipping at trump s heels in iowa polls  the front runner has begun to give cruz the business for his part  cruz has also fired back  he accused trump of having  new york values  a phrase that some have seen as a dog whistle to base republican voters about new york s more diverse culture with is large population of jewish people  gays  and minorities trump responded by pointing out that  new york values  are what terrorists targeted on    to add insult to injury  trump received praise for those comments from both hillary clinton  who was new york s senator at the time  and current new york city mayor bill de blasio additionally  trump has been concern trolling cruz about his eligibility for the presidency  citing the fact that cruz was born in canada  trump has been egging on cruz to defend himself against possible challenges to his candidacy if he s the nominee  trump has been a long time promoter of the conspiracy theory that president obama was not born in the united states over the course of the race  trump has shown a propensity to dig in and go nuclear in his attacks on anyone who directly challenges him  and this latest salvo directed at cruz seems to signal that the next two weeks ahead of the caucus could be immensely entertaining featured image via youtube
