former ku klux klan leader david duke is so enthralled with donald trump that he s been inspired to run for the senate  but the republican party supposedly isn t having it  gop chairman reince preibus finally said something about it  which  in and of itself is weird because duke announced this a day ago this is ridiculous on its face because priebus chairs the party that nominated donald trump  and donald trump attracts white supremacists like iron filings to a rare earth magnet  priebus might think he s telling the world that the gop isn t made up of a bunch of bigoted hypocrites  but the internet sees right through him  they raked priebus over coals so hot that  if satan were real  he d be insane with jealousy         indeed  priebus is quite proud of the gop s decision to nominate trump  as evidenced by posts on his official facebook page  it s only a little over the top  given how he allegedly feels about racists who spread their hate like david duke while trump does denounce white supremacists to appease the press  he s always retweeting them  also  richard spencer  a prominent white supremacist  pointed out that trump must think like them  because otherwise they wouldn t be so drawn to him  they see something in his rhetoric to which the gop s leaders have turned a completely blind eye priebus doesn t know this  hard to believe  he s as transparent as clear mountain air  the gop is officially the party of white supremacists  and his token repudiation of david duke is way too little  way too late featured image via win mcnamee getty images
