sean hannity is definitely going to blow a gasket about this in recent weeks  major mainstream media outlets have been slamming the fox news host for pushing lie after lie after lie in his effort to get donald trump elected in november first  jon stewart came out of retirement for one night to slam hannity so hard for being a hypocrite when it comes to the way he has treated trump versus the shitty way he has treated president obama that the conservative host could hardly stammer his way through an angry response to the comedian the next day and then hannity threw a hissy fit after wall street journal foreign affairs columnist bret stephens called him  fox news  dumbest anchor  for attacking republican leaders for not blindly supporting trump no matter what he does then cnn host brian stelter took hannity to the woodshed for helping trump claim that the election is rigged for hillary clinton and if that weren t enough  the washington post also dealt hannity a major rebuke for lying about trump rescuing stranded marines after the gulf war came to a close now hannity just got his ass handed to him by newsweek over his constant stream of lies and the fact that he insulted people with epilepsy by questioning hillary clinton s health kurt eichenwald absolutely destroyed hannity in a published column and it s clear that he just smacked hannity in the face with a gauntlet  hard a man who purports to be a dutiful catholic  hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment  or eighth in his faith  against lying about others  if hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods  his program would be nothing but a test pattern  from him and the others in the  who cares if it s false   conservative media camp  we have heard over the decades that hillary and bill clinton murdered many people  that the bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in iraq  that obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law  and on and on they are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared  foolish people eichenwald then took hannity to task for telling his audience that hillary may have had a seizure in a video which shows clinton  being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once  clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll  smiling and then speaking after the joke was over  but hannity characterized clinton s playfulness as a serious medical condition  which eichenwald did not appreciate i know this response to sean hannity is a little raw  but as someone with epilepsy  i hope my editors will let this slip through  fuck you  sean  your willingness to deceive your viewers to degrade those of us with epilepsy  to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one  to leave people dumber about this condition is unforgivable it is rare for a mainstream journalist to use such strong language  but hannity certainly deserved it  and that was only the beginning eichenwald went on to talk about what a real seizure is  explaining  people do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence  there s no smiling because  if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness  the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying  after a seizure  someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation  making jokes  eichenwald then delivered the final blow while i know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air  this sin requires some penance  it can be done in secret if you don t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret  write a check  make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged if you are unable to show the backbone to undo the damage you have done  you can understand why i say you  purport  to be a catholic  if you really were one  you d be worried about burning in hell for what you ve done thus far  sean hannity has not responded nor has he thrown a temper tantrum over eichenwald basically putting him over his knee and giving his an ass whipping  but you can bet one will probably happen soon as hannity has a thin skin just like donald trump featured image  screenshot
