ted cruz just keeps on embarrassing himself during the gop debate on thursday night  the texas senator set himself up to be exposed and humiliated by republican front runner donald trump the whole thing happened in under a minute as cruz began talking about just how much he opposed ethanol in iowa  when i went to iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates  everyone said that was political suicide   cruz claimed  you can t take on ethanol in iowa  and my opponents on this stage not only didn t do the same  they attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare  if we re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids  you ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists patiently waiting to go in for the kill  trump responded by reminding the audience that ted cruz actually flip flopped on that particular issue in iowa because as bloomberg reported at the time  ethanol is  the third rail of iowa politics  across party and socioeconomic lines  indeed  that meant cruz had to say anything to win  even if it meant throwing his support behind ethanol production  because if he didn t  he d be telling   iowans that he opposes them having a job  cruz even wrote an op ed whining about how his opponents have slammed his anti ethanol views and he lied to iowa farmers to their faces by claiming he was fighting for them  by this point in the campaign  many readers will have seen the furious coordinated effort being waged by democrats and big money lobbyists  who are together spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to convince iowans that i oppose ethanol  their charges are utter nonsense  however  those farmers didn t mean much to cruz last night as he bragged about how he opposed ethanol in iowa and trump quickly called him out for lying  if you look back to iowa  ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit  he did and   at the end  not full on  but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well  and you know  i think everybody knows that  it was a front page story all over the place  and he did make a change  when the debate moderator asked cruz to respond  the caught red handed liar could only throw up his hands and dive into a canned line about how he ll stand up against washington  listen  if you are fed up with washington  the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on washington  here s the video via daily motion  rubio cuba by tommyxtopheronce again  ted cruz gets humiliated by being caught lying on the debate stage  clearly he has no shame featured image  flickr
