for decades  it seemed  when the nation imagined a president  they imagined martin sheen  it s no wonder  he was once cast as john f  kennedy  he starred in the american president and he spent seven years as the cerebral president jeb bartlett in the west wing in real life  sheen has never served in office  but he is a political activist  he s a clinton supporter and he has strong and brutal opinions about donald trump sheen was interviewed about trump in the hollywood reporter  when asked about trump  sheen said oh  don trump  he makes me laugh  in that nobody seems to get it yet that he s an empty headed moron  that he has absolutely nothing to offer us  that he s done his bidding and he has to be responsible for the damage he s already done  empty headed moron  is perhaps the best description of trump ever  it paints him as a man who doesn t deserve to be taken seriously  yet somehow is the hollywood reporter countered that trump is just a private citizen that he can t have yet done damage oh  come on  there s nothing private about this guy  don trump has been around for a very long time  he s a very self centered promoter  i think that says it he also called the billionaire  scary  asked about clinton  he said he was a supporter and all the talk of benghazi and emails doesn t faze him at all she has some common sense  i m not saying she s mistake free  who is  i mean  she s a human being  she s been in public life for  years  she s made a few mistakes  is anybody talking about george bush and the   emails he destroyed about the weapons of mass destruction in iraq and all of that nonsense  and how great britain came in  and all the other allies knowing full well that it was bogus  so  please  if you want to talk about how much her mistakes have cost us  none in human lives   and please don t mention benghazi  that s a lot of crap  she was not controlling that situation  it was a military situation  and that s run by the pentagon or the cia or both  she s under orders he also called benghazi  terrorism  plain and simple  terrorism  sadly  the interview was done before trump appeared to summon his supporters to assassinate clinton  it s not hard to imagine that sheen would have had even stronger words than  moron  and  dangerous  featured image via andrew burton at getty images
