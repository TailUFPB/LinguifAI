throughout his presidency  president obama has dedicated himself to exploring policies with the goal of making life better for working americans and making sure they are fairly compensated for their time and effort unfortunately  the gop has become a major obstacle for the president ever since he stepped foot in the white house  after a republican congress made it perfectly clear that they won t even consider a minimum wage increase  the obama administration was forced to seek out another alternative   and it s finally going to pay off  thanks to obama s overhaul on overtime pay   which doubles the salary level that workers must be paid overtime  millions of americans are going to have more money in their pockets  this is major news  because this law hasn t been changed in over ten years when obama first mentioned that he wanted to revamp overtime pay  hardly anyone took him seriously  at his state of the union address last year  the president said   we still need to make sure employees get the overtime they ve earned   then  he unveiled a proposal to raise the income thresholds for those who would be eligible for overtime  it still seemed like faraway goal  until yesterday when the labor department finalized those new rules   an initiative that the huffington post called  one of the most ambitious economic reforms of the obama era  vice president joe biden announced the decision on tuesday  stating that middle class workers have  been getting clobbered  for decades  biden said  the american people want to work  they want a fair shot  no handouts  no guarantees  just a good job at a fair wage  under the new rules  all workers earning salaries under the overtime salary threshold are entitled to time and a half pay when they work over  hours per week   which many do  the previous threshold was only      making millions of struggling  hard working americans ineligible  but thanks to the obama administration  that number will be doubled to     which guarantees overtime rights for any salaried workers earning underneath that number  before this was changed  only   of americans were eligible for overtime  and it gets better   the threshold will be updated by the labor department every three years to make sure that it keeps up with inflation  the huffington post reported featured image via pool   getty images
