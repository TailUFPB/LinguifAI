with the presidential race narrowing down to donald trump versus either hillary clinton or bernie sanders  the news has been pretty slow  and it leaves people to report on things like  enthusiasm  and how one candidate may beat another candidate during a segment that was focused on hillary hoping to  shatter trump s populist appeal   cnn chose to use twitter to try to prove how popular trump has been  so they featured one of his tweets explaining one of his recent rallies the screen capture cnn chose to use featured a trump tweet that said  great rally in new mexico  amazing crowd  now in l a  big rally in anaheim  however  what cnn didn t do was check to see what else was in the screen capture  because if they had  they probably wouldn t have used it  the first reply listed under trump s tweet stated  does your c ck match your skin color  like  is it orange  here s the image that was taken and has been circulating on facebook image via cnnoops  looks like they didn t quite crop that image as well as they should and no one apparently caught it before it went to air  although  the question in the reply is still a valid one  but one not exactly appropriate for cnn s viewing audience nonetheless  this error is frickin  hilarious for the rest of us  so  cnn  never stop being you featured image via cnn
