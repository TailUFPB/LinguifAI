donald trump is a flaming racist  and he has made no secret of that  after all  he has a history of calling mexican immigrants rapists  of calling for a ban on all muslims entering the united states  and of telling his imbecile supporters to beat up black protesters  well  if all of that wasn t enough to convince you of the racism of the trump campaign and of the man himself  this ought to be donald trump took his hate parade of a campaign to south carolina   to clemson university  to be precise  a professor at the historic south carolina university  chenjerai kumanyika was at the rally with his friend  a d  carson  they listened  first  to  amazingly  gospel television preacher mark burris give a prayer speech  which included the words  father god  in the name of jesus  we re truly thankful for the life of donald j  trump  we re thankful that you have created a man through the spirit of the holy spirit to give him the boldness to say what other people will not say  to do what other people will not do after that  kumanyika and carson stood listening to the events of the evening  when they were approached by police officers who told them they had to leave  there was no apparent reason for this  so kumanyika asked why they were being tossed out   i m leaving  i m not arguing with you   he said   i just want to know why  once they had exited the event  one cop was kind enough to tell the men why they had been thrown out  the trump campaign or the trump people said that you are no longer welcome  yes  you read that right  the campaign simply said that they were not welcome there  no explanation for that  as they were not protesting or causing a ruckus  just standing there  the professor said of the incident  i stood peacefully observing trump s speech  i remained quiet and calm the entire time i was there and never spoke to anyone other than a d  eventually  several police officers dressed in military gear grabbed my arm and told me to leave the venue immediately  again  no protests  just observing like everyone else there  the difference  they re black  that s the only conceivable reason luckily  the entire exchange was caught on camera and posted to social media  take a look below         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt  the trump campaign said you are no longer welcome here earlier tonight  a d  carson and i were kicked out of a trump rally in clemson south carolinaposted by chenjerai kumanyika on wednesday  february    image via video screen capture
