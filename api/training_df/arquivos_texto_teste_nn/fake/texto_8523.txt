a grand jury in texas realized who the real criminals are  and fox news isn t happy about it on monday  a houston grand jury chose to indict two anti abortion activists from the right wing group center for medical progress  cmp  for their involvement in an investigation of planned parenthood that led to the release of repeatedly debunked videos the cmp secretly filmed while posing as employees of the women s health organization the videos allegedly show planned parenthood employees selling fetal body parts when in reality they were only discussing reimbursement of transportation costs to get the cells to researchers  planned parenthood wasn t actually selling  baby parts  at all despite that  texas republicans ordered a court to indict the women s health organization  instead the grand jury slapped cmp boss david daleiden and cmp employee sandra merritt with their own indictment  charging them with tampering with government documents and trying to purchase organs illegally  both of which are felonies  the cmp employees also used fake ids to infiltrate planned parenthood thus far  planned parenthood has been cleared of any wrongdoing by a congressional investigation as well as several state investigations but that didn t stop fox legal analyst andrew napolitano from throwing a temper tantrum about the indictment during an appearance on fox   friends on tuesday  the former judge weighed in without having seen the actual indictment itself  claiming that the grand jury indicted the wrong people and were somehow led astray by the prosecuting attorney the cmp employees  he said  should be considered  bona fide journalists  running a legitimate investigation  even though they aren t journalists at all  they re really seriously pro life people wanting to expose how government dollars are being used by planned parenthood   napolitano said   the tapes came out  there s a big uproar  he then accused planned parenthood of  using tax dollars to kill babies and sell their body parts   even though such use of funds are prevented by the hyde amendment  furthermore  abortion services only amount to  percent of the services planned parenthood provides and it has already been established by legal and medical experts that planned parenthood was not doing anything wrong in the tapes napolitano also made some rather serious accusations against harris county district attorney devon anderson  suggesting that she turned the jury against cmp instead of getting the jury to automatically indict planned parenthood regardless of the evidence or lack thereof like a real republican is supposed to do  the grand jury does not turn around and indict your witnesses  the people who brought you the case  without the prosecutor wanting this to happen  so  why would this prosecutor  appointed by governor perry  a former judge  a republican woman  why would this prosecutor want to do this other than to send a message like   i might be a republican but leave planned parenthood alone   in the end  napolitano called the indictment  a political hit job  while continuing to defend daleiden and merritt as journalists who did nothing wrong since the government  uses the same techniques  for catching criminals all the time here s the video via youtube clearly  napolitano has lost his damn mind and demonstrates why he shouldn t have ever been allowed to be a judge in the first place  these cmp employees do not work for the government nor are they employed by a media organization  they are activists who forged government documents and tried to buy fetal body parts that planned parenthood was never actually trying to sell  therefore  cmp broke the law  not planned parenthood  in addition  just because the prosecuting attorney is a republican  it doesn t mean planned parenthood isn t entitled to a fair investigation  napolitano is whining because he thinks there should have been an automatic indictment just because the attorney is republican and the investigation took place in texas  in fact  it took place in the very city cmp conducted the sting operation  the true political hit job would have been if napolitano had his way however  the bottom line is that the grand jury did their job based on the evidence presented to them and they chose to indict cmp and exonerate planned parenthood  the legal system worked despite how much napolitano and other conservatives want it to be rigged featured image via fox news screenshot
