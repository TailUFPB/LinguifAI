abdelhamid abaaoud  the planner of the terrorist attacks that hit paris on november     was killed after a raid led by french authorities who stormed an apartment in the town of saint denis  it has now been revealed that police found abaaoud in part thanks to information given to them by a muslim woman she has now revealed her faith because she wants the world to know the following but until now  the public has been unaware that the critical tip in the hunt for abaaoud came from a muslim   one of millions who now face a backlash in europe fueled by anger over the attacks in paris and brussels  as well as fear and resentment of a rising tide of refugees  it s important the world knows that i am muslim myself   the woman said  citing that as a reason for being willing to speak to the post   it s important to me that people know what abaaoud and the others did is not what islam is teaching  too often after terrorist incidents  people   particularly conservatives   act as if islam is the only faith that extremists use as justification for mass murder  ignoring the history of other faiths  including christianity  being perverted when terrorists have hit america the hardest  their attacks did not discriminate by faith  in fact  one estimate says that  muslims were killed in the   attacks ironically  even though his administration declared war on iraq  it was president george w  bush who often went to great lengths to point out there was a distinction between those who practice peaceful islam  and the terrorist hijackers  and that sentiment has continued with president obama  who pointed out that when discussing americans and those with islamic faith  it s  not them or us  it s just us  this woman s example shows that blanket condemnations of muslims  as agitators like donald trump have engaged in  are backwards and just flat out incorrect featured image via youtube
