it gets creepier and creepier with ted cruz  this time  he took ben carson  who s not exactly the model presidential candidate either  along for the ride as the two held a secret meeting in   yes   a storage closet the strange meeting was called for by ted cruz ahead of the conservative review convention thursday  in order to mend fences with carson and improve his image ahead of the south carolina primary  the two cuddled in the closet for more than  minutes as secret service agents stood outside carson has spent weeks attacking cruz for spreading false rumors that carson had dropped out of the presidential race during the iowa caucuses  cruz won iowa but not before unleashing a storm over his questionable antics  which have not only eroded his already creepy reputation but have seen him dip in polls after a strong iowa showing carson s campaign confirmed that carson had agreed to meet cruz but blamed the leak about the meeting on cruz and his campaign  they accused the cruz campaign of leaking the meeting in order to give the impression there were no longer any hard feelings between the two candidates  should carson be surprised at cruz s sleaziness at this point the meeting  which took place in a storage closet next to a bathroom ended with carson saying  we agree to disagree  we disagree on accountability and culpability  in a sign that the meeting was leaked before it actually happened  reporters were already calling the carson campaign as the two met   it lasted for more than the five minutes carson originally agreed to and carson s people had to knock on the door to get him out because he was about to speak  according to a republican operative  the meeting did not go like cruz had planned  there was a political play there and it didn t work for them  the meeting didn t go as well as cruz wanted it to go  carson had a smile on his face and was looking right at him  there s no doubt that cruz s lies are catching up to him  and it s only a matter of time before he ll drop out of the race and his run will be in the dustbin of history  featured image from wikimedia commons
