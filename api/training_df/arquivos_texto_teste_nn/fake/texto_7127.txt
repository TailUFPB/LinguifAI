donald trump has once again decided to lie to his supporters and accuse a major news network of editing his words to explain away his abortion views last week  trump took five different stances on abortion  first  he said women who have them should be punished  then he said it should be left up to the states  after that  he changed his mind again and  clarified  his original statement by saying doctors who perform abortions should be punished  his fourth position came when he gave an interview for cbs s face the nation and claimed that he wouldn t do anything to change abortion laws because the supreme court has already decided on their legality with roe v wade when the media said  wait a second trump just took a pro choice stance on abortion by declaring it should remain legal   his campaign put out a statement saying he would  in fact  try to outlaw it with judicial appointments   taking his fifth abortion position of the week well  on saturday while speaking at a rally in racine  wisconsin  the republican frontrunner implied that cbs edited words out of his statement in an attempt to smear him  according to cnn  they can take something you say and turn it around  like i will be on cbs s  face the nation   what i said was perfect   trump explained  adding   what i said was so good  it was so perfect  and they looked and said   oh  maybe he should have added a word   well  actually the way it came out  they took words out that i said   he added   the only reason i tell you this is because i want you to watch it  if i did something wrong  i wouldn t want you to watch it  clearly  his words were not as  perfect  as he thought since he now feels the need to explain them away by lying to his supporters  he went on to say that the media often edits his words  the problem is they don t do it with everybody  they do it with me  but i don t see them doing it with other people  wow  it s pretty convenient that the media only edits him  don t you think cnn apparently reached out to cbs for comment and a spokeswoman said  nothing in that section he reference was edited   that s exactly the same response that msnbc had last week when trump accused them of the very same thing it is amazing that this guy can literally lie all the time and his supporters don t care at all  it s even funnier when these same supporters turn around and call president obama a liar  it s almost as if they live in an alternate reality  isn t it featured image via ian macnicol getty images
