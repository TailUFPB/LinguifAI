the residents of flint  michigan have been poisoned  some irrevocably  by a long  intentional brutalization brought about by republican governance  even after the extent of this act of terror was made apparent in the national media  forcing republicans to cower and scurry in fear  residents are still being forced by these same legislators to pay the highest water rates in the entire country while they continue to be forced to use poisoned water via detroit free pressthere is a person  though  that is getting clean water virtually for free at a rate of over a quarter million gallons per day who is this person you ask  it s the nestle corporation  remember how they are now people too  nestle is pumping  gallons per minute of clean water from aquifers that feed lake michigan under a permit granted by the state in the early  s  what s even more grossly offensive is what nestle pays   or rather doesn t pay   for this privilege  they don t pay anything for the actual extraction of water  they pay a   permitting fee to the state and lease a portion of land from a private landowner for housing their facility  it gets even better  though  because not only do they get this sweetheart deal   they re also given   million in tax breaks and giveaways by the state for deigning mescota county worthy of their corporate benevolence by  creating jobs  with their facility not only do state republicans force an average resident of flint michigan to pay nearly   a year for poisonous water  but they give away clean water for free so that a corporation can sell it back to the people they took it from for a huge profit  in an entire year  nestle pays approximately   dollars per gallon of water that they then resell for millions of dollars in free profits on top of the millions of dollars they don t pay in taxes nestle s spokesperson in michigan is deborah muchmore  she is the wife of dennis muchmore  who was the chief of staff for the lead poisoning terrorist michigan governor  rick snyder  dennis recently retired from snyder s office in order to become a lobbyist  i am sure that michigan republicans will find some of the billions in yearly profits from nestle in their re election campaigns soon  rather than having money diverted to alleviate the suffering of the people of flint featured image via flickr
