by now you have all heard that republican candidate ted cruz is absolutely loathed by the people he attended college with   including his former roommate  craig mazin  a screenwriter who worked on films like scary movie      has an entire twitter page dedicated to how much he hates ted  it literally it goes back years  on saturday night  cruz s former roommate stepped up his trolling game and leveled attacks against all of the gop candidates here s a sample of his trolling ted is listening to carson and thinking   what is this road  it is not a low road  it is a  high road  do not understand   craig mazin   clmazin  february    uhhh  someone played the same tape in rubio s head   craig mazin   clmazin  february    it s cuz i m from jersey  but i enjoy christie s swagger   craig mazin   clmazin  february    okay  christie  too much jersey  declare victory and pull out   craig mazin   clmazin  february    am enjoying president cruz  plan to build a time machine and undo nk s missile plan   craig mazin   clmazin  february    jeb ate his wheaties this morning   craig mazin   clmazin  february    moderators know that carson is still on the stage  right  does carson know he s still on the stage   craig mazin   clmazin  february     i will deport them by forcing them to listen to my voice  they will flee that very night   craig mazin   clmazin  february    responds to  maybe you have no heart  with a heartless  calculated chuckle   craig mazin   clmazin  february    this is amazing  trump is attacking the crowd  it s almost admirable   craig mazin   clmazin  february    is my new hero  he was absolutely hilarious  and he was spot on so many times  the new hampshire debate was filled with so much bullsh t it was hard to wade through it all  i literally screamed at my television several times  and at least twice it was cruz who turned me into a demon  in one statement  the iowa caucus winner told the crowd that he did not believe that waterboarding fit the definition of torture  seriously  he doesn t believe that putting a mask on someone and pouring water on their face to simulate drowning is torture  he doesn t believe that making someone think they are going to die over and over and over again is wrong  i guess that means he d be totally cool with a foreign government doing it to our citizens then  the second thing he said that really pissed me off was when he brought up his sister dying of a drug overdose  wait  no  i m sorry his  half sister  who died of a drug overdose  you see  he began his monologue about her horrible death by referring to her as his  sister   but then he quickly corrected himself and made sure everyone knew that they had different mothers  so  he was exploiting her death  but also trying to distance himself from it  pretty f cking despicable  the rest of the candidates had the same kind of night  unlike the other yellfests you could almost feel the desperation of candidates like ben carson and jeb bush who failed so miserably in iowa  no matter how bad it was  though  craig mazin definitely provided us with some much needed comedic relief  i hope he shows up for the next debate  featured image via twitter flickr
