the gop convention is drawing all sorts  including nutbags like this one on youtube  it s also drawing those who believe the gop s policies are a major departure from what this country was supposed to be  despite all their claims that they want us to be exactly that  because of that  the freedom from religion foundation has a billboard up near their venue with a quote from none other than st  reagan himself  and conservatives will absolutely despise it this is the billboard below ffrf quotes reagan in cleveland message to gop convention  https   t co mikpbehtqv pic twitter com   ffrf   ffrf  june    point is clear  keep church and state separate over the last couple of decades  republicans have worked hard to entangle civil law with biblical law  and they hope to keep us from knowing the difference  pea brains like ted cruz  rand paul  james inhofe  and more allow their religions to have a stranglehold on their policy decisions  the gop itself has taken the establishment clause to mean that christians should be free to do whatever they want to whomever they want  but all other religions need to put up with being restricted  and shut up altogether the ffrf has been working to keep church and state separate since   and this billboard is a brilliant idea because it takes a quote from one of the gop s own idols and turns it back on them  some places  like the blaze  have already claimed that the quote is taken out of context  which is nonsense  the full quote is  our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism  we establish no religion in this country  we command no worship  we mandate no belief  nor will we ever  church and state are  and must remain  separate  all are free to believe or not believe  all are free to practice a faith or not  and those who believe are free  and should be free  to speak of and act on their belief  that s in no way taken out of context  instead  it s basically a summary of what reagan was saying  furthermore  reagan s own son  ron reagan jr   is on the honorary board of distinguished thinkers at the ffrf  and is an atheist who isn t afraid to burn in hell  there s little question he supports this display it s actually the hateful  judgmental  narrow minded  christians  of the religious right who don t want to follow the constitution  and they re dragging the gop along with them  all in the name of  following the constitution   it s long past time for the gop to stop pandering to the evangelicals and actually try to govern according to the constitution  like they keep insisting they are featured image by win mcnamee getty images
