in the book  the world is blue  how our fate and the ocean s are one  marine biologist sylvia earle wrote  even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean  the ocean touches you with every breath you take  every drop of water you drink  every bite you consume everyone  everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea  a report released this week discovered roughly  percent of the great barrier reef in australia  the largest living structure on earth  has been damaged due to coral bleaching  we ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before   said professor terry hughes in a press release  professor hughes is director of the arc centre of excellence for coral reef studies  and leader of the national coral bleaching task force which produced the report   in the northern great barrier reef  it s like  cyclones have come ashore all at once  the task force evaluated  coral reefs by air around australia  and found  percent were suffering from coral bleaching to some extent  the bleaching was found to be worse in the northern sector of the reef  where no coral has escaped its impact  based on diving surveys  the researchers say they have seen nearly  percent coral death so far according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  part of the united states department of commerce  increased ocean temperatures caused by climate change are the leading cause of coral bleaching  coral depends on algae to survive  which is very sensitive to temperature changes  if warm temperatures remain constant for a long period of time  the coral dispels the algae  leaving it colored white  and eventually leading to the death of the coral if the stresses are prolonged  in   the united states lost half its coral reefs in the caribbean sea due to a massive bleaching event  high carbon emissions absorbed by the ocean also decrease ph levels  leading to ocean acidification  observation stations monitored by the us epa in hawaii  bermuda  and the canary islands found that in the past two decades  carbon dioxide levels in the oceans have increased  directly resulting in the acidification  these changes also put stresses on marine life  diminishing the quality of their habitats and depleting food sources  if emissions aren t reduced soon  the negative effects already being seen in these environments will be irreversible  the bleaching doesn t necessarily mean the coral is dead  but the greater the stressors causing coral bleaching  the less likely the coral is able to recover   it can take thousands of years for coral reefs to fully form  so once the coral dies  those ecosystems are unlikely to ever recover  this is  by far  the worst bleaching they ve seen on the great barrier reef   mark eakin  director of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s coral reef watch  in an interview with the washington post   our climate model based four month bleaching outlook was predicting that severe bleaching was likely for the  back in december  unfortunately  we were right and much of the reef has bleached  especially in the north  today on earth day  it is important to acknowledge and fully comprehend how dire the situation of our world s ecosystems are because of climate change  there is no time for incremental efforts  we must either make the necessary changes to mitigate the effects of climate change in the future now  or pay dearly for the consequences which will manifest exponentially in the near future  we can no longer treat our earth as a source of infinite economic development when the resources on it are finite featured image courtesy of flickr
