ted cruz is just one night away from losing the nomination to donald trump and the pressure is clearly getting to him  at a truly unhinged last minute rally in la porte  indiana  cruz  joined by his faithful supporter glenn beck  spoke to a half empty gymnasium and things went off the rails almost instantly while telling the crowd that god had chosen himself and carly fiorina to be the next president and vice president  divine intervention or faulty wiring caused cruz s mic to die mid sentence  leaving the republican candidate to shout for a new one then stand around silently while one was brought to him  later  his attempt to pander to the indiana crowd with quotations from the movie hoosiers drew eye rolls and groans at another point  a preteen boy interrupted the rally by shouting  you suck   at cruz  he was ordered out of the event and as he was leaving  cruz told the crowd that he deserved a spanking a preteen yelling  you suck  is hauled out of cruz event   in my household  when a child behaved that way  they got a spanking   says cruz   daveweigel   daveweigel  may    protester interrupts ted cruz in la porte  ind   in my household  when a child behaved that way  they d get a spanking    phil elliott   philipelliott  may    angry  cruz couldn t let it go  he added that  children should speak with respect  the crowd went wild spanking is a big deal for cruz  he speaks on it frequently  often bragging about spanking his two daughters  lately  he s been adding a splash of sexism into the mix  primarily focused on hillary clinton  a former secretary of state and not cruz s  year old daughter  we do know hillary told her daughter chelsea   well  gosh  i knew it was a terrorist attack  while we were out telling the american people it wasn t    cruz said   you know i ll tell you  in my house  if my daughter catherine  the five year old  says something she knows to be false  she gets a spanking  at another point  he said the american people should  spank  clinton for benghazi  spanking appears to be cruz s main way of communicating if what is happening in la porte  indiana  is any indication  cruz is going to have a rough go of it when polling starts  having dumped all of his resources into winning indiana  the last polls show that trump still has a double digit lead over him  apparently  nobody is impressed by cruz or as a preteen boy might say it   you suck  featured image via youtube screengrab
