just hours before the final democratic primary debate  bernie sanders has finally released his full healthcare plan on his campaign site  sanders lays out how important the affordable care act has been  he notes that he  himself  helped contribute to the huge piece of legislation that helped to provide  million people with health insurance but sanders believes that it is time to move forward with a national healthcare system that provides coverage to all  he writes on his site  all americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre existing conditions  sanders says  but as we move forward  we must build upon the success of the aca to achieve the goal of universal health care  twenty nine million americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people  there has been some controversy between democrats this week relating to the issue of sanders  proposal to implement a universal healthcare system in the united states  concerns over how this program would be funded have been of particular interest to the public  sanders lays that out in plain detail for all to read most of the health care plan receives its funding from new progressive taxes on the wealthiest americans  some people in the middle class might pay a tiny bit more in taxes  according to the campaign website   a family of four making    a year taking the standard deduction would only pay   this year   that small increase in taxes isn t anything to what a similar family would save under sanders  plan  they would save around    dollars a year  last year  the average working family paid    in premiums and    in deductibles to private health insurance companies  under this plan  a family of four earning    would pay just   per year to the single payer program  amounting to a savings of over    for that family each year   the site reads it long past time that the united states join every other industrialized nation in the world and implement a national single payer healthcare system  that s what the aca was presented as a stepping stone towards  regardless of who is the eventual democratic nominee  the fight for healthcare as a right need to be at the top of the democratic platform  democrats should not have to apologize for wanting to live in a nation where every person can get the healthcare they need should a better proposal than sanders  be presented  it should be adopted  there may be some strategic advantages to wanted to expand the aca very gradually  but we are talking about people s lives  but there are some big cracks in the aca  cracks that  million people have fallen through  it is time that we come together and demand that  no person deserves to be left behind you can read a full break down of the plan here featured image credit  phil roeder via flickr
