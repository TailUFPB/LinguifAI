ted nugent woke up on the wrong side of the bed wednesday morning  pretty soon the secret service will be knocking on his door  not long after   a m  central time  nugent was already in the mood to call president obama a  chimp ass punk  that needed to be  tried for treason and hung   along with secretary clinton for their handling of  you guessed it  benghazi  he must have made his coffee a little bit too strong  sending him into a caffeine filled rage  that  or he s just the same ted we ve all come to know over the years we get that the right wing is all rattled up about the new   hours  the secret soldiers of benghazi  movie that just hit theaters  nugent must have stayed up all night watching it on repeat judging from his post  immediately after threatening the life of president obama  nugent goes into a long rant detailing what he considers to be evidence that clinton and obama are just the worst two people on the face of the planet  what s funny is that even though he comes to the conclusion that they need to be  hung   he resorts to lighter language in the very next paragraph saying instead  this  raises dramatic new questions   there really is a difference  either it s convincing  or it s not  ted  which one is it pic via facebook we won t even attempt to go into the subject of benghazi  because it s been talked about too much already  and we re not trying to get into the business of entertaining this guy any more than he already is  the fact is  this guy s blinders are truly on  we don t recall ted getting all huffy puffy at george w  bush and co  for his handling of the iraq war  there were too many failures to mention  nevermind that  though  right here s a video of nugent from a few years back where he said   i m not going to call people names anymore   he actually repeated it twice  when the interviewer called him out on it  not thinking he would commit to it  so  he doubled down  at the time  he sounded serious  but as you can see  we all know how that ended up oh  and that benghazi movie ted was all worked up about  it tanked at the box office  it was a total  abject failure  so much for that bogus message gaining any steam featured image via flickr
