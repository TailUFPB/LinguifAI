this just goes to show that you should always do your research before donating to a charity despite being a charity that supposedly provides support to wounded military veterans and their families  the wounded warrior project wwp  failed one family so badly that it should anger every american who claims to support our troops courtney leigh schumacher was preparing to deliver her second child when her husband was severely injured  jon schumacher lost both of his legs and required major medical care at bethesda medical center in maryland  the only problem was the family was stationed in california and courtney needs to figure out how to fly across the country and make sure her husband  her baby  and herself had everything they needed for the long recovery ahead so she reached out to the wounded warrior project seeking travel assistance  baby items  and other needs to get through the hardship  wounded warrior project denied her requests  in fact  the only thing they managed to send her was a box full of merchandise including hats and stickers instead of what she and her family actually needed  needless to say  courtney schumacher was angry  so she posted her story on social media dear wounded warrior project please stop sending us merchandise we do not want the hats  stickers  magnets  clothing and backpacks you send us throughout the year  i don t understand how you have the funds for these items  yet you can t help the countless veterans who need it  you can show us your programs and have a few veterans testify for you  but it means nothing  i m not a person who read a negative article about you and is now deciding to speak out  i am a caregiver who approached you in my time of need and i was told no i was  weeks away from delivering our second son when my husband was injured  i flew from california to bethesda to be by his side  i asked for baby items and assistance with travel for our immediate family so i could recover  i was told no  these were two of my dozen of requests that were all denied  i asked then what can help us with and you said  whatever you need   merchandise was the only thing we have ever received from you luckily  courtney and her family found support from a charity that actually went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure they had everything they needed fortunately for us  an organization did support us and fulfilled our needs  they gave us a swing and a pack n play for my husbands hospital room so i could continue his care  they flew our family out in time for the birth and flew out our oldest son  who was   across the country to spend christmas with us  this organization was the semper fi fund as for wounded warrior project  courtney refused to waste any more time supporting the organization i will be sending an email today to be removed from your mailing list  i hate to see anymore of your donor s funds wasted  sincerly  the caregiver of a triple amputee   wwp  semperfifund    wwpgear     woundedwarriorproject     semperfifund here s an image of the post via newsfoxes now  there is no denying that wounded warrior project has helped many veterans  but what happened to this family is totally unacceptable  especially when you read an account of what courtney went through in bethesda for months  which she wrote after her original post went viral we were stationed in  palms  ca and made under   a month for a family of three  when my husband was injured  i was flown to bethesda  md  i decided to leave our four year old son in california with my parents  i was expecting a swift return to san diego and i didn t want him to see his dad in that condition  i had a automatic payment set up for my parents back home so all his needs were met there was no savings for our needs in bethesda  i was never looking for a handout or a check from wwp  i just wanted help i had nothing to lay my newborn baby in while in the hospital room  i slept on a chair and my husband had mrsa  i asked for a bassinet  i was told no  i asked for someone to take my debit card to target and buy me one  i was told no  i didn t have a vehicle or a car seat  i was desperate  i flew to bethesda in october and stayed through january  i didn t own any warm clothing  i walked to and from the hospital through snow in flip flops until my family bought me boots during their visit  i never asked for things for myself we couldn t afford plane tickets across country during the holidays  i was due to deliver our second son on december   i knew we needed family bedside to continue my husbands care while i delivered our son  we were told no  luckily  semper fi fund flew our family out for two weeks  it made our hospital room christmas morning much more pleasant  i had a hard time getting my husband dressed everyday for therapy  he was still connected to wound vacs in his legs and tubes throughout his body  we asked if there was a way to get some snap athletic clothing  we were told no  luckily  sew much comfort  provided jon with velcro clothing  there were more requests i made and i was told no  i asked what do you do and they said whatever you need indeed  despite that declaration by wounded warrior project  courtney still only received a two letter word that made it clear that her family wasn t going to receive help from that particular organization  and she ripped them a new one for it if you only provide specific services  then make that information available  if you outsource most of your veterans to other non profits  yet sue them for stepping on your toes  then state that if you cant help my family then state that instead of keeping us hooked with false hope  i see organizations like homes for our troops who can put a veterans family in a mortgage free handicap accessible forever home with a tiny portion of what wwp makes a month and it upsets me  all i ask  if you know of a specific need of a veteran that you want to see happen  then donate to that specific organization here s an image of the family wounded warrior project refused to help wounded warrior project may have began as a worthy cause that helped a lot of people  but it has since become a questionable charity that is struggling to make the grade according to non profit quarterly  wwp received a  d  rating from the american institute of philanthropy  c  by charity watch  and  three out of four stars  from charity navigator  in short  it s a mixed score that doesn t exactly inspire confidence in addition  wounded warrior project brought in   million in   and only  percent of that goes to actually helping veterans in need while the other  percent is used for administrative expenses     of which is the salary paid to ceo steven narduzzi  one has to wonder how it feels to get rich off the backs of veterans in contrast  the semper fi fund that courtney and her family received help from has a spectacular rating  it has a four star rating from charity navigator  an a  rating from charity watch  and unlike wwp  only  percent of the funds donated to semper fi fund are used for overhead this really shows which charity organization has their priorities straight  so  perhaps it s time for all of us to do research before we donate to an organization  especially when that organization claims to support wounded veterans and their families  if we really believe our troops and their families deserve the best  shouldn t they also deserve the best charitable organizations as well featured image  news foxes
