tuesday night was big for speaker of the house paul ryan  who had a primary night victory  of course  he couldn t celebrate or enjoy it because he was busy doing damage control on trump s latest horrific controversy   the republican nominee had actually called for democratic candidate hillary clinton to be assassinated earlier that day at a press conference  ryan was directly asked about what trump had said regarding second amendment people  stopping the former secretary of state from appointing liberal supreme court justices and taking away their guns if she got elected  ryan s response to trump s inflammatory remarks was an epic fail on the gop s part to maintain even the smallest bit of dignity and respect as trump continues to ravage their party on a daily basis first  ryan insisted that he had no clue what trump had said because he d apparently been too busy to hear about what had been dominating the news all day  and ryan s reaction got even more disappointing as it went on  with his voice full of irritation  ryan passed off trump s suggestion that his followers shoot clinton as a  joke gone bad   ryan said  it sounds like just a joke gone bad  i hope he clears it up very quickly  you shouldn t joke about something like that  and to top it off  ryan once again turned down an opportunity to grow a spine and stand up to trump and his dangerous  divisive campaign  instead of condemning trump for his comments as many top officials are doing  ryan insisted that a president trump would bring better receptivity of our agenda  than clinton  seriously  all ryan cares about is furthering his bigot gop values   even if it destroys america you can watch ryan bring to life the very definition of a coward in the clip below featured image via darren hauck   getty images
