there are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic  but the people sharing the space where the republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the gop party platform it s all happening at the marriott hotel at the baltimore harbor  and right down the hall from where republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year   that is where the mid atlantic monument builders  association is holding their annual summit  and within the room where the monument builders are meeting  there is a huge sampling of headstones how is this the perfect metaphor for the republican party  so glad you asked the gop has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest  instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care  they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage  they ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives  they d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could  quite literally  lose everything  the gop has also consistently tried to make it harder for low income citizens to have access to medicaid and food assistance programs  not to mention the gop s love for war and lust for sending american lives to die for causes still unknown so  to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect  their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens  kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event  it s very telling of gop policy   video featured image  abc
