the koch brothers have just received a huge legislative gift from house republicans  on thursday  the ways and means committee voted on a bill that would make dark money even darker  in a   vote split along party lines  the committee approved the bill  after the supreme court s citizen s united decision  a flood of dark money has been funneled into u s  political system  now  the koch brothers and their republican goons in the house are trying to make it harder to know who is donating money to these non profit groups u s  representative peter j  roskam  r il  introduced the bill  which is titled the preventing irs abuse and protecting free speech act  the bill would change the current law so that non profit organizations no longer have to disclose their donors to the irs  the kochs and republicans have argued that these donor lists only serve to give the irs a way to intimidate those who donate to certain non profit groups koch companies public sector president phillip ellender released a letter in support of the bill which says  the targeting of non profit organizations by the internal revenue service  irs  to limit free speech under this administration is well documented  from the irs subjecting donors of nonprofit organizations to the gift tax  to the direct targeting of conservative non profit organizations based solely on their beliefs  this legislation could not be more pertinent  considering the pair of reports released earlier this year by the government accountability office  gao   it s even more pressing  the gao found serious internal control flaws within the irs that could allow the agency to continue its targeting of certain americans for audit  based on an organization s religious  educational  political  or other views  in reality  these lists are mainly used to prevent donations from people in foreign nations from influencing u s  elections  if this bill were to pass it would open up the floodgates for foreign contributions into the u s  political system  democracy   an organization that advocates for fair elections and campaign finance reform  released a statement where they said  currently  the fact that nonprofit groups have to report their donors  including foreign donors  to the irs serves as a check against any nonprofit taking the risk of illegally spending these funds in federal elections  by eliminating this reporting requirement  as the roskam bill does  there would be no way for anyone to know whether foreign money was being illegally spent through a nonprofit in a federal election and there would be no way to hold violators accountable for their illegal activities  this move by the koch brothers is nothing more than an attempt to further erode democracy in the u s  the reality that u s  politicians can be bought and sold by  charities  is bad enough  the idea that they could be financed in part or totally by people who are not u s  citizens is downright scary  this bill is treasonous and those who support it should be considered traitors to the u s  it should concern both on the right and the left you can watch the ways and means committee session on the bill below featured image from  photo by chip somodevilla getty images
