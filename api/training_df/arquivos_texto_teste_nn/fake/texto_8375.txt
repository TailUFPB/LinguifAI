a huge number of federal employees wouldn t be able to stand their jobs if republican presidential front runner donald trump won the next presidential election  according to a survey done by the government business council  a quarter of government employees find trump so unbearably repulsive that they would actually quit the breakdown revealed that   of workers surveyed would definitely jump ship  and   stated that they d consider leaving their jobs   resulting in a potential   of federal employees terminating their positions  it could be disastrous  when you imagine all the government agencies   such as the post office and our va system   which are normally understaffed to begin with   trying to function with   fewer people  the results of trump s presidency could be damaging on every level when broken down by party    of democrats said they d consider leaving  compared to just   of republicans  the survey also revealed that regardless of their political party  almost   of federal employees admitted they d be  embarrassed  to call trump their boss  this was much higher than any of the democratic candidates such as hillary clinton     and bernie sanders     to make matters even more embarrassing for the gop  survey participants were also asked how they felt about their current boss  president barack obama   and the majority     of democratic employees said they would be honored to support him for a third term  if he was permitted one  so while donald trump might continue to be popular in the polls  this study reveals that many americans are still level headed and quite humiliated by the idea that he might be given the chance to lead this country  you can t get a much clearer sign than  in  people quitting their jobs to demonstrate just how vile the idea of trump in the white house is this poll was conducted at the end of january  and used data from  federal employees with a margin of error give or take four percentage points  of those surveyed    called themselves republicans    identified as democrats  while   said they did not know and   wouldn t state their party featured image via gage skidmore
