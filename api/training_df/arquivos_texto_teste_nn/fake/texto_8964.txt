in   a group called the  christian movement for life  was founded by john africa  africa and his followers advocated a radical form of green politics  calling for a return to a more natural hunter gatherer type existence while being opposed to things like scientific advancement and technology  is this starting to sound similar to certain modern right wing groups yet africa and his followers  who were almost exclusively african american  eventually renamed their group to move  the members established a commune in a house in west philadelphia  they participated in demonstrations against institutions they opposed by using bullhorns and shouting out their opinions at all hours of the day or night move s activities drew the scrutiny of law enforcement over time  this culminated first in  when a nearly year long standoff with police who were ordering move to leave their collective home ended in violence  move members would not vacate so police decided to break into their home and force them to leave  when this happened  shooting started and a policeman was killed  move claimed none of its own members shot the officer  as he was shot in the back of the head and was facing towards the house at the time  seven other officers  five firefighters  three move members  and three bystanders were injured also  as a result of the shooting  nine move members were all sentenced to a maximum of  years in prison for third degree murder over the officer s death after the shooting and arrests  remaining move members continued on and in   they re established their commune in a row house in west philadelphia  after they settled in  they began the same bullhorn aided protests they gained notoriety for previously  as before  they got onto local law enforcement s watch list neighbors began complaining about the protests and filed health complaints about piles of compost that the group kept on their property  further pressure from police resulted in indictments of move members for crimes like parole violation  contempt of court  illegal possession of firearms  and making terrorist threats  is this starting to sound even more like certain right wing groups yet eventually  then mayor wilson goode classified move as a terrorist organization on may    all hell broke loose  city manager leo brooks arrived with a sizeable police contingent in order to force the eviction of all move members from their home  and arrest of indicted move members  this quickly turned into an armed standoff with police  who began firing tear gas into the rowhomes  gunfire began  with police returning fire with automatic weapons this is the most insane part  police commissioner sambor then ordered that the compound was to  be bombed while the move members were still inside  a police helicopter dropped bombs on the roof of the house  explosions and fires ensued that destroyed sixty five nearby homes  firefighters that were on scene stood idle and allowed the fire to continue burning the homes  the same firefighters were just earlier trying to flood the members out of the homes with their hoses below is a picture of the aftermath of the move bombing and ensuing fires move bombing photo  phillymag one of the survivors  ramona africa  said that police were firing at those who were trying to escape the burning buildings  the firefighters were given orders by the police to allow the fire to continue burning  this allowed the fire to spread to adjacent homes and left two hundred and fifty people homeless  eleven people  six adults  and five children  burned to death in the fire  ramona africa managed to escape the gunfire and flames by crawling out through a broken basement window  even though she suffered severe burns a commission was quickly formed to investigate the police response  which denounced the actions of the city government  but did not press any criminal charges against anyone involved let s compare this  to the response of police and federal law enforcement to the bundy militia s armed seizure of a federal public building literally not one person from law enforcement is on the scene  as per oregon live during saturday s rally  not a police officer was visible  and so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory  the fbi is in charge because the refuge is federal property  the harney county sheriff s office and the oregon state police are engaged as well source  oregon livemove was living in their own private home  or homes at the time  each time  the bundys were occupying property that did not belong to them move was classified a terrorist organization  the bundy militia has yet to receive this distinction after the same amount of incidents as move had occurred move was ready to shoot  but cops went in anyway  the bundys are ready to shoot  and the cops are afraid to move in because they didn t want to cause a scene move ended up in a standoff with cops twice  and violence and death were the results both times  the bundys have been in a standoff with cops twice  and each time authorities are afraid to act against people literally pointing guns at them because of how it will look if they do let s face it  move was mostly black  the bundys are mostly   if not all   white  militias seem to be the new pinnacle of the white privilege pyramid in america  how shameful for us all featured image via phillymag
