every presidential candidate s economic plan has flaws  they either rely on deficit spending  hillary clinton   or they rely on magic mirrors  every republican there is   trump s plan will cost the u s  more than   trillion  mostly from tax cuts for the wealthy that aren t paid for  campaigns and their surrogates are supposed to rally around their candidates  but newt gingrich found himself unable to defend trump s economic plan during an appearance on fox news sunday chris wallace asked gingrich point blank whether trump s numbers add up  gingrich said  of course not  historically  no candidates have numbers that add up  brilliant cover there  fanboy  you re still a campaign surrogate admitting that his candidate s economic plan is a worthless pile of steaming dog shit  doing this is virtually unheard of  even romney s surrogates didn t admit outright that his economic plan was going to kill the economy  not stimulate it  when the tax policy center said that romney s plan would require raising taxes on the middle class to avoid ballooning the national debt  his campaign  and the entire gop  came to his defense back in june  moody s said that trump s economic plan would cost us millions of jobs in addition to raising the national debt by   trillion  trump only has a tiny part of his massive tax cuts offset  the rest amount to a massive black hole in the middle of the budget  which  in turn  would cause interest rates to skyrocket  skyrocketing interest rates  when combined with other factors  harm corporate output  and eventually  stock prices we all know what happens when the stock market crashes predictably  trump s campaign said there were  profound errors  in moody s analysis  trump wants to rely on strong arming china into a different trade agreement for his jobs plan  because of course he does  he s a master negotiator  so china will capitulate this isn t the beginning of the end of gingrich s love affair with trump  not by a long shot  that s evident by his cover that no presidential candidate s economic plans ever add up  but a surrogate going so far as to say on television that it s nonsense  even with a cover  is virtually unprecedented featured image by t j  kirkpatrick getty images
