as republicans gather for the first day of their clown show   also known as their convention   a glaring and telling detail rests in the gop platform  the preservation of citizens united and big money in our national politics on the other side  however  democrats are committed to overturning the disastrous supreme court decision that has allowed a total pollution of our system of politics  and the party s nominee for president of the united states  hillary clinton  is making it priority number one in a video posted at the progressive gathering netroots nation in st  louis  missouri  clinton pledged her support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the  decision  and will push for such an amendment in her first  days should she be elected the former secretary also promised to enact an executive order that would require all government contractors to disclose their campaign contributions and require the securities and exchange commission to require all publicly traded companies to disclose their contributions as well the chances of a constitutional amendment overrunning citizens united are slim should the house and the senate remain republican controlled  but polls show the public overwhelmingly wants money out of politics  then again  the overwhelming majority of the public supports common sense gun legislation but that hasn t convinced the republicans to do anything one of the biggest arguments in the democratic primary was the use of money in politics  while both candidates  including vermont senator bernie sanders  supported a constitutional amendment overturning citizens united  it was clinton who received major backlash from progressives over hefty super pac contributions  cbs reported last month that her biggest pac contributor  priorities usa  had raised over   million in june alone  and currently has   million stashed away for general ads against donald trump according to opensecrets  an independent government watchdog group  of the   million that clinton has raised this election season   percent of that came from super pac donations the bottom line is this  yes  hillary clinton used super pac money to help fund her campaign and get this far in a very competitive race  but in the age of super pacs  and now a billionaire mogul   a candidate needs money to win  clinton recognizes this  and is pledging to put an end to the system that pollutes our elections if anyone thinks a president trump would end super pacs  they are blissfully ignorant or totally blind  or both featured image via jessica kourkounis getty images
