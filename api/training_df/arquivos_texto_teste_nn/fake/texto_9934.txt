here is a portion of the interview that was conducted by a group of journalists and pope frances today vatican insider    i leaned out to greet the children and didn t see the glass  and  pum  the pope with a smile and an obvious dark bruise framing his left cheek  answers the question on how he feels after the small accident that happened to him in cartagena  immediately after the avianca flight took off from cartagena  francis spoke for  minutes with journalists on immigration  climate change  trump s latest measures and the situation in venezuela  he confirmed that he had a private meeting with the italian prime minister paolo gentiloni  but denied that there was talk of immigration  he expressed his support to italy for what the country is doing by trying to manage the emergency landings and regulate immigration flows  here is a list of us senators who are also catholics  their pro life ratings are listed in front of their names     mike johanns  r neb   jim risch  r   david vitter  r la   pat toomey  r pa     lisa murkowski  r   robert casey jr   d pa   mary landrieu  d la   susan collins  r   patrick leahy  d vt   john kerry  d mass   richard durbin  d ill   tom harkin  d   barbara mikulski  d md   patty murray  d wash   jack reed  d r i   robert menendez  d n j   mark begich  d   maria cantwell  d wash   kirsten gillibrand  d n y   claire mccaskill  d mo does anyone see a pattern here  yet  no open condemnation for these lawmakers who actually have the power to stop the barbaric practice of abortion by the pope  italy is starting to feel the climate change  there have been many deaths in recent days and so much damage  why is it that governments are delaying this realization  whereas on other issues they keep soliciting  like on the korean arms race  for example how ironic that the pope would suggest climate change deniers who ve been screaming that phony climate change data and peddlers are part of a scheme to extort money from citizens that will somehow  fix  the not resolved science behind  man made climate change  i have heard of the abolition of this law  but i have not been able to read the articles on how and why this decision was taken  i do not know the situation well  however  detaching young people from their family won t bear any good fruit for young people or the family  this law comes from the executive and not from parliament  if that is the case  i hope that they will think it over again a little bit  i have heard the president of the united states speak  who presents himself as a pro life  if he is a good pro life  he understands the importance of family and life  the unity of the family must be defended  when young people feel exploited  they ultimately feel hopeless  and who steals it  drugs  other kinds of addictions  suicide  achievable when your roots are cut off  anything that goes against the roots steals hope
