donald trump s personality could be described several ways  some would call him type a   competitive  outgoing  ambitious and aggressive   while others would call him the textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder  megalomaniac is another that comes to mind  no matter what way you look at the donald  he definitely doesn t qualify as  typical  as it turns out  there may be a very good  very dangerous  very pharmaceutical reason for it  gawker recently re examined an article from  that may have more to do with donald trump s failures as a human being than the genes he inherited from his booze and hooker pimping grandfather as it turns out  a story from spy magazine revealed that trump was a patient of the infamous dr  joseph greenburg  who was known for prescribing an amphetamine like drug called tenuate dospan for a non existent condition called  metabolic imbalance   according to the story dr  greenberg s program included no set caloric limit  and tenuate was prescribed or five months  the long term use of tenuate can  according to the medical literature  lead to psychosis delusions of grandeur  say  like the belief that by simply putting your name on real estate properties  you will double their value according to the nih  prolonged use of tenuate can lead to hallucinations and confusion  prolonged is exactly what trump s exposure to the drug can be described as  according to this medical record obtained by gawker that shows years of visits to greenburg by trump gawker was able to confirm by email with a former employee of greenburg that this is in fact an actual copy of the donald s record  since greenburg s role in trump s care seemed to only include giving him happy pills that should have been prescribed for no longer than a month  it could be argued that the lasting effects of anger  anxiety and delusions of grandeur are still with the man today  his campaign speeches and lack of ability to hold a coherent thought in an interview for more than a moment or two are fairly clear indicators the pills had such a detrimental effect on trump that one of his vice presidents once noted that when he got to work he would ask if it was a  dr  greenburg day   doing everything in his power to avoid the boss if the answer was yes does trump s obsession with fitness and physical appearance have something to do with his obvious desire to be thin and trim  his personal attacks on people based solely on their looks do a pretty good job of answering that question featured image from gawker via screen capture
