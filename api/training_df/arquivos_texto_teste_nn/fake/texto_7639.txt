when president obama took office in january of   the united states of america was on the brink of utter economic collapse  jobs were being lost at the rate of  per month  but have made consistent gains throughout all of obama s tenure as commander in chief  part of bringing us back from the worst recession since the great depression included several wall street reforms and a credit card bill of rights clearly  we ve come along way from the financial crisis that took place from    and sure  we have a long way to go to ensure that sort of crisis doesn t happen again  but president obama had some choice words for those who claim he s been soft on wall street on monday  while standing with federal reserve chair janet yellen and several other top regulators  the president stated  i want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media and the political discourse  both on the left and the right  to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing happened  that is not true  i want to dispel the notion that exists both on the left and on the right that somehow  after the crisis  nothing happened  we did not just rebuild this  we rebuilt it better  and we ve rebuilt it stronger  according to reuters  obama said regulators appear set by the end of the year to have achieved most of the goals he set out for the financial system in   when he first took office  although he noted there was still work to do on rules for hedge funds and asset managers in what he called the  shadow banking system  he then explained why that work hasn t been done yet  one of our projects is to make sure that we are covering some of those potential gaps  we may need at some point help from congress to do that  which is exactly right  in order for those gaps to be filled we need congress to cooperate  and it s not enough to just blame leadership  we have to hold our congresspeople accountable  that s why elections  and not just presidential elections  matter so much  republicans want to weaken regulations and make it possible for the practices that caused the financial crisis to occur  to create a future crisis  if anything  we need to embrace and expand president obama ideas and goals on wall street  not condemn them  he has every right to be mad at those claiming he s done nothing  because that s an outright lie featured image  white house flickr
