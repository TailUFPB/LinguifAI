it s illegal to use money meant for charity to purchase stuff for yourself and it looks like donald trump definitely broke the law in   the republican nominee participated in a bidding war over an autographed tim tebow football helmet and eventually won with a bid of     clearly  trump overpaid for the item the auction was in support of the susan g  komen foundation  which suffered a serious backlash the same year when it tried to take funding away from planned parenthood in protest of abortion  thus depriving women of breast cancer screenings that the money paid for  the ensuing outrage forced the komen organization to reinstate the funding the koman foundation lost a lot of support over the scandal but donald trump pumped    into the organization for a worthless helmet  there normally wouldn t be a problem with that  after all people can spend their money on anything they want  but trump didn t personally pay for the helmet himself  instead  he took funds out of his own charity to pay for it that s right  trump did not pay for the item with a single dime of his own personal fortune  he used money donated by other people to his donald trump foundation to make the purchase well  the washington post consulted some tax experts to find out if trump broke the law and this is what they had to say  that would be a classic violation of the prohibition on a charity being operated for the private inurement  benefit  of the charity s creator   wrote brett g  kappel  an expert on tax exempt organizations at the akerman law firm in washington  the trump foundation does not appear to have offices of its own  it is headquartered at trump s business offices in new york and has no full time staff the best case for trump  experts said  would be if he had given the helmet and jersey away to another charity  perhaps to be auctioned off at another fundraiser  if   the foundation paid for it  and they owned the helmet  and the helmet was given to someone as a charitable activity   that would be enough  said john edie  now retired  who was the longtime general counsel at the council on foundations edie said trump could not get off the hook by simply giving the memorabilia to a friend  spending    for a helmet and then giving it to a golfing buddy is not  charity  edie said in short  trump is clearly hiding his tax returns for a reason or multiple reasons that could seriously damage his already sinking campaign  and by the way  the man who claims to be great at making deals clearly failed to see the bad deal he was making when he bought a football helmet signed by a guy who couldn t hack it in the nfl  the washington post reports that trump s    memorabilia is now only worth just over   today  and if you ask me  that price is still too high featured image  ralph freso getty images
