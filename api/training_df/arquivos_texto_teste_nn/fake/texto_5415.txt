republicans have routinely blamed president barack obama whenever something goes wrong  even if it s completely unrelated to him in any way  perhaps it s a sign that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton is going to be replacing obama in the white house  because the gop is already blaming the dumbest things on her   including melania trump s disastrous speech on the first night of the republican national convention melania s speech raised eyebrows last night as people immediately recognized how similar it was to first lady michelle obama s speech from the  democratic national convention  it was clear that a good chunk of the speech had been plagiarized  but don t expect trump s campaign to take any responsibility for it  on cnn this morning  trump campaign advisor paul manafort refused to acknowledge the obvious similarities and awkwardly denied any plagiarism  it was an uncomfortable interview with chris cuomo  and manafort made it even worse by trying to blame it on clinton  manafort told cuomo  who appeared stunned by what he was hearing  that melania s speech was original  there s no cribbing of michelle obama s speech  i mean  these were common words and values  i mean  she was speaking in front of  million people last night  she knew that  to think that she would be cribbing michelle obama s words is crazy  cuomo pointed out that the speech didn t just pull a few common words   there were word for word sentences that were taken from the first lady s  address  here s  a few  similarities  as a twitter user pointed out twitterthe truth is blatantly obvious  but manafort continued to refuse to admit that there had been any sort of wrongdoing and tried to place the blame onto clinton  he said  this is  once again  an example of what happens when a woman threatens hillary clinton  she seeks to demean her and take her down  it s not going to work  you can watch manafort make a fool of himself below trump campaign manager paul manafort  melania trump s speech used  common words and phrases   https   t co   cnn   cnn  july    isn t the only trump advisor blaming clinton for this incident  donald trump senior advisor sarah huckabee sanders defended the trump campaign and melania on fox news  america s newsroom when host martha maccallum pointed out that the speech had been lifted  when maccallum brought up the fact that many people thought manafort should be fired for allowing such a thing to happen  huckabee sanders said  i think the person who ought to be fired is hillary clinton  she broke the law and that s been completely ignored  featured image is a screenshot
