each year  the people for the american way s equine posterior achievement award  is granted to public figures who drag america to a new low of right wing extremism  for several years now  ted cruz has been  honored  with the top spot  but this year  the prize has been handed to donald trump it s official donald  you are the biggest horse s a   in america according to the adjudication panel of people for the american way will trump be as quick to crow about this victory as he was when he was crowned  man of the year  by worldnetdaily  it didn t seem to bother him that the site is conspiracy theory central  and as right wing watch points out  is convinced that obama is about to throw every man  woman and child in america into a fema camp trump worked hard for this honor though  he labeled all latin american immigrants as drug dealers and rapists  he called for muslims to be banned from entering the u s   even muslim americans returning from holiday   he lied that  thousands and thousands  of muslims in america cheered while   was happening  and failed to retract or apologize when he was busted for it  instead he chose to stand up at his next rally and physically mock the disabled reporter who had exposed his lie  on top of this  he spends the majority of time hate tweeting any journalist or media outlet that dare refuse to kiss his trust fund tycoon posterior this level of commitment to running for president as a bigoted man child needs to be honored somehow  and thankfully  people for the american way solved the problem for us  sadly  it does mean that ted cruz  winning streak is over  he will clearly have to work harder to win back the accolade next year  his brand of evangelical  homophobic  anti choice  anti science  pro gun bs might well appall any rational human being   but there s a new bigot in town featured image via flickr flickr
