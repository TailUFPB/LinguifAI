republican presidential candidate gov  chris christie is mad  he is so mad  in fact  at michelle obama for wanting kids to eat healthy  that he has just openly come out against her initiative for healthier children  sound crazy  because it is never mind the fact that it was only a few short years ago when christie lauded the first lady on her healthy eating agenda when he said  i think it s a really good goal to encourage kids to eat better  you know  i ve  i ve struggled with my weight for thirty years and it s a struggle  and if a kid can avoid that in his adult years or her adult years  more power to them  and i think the first lady is speaking out well  i mean  i don t want the government deciding what you can and what you can t eat  i still think that s your choice  but i think mrs  obama being out there encouraging people in a positive way to eat well and to exercise and to be healthy  i don t have a problem with that  now he s trying to run for president and knows that the people he needs nationally to vote for him don t want some commie agenda of healthy eating  after all  eve ate the forbidden apple  but there is nothing in the bible against eating twinkies for dinner while campaigning in iowa on monday  christie told a young child in the crowd that he ll be able to eat whatever he wants if christie were to be elected  he told the kid  the first lady has no business being involved in this  using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business  it just isn t  i want people to eat healthier  i ve been trying to eat more healthy  we all should be trying to do that  it makes us better  makes us living longer  better quality of life  all the rest of it  but in the end  it s your choice  i don t care what you re eating for lunch every day  i really don t  i want you to eat whatever your mother wants you to eat and your father want you to eat  and if your parents want you to eat gum drops and mountain dew as a balanced meal  go for it  who cares if kids get sick from malnutrition or get diabetes and raise health costs nationwide  at the end of the day  fruits and vegetables are yucky  and if you don t want your kid eating yucky food  vote for chris christie   please note the sarcastic tone before angry commenting let s get to the point here  folks  first lady michelle obama and her push of healthy eating isn t a forced agenda  it s a suggestion  her let s move campaign is also just a suggestion  just like former first lady laura bush promoted reading  and nancy reagan was a against drug use  it s not a communist plot to take over the minds of our youth  it s to suggest and promote positive actions in the lives of children  that s all  calm down  and christie  really  this pandering is just outright pathetic featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
