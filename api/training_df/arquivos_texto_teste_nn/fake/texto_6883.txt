when you want to learn more about what a person is really like  talk to the people they have been around a lot  it s one thing to push a persona into the spotlight that has been sculpted to how one would like to be perceived while it is quite another to get to the truth behind the actual person so  when half a dozen former contestants from republican presidential frontrunner donald trump s reality show  the apprentice  come forward to issue statements condemning the candidate  we should all probably listen  some of those who have come forward are the winner from season   randal pinkett alongside kwame jackson who was runner up in season   they are also planning a press conference according to bloomberg  in statements  the contestants slammed trump s rhetoric as divisive and accused him of running a  campaign of sexism  xenophobia  racism  violence and hate  winning project manager from  the apprentice   marshawn evans daniels said  trump is passionately and strategically reigniting a dirty and divisive culture soaked in a history of prejudice  fear and hate  it is unpatriotic  anti american  self serving  regressive and downright lazy  pinkett stated  as alums of  the apprentice   we have had the opportunity to work with donald in various capacities  including as employees of the trump organization  based on that experience and donald s campaign  we do not believe he is worthy of becoming president of the united states  of course  trump responded to these criticisms in the most trumpian way possible  and said the group of former contestants are  six failing wannabes  he said  how quickly they forget  nobody would know who they are if it weren t for me they just want to get back into the limelight like they had when they were with trump  total dishonesty and disloyalty  they should be careful or i ll play hours of footage of them individually praising me  ask how successful they ve been since they left  six failing wannabes out of hundreds of contestants   so sad  a statement in response that pretty much proves the former contestants point of what a hateful  vindictive person trump is  as you may have noticed  in trump s mind  he s never wrong  it s always someone else s fault  it s always someone else doing something to him  and never ever the other way around  this is a true sign of an egomaniacal narcissist  it s amazing that he can fit his giant  braggadocios head through any door we need to listen to these former contestants  they ve had to work with him  and aren t afraid to tell it like it is  donald trump cannot be our next president  it wouldn t only be bad for the nation  but the entire world featured photo by amanda edwards getty images
