throughout this entire election stephen colbert has invited a schoolyard bully on the late show who supposedly advises donald trump on all his ridiculous and childish nicknames  it s been a schtick that started out funny  but has become all too real when noticing trump s behavior so  when colbert once again had  timmy the schoolyard bully  on his show  it was the usual back and forth of sophomoric nicknames  but then timmy did something unexpected   he switched sides apparently  trump has become too much of a bully for even timmy the schoolyard bully  and is now supporting hillary clinton for president  he said  okay  listen  i know you know  we need to talk for a second  man to fart knocker  i m in over my head  man  i thought this would be fun  ya know  share some laughs  destroy the gop  maybe even ban an entire religion from the country  but trump s out of control  that guy is way too childish to be president  i m voting for hillary  cooties be damned  trump will likely come up with a nickname for timmy now  just you wait  the republican candidate can t handle anyone who thinks for themselves and supports sanity over himself watch the hilarious segment here featured image via video screen capture
