for the last nine or so months  we ve all had to witness donald trump try to foray himself into our lives as a possible contender for commander in chief  he s pretty much on every news cycle    and there s absolutely no escaping  if you don t watch television  he will be on the internet  if you don t go on the internet  he will be in your newspaper  if you don t read the newspaper  you re probably a trump supporter well  during trump s most recent town hall appearance on msnbc with chris matthews  trump said his most trumpian things  and we all watched and listened in horror as he said women should be punished for getting an abortion however  it was during one moment  probably around the time you started to tune him out and stare at your phone  that trump was asked a question by matthews and the girl sitting visibly in the camera shot just couldn t hold her straight face any longer she  in essence  is all of us you can t really tell if she s going to laugh or cry  but she s definitely sitting there in utter disbelief  it is  most certainly  how we all feel every day regarding the likes of donald trump kudos  to you  young lady  we do not know your name  but you are a hero  thank you featured image via video screen capture
