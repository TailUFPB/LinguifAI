the great robert reich posted a new whiteboard video this week in which he makes a case in support of bernie sanders by reacting to claims made by bernie sanders skeptics   democratic voters who aren t convinced bernie is the guy  i hasten to underline that while i m a bernie skeptic  i m not a hillary clinton supporter either  though i do intend to vote for either bernie or hillary in june s california primary  as well as for the dem nominee in the general election  obviously  i d also like to repeat that i think reich is one of the great left wing political thinkers of our time  now that the obligatory qualifiers are out of the way  reich is off base with several of his counterpoints to bernie skeptics let s take a look    he d never beat trump or cruz   reich s response suggests that bernie does indeed have a polling advantage over the republicans in the general election  more so than clinton  unfortunately  politifact determined that bernie s version of this assessment is flatly  false   while sanders and clinton each lead trump  specifically  in the general election according to an nbc wall street journal poll  sanders trails both marco rubio and ted cruz  while clinton performs slightly better  ppp  meanwhile  shows sanders losing to trump  cruz and rubio while clinton defeats all three  additionally  and this is crucial to understanding the general election differences between the democratic hopefuls  voters have been following hillary clinton for  years and yet she still performs better  scandals and all  than sanders against the gop in most polls  sanders  meanwhile  is a relative unknown  so it s too early to tell how he ll do after the gop begins to relentlessly attack him    congress would reject his ideas   reich reminds us that if congress remains in the hands of the republicans  hillary clinton wouldn t be able to do much legislatively either  actually  that s not necessarily true  clinton s agenda is decidedly more moderate  so while she s sure to run up against significant gop opposition  it ll be easier for her to shake loose centrist and center right republicans  as well as blue dog democrats who would otherwise oppose sanders  significantly more leftist ideas reich goes on to say that bernie could bring about a democratic majority in congress   if    his political revolution works out  that s a super colossal  if   first of all  no revolution this year will change any gerrymandered districts  secondly  let s suppose sanders rides a massive wave of support into the white house with very long coattails  he d need a roughly  seat democratic majority in the senate to pass his single payer proposal  for example why  and not   blue dog democrats  the blue dogs successfully killed the public option in  and would surely join the republicans in filibustering bernie s single payer legislation  hence the extra  votes above and beyond the  required to break the filibuster  realistically  the only thing that might be able to spark a  seat majority  the house is totally different story  by the way  is another major financial crisis or another groundbreaking event that d compel voters to choose democratic candidates across the board    america would never elect a socialist   reich makes the off the shelf argument that there are many popular socialist programs in the united states  therefore americans love socialism  wrong  american voters love socialism  yes  but they don t know they do  and this argument about public schools and roads has been used since forever without successfully nudging very many voters leftward  trust me  i ve tried it many  many times socialism  as we observed when obama was falsely accused of pushing it in   is still intensely demonized as being the same as communism  it s not  and  in some cases  republicans have erroneously conflated it with the nazis  aka  national socialists    just because  socialism  is in the name of the party founded by hitler doesn t mean it s really socialist  likewise  hot dogs don t contain actual dogs  when the republicans launch their relentless attack on sanders  democratic socialist platform  it ll be another swift boating like we observed in   only it ll be more relentless  some undecided moderate voters in swing states   the people who decide elections in the polarized modern era   might be convinced to vote sanders  but it s a long shot  these are picky  old fashioned voters in states like pennsylvania and missouri  bottom line  softening the american voters  negative attitudes about socialism will take much longer than nine months    his single payer proposal would require raising taxes on the middle class   i m with reich and sanders on this one  it s a bogus argument  pushed by skeptics and hillary supporters alike  according to sanders  numbers  middle class families would pay less per year for healthcare and therefore end up saving money in spite of a modest tax hike  the trouble  however  is getting congress to support a tax hike on the middle class  see also      his plan for free college tuition would mean colleges would be run by government rules   i haven t heard any democratic skeptics saying this  but i might ve just missed them  nevertheless  i again agree with sanders and reich here  there s nothing in sanders  proposal  or obama s two year college plan  for that matter  showing that colleges would have to kowtow to the federal government    he s too old   reich believes  is the new  and  honestly  i m not concerned about bernie s age at all  as long as his would be vice presidential nominee is strong  it s a non issue  however  this will be an area the republicans will use to attack sanders  but it won t matter all that much  john mccain s age was only modestly relevant due to his battle with skin cancer  sanders  on the other hand  seems quite energetic and healthy so  all told  three of reich s counterpoints to skeptics aren t particularly strong  while one counterpoint against middle class tax hikes is directed at hardline pro hillary people  not mere skeptics  as well as republicans  and the final two are counterpoints to arguments i haven t really heard coming from bernie skeptics all in all  it still seems like a sanders victory and a subsequent sanders presidency would be a long shot  not impossible  but risky from the standpoint of overcoming significant electoral and political hurdles  as well as the current status of the  obscenely gerrymandered  congress  democrats ultimately have to decide whether sanders  agenda is worth risking a possible republican victory in november         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs
