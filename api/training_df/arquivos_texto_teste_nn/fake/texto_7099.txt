why has fox news been donald trump s cheerleader  even while he viciously attacks its employees  the answer may be as simple as blackmail while much of the republican establishment has turned on donald trump  conservative newspaper national review published an entire issue bashing trump  recall   fox news has been conspicuously on the sidelines  it s certainly not because they want to remain neutral to the political process  this is the network  remember  that has no problem criticizing obama for  say  eating at a nice restaurant or doing a comedy show  they ve never shied away from wearing their hack y opinions on their sleeves but even as trump goes after one of fox news  biggest stars  megyn kelly  with sexist  disgusting digs at her  the network has repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate the republican front runner an explosive report in new york magazine may reveal a clue as to why an odd bit of coincidence had given him a card to play against fox founder roger ailes  in   i published a biography of ailes  which upset the famously paranoid executive  several months before it landed in stores  ailes fired his longtime pr adviser brian lewis  accusing him of being a source  during lewis s severance negotiations  lewis hired judd burstein  a powerhouse litigator  and claimed he had  bombs  that would destroy ailes and fox news  that s when trump got involved trump has often bragged about this encounter  citing it as an example of his superior negotiating skills  but he also got something out of it  when roger was having problems  he didn t call  people  he called me   trump said  burstein  it turned out  had worked for trump briefly in the    and ailes asked trump to mediate  trump ran the negotiations out of his office at trump tower   roger had lawyers  very expensive lawyers  and they couldn t do anything  i solved the problem   fox paid lewis millions to go away quietly  and trump  i m told  learned everything lewis had planned to leak  if ailes ever truly went to war against trump  trump would have the arsenal to launch a retaliatory strike information that fox news head roger ailes paid millions to keep quiet is floating around trump s brain somewhere  just ready to come out of his mouth should the network really provoke him  it s no wonder ailes has freaked out each time trump threatened to go nuclear on the network  in a telling moment  when things had come to a head between fox and trump  ailes   the man behind the most watched news network in america   rolled over and showed his belly  unconditional surrender  trump won roger ailes just called  he is a great guy   assures me that  trump  will be treated fairly on  foxnews  his word is always good   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    another example  after trump went after kelly  the fox host opened up to charlie rose about how bad for the network trump s animosity would be speaking for herself and fox news chairman roger ailes  kelly told rose   neither one of us wanted any sort of a war with donald trump  we didn t think that benefited the channel  we didn t think it benefited me  and we don t think it benefited donald trump   adding that she believes trump would agree kelly said they just wanted to  forge forward and put it behind us and not pour anymore fuel on that fire  the result is some cringeworthy segments that feature fox pundits twisting themselves into pretzels to defend trump s nonsense  when trump recently changed his position on abortion three times in two days  with each new stance more nonsensical than the last  fox s reliably dim witted andrea tantaros found a way to blame his gaffes on a  trap  set by hillary clinton to make trump look stupid for years  ailes had exploited trump s star power to take shots at obama  the billionaire was a regular guest on the network  and fox no doubt introduce trump s brand of egocentric conservatism to millions of viewers  when they had a common enemy in obama  things were fine  ailes never seemed to anticipate being placed in a position where trump would use the dirt he had on ailes against him  like the gop more broadly  fox helped create the trump monster and now seem shocked to find that he has wrested control away from them and is on the warpath  it would almost be funny  if it weren t so scary featured image via thinkprogress screenshot
