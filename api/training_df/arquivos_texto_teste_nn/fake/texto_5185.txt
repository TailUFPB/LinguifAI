due to donald trump s continued unhinged and unacceptable behavior  panicked republicans are running away from their own presidential nominee in droves  now  yet another sitting gop congressman has come out saying that he cannot see how he could support trump rep  adam kinzinger  r ill  came out on wednesday with a laundry list of reasons that he cannot vote for donald trump  kinzinger said  i ve said my intention is to get there  i want to get there  i m not there yet  i don t see how i get there anymore  kinzinger attended trump s coronation party reluctantly  with one hope  that he could get behind trump  that didn t happen  though  in fact  trump only worsened kinzinger s opinion of him  he continued  you know  party unity  and all that  woke up wednesday morning  saw his comments about article v  nato  decided to hold off  kinzinger himself is a veteran of the very war that captain humayun khan was killed in  and trump s week long public feud with those gold star parents seems to be what finally pushed him into the  nevertrump camp  he says  then this spat  this unbelievable spat with the family of a fallen soldier  a fallen soldier who swore to protect and defend the constitution of the united states  wouldn t even initially say we honor the family for their service  immediately took it as what it was to him  an affront to him  then  rep  kinzinger said what we ve all been thinking that trump seems to be beginning to cross a lot of red lines in the unforgivable on politics  while he does not plan to support hillary clinton because he disagrees with her on probably almost all things   he will not be supporting donald trump either  kinzinger went on to pivot to trump s shocking and disturbing flirtation with russian dictator vladimir putin  for instance  even yesterday doubling down on saying how great it would be to have a fantastic relationship with putin our party  you know  me and other people in the party have said for the last six months how awful it was that hillary clinton did this reset with the russians  and how we were taken advantage of  now  you have vladimir putin basically pulling out the old kgb playbook on how to manipulate donald trump  and it appears he s fallen right into it  of course i don t agree that hillary did anything to endanger the country with regards to russia and putin  but trump certainly would  and has   there s really no comparison between hillary and trump there  that being said  though  this man is doing the right thing  regardless of political differences  he and i agree on one thing  donald trump should not be president  kinzinger also says the one thing that his gop comrades would do well to listen to with regards to this election  i m an american before i m a republican  watch video of some of kinzinger s comments below   repkinzinger says he can t support trump   i m an american before i m a republican https   t co  https   t co   the situation room   cnnsitroom  august    image via video screen capture
