fox news is now part of the  lamestream  media as far as sarah palin is concerned  and that s not the only shot she fired at the conservative network on saturday  palin responded to reports that she had dropped out of an appearance at the wyoming primary in support of trump  who went on to lose all of the delegates in the state  no  despite reports  i didn t  drop out  of anything in wyoming s gop primary today   palin wrote on her facebook page   i wasn t scheduled to be there  which can be verified by the trump campaign and our email exchanges from eight days ago where it was agreed a trip to wyoming wouldn t fit in with my prior obligations to work in dc and nevada this weekend  not satisfied with just accusing the media of issuing false reports  she threw an absolute temper tantrum to the point where she actually stated that she wants to put the media over her knee and spank them but the most interesting part of palin s rant came in the third paragraph when she threw fox news under the bus and confirmed what we all already knew  that fox news does not seek out the facts before reporting stories too bad reporters don t bother to seek facts before spewing their bull   here s to you even  fox news   i ve never had a pr team to correct the record for me  so within reason i try to keep up with constant misreporting  but it s impossible to do when i  have a life  and don t waste precious time perusing press clippings here s the full post via facebook as you ll recall  sarah palin was once employed by fox news before they gave her the ax  only for her to return and then leave the position herself  fox news and sarah palin have clearly not always been on good terms but it definitely looks like the gop civil war now includes a newly sparked battle between america s village idiot and the propaganda arm of the republican party  now we just need to grab our popcorn and wait for fox news to respond featured image  flickr
