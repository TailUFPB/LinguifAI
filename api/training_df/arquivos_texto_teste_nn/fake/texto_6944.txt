the  crop of gop clown car candidates is simply awful  we have donald trump  who is a cartoonishly violent bigot with bottom feeding imbecilic bigots for a base of supporters  and we have anti gay  anti woman neanderthal ted cruz  who is hellbent on turning america into his personal evangelical church  then there s john kasich  who is seemingly a bit more moderate  but not really  at any rate  it s not like he stands a snowball s chance in hell at this point of snagging the nomination anyway these sad facts have led to a literal civil war within the republican party  and many whispers that current speaker of the house paul ryan might nose his way into the race at the last minute  should the cleveland convention become contested  there s just one problem with that pipe dream for establishment republicans looking to save their party  though  speaker ryan has absolutely zero intention of running for president on tuesday  ryan said of the prospect of his running in a radio interview  via alan com  i am not going to be the nominee  i don t want to be the nominee   ryan said during a radio interview tuesday   if i wanted to be president  i would have run for president  this is a very scary thing for the gop  because cruz is a universally disliked extremist who is known to do things such as embrace an idiot preacher who once tried to perform an exorcism on president obama  and trump is a flagrant racist and misogynist who gets off on starting wars with female fox hosts with whom he disagrees paul ryan is set to make a statement at   pm cst     pm est  on tuesday to put to rest the untrue rumors that he has any interest whatsoever of attempting to put himself into the oval office due to the fractured nature of his party good luck  gop  looks like your last trojan horse in the  race just dashed all your hopes featured image via getty
