here we go  again another supporter of donald trump openly shouted at a trump rally held in new hampshire on tuesday that president obama was a muslim   and  this time  the only difference we got from trump was a sarcastic reply  which in essence all it did was show his supporters that it s funny to be a racist here s trump pretending to go after one of his supporters for the hateful comment  oh  i m supposed to reprimand the man  who was the man that said that  i have to reprimand  how dare you  okay  i reprimanded him  i reprimanded him  now the press can t be angry  is anyone surprised  we re not  trump has become such a joke that we re tired of even using the word  joke   it s long played out   so is the media  even when he shows a penchant for hateful rhetoric  all the media can do is laugh about it  the shock factor is over  and  the thing is  there was nothing funny about this all cnn and crew could do when announcing this latest b s  was to smile  below is an actual pic taken in context showing what they thought of this latest incident  it s like we re all in some twisted  twilight zone waiting for the rapture  for more on this  visit here  see for yourself pic via cnn the truth is hate sells  trump takes care of the media  and they scratch his back in return  trump didn t lie when he said he was good for business   cheap reality tv  and political theater  calling the president a muslim  it s all good for shits and giggles  and  frankly  this writer is tired of it the real truth is  trump wouldn t go after his supporters for being racist even if he wanted to  that s because  the majority of his supporters are racist  he can t alienate his base  according to a major poll done  a full   of his supporters think obama is a muslim  that s pretty insane  maybe that s why cnn is laughing  they still can t believe this is still actually happening  either
