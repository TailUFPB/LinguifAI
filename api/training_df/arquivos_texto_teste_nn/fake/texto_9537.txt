the former npr ceo ken stern ditches and switches after getting out of the liberal bubble he recently spoke with tucker carlson about his escape from the  liberal bubble   we give him huge credit for ditching the left to come over to the right side stern recently spoke with breitbart s alex marlow stern described himself as a  lifelong democrat  who  spent time in democratic politics  ran npr   and  lived in a  percent democratic ward in a  percent democratic household   concern for the increasing political polarization of the country led him on a journey into red state america to take a clear look at the other side of the political divide he said his  a ha   moment was the latest version of a pledge recited annually by children at a block party in his d c  neighborhood   all are welcome here on hobart street  man or woman  gay or straight  white or black   everyone but republicans  it was a joke  but it wasn t a joke   he said   it really signified  i think  how people are starting to feel about side  for me it said  you know what  something s got to change  at least for me  i live in a democratic bubble  i need to get out there and meet the other half of america and see if they are  deplorables   or if they are americans like me  that s really what this year is about  stern said npr is  different from other media organizations  because its staff lives across the entire country  rather than being concentrated in a few media and political hubs  the new york times  based in new york   percent of their staff will be in new york  npr is actually a membership organization with stations across the country  so it is actually unusual in the sense that it does have representation across the country   he explained  i think the challenge  and i sort of challenged this week in the new york post  is that even though they are geographically distributed  they   like most mainstream journalist organizations   draw from a pool of largely liberal people   he continued   when that happens you risk groupthink  you risk thinking about what stories are important that really don t represent the rest of the country as a whole  stern contended that  bubbling  has become a bipartisan phenomenon   because we are so politically vulcanized   democrats hang out with democrats  republicans hang out with republicans   it is easy to engage in the most vicious stick figure cartoonish depiction of the other side  the washington post did a poll last year  i think  where they asked democrats   give me one word to describe republicans   and they did the same for republicans  the words that came out from both sides were ridiculous  i mean  if you re a republican you re a  bigot   if you re a democrat you re a  traitor   i forget the exact words  but all of the words that came out were really cartoons of the other side   he recalled  i think when hillary clinton said that she thought half the people that supported trump were from the  basket of deplorables   and then apologized for it  i think it does reflect how many people think about conservatives   he said   truthfully  i think it goes both ways  that s a shame because we don t know the other side  stern s journey to the flip side of politics took him  pig hunting in texas  and  going to small assembly of god churches  to meet people with different viewpoints  it meant hanging out in pikeville  kentucky  sort of a declining coal mining community  it meant going to youngstown  ohio  it meant tons of things   he said   the subtitle of the book is  how i left the liberal bubble and learned to love the right   it didn t mean that i agreed with everyone i met  but it meant i met hundreds of people who i admired  and were doing great things in their community  and who in no way reflected the cartoon figure of what middle america looks like  stern said he took issues he was positive he was right about   including  climate change  poverty programs  and guns    and challenged himself by talking with people like gun control skeptic john lott  jr  i went hunting  i went to gun shows  i talked to experts  i did my own research  and i really came away with a very different perspective  because i tried to look at it from other people s points of view  when you do that  you re going to change   he said he recalled pig hunting in george as an especially memorable experience for someone from an urban gun control political environment  as he was tutored in gun safety by an eight year old  and found himself hunting with a diverse group that bore little resemblance to coastal caricatures of rural white men  i m an agnostic jew from washington  dc  i don t have a lot of experiences with evangelicals  so what i knew was from  footloose  and from jerry falwell  who had been dead for ten years by the time i did this   stern said of his foray into church life  culminating in a visit to the urbana conference with some   evangelical youths  i thought they would be like you see in the movies  but these kids were there  they were talking about refugees   how to help them  not how to turn them away  they were talking about diversity on campus  they were talking about how to dedicate their lives to feeding the poor and housing the homeless  it was a really admirable group of people i saw  it taught me that  look  there are  million evangelicals  which means there are  million stories  you just can t bucket everyone in simple ways   he said stern said that media people tend to  cluster in groups and reinforce their own stereotypes  their own confirmation bias  their own groupthink  that s a challenge that s really hard to acknowledge  but hard to deal with  and that s  i think  a fundamental challenge for the cnns and others of the world   he said   but i think in the age of trump they ve also found  if we can be direct about it  conflict is good for business  president trump   it s actually sort of a self reinforcing circle   challenges the  failing new york times  and the new york times responds  and it s great for business for both of them  and that s a problem
