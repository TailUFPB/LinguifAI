it s very hard to pick between ted cruz and donald trump in terms of who would be worse for the country if either were to become the next president  hopefully it won t come to that  but for now  what an embarrassment for the republican party this must be to watch the candidates go after each other  in the latest attempt to attack his rival  texas senator ted cruz claimed that trump has ties to the mob on nbc s meet the press  cruz attacked trump over his tax returns  citing possible reasons why trump is not making them public  cruz went fishing on this one  saying that trump is not revealing his taxes because he s supposedly worth less than mitt romney s few hundred million  then there s the money he allegedly gives to liberal groups  he then threw in the mob tie allegation  he said  maybe he s not s rich as he says he is  maybe mitt romney is richer than donald trump  he can answer that by releasing his taxes  on the other hand maybe it s the case that he s given large sums of money to liberal left wing groups like planned parenthood  you know  he praises planned parenthood in the debates over and over again  maybe he s a big financial supporter of that  all of those questions donald trump can put to rest  you know chuck  maybe it s the case  there have been multiple media reports about donald trump s business dealings with the mob  with the mafia  maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported regardless what the bombshell is  chuck todd seemed startled by the claim and asked if cruz had any evidence  cruz said  abc  cnn  multiple news reports have reported about his business dealings with for example s a construction  which was owned by fat tony salerno who is a mobster who is in jail  it is owned by two of the major new york crime families and that has been reported in multiple media outlets  it s interesting how cruz  a lawyer  can be so dirty as to proclaim trump s alleged mob ties simply because of reports  that s the type of dirty campaign cruz has run thus far  however  there is no sympathy felt for trump and the hope is that the republican candidates can continue to make a mockery of one another featured image via video screen capture
