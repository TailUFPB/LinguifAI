someone we haven t heard a lot from during the course of this year s election cycle is melania trump  wife of presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump  however  wait no longer  because maya rudolph on her new show maya   marty just gave us what we can only assume to be a pretty accurate representation of the wannabe first lady rudolph s melania introduces us to the world of edible diamonds  which are pretty much just regular diamonds that you eat  alongside melania on this new venture is heidi cruz  wife of senator ted cruz  played by the brilliant kate mckinnon from snl the two ladies get together and discuss the presidential race while munching on some of the diamonds  heidi starts by saying   ted would be very upset to know that i m here  so shhh  but truthfully  you know i m quite fond of you  also saying   l love being compared to you   with melania saying   it s so funny because my face is so perfect  and yours is so loose and fun  it s like a broken balloon   the satirized comparison obviously going back to when the two real life women were compared on twitter it s doubtful these women would ever be friends in real life  but watching rudolph and mckinnon together is worth every second of viewing check the hilarious sketch out here featured image via video screen capture
