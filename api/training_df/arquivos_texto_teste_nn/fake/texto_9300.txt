yesterday  the leftist media spent the day wringing their hands in anticipation of finally pinning a russian collusion story on president trump  after general flynn admitted to lying to the fbi about meeting with russian ambassador sergey kislyak  during the trump transition period  it now appears that flynn s testimony is a big nothingburger  in fact  if the media was being honest with the american people  they would be telling them that flynn s admission doesn t hold a candle to the lies former president barack obama s regime was caught telling  barack obama s regime lied about matters that actually were much more serious in nature  many of their lies were about covering up for the deaths of innocent americans  from obama s crooked former ag  eric holder  who lied about the illegal gun running program fast n  furious that was responsible for the death of us border agent brianterry  to the lies his former national security advisor  susan rice told  when she went on a media blitz to knowingly lie  when she told americans the death of  americans in benghazi  was caused by a video  it s got to be pretty bad  when a staunch obama media ally  the washington post  tells him he should fire his cia director  john brennan for lying   from the washington post in march  at the council on foreign relations  cia director john brennan was asked by nbc s andrea mitchell whether the cia had illegally accessed senate intelligence committee staff computers  to thwart an investigation by the committee into  the agency s past interrogation techniques  the accusation had been made earlier that day by sen  dianne feinstein  d calif    who said the cia had  violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the united states constitution   brennan answered as far as the allegations of  you know  cia hacking into  you know  senate computers  nothing could be further from the truth  i mean  we wouldn t do that  i mean  that s   that s just beyond the   you know  the scope of reason in terms of what we would do     and  you know  when the facts come out on this  i think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong watch brennan lie to andrea mitchell here now we know that the truth was far different  the post s greg miller reports cia director john o  brennan has apologized to leaders of the senate intelligence committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners     a statement released by the cia on tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators  agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret cia internal report on the interrogation program  some employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached  between the cia and lawmakers in   when the committee investigation was launched  according to the agency statement  which cited a review by the cia s inspector general  the cia statement was first reported by mcclatchy that committee s investigation is said to be sharply critical of the cia  finding that it exaggerated the effectiveness of harsh interrogation measures and repeatedly misled members of congress and the executive branch  the findings are expected to be released publicly within weeks after briefing committee leaders  brennan  apologized to them for such actions by cia officers as described in the  report   the agency statement said  brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board  led by former sen  evan bayh  d ind    to review the agency employees  conduct and determine  potential disciplinary measures  an apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were brennan or intelligence leaders  first offense  but the track record is far from spotless  in   brennan claimed that dozens of u s  drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian  this remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports   even supporters of the drone program called it  absurd    but as the bureau of investigative journalism and the new york times both reported later  president obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians  as obama s top counterterrorism adviser at the time  brennan would have received these reports as well  so either brennan knew that his claim was a lie  or he is secretly deaf  similarly  brennan denied snooping on senate computers six weeks after feinstein first made the accusation to the cia in private  which means either that he was lying  or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks  then spouted off about it without any real knowledge   hardly the behavior expected of an agency director and last year  director of national intelligence james clapper lied under oath to congress when he told sen  ron wyden  d ore   and the senate intelligence committee that the national security agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of americans  a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former nsa employee edward snowden  despite clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle  the damage to clapper s and the white house s credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and  well  the fact that lying to congress is a crime  though one that s difficult to prosecute   obama has not disciplined clapper in any way
