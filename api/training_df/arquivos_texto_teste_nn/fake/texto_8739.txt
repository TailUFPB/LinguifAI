a rhode island city official has resigned after she was caught dressing up a male middle aged bus driver as a little old lady to  prove  how well her snow shoveling program was helping senior citizens apparently unable to find a single real senior citizen to fill out her press conference  director of senior services sue stenhouse got a man who worked at a nearby senior home to don a wig  earrings  lipstick  and a dress to stand next to her while she bragged about the program  let s just say it was not an effective disguise almost immediately  reporters began to question the ridiculous situation  but the sheer audacity of the stunt was such that initially no one called out stenhouse or the  woman   it was only later that things began to fall apart when nbc affiliate wjar tv reported on the bizarre story  stenhouse grew angry  i ve been in a meeting all night being a great public servant for the city of warwick   stenhouse said   now  i get this  expletive   and you guys did not reach out to me  and that was a big lie on the news  however  just a few days later she was turning in her resignation letter there are  of course  a lot of questions that remain unanswered  why didn t the officials simply ask a resident from the senior home they were standing in front of to join them for the presser  why did they need an elderly woman to be in the shot in the first place  what was she thinking  and did stenhouse get the idea from mrs  doubtfire or a chris farley sketch it s difficult to fathom why stenhouse  who by all accounts had a long and promising career in rhode island politics ahead of her  would torpedo her chances on something so monumentally silly  a few of her colleagues expressed shock and alleged deceit when asked to comment on the incident one theory that seems plausible is that stenhouse s snow removal initiative was struggling thanks to a mild winter  while not her fault  the lack of bad weather meant holding a press conference to brag about snow plowing was going to go down in flames  what followed was a series of desperate decisions worthy of a sit com  according to witnesses  city officials had snow shipped to the front of the senior center and dumped in the background of the press conference  the bus driver turned old woman was just an extension to an already completely fabricated situation  whats one more lie  and a little lipstick  after all featured image via mashable
