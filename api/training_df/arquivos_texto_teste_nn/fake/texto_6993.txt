it isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes  i m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some  i mean the offensively wealthy  multi millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class did you ever wonder   what could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale  the short answer is  we d have about   billion extra per year for the government to use thanks to a leak of the panama papers  which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations  the wealthy and even world leaders  we can now start to answer that question  here are a few examples of what we could do with the money   help to reduce the deficitrepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time  it prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening    billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit  republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy   help to protect the elderlythanks to republican shenanigans  social security has some budget problems  currently  it s experiencing a shortfall of about   billion because people like ronald reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the social security lockbox  rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come    billion extra a year could help resolve the social security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect  year olds from having to work full time jobs   fund universal preschooluniversal pre k would cost about   billion a year  we would actually have money left over from this one  the economic policy institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to  years old for just  percent of their income  the government would pick up the rest of the tab  the plan would end up paying for itself in the long term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system   pay the full salaries of all of our troopsthe pentagon s personnel costs in  totaled   billion dollars  here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare  yet republicans are silent  strangely enough  even the troops don t motivate them on this one  republicans love our troops  right  sadly no  they don t  they only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops   make sure nobody in america goes hungryat its recent peak  food stamps cost   billion dollars in   it has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace  however  instead of screaming  cut  cut  cut   as republicans are inclined to do  we could fully pay for it and have a little over   billion a year left to do other things with here is a chart showing the costs of a few things  and where the extra money falls in comparison  it s so embarrassing  we could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over  but  republicans are bound and determined to make sure america can t have nice things featured image via flickr
