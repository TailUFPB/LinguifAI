are we a post racial nation  no  we re not  no matter what conservatives like to say  and what happened at a seattle starbucks is just further proof of that  dr  bob hughes  an associate dean at seattle university  was sitting with a colleague  just catching up  when an openly racist jerk decided it would be fun to be a completely racist jerk as he walked on past hughes felt something on his hand  and then the guy called his friend a  n      b tch  before walking out   that s right  f  king n      b tch   he called one more time as he walked out the door  the other customers in the starbucks just kind of sat there  doing their own things in a deafening silence that demonstrates how post racial we re not these are two college administrators who were dressed professionally  and just talking inside a starbucks  kuow org published an essay from dr  hughes  in which he said  as my colleague noted  as we waited to file a police report  we both know that we can t dress ourselves out of the perception of who were are in the dominant society  she and i were dressed in the kind of professional attire anyone would expect a college administrator to be wearing in the middle of a work day  are still targets for hate but the young man didn t see educated college administrators sitting at the table  he saw two black people and  in his twisted sense of the rules of life  our socio economic status  educational accomplishments or our age required no respect or deference  in fact  he seemed only to see a woman of color whom he could brazenly assault in an open space with others watching  he went on to explain that it took him back to his childhood in the  and    where he was a black kid growing up in an all white community  and where this kind of racist  hateful behavior was normal because of that  silence from onlookers was normal then  and it appears it s still normal today one woman offered to be a witness  and the manager of the starbucks helped them file a police report  in a truly post racial world  as hughes said  nobody would stand for this  nobody would have just sat there quietly  and yet  we hear all the time from conservatives that black people  and everyone else who talks about racism  are the ones who are the problem because race doesn t matter anymore this wouldn t have happened if race didn t matter anymore the lack of immediate consequences for the young man who did this mean he will do it more and more  without shame and without remorse  hughes says  my guess is that next time  this young man will be more violent  unstopped  antisocial behavior like this escalates  and he lives in a world right now where he felt safe taking these actions  he ll feel even safer doing so if we end up with a president trump  what hughes and his colleague endured is disgusting in  featured image via seattle university
