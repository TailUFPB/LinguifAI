few states in this country can compete with mississippi when it comes to enacting legislation which significantly constricts the rights and liberties of women the lgbt community  minorities  and other marginalized groups most recently a state senate bill     failed to incorporate domestic violence as a justifiable reason for divorce  the state currently allows only  justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce including impotency  adultery  alcoholism  and incurable mental illness among some of the reasons according to a  report conducted by the violence policy center  mississippi ranks  in the nation in the rate of women murdered by men  in the united states  a woman is beaten or assaulted every  seconds  one in three women have been victims of severe physical violence from an intimate partner as some point in their lifetime  a gun being present during a domestic violence situation  where in mississippi there is virtually no gun control  increases the likelihood of a homicide by  percent  according to the u s  department of housing and urban development  domestic violence is the third leading cause of homelessness among families setting justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce is already a ridiculous aspect  but rescinding domestic violence off the list of justifiable reasons gives the abusers in a relationship even more power to abuse and control their victim without any repercussions  domestic violence is rarely an anomaly  rather it is a behavior pattern of an individual    to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation  often including the threat or use of violence  mississippi has caught a lot of negative publicity recently  in addition to north carolina and other southern states  which have either passed or attempted to pass discriminatory laws against the lgbt community  mississippi s gop is disgraceful and they seem bent on trying to get away with passing as many unconstitutional laws as possible featured image courtesy of flickr
