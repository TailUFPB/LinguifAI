yet another conservative is openly expressing his support for the  nevertrump movement   and it s none other than michael reagan  the son of former president ronald reagan on monday  michael took to twitter to tell his followers that he would not be voting for the donald on tuesday  and that he firmly believes that his father would also refrain from voting for the business mogul if he was still alive  of course  reagan was immediately attacked by trump s die hard followers  who tried to argue his claim that the former president wouldn t have backed trump if he were here today  here s how that went twittertwittertwittertwittertwitterreagan is one of an overwhelming amount of republicans abandoning the gop solely because donald trump is the presumptive republican nominee  no one can forget that when trump was announced as the leader in the gop race  conservatives all across the country reacted by burning and tearing up their voter registration cards  in some cases  gop voters left their affiliation with the party altogether reagan has spoken against trump before  with the assertion that his father would not approve of the business mogul being the gop nominee  a few months ago  during an interview with newsmax  reagan slammed trump s campaign  and the republicans who support it  my father would be appalled by what s going on with this campaign  are you a trump republican  or are you a reagan republican  because you cannot be both  the words of reagan s son are particularly humorous considering that trump has compared himself to reagan before  when he claimed he evoke the name ronald reagan   trump said on cbs s face the nation  ronald reagan was a fairly liberal democrat  and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative  and he was not a very conservative person  but he was pretty conservative  and he ended up being a great president  clearly  no one else sees the similarities besides the donald  and many gopers   such as reagan s son   don t have any faith in trump to be  a great president  featured image via wikimedia
