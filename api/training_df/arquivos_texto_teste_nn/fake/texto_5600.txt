when house democrats staged a  hour sit in to protest the house s refusal to take up anything having to do with gun legislation  most people probably didn t expect the gop to throw a tantrum  and then take their balls and go home  however  after the humiliation of the latest fruitless benghazi panel  you d think that they d be a little more skittish about launching more investigations that are politically motivated  you d be wrong  they re about to do it again house gop leaders are looking at launching a frivolous investigation  this time into the house democrats who were involved in last month s sit in  to determine whether they should be punished for it  republicans just can t get past the idea that something is only american  is only patriotic  if they agree with it  very little is more patriotic than civil disobedience  and that s what the sit in was republicans weren t so quick to jump to investigating ted cruz when he and a small cadre of senate members shut down the entire government for  days because of obamacare  or that tea partiers have disrupted other business in both the house and the senate  they and their minions will say that s because cruz   co   and every other republican  didn t break any rules  and house democrats did but at least the democrats didn t bring the entire government to a standstill  it s only when democrats disrupt congress that it s a problem house majority leader kevin mccarthy even said  members of congress  need  to adhere to the rules and the decorum of what is expected of being on the floor  what an odd interest in adhering to the rules all of a sudden  this is the gop that s been having all sorts of fun passing closed rules to block amendments  in fact  they broke the record for the most closed rules in congress  while the party in power can change the rules and make rules all they want  or  at least  that s how that power seems to be used   the house gop has never shown any interest in actually doing things the right way mccarthy believes that this isn t what democracy should look like  and claimed he d never seen such blatant flouting of the rules  oh  please  what absolute bullshit nevertheless  they re looking into whether democrats intimidated the floor staff to break decorum rules so they could engage in a purely political stunt  the purpose of which was to  line their coffers with campaign cash   those are ridiculous allegations on their face  like hillary clinton can t possibly be innocent in benghazi  house democrats can t possibly have actually done this to try and spur movement on gun legislation because that would make the gop look worse than they already do because they can t have this black mark on their record in an election year because admitting a mistake and making good faith efforts to fix it and move forward just aren t the gop s style because the gop is more about political stunts these days than actually working for the people that s what benghazi is for them   a political stunt intended to try and polish an image that s so badly tarnished it s permanently black democrats  and the public in general  are sick to death of congress refusing to do anything anything at all about gun violence in this country  they don t even want to fund research into gun violence as a public health issue because they believe all such research will be politically biased against guns and gun owners  the gop is too far up the nra s ass now to be saved it s a shame republicans can t see past their own haughty  disgustingly dark brown noses with the nra brands on them  they might actually have a chance to remain politically relevant if they d stop with the stunts  plus they d actually be working for the people  imagine that featured image by t j  kirkpatrick getty images
