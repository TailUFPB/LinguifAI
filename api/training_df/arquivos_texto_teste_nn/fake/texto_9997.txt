jesse jackson thinks he s heaven s gatekeeper the arrogant  reverend  proclaimed that president trump might not qualify to enter jesus  kingdom  how dare he jackson made the comments at the  ministers march for justice    trump says you must be able to speak the language of english  be qualified  and have a job skill  jesus would not qualify to come in trump s country he would not qualify to get into jesus  kingdom  jackson used religion to bash trump during the event  he quoted part of a passage from the gospel of matthew  i was hungry  you fed me  naked  you clothed me  captive  you set me free  jackson was referring to the fact that he believes in open borders and welcoming arms for everyone  nice try  it s just not true that a nation can survive without borders  this is typical of the pandering reverend who s been using minorities his entire life to profit off of  he s a grifter along with sharpton who was in attendance of course  these shysters detest trump because they know he s the real deal and will really help all americans
