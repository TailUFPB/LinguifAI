an analysis by the washington post has discovered that in the first four months of   there have been  people in america that have been shot by toddlers  our gun obsessed nation has gotten to the point where deadly weapons in the hands of children too young for kindergarten actually has a body count last year  a washington post analysis found that toddlers were finding guns and shooting people at a rate of about one a week  this year  that pace has accelerated  there have been at least  toddler involved shootings since jan    compared with  over the same period last year in the vast majority of cases  the children accidentally shoot themselves  that s happened  times this year  and in nine of those cases the children died of their wounds toddlers have shot other people five times this year the most recent instance of this problem grabbing national headlines was when a two year old milwaukee child got ahold of a gun carelessly placed on the backseat of a car and shot his mother   year old patrice price  killing her despite these horrific incidents  unacceptable in so much of the advanced  modern world but treated in america as if there s nothing to be done  the will to do anything about guns at the federal level is almost nonexistent intimidated by the nra flexing its muscles to oppose pro gun safety political candidates  republicans and a few democrats in congress have refused to bring up legislation about guns  if any action has occurred  it has been in the states  and largely in states with a large democratic majority in the northeast   which leaves citizens in the rest of the country unprotected thanks to some strategically placed campaign contributions recently the nra s media arm  nra news  went after hillary clinton because she has argued in favor of legislation that the gun lobby opposes  more of that sort of behavior is to be expected in the general election  but they did the same against president obama in  and   obviously unsuccessfully  despite their bravado and paid political attackers  their bark at the polls is far louder than their bite  if politicians ignored the noise  gun legislation could actually pass despite the nra s insistence featured image via youtube
