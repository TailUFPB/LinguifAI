the republican senator who gained infamy last year by attempting to sabotage a historic nuclear deal with iran is back at it again   this time by trying to derail a crucial appropriations bill so america is forced to violate the agreement arkansas sen  tom cotton got the moniker  tehran tom  after he and many of his republican colleagues in the senate sent a brazenly out of line letter directly to the iranian capitol in an effort to convince the country to stop negotiating with president obama  the plan not only backfired  the iranians delighted in mocking the republicans   but it led to a major backlash from across the country  politics may be getting nasty  but it seems betraying your country to score a cheap shot against the president still crosses a major line unable to understand when he has lost  cotton has since been working behind the scenes to undermine the agreement any way he can  this week  he and his loyal band of obstructionists introduced an amendment intentionally meant to rankle relations between the two countries  cotton had tried to bar the purchase of  heavy water produced in iran   heavy water is  a component of making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy   part of the deal with iran involved the country handing over its stock of heavy water  to show they were serious about ending their nuclear program    but cotton doesn t want america to take it  why  because then the deal would actually work needless to say  the white house was furious  at a press conference  press secretary josh earnest let cotton have it  so it is clear what the intent of his amendment is  senator cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water  i m confident that he couldn t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water  his focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  cotton is fast becoming a single issue politician  the time and energy he pours into trying to hurt iran united states relation borders on pathological  even many of his colleagues  some of whom signed his letter in   have given up thinking they can stop this agreement  not tehran tom  he keeps plugging away on twitter  cotton did not take the news of his white house dress down well  he suggested that he  a sitting united states senator  isn t aware the existence of  sparkling water  because he was in the military   a claim many found  dubious as for you  presssec   you re right  i don t know much about sparkling water  it isn t served in army  unlike in your ritzy west wing   tom cotton   sentomcotton  april    cotton can get some of his lobbyist friends to send him a few bottles featured image via mark wilson getty images
