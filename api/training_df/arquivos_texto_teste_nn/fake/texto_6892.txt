with all the candidates from both parties in new york preparing for the primary next tuesday  it s no surprise that they are making the late night talk show rounds  appearing on the tonight show with jimmy fallon  ted cruz  got a call  from  donald trump  offering him advice for the show appearance  and questioning him about some of his policy positions as crazy as cruz is  the sketch actually turned out pretty funny with digs being taken at both the gop candidates  one of the funniest moments was when cruz mentioned that the party is starting to unify behind him  yet trump cut in to remind cruz that the party is also unifying behind himself   unifying against him  which is becoming more and more obvious as the weeks and months go by leading up the republican national convention in cleveland  ohio when  trump  questioned cruz on his  new york values  remark  cruz responded by saying that what he meant to say was that he  values new york   but he was just speaking like yoda from star wars at one point in the sketch trump was offering cruz some advice on how to get around new york  when trump asked the texas senator if he was writing it down  cruz responded in the affirmative  but then pulled out a bottle of booze  poured himself a glass  and then took a sip  something that likely needs to be done while speaking with the actual donald trump  or for that matter  cruz as well all in all  no matter how much you may loathe cruz  and if you re like me you loathe cruz  it was still a pretty damn funny sketch with fallon s trump getting better and better  however  hopefully after november we won t need to see him play the republican frontrunner anymore  because a democrat is going to win watch the silly sketch here featured image via video screen capture
