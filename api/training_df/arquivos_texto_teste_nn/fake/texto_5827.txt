a rainbow flag raised to honor the lgbt victims in the worst mass shooting in american history is in danger of being removed from the hillsborough county center in tampa bay  florida  because a republican official said she talked to a christian  singular  who said the flag was  unbearable   priorities the pride flag was raised just hours after hillsborough s commissioners voted   to hang the flag for the remainder of the month both in acknowledgement of it being pride month and in honor of the victims of orlando  many of whom were lgbt and whose killer was reportedly vehemently anti gay rather than see this as a symbol of unity during the wake of a national tragedy  one republican commissioner  stacy white  decided to make this all about fake christian oppression  apparently  just seeing the rainbow colors has caused one of her constituents to feel like she can t even drive to work  in an email sent to her fellow commissioners  white complains about how the rainbow flag might be harming those with  strong christian values  warning  her letter is bonkers my office recently received an anonymous phone call from a county employee stating that  because of her strong christian beliefs  it will be nearly unbearable for her pass the  pride  flag each morning as she enters the workplace  she clearly indicated that the display of that flag  for her  has created a hostile work environment my question is  given the nature of this employee complaint  has the board s action taken this past wednesday created any issues for the county from a human resources perspective  if the display of this flag exposes the county any liability whatsoever  i request that it be taken down on the basis that the board s action has violated the workplace rights of some of our employees white closed her letter out by referring to the pride flag as a  divisive  politically charged symbol  inappropriate for  our workplace  in a country that still routinely displays a flag used in the civil war to rally around slavery on state property  you may need a microscope and a very steady hand to create a violin small enough to play for white s pity party here  it s also particularly astounding that republicans can somehow take a hate crime perpetuated on  mostly  lgbt latinos and somehow make it all about them ironically  in the days after the shooting  republicans shamelessly attempted to leverage the raw emotions of the lgbt community to make the  frankly insulting  pitch that the gay community should vote for republicans because they could keep them safe from muslims  the lgbt community  having had decades of experience in picking up on when they are being pandered to  gave the gop a resounding middle finger and instead demanded america solve a much more dangerous problem  guns apparently  having realized gay people weren t taking the bait  republicans have reverted back to bashing them instead  now  just a week after the shooting  commissioner stacy white is unflinchingly accusing a symbol of their pride of being  unbearable  to christians  in several other republican dominated counties across america  officials have also refused to honor president obama s request to lower their flags to half mast based on technicalities  an obnoxious form of grandstanding meant to signal to their most bigoted voters that they don t really like gay people  so please don t vote them out thankfully in hillsborough at least the other commissioners seem to have an ounce of common decency  faced with white s pitiable letter  they kindly told her to shove it featured image via justin sullivan getty images
