a  year old boy has just gone viral for absolutely shredding every anti vaxxer s argument against vaccinating children the boy  who goes by the name marco arturo  is a science loving video blogger who uses his facebook page to share his findings and ignite discussions related to science  his latest video was a major hit  and has left the young boy shocked that his  minute video has been seen by more people than the population of bahamas  belize  greenland  monaco  bermuda and dominica combined   his educational message to anti vaxxers has been viewed millions of times  and when you watch it  you will understand why marco begins the video addressing two major concerns being proposed by anti vaxxers  that vaccines are to blame for autism  and that they re part of a government conspiracy  marco says  we ve all been lied to by doctors and pharmaceutical companies about vaccines  after a lot of research i realized that vaccines do and will cause autism  at first it sounds like marco is taking their side  but if anti vaxxers thought they d just found their youngest recruit  they re dead wrong  seconds later  marco holds up a folder labeled evidence that vaccines cause autism  stating that he will explain his findings  page by page   by now  anti vaxxers are probably salivating all over themselves  eager to hear the scientific proof that their ridiculous theories are correct  however  when marco opens the folder  all of the pages are blank  marco explains  i think it might be because there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that vaccines are linked to autism in any way whatsoever  to make anti vaxxers even more furious that they d been tricked so expertly  marco stresses how important vaccines are  and what they re really responsible for  saving the lives of millions of children  marco closes by begging parents to get their children vaccinated  and reiterates that there is no evidence that can link vaccines to autism in closing  marco notices that one of the pages actually does have something on it  which might get gullible anti vaxxers  hopes up once again  the page says one word   mic   and marco drops it here s marco s brilliant video featured image via screenshot
