fox host sean hannity lost his cool during a radio interview with ted cruz yesterday  as the gop candidate tried to dodge answering questions that might actually be helpful to voters hannity  who is a trump supporter  brought up the way cruz s campaign handled delegates  stating that it baffled many  and possibly being annoyed that cruz was more prepared to win over delegates than trump   cruz completely avoided answering the question  and actually told hannity he didn t think people cared about that  hannity pushed back  insisting that millions of his followers wanted to know because they  find this whole process confusing  once again  the gop s least likable republican dismissed hannity s question  claiming that the only people who cared were on trump s team  cruz must have gotten hannity s blood boiling  because then the fox host blew up  he said  senator  why do you do this  every single time no  you gotta stop  every time i have you on the air  and i ask a legitimate question  you try to throw this in my face  i m getting sick of it  i ve had you on more than any other candidate on radio and tv  so if i ask you a legitimate question to explain to the audience  why don t you just answer it  cruz s response was equally testy as he shot back  sean  can i answer your last question without being interrupted   then he made a half ass attempt to respond to hannity s question  but insisted that  as i travel the country  nobody is asking me this  other than the trumpsters and the people repeating it  hannity wasn t satisfied and continued to press the texas senator  stating that  it s a simple question  it s not a trump question  you could tell that both men had gotten under each other s skin  because at one point in the interview  hannity said to cruz  senator  i don t know why you re mad  and cruz insisted that he wasn t mad  he was just annoyed that they were talking  only about the nonsense  instead of policy here s the intense interview  via the sean hannity show the interview clearly left hannity with a bad taste in his mouth  because when the interview was over he took to twitter to blast the candidate twittertwittertwitterhannity is known for giving pretty mild interviews to republicans  but he was obviously no match for cruz s ability to annoy anyone he comes in contact with featured image via gerardo mora   getty images
