 bubba  bill clinton celebrated his election  years ago at very liberal  georgetown university  he made the usual slams against president trump that we expect nowadays and then turned to gun violence in america he bemoaned the state of gun violence and then he pivoted to made this very baffling claim about muslims and  native born  americans president clinton also said   in spite of the horrible killings in san bernardino and fort hood  and what happened in new york city just a few days ago  the aggregate murder rate of muslims is one third that of the native born  how many people know that  if all your neighbours knew it  would it make a difference  how nice except it s not true  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src    https   connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    bill clinton   good news is important to make good decisions  the aggregate murder rate of muslims is one third that of the native born  how many people know that  bill clinton gives his view that when talking about immigration  good news is important to make good decisions  posted by channel  news on tuesday  november    s an eye catching statistic  but we can t find any evidence that it s true  reported president clinton appears to be blurring two different concepts when he talks about a  murder rate of muslims  compared to  the native born   he is confusing religion with immigration status here  and the two groups are not mutually exclusive  clearly  you can be a native born american muslim  so it s not absolutely clear what he means  but we can only presume from the context that he is saying muslims   perhaps muslim immigrants specifically   are less likely to murder people than others there are two official sources of national homicide statistics in the us  the fbi and the center for disease control and prevention  neither of these organisations records the religion of the offender  so it s not possible to construct a  murder rate of muslims  from official figures so did clinton just read this and deduce what he wanted to or did some low level staffer offer this as fact  we ll probably never know but this calls attention to the blithering bs that the clinton grifters dole out on a regular basis  another recent gem was on a late night talk show where he claimed that we must fill america with more third world refugees so we can truly feel sufficiently diverse as a nation what is he smoking  our state department has issued over   foreign visas to people from terror sponsored nations since   yes  we re covered up in muslim refugees we get it  the goal is to change america s demographic which will change elections so more democrats will win correct  it s that  fundamental  change obama was working on for  years open borders  refugees  diversity lottery we get it and that s why we voted for donald trump  just listen to this globalist elitist continue the narrative that mass migration is great does he really believe this  we don t know if he does but we do know that he wants you to believe it so the dems will have more votes and cheap labor  yes  those democrats they really have your back  don t they read more
