bill maher and his guests took an opportunity during bill s show real time  to delight in the many failings of the most unsuccessful half term governor in american history  sarah palin this night  like many others  was not kind to caribou barbie  bill and the guests began with a criticism of trump for continuing to use sarah palin as his media mouthpiece  bill compared sarah to the  billy bass  talking fish decoration in an amazingly accurate way   the novelty has worn off  we can t remember why it was fun to begin with  and yet it keeps talking and quite frankly  it looks like it s on meth  after some accurate criticisms of palin  bill made his way into the announcement that sarah is actually becoming a rapper  he d noticed recently that sarah s speeches have been taking on something of a  different  tone  and they included a lot of rhyming words  showing examples in a video clip he had prepared as if the video was not hilarious enough  bill then presented sarah s debut rap album  the miseducation of sarah palin  with a track list that includes  boyz in my daughter    me  so honky   and  fear of a black planet  no seriously  i m terrified of black people   while we can all sit and laugh at the daily exercise in embarrassment that is sarah s life  it does highlight an important point  the person who is probably going to be the republican presidential nominee had the poor judgement to not only accept her endorsement  but he literally took her with him on the campaign  it s like  all over again  why doesn t anyone understand how bad she is for trump to one day announce that his entire campaign was an elaborate prank to embarrass republicans would be hilarious  but not surprising  it s the only way to explain it watch the funniest compilation of sarah palin in months below featured image via video screen capture
