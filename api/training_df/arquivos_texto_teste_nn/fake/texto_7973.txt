the ku klux klan had quite a year in    the racist hate group made an unprecedented comeback and more than doubled its membership last year   all thanks to the bigotry and hateful rhetoric of the conservative party and one republican presidential candidate in particular although gop front runner donald trump denies that he s affiliated with the kkk  there s no denying that the racist club has seen a substantial increase ever since trump came onto the political scene  this was proven in a recent report by the southern poverty law center  called the year in hate and extremism  the organization discovered that   saw an apparent comeback of klan groups    a  percent increase in kkk membership to be exact  all thanks to trump in   membership had only increased by    but in  membership had skyrocketed up to  despite the fact that two prominent kkk groups had shut down that year  even with the disappearance of the fraternal white knights of the ku klux klan and the knight rider knights of the ku klux klan  there was still a  increase increase in active hate groups   something the report says was due to worsening income inequality  the rise of left wing movements like black lives matter  major advances for lgbt people and growing numbers of refugees and undocumented workers that have angered republicans and white people  the report blames the gop for the rise in hate groups  and believes trump is largely responsible  the report says  the bulk of that anger is coming from beleaguered working class and  to a lesser extent  middle class white people  especially the less educated the very same groups that most vociferously support trump  being that trump is a racist that supports white supremacists and his supporters are basically just like him  the report said that trump served as a mainstream channel for some of america s most racist and awful people to air their bigotry without much consequence  trump has been given almost unrestricted access to americans  allowing everyone to be exposed to his rhetoric  such voters are nostalgic for the country they lived in  years ago  when non hispanic whites made up more than  percent of the population  today  their share has shrunk to  percent as demographic change has transformed the united states into a nation where others have a shot at power  trump  who has become infamous for his anti latino and islamophobic views  was blamed for fueling the radical right  and encouraging more hateful views  and to prove just how much the presidential candidate resonates with kkk members  here s a video of trump being confronted about an endorsement from kkk great wizard david duke featured image is a screenshot
