with the nation focused on anti lgbt  religious liberty  battles  a mississippi landlord has done something that brings focus back to one of our nation s prior fights over  religious liberty    the right to discriminate against interracial couples  in   a poll taken among republicans in the red state of mississippi revealed that a shocking  percent of them want to ban interracial marriages outright in   then mississippi governor theodore bilbo wrote that urity of race is a gift of god   and god  in his infinite wisdom  has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity  it can never be redeemed  and that god  was the original segregationist   he may be dead  and african americans may have rights now   including the freedom to marry anyone they choose  that they did not have when bilbo was in charge  but his spirit lives on in rv park landlord gene baker  who admitted over the weekend that he evicted an interracial couple simply because they were an interracial couple  me and my husband  not ever in  years have we experienced any problem   said erica flores dunahoo  who is hispanic and native american   nobody s given us dirty looks  this is our first time   her husband  a former national guardsman of more than a decade  is black   something that bothers the racist landlord s friends  neighbors  and church in february  dunahoo and her husband  standley hoskins  and their two children were set to move into an rv sace to save money and  get our life on track   the lighter half of the interracial couple explained  on february   she gave baker a check for   to pay for a month s rent  this should have been the end of it   she paid her rent and inexchange she should have been allowed to stay  in fact  there were no problems that first day  he was real nice   she said   he invited me to church and gave me a hug  i bragged on him to my family  unfortunately  the next morning  baker called her  fuming dunahoo told him that she didn t realize it would be a problem  it is  after all    oh  it s a big problem with the members of my church  my community and my mother in law  baker told her   they don t allow that black and white shacking  we re not shacking  we re married   she replied  but baker would have none of it  explaining that  it s the same thing  you don t talk like you wouldn t be with no black man   the church going  christian  continued   if you would had come across like you were with a black man  we wouldn t have this problem right now  dunahoo explained that her husband is not a  thug   and told baker of his distinguished and lengthy service to our country  but that didn t matter to the landlord  all he saw was black  he returned the   and forced them to leave  they took refuge at another rv park  where rent is higher     a month baker maintains that he is not a racist  telling the clarion ledger that he only refused to provide a space to the couple because of the issues members of his church and community had with a black man and a light skinned woman shacking   he even says they would be welcome to attend his church  they just could not be members  because the church does not believe in interracial marriage to avoid future issues  he plans to completely close his rv park down just in case he ever encounters another interracial couple who wishes to rent a space  i m closing it down  and that solves the problem  recently  the mississippi state senate passed a  religious liberty  bill allowing businesses to deny service to the lgbt community   just like they used to do  and some individuals currently still do  with interracial couples hate is hate   and unfortunately the state of mississippi is full of it  apparently watch a report on this blatant and unabashed act of discrimination below featured image via screengrab
