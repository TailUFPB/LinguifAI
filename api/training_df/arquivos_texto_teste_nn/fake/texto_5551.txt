following the horrific turn of events in dallas  obama addressed the country and mentioned that at some point we are going to have to really think about the  powerful weapons  that make shootings like this so deadly  any guess what happened next  just as expected  right wingers totally lost their damn minds the president said he was  horrified  by the  vicious  calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement   after expressing his support for law enforcement  obama turned his attention to the guns that allow mass shootings like this to take the so many lives in mere minutes we also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons  unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic  and in the days ahead  we re going to have to consider those realities as well predictably  republicans went into full on freak out mode  within an hour of president obama s remarks  ben carson was throwing a hissy fit on fox news  now is definitely not the time to get political   said the failed presidential hopeful turned trump fanboy   now is the time to use logic and ask ourselves  why do we have a constitution  why do we have a second amendment  they re always saying you don t need a high powered weapon to hunt deer  the constitution is not about deer hunting  it s about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion  carson said that if he were president  he would ask everyone to  imagine  or  hours with no police  what would your life be like  yes  there are some bad apples and  yes  we will find ways to deal with them but in no way do we indict the entire police force   carson said speaking of the tragic shooting in dallas that took the lives of five police officers and left six more wounded  carson said that there are terror cells  and  professional agitators all over our country looking for opportunities  and these opportunities do arise  they will continue to arise because  you know  there are bad apples in the police force like there are bad apples in everything  there are bad surgeons   the retired neurosurgeon said   but the vast majority of surgeons are wonderful people  so  you know  these opportunities will continue to happen and they will continue to do these things  but i guess the real issue is  you know  the president s going to start saying  see  gun control  former arkansas gov  mike huckabee took the opportunity to pounce on the president s comments as well  arguing on fox news that obama should have addressed the nation more like ronald reagan did after the  challenger disaster  he doesn t need to inject the divisive arguments like gun control at a time of great grief for the nation  and he ought to do for us what ronald reagan did after the challenger disaster   huckabee said colorado republican senate candidate darryl glenn just had to jump on the bandwagon  saying that obama needs  to be very careful not to get too far ahead of the facts  but you need to be careful not to drive your policy agenda  william johnson  the executive director of national association of police organizations  was asked on fox news if police officers feel increasingly under siege and targeted  absolutely  it s a horrible day  it s a war on cops   johnson responded   and the obama administration is the neville chamberlain of this war  i think their continued appeasement at the federal level with the department of justice  their appeasement of violent criminals  their refusal to condemn movements like black lives matter  actively calling for the death of police officers  that type of thing  all the while blaming police for the problems in this country has led directly to the climate that has made dallas possible  speaking about the deaths of alton sterling and philando castile just hours before thursday s mass shooting in dallas  president obama had tried to strike a balance between the public outrage over the police killings and support for law enforcement  to be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement   he said   when people say black lives matter  it doesn t mean blue lives don t matter  featured image via jim lo scalzo pool getty images
