iconic liberal news anchor lawrence o donnell is clearly not happy   and he has every right to be yet again  his  lean forward  bosses at msnbc opted to cut his show so that they could run a live feed of a donald trump stump speech  it wasn t  news   it wasn t even  new   it was just donald trump  up at the podium  saying the kind of disgusting things he always says  msnbc gave over their network for that  msnbc silenced one of their star anchors for that needless to say  viewers were furious  so too was o donnell because the anchor is in many ways the face of his or her program  many of msnbc s disgruntled fans took out their frustrating on o donnell  on twitter  his account was innundated with negative responses  many couldn t believe they were watching msnbc hand over free advertising to trump  many just wanted to know why o donnell wasn t on like they had hoped rather than toe the network line and give a weak defense of why trump just had to be given the air time  o donnell threw the script away and began sympathizing with his fans  msnbc screwed up  they have repeatedly screwed up during this election  they need to own this      i tried to make it clear that wasn t my decision   lawrence o donnell   lawrence  april       i don t like it   lawrence o donnell   lawrence  april     joeleydon     i understand  completely   lawrence o donnell   lawrence  april    an act of defiance  or maybe a hope that maybe his bosses might see reason   o donnell also began tweeting media critics who have repeatedly slammed networks for their unabashed love affair with trump  s ratings  media  we re not enabling donald breaking news  donald trump giving same stump speech he s been giving for months pic twitter com   angelo carusone   goangelo  april    truly may be unprecedented in the tv era  one candidate  and one candidate only  given massive free air time by media giants   joe adalian   tvmojoe  april    other anchors  o donnell is rightfully fed up with allowing the tail to wag the dog  rather than report the news  msnbc has settled on chasing trump from campaign event to campaign event in the hopes that viewers will tune in  it s given the republican candidate unprecedented amounts of free air time  he doesn t even have to spend money on advertising because huge networks give it away for free and instead of trying to rein in the absurd status quo  msnbc has shown signs that it will only get worse  already the network tossed one of their fiercest liberal hosts  melissa harris perry  because they needed more time for trump live feeds  they ve recently begun hinting that they will be expanding their conservative morning show  morning joe  in an effort to entice both trump and his fans to check out the network  host joe scarborough is a well known trump fan making the relationship between the republican candidate and the network even more inexcusable did the media  create  donald trump  the answer is complicated  certainly  trump s racist and sexist fans were already around  just waiting for a candidate to say all the right things to them  but there can be no question that the media has enabled trump  every phone interview  every campaign rally  every panel discussion about trump s  viability  makes trump s star rise  there is no such thing as bad publicity  and nobody gets publicity   good and bad   like trump kudos to o donnell for taking a stand against this betrayal of integrity featured image via screengrab
