a couple of days ago a woman in washington was shot while watching the benghazi movie   hours  and thanks to the united states  obsession with guns  we are now learning that the shooter  dane gallion    had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting according to the seattle times dane gallion    told officers he took the gun to regal cinemas  at the landing on thursday night because he was  concerned about recent mass shootings in public places   according to a police account in a probable cause statement released saturday that same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband  the statement says think about that for a minute  our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies  he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself we all know that the  good guy with a gun  rhetoric that the national rifle association and republicans like to spew is complete nonsense  but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws  a great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters this  of course  doesn t excuse the shooting  it definitely should have never happened  a gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen  frankly  gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid  after all  paranoia makes people do reckless things however  it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country  personally  i have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time i go to the movies too  or when i drop my elementary school aged child off at school  how sad is that  we live in a country that prides itself on its  freedom   but how free are we featured image  youtube
