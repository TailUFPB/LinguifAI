consider this john kasich s  binders full of women  moment  the exact second he reminded the entire country that his views of women are antiquated and misogynistic at a campaign stop in fairfax  virginia  kasich was making the pitch to a  nearly empty  room of supporters when he went off script to remark that his success in politics was due to   wait for it   women having the courage to leave the kitchen and come help him get elected  we just got an army of people  and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me  it was an incredibly daft remark  especially from a candidate who is sitting so low in the polls that he can t afford to alienate even a single voter much less  percent of the country needless to say  the juvenile  women spend their time in the kitchen   comment was greeted with one of kasich s own supporters turning on him  a woman in the crowd aptly summarized the reaction many probably had when she told kasich  first off  i want to say  your comment earlier about the women  came out of the kitchen to support you  i ll come out to support you  but i won t be coming out of the kitchen  a flustered kasich is left sputtering meekly  his chances  already grim  becoming more remote by the second making things worse  kasich spent the weekend signing a disgusting bill into law that will go after women s rights in ohio  the bill  intended to attack planned parenthood  will strip funding for vital procedures like std testing  cancer screenings  and birth control from women s health clinics that also perform abortions  and due to the fact that no federal money goes to abortions in the first place  the budget cuts won t affect abortions  they ll affect everything else  just one more way kasich and his party have found to cause damage to women s health as part of their fanatical quest to take down planned parenthood ironically  kasich has promoted himself as the moderate choice for the republican party  he s repeatedly argued that america should vote for him over the likes of trump and rubio because he isn t  quite  as crazy  with his views of women s role in the home  in the kitchen  of course   and his quest to make it harder for them to receive health care  it s becoming a laughable premise  kasich is no moderate  he s just typically better at hiding his misogyny featured image via youtube
