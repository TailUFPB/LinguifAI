at this point  jeb bush s campaign is nothing short of pathetic  recently  the would be third president in the bush dynasty surely received a rude awakening when he had to beg a new hampshire crowd to clap for him unfortunately  even though his own mother doesn t think he should be president  bush refuses to give up  with no chance to win unless almost every single one of his primary opponents spontaneously combusts   or unless he possesses some sort of supernatural ability like mind control   jeb doesn t stand a chance but what if rand paul s supporters join him  paul recently dropped out of the race after a humiliating fifth place finish  paul finished fifth among the gop candidates with a rather unimpressive   of the vote  with thousands more supporters than bush  who finished sixth  late night host jimmy kimmel took a moment wednesday to imagine a fantastical world in which jeb has a chance to finish fourth in a primary  jeb bush is still running  but he doesn t know what to do   kimmel said   you know  if he loses  he can t go home because his father and brother will laugh at him  i guess he s hoping that some of the people who supported candidates who are dropping out will get on board with him   fallon plays a mock ad encouraging those who wanted to  stand with rand  to instead  ebb with jeb  jeb s still running  and he desperately needs your vote   the narrator says   if we join forces  who know   we might just make it to fourth place  unfortunately  bush is so wildly unpopular that even if paul s supporters instead joined forces with him in iowa  he would have finished fifth behind ben carson anyway  he s just that terrible  you have to admit though   with truly memorable gop contenders like whatsisname  some guy  and another person dropping like birds in an acid storm  it takes a lot of guts for someone so grossly unqualified  unlikable  and pathetic to even consider staying in the race watch this hilarious segment below featured image via screengrab
