repeat after me  there are no gun  accidents  there  are  no  gun  accidents  people all too often die unintentionally   like when  responsible  gun owners leave their weapons lying around and children find them   and while these situations are often called accidents  the true issue is negligence  simply put  nothing would have happened in many  if not most  accidental  shootings if the gun wasn t present in the first place   or  at minimum  if the owners of the weapons actually cared about gun safety the nra regularly promotes the lie that all people who own firearms are  responsible     good guys with guns  who stand ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger  if they manage to help out without shooting the victim of a crime in the head  that is  once again  one of the saviors of mankind  accidentally  discharged a firearm and took another human s life  on saturday  a gun store owner in amelia  ohio was murdered  yes  murdered  when someone taking a concealed weapons class was negligent with his gun  an unnamed participant  whose identity  as is normal  is being protected  in a class at the kayjay gun shop   someone who already owned a gun and wanted to carry it around with him everywhere he or she goes was practicing weapon malfunction drills with a handgun that was  for some reason  loaded during a training exercise  the weapon fired and struck shop owner james baker in the neck friends describe baker  whose shop repairs and engraves firearms  has authorization to manufacture weapons  and is licensed to sell military grade guns like the one that was used to slaughter fifty people in orlando  florida  as a  special  person who was  loved by the whole community  as always  the media and police are treating this as though it was an actual accident  like tripping while walking down the sidewalk  the reality is that this was no accident  and it is time that we stop treating it as such  this was murder  sure  the person did not intend for it to happen   just like if someone is negligent while driving a car and runs someone over  in the latter case  at least the killer would be charged with a crime   something that rarely happens in  accidental  shootings the investigation is still ongoing  but we can expect two things to happen  no charges will be filed  after all  it is already being called an  accident    and second amendment advocates will flock to excuse this  accident  before forgetting about it entirely perhaps it s time that we end the madness  maybe  just maybe  we need to reconsider if the second amendment should exist in the first place watch a report on this latest  accident  below featured image via screengrab
