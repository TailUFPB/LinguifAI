nobody seemed more desperate to win iowa by sheer force of will than rick santorum  the perennial republican also ran staked his entire campaign on convincing enough ultra conservative iowans that he was their guy  and didn t just come up short   he hardly came up at all but if iowan voters didn t know santorum was running  the hapless employees at the state s ubiquitous pizza ranch restaurants sure did  for some reason   some very  very insane reason   santorum decided to almost exclusively stump in the pizza chain s locales  by the close of the primary  santorum had racked up an impressive  or sad  depending on how you look at it   visits  that s nearly two visits per location cnn s chris moody covered the santorum s iowa bid  and while he clearly tried to remain objective   and we give them an  a  for effort  really   his recollection of santorum s sad campaign radiates a sense of bafflement and failure about forty die hard santorumites joined together in a private room at a pizza ranch restaurant  the evening was full of nostalgia  sadness and hope  and a pinch of denial  to celebrate a man who hosted more than  events in the hawkeye state  it has been an honor  it really has   santorum said   i hope we have another opportunity  but my guess is that when we come in on air force one  we re not going to have these types of deals because we re going to have a country to run  the crowd laughed  lovingly  knowing that what he said wasn t true and probably would never be there may be nothing more fatalistic than holding what is probably your last campaign rally in the back room of a greasy pizza shop and joking about how someday you may be unable to come in because you re too busy on air force one  it s never going to happen   that s the punchline to twist the knife of failure just a little bit harder  santorum s pizza ranch base of operation is actually already spoken for  the company s ceo  adrie groeneweg  announced just weeks ago that he would be endorsing trump groeneweg has never endorsed a candidate before and he has also never caucused   it was just something my dad has always done   he explained  this year  groeneweg said he d go to caucus for trump in february hilariously  trump didn t even have to show up beforehand  in trademark fashion  trump only decided he liked pizza ranch after he learned the ceo endorsed him meanwhile  all the pizza slices in the state couldn t buy santorum some love but there is one silverlining to this story  taking pity on poor santorum  pizza ranch did throw him a bone  they gave him a t shirt and made him an  honorary employee  rick santorum is made an honorary pizza ranch employee pic twitter com   ben jacobs   bencjacobs  february    that he ll have time to do as much pizza cooking and toilet scrubbing as he may want to  what with flying on air force one and all featured image from twitter
