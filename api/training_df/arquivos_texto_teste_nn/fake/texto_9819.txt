outspoken conservative paul joseph watson is  as usual   spot on  with his analysis of what is happening today with the overpaid  petulant athletes in the nfl who are  taking a knee  during our national anthem  as a way to protest the  injustices  against blacks by cops  watson points out that while they re protesting the deaths of blacks at the hands of cops in their communities  they completely ignore the rampant black on black crime and the actual high crime rates by blacks in the cities where the alleged  injustices  are taking place  watson also claims the nfl players are ignoring the fact  that white people are more likely to be shot dead by cops  than blacks this week  nfl players and even some coaches  turned their ire against president donald trump for daring to suggest that nfl owners should be taking disciplinary action against players who disrespect our flag that represents the lives sacrificed by so many brave men and women who died giving them the right to protest paul joseph watson reminds americans how prevalent violence is with many of the  thugs  who play in the nfl  watson even suggests   maybe they all hate the police so much because the cops are the only ones stopping them from beating up their own wives and girlfriends  this new incarnation of  take a knee  isn t about protesting police murders of black people   there haven t even been any high profilee cases of that for months   it isn t about patriotism  it isn t about free speech   it s just the latest manifestation of mass hysteria of trump derangement syndrome  watch
