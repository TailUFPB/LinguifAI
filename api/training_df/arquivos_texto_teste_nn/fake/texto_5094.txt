sean hannity told a massive lie to make donald trump look like a hero and he got busted for it by real journalists in may  the fox news host published an article on his website claiming that the republican nominee sent his planes to give transportation home to  united states marines who were stranded at camp lejeune in north carolina in  after they returned from the gulf war  trump even touted the story of his supposed generosity and heroics  the trump campaign has confirmed to hannity com that mr  trump did indeed send his plane to make two trips from north carolina to miami  florida to transport over  gulf war marines back home   hannity bragged not so fast  says the washington post according to wapo  not only is trump fibbing about sending his plane to help the marines  he had absolutely nothing to do with helping the troops as usual  hannity relied on a source who passed along rumors that trump sent his plane to pick up the marines  cpl  ryan stickney told a story that he heard from someone else that  mr  trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us  wapo noted  however  that trump s private plane was certainly not involved because it was the wrong color and only had enough seats for  people  basically  trump s own plane would have had to make ten trips or he would have to have owned ten planes  and let s face it  trump s not that rich in fact  it was a pair of boeing  from trump s failed airline with a capacity of  seats each that came to save the day and those had already been contracted out to the military long before they were needed at camp lejeune  it turns out when trump bought the shuttle  trump shuttle  from eastern airlines  he made a bad deal  accepting an additional five planes instead of a lower purchase price because the market had turned south   the post reports   so some of those extra planes were contracted out to the u s  military to ferry personnel in the united states during operations desert shield storm in    so trump is taking credit for something he had no part of and hannity is lying in order to make the candidate he backs look good wapo even spoke to lt  general vernon kondra  the man in charge of all airlift operations  and he didn t hesitate to swat down the claim that trump personally came to the rescue kondra said the notion that trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense   i certainly was not aware of that  it does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that  it would not fit in with how we did business   he told the fact checker   i don t even know of how he would have known there was a need  in conclusion  wapo slammed hannity for not doing his homework and for reporting rumors as facts and gave trump the maximum number of pinocchios despite the rumors on base  it s clear that trump had nothing to do with the dispatch of the jet to the troops stranded at camp lejeune  the aircraft that ferried the troops was part of the trump shuttle fleet  at a time when trump barely had control over the airline and was frantically trying to negotiate deals with bankers to prevent the collapse of his business empire trump shuttle had a contract with the military  and this flight home was part of that contract  simple as that sean hannity needs to prominently correct this article  the trump campaign  meanwhile  earns four pinocchios for confirming a story that is easily debunked thus far  hannity has not thrown a temper tantrum about being outed as liar  but stay tuned  it s likely he may very well do so since he has a problem with facts and the real journalists who report them featured image via screen capture
