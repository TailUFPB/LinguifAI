there are many certainties in life  grass is green  water is wet  if you place an electric eel in your bathwater and climb in  the results will not be positive  ted cruz is a liar  recently  cruz played a trick even dirtier than sending out a campaign mailer falsely accusing iowans of  voting violations  that feature  data  the campaign completely made up  continuing his tradition of never telling the truth about a single thing  he convinced people rival ben carson had dropped out of the race  the press is reporting that dr  ben carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after iowa and making a big announcement next week   team cruz said in a campaign email   please inform and carson caucus goers of this news and urge them to caucus for cruz  cruz has  numerous times  cited faulty reporting by cnn as the reason his lackeys immediately began spreading the  news  that dr  brain had quit  in reality  the rumor came from rep  steve king  who retweeted a message from a cnn reporter and opined  carson looks like he is out   carson had previously announced that he will be skipping new hampshire  where he polls lower than even jeb bush and carly fiorina  and south carolina   the same state  that is currently building a multimillion dollar shrine to a shameful symbol of slavery  here s what was actually said carson won t go to nh sc  but instead will head home to florida for some r r  he ll be in dc thursday for the national prayer breakfast   chris moody   moody  february    thing that is missing   quite notably   are the words  carson is dropping out  or any variation thereof  there s not even a suggestion that carson intended to drop out   during coverage  jake tapper and dana bash called the news  unusual   but made no suggestion that carson was quitting  in fact  the very same tweet king and cruz used to dupe people informs people who know how to read of his next campaign stop  the national prayer breakfast  unfortunately  we re not exactly dealing with geniuses in the cruz campaign  last night when our political team saw the cnn post saying dr  carson was not carrying on to new hampshire and south carolina  our campaign updated the grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story  that s fair game   cruz said in a statement following his crafty little ruse   what the team should have done is send around the follow up statement from the carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out  that was a mistake from our end  and for that i apologize to dr  carson  unfortunately  cruz ignored some very crucial follow up tweets that appear to be intended to clear things up for people who were too stupid to grasp the meaning of the initial tweet at this point  it s clear to everyone but ted cruz that cruz lied  carson is going to skip two states that he stands no chance to win and instead relax in florida  there s no mystery   no controversy  no quitting  cruz even grudgingly admitted that  cnn got it correct  my political team saw cnn s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers  it was being covered on live television   cruz claimed  arguing that cnn had incorrectly reported that carson was suspending his campaign   from   p m  to     and  didn t correct that story until   that night   the texas senator s blatantly false claim prompted a scathing reply from cnn  who pointed out that cruz s continued use of the narrative  was especially notable because cruz had walked back his accusations against the network earlier this week and said   cnn got it right   in a statement  the network blasted cruz s  astonishing  ability to commit to the lie  what senator cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false  cnn never corrected its reporting because cnn never had anything to correct  the cruz campaign s actions the night of the iowa caucuses had nothing to do with cnn s reporting  the fact that senator cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing  it s amazing that republicans are so willing to commit to their various lies even after reality destroys any illusion that they could be correct  from carly fiorina still clinging to her  baby parts  propaganda after the videos were shown to be heavily edited right wing propaganda and their creators indicted by a federal grand jury  to cruz s remarks about ben carson and cnn  to pretty damn near everything that comes out of donald trump s mouth  though we do believe him when he says he wants to bang his daughter   the representatives of the stupid part of america carefully craft a bubble of their own reality   and refuse to leave it even when the facts threaten its existence watch cnn tear cruz apart below    tomforemancnn fact checks  tedcruz on his false claim about  cnn https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  february    image via screengrab
