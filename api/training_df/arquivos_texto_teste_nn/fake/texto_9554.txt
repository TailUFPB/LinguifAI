when  comedian  andy dick repeatedly slid his hands up and down ivanka trump s legs during her interview with jimmy kimmel  his liberal audience laughed  to kimmel s credit   and believe me  we don t give kimmel credit for much of anything  after seeing ivanka becoming flustered by his inappropriate behavior  kimmel got fed up with the actions of his guest host and actually asked to have him removed from the stage by security  it s hard to say if the whole security guard entrance was a set up for comedic purposes  but in any event  kimmel did make the point that he was standing up for ivanka  and refused to sit back and watch andy dick make uncomfortable and unwanted advances on her watch kimmel was  of course  quick to defend trump s daughter on his show  but that was during the pre obama era of  when jimmy kimmel and all of hollywood loved donald trump  who could ve possibly imagined that only  years later  trump would betray the liberal democrat cesspool of hollywood  and put his passion for defending the forgotten man  or the everyday american before the false idols of liberal hollywood as hollywood continues its implosion  it looks like andy dick s chickens are finally coming home to roost hollywood reporter   though the  year old actor denies he groped anyone  he does admit to other inappropriate behavior   i might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them  that s my thing   andy dick has been dropped from the independent feature film raising buchanan following accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct on set the hollywood reporter was not able to reach any of the alleged victims  however  two sources detailed dick s inappropriate behavior  which included groping people s genitals  unwanted kissing licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production  it s unclear if those involved were actors or crew late monday  thr spoke to dick  who confirmed he was let go from his small role in the film  though he vehemently denied groping claims  he said it s possible that he licked people and he confirmed that he did make advances on others to anyone who has followed dick s legal troubles  his well documented history of outlandish comedy and often intentionally offensive behavior  his dismissal may not come as a surprise  but the claims can be seen as more unsettling in today s cultural climate in the wake of the harvey weinstein scandal   or ousted figures like bill o reilly  amazon studios  roy price  political journalist mark halperin  the loud house creator chris savino  and the list goes on  dick said he s aware of his reputation  at first  he made light of the situation  joking that  my middle name is  misconduct   they know what they signed up for   however  he followed up with a denial that he ever groped anyone on set  i don t grope people anymore  i don t expose myself anymore   he said by telephone   also well documented is his history of exposing his genitals in public and on stage    i do understand that the temperature in the world right now is delicate  kimmel recently claimed that he would  go easy  on the accused rapist and serial sexual predator hollywood kingpin harvey weinstein while hosting the academy awards show in   fox news   jimmy kimmel intends to deliver some sly wisecracks about disgraced hollywood mogul harvey weinstein when he hosts next year s oscars   but he ll tread warily given that victims of the accused sexual predator may be vying for the gold plated awards  it s not really a laughing matter   the  jimmy kimmel live   host says about the rape and sexual assault allegations pouring out against weinstein in new york magazine out monday hollywood com caught up with kimmel after dick was dragged off the stage by security with kimmel s assistance  here s what kimmel had to say talk show host jimmy kimmel has spoken out about his decision to carry unruly guest andy dick off his show on friday night  confessing the wacky funnyman always makes him  uncomfortable  kimmel called security and helped them physically remove dick from his show sofa after the comic started making unwanted advances toward fellow guest ivanka trump the host says   andy did a segment  he was a little out of it   when  she  ivanka  came out  he wanted a big  wet kiss  it was time for andy to go  so i escorted him out by his feet  but kimmel has spoken to dick since the jimmy kimmel live incident  and he insists the comic is far from upset about his rude exit kimmel adds   he s andy  he s not upset  he s not apologetic  he s just nutty
