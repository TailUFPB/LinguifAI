daily show host trevor noah got brutal with ted cruz over his appalling response to the bombings of eu capital brussels this week  an attack in which dozens  including americans  lost their lives the republican presidential hopeful  currently coming second in the race to donald trump  launched an all out attack on president obama in the wake of the attacks  first  cruz railed against obama for not flying immediately to brussels   when not even european leaders responded this way  secondly  cruz issued a hysterical demand for police to  patrol and secure muslim american neighborhoods  effectively placing muslim citizens in a police state the idea drew a swift and sharp response from president obama  who reminded the texas senator as far as the notion of having surveillance of neighborhoods where muslims are present  i just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance  which  by the way  the father of senator cruz escaped for america  the land of the free  the notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense the president was backed up by furious comments from nypd commissioner bill bratton  who saw the consequences when his police force implemented similar tactics in the past  he said  he doesn t know what the hell he is talking about to be frank with you  while he s running around here  he probably has some muslim officers guarding him  now trevor noah has piled in with a brutal dropkick of ted cruz over the matter  which begins  first of all  you re a sanctimonious jackass  second of all  president obama doesn t need to go to belgium for them to know that he s an ally  it s not like all the european presidents went to belgium after the attacks   and they re within driving distance  then noah turns to the president s comments that we cannot let terrorists achieve their core aim   which is to sow terror in us  saying  it s very important for us to not respond with fear  then  turning to cruz s attempt to do exactly that  by in turn terrorizing the american muslim community in response  noah says  unfortunately  there are always those who use these times to score political points   adding  terrorists win when we allow them to disrupt our way of life  while cruz may persuade the right wing of his party that persecuting american muslims for the actions of a handful of muslims in belgium is a good idea  but he will not win that argument with the wider country   and that s why this dropkick is so brutal  because it s true featured image via screengrab
