while it s often useless to talk about things politicians said more than a decade ago  there are times when those things are relevant to current events  such is the case with trump s running mate  mike pence  he s a religious nut  as evidenced by the discriminatory  religious freedom law  he helped pass in indiana  which specifically targeted the lgbt community  but  as bad as that is  it s not the most insane thing he s ever said or done during a  interview with wolf blitzer  pence discussed his opinion of then secretary of state colin powell s call for better education and protection against stds  particularly in the form of condoms  for pence  who once advocated for prayer to stop an hiv outbreak  rather than a clean needle exchange  saying that condoms can help protect against stds was just too much he spouted this absurdity in response  well  i just simply believe the only truly safe sex  wolf  as the president believes  is no sex  and we ought to  with leaders of the stature of the secretary of state  we ought to be sending a message to kids across the country and the opportunity had across the world that abstinence is the best choice for young people  but let s be clear  last year  the national institute of health  wolf  and some  separate experts said at least a half dozen to ten sexually transmitted diseases for which condom use has zero preventative value  the secretary of state is simply wrong the problem is it was too modern of an answer  wolf  it was   it truly was a modern  liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over america  and frankly  all over the world  yes  condoms are too modern and too liberal for an abstinence only nutbag like then congressman  now vp candidate mike effing pence  everything everyone s parents ever said about condoms  everything every sex ed program has ever said  even everything the cdc has said  is wrong  pence knows things this is the man who wanted to redefine rape so that federal funds would only pay for abortions in the instance of  forcible rape   that s the same thing as the infamous todd akin s  legitimate rape  comment  pence is known as a pioneer in the fight against planned parenthood  and has signed multiple bills limiting abortion access in his state of indiana pence is also the man that said working mothers stunt their children s emotional growth  and who diverted    million from the state s tanf fund to pay an anti abortion group known for lying to  well  lie to indiana s women about abortion so  while it seems silly to bring up something he said as a congressman  years ago  it s also frighteningly relevant to who and what he d be as vice president  because he s still that man  it wouldn t be surprising to hear him say that he and trump will seek to ban sex education  if not condoms themselves  in favor of telling girls just to keep an aspirin between their knees is they don t want to get pregnant  or an std featured image by sara d  davis getty images
