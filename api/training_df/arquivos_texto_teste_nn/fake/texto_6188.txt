senator tom cotton just put on a legendary show of hypocrisy on the floor of the senate and my jaw has not quite left the floor  cotton is known these days as  tehran tom  thanks to his poorly executed attempt to derail president obama s nuclear agreement with iran by organizing a secret letter that was sent to the iranian government instructing the country to ignore the diplomatic agreement or else  so it s a little rich that he feels confident in lecturing another senator on  leadership  however  it s not just cotton s shameless hypocrisy that is striking  but the apparently fully realized fantasy world he lives in  so powerful are the delusions and so blind is he to the real world  it s a wonder cotton manages to walk through his office without bumping into a coffee table  here s cotton  a man who recently held up a crucial bill because it would have allowed the iranian nuclear agreement to go forward  slamming sen  harry reid for   don t laugh  this is serious   obstructing a defense bill  as a junior senator  i preside over the senate  i usually do in the morning  which means i m forced to listen to the bitter  vulgar  incoherent ramblings of the minority leader   cotton said   normally  like other americans  i ignore them  i can t ignore them today  however  cotton tore into reid for stalling a vote on a crucial defense bill  even though the bill eventually passed     when was the last time the minority leader read a bill  it was probably an electricity bill   cotton quipped why was reid holding up the bill  for one thing  republicans decided to add an amendment that would allow religious organizations to legally discriminate against gay people  in defiance of federal law   it s a favorite pet project of the gop and  you may have noticed  has absolutely nothing to do with funding the military  reid may be forgiven for feeling like amendments like these are unfettered bullshit and intentionally placed in important defense bills so that people like tom cotton can grandstand about them ironically  another aspect of the defense bill that has led to controversy is amendment requiring women to register for the draft  why is that in there  well  it s a funny story the move to require women to register for the draft had an unlikely origin  when rep  duncan hunter  r calif     who opposes the obama administration s recent decision to open up all combat roles to women   proposed the change in the house armed services committee to start a  discussion   but to gop leaders  surprise  the committee approved his language  prompting them to yank out the provision in a rules committee maneuver before it could go to the floor in other words  republicans in both the house and senate have worked overtime to shoot themselves in the foot then scream at democrats for not providing them with bulletproof shoes it s clear what going on here  the republican led congress has bravely led congress to its lowest approval numbers in history  it s function as an equal branch of government has been replaced by a level of gridlock so severe that almost nothing gets accomplished  having gotten congress to this point by obstruction  republicans are eager to diffuse the blame by pretending  both sides  do it in cotton s hysterical screeching  there s a very real fear that nobody is buying it anymore  even someone as delusional as him can see that watch cotton s ravings below via c span featured image via youtube
