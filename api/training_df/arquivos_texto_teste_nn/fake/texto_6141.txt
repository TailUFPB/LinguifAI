kansas  school system has been in considerable trouble ever since the state s republican government decided to slash funding and change how money was distributed  which badly shortchanged poorer schools  of course  kansas republicans didn t really seem to care until they were sued  and the case went to the state s supreme court  the court ordered them to fix the situation  and we re just certain they put forth their best effort  but the so called  changes  resulted in no change at all for most schools after reviewing the plan  the kansas supreme court rejected parts of the plan  saying  disparities among the districts remain inequitable and unconstitutional  if the legislature doesn t fix the problem in a way that makes funding fairer for the poorer districts by june   the court has ordered that all schools will remain closed until the funding problem is resolved governor sam brownback swept into office with grandiose promises about how tax cuts and budget cuts would result in businesses just flocking to the state  which  in turn would actually increase revenue for the state  the education funding crisis began after the gop legislature and brownback cut the state s education budget last year  after brownback s promises of business windfalls failed to materialize that s typical republican thinking   these things never work that way  they live in denial  though last year  six districts had to close before the official end of the year because their funding had run out  fortunately  they d already held enough days of school to still comply with the law  but they had to look for ways to tighten their belts without laying off teachers  which was quite painful for them all the state legislature did to address the problem was reshuffle dollars around  but didn t increase education funding overall  according to u s  news   world report  because the plan guarantees that no district loses any aid it already has been promised for the next school year  most of them  including the four suing the state   would see no change in their aid overall  twenty three would see small increases  covered by the state tapping an existing pot of emergency school aid  forget kansas  students  forget producing graduates that can help take the state and the country into the future  cutting government spending is republican dogma  they don t care who they hurt  even if it means hurting children and the education they re entitled to under their state s constitution featured image by gage skidmore  licensed under cc by sa   via flickr
