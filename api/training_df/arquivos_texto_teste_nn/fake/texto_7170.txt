rachel maddow is angry with her fellow members of the press   and with very good reason  the thing is  everyone has been railing trump s nutty comments regarding punishing women for exercising their right to choose to end a pregnancy  and rightfully so  however  the truth is  the whole gop agrees with trump  but no one is talking about that  on the thursday night edition of her show  maddow took the rest of the press to task for ignoring the dangerous anti woman views of almost all politicians on the right  she began  i don t know if the beltway media sort of doesn t get this yet  or if they don t feel like reporting on it or if it s uncomfortable  or if it earns you too many enemies from people you want to be sources or friends in the future  but what we are having right now in terms of the focus of the republican presidential race and its national media coverage right now is a farce  she reminded everyone that ted cruz and others are simply smart enough not to openly call for something as outrageous as punishment for abortions  and he said so at a  women for cruz  rally  maddow continued ted cruz is right  that the anti abortion movement in general has learned to stop talking about that  they don t like to talk about that  they like to say that they ll never talk about that  but it is  if we re being honest here  an unavoidable consequence of what it would mean if they get their way  maddow is right  of course  cruz has very extreme views on abortion  and has bragged publicly about his so called  right to life  stance  he isn t any less extreme than trump  in fact  he may be more so  considering that he has said he d go around the roe v  wade decision to end abortion in america for good maddow s parting warning is one we all need to understand and heed so  just a note to the national media and to the beltway media on this subject  i know everybody s all over donald trump on this   what will this mean for his campaign    but covering a story like this does not mean just writing down what people want you to say about them in the terms they want you to use  exactly  the entire republican party wants to set women s rights back half a century  but nobody wants to talk about that  that is a very dangerous game to play  to ignore the facts of their positions and pretend that these other politicians are any better than the circus act that is the donald trump campaign watch the video below  maddow s trump comments start around the   mark featured image via video screen capture
