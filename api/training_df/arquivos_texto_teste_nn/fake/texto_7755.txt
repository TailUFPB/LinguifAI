governor scott walker from the good state of wisconsin did a very strange thing on tuesday  he posted a close up picture of his right hand  now  why on earth did he do such a thing  don t ask us   we haven t a clue  and   neither does the rest of the internet  but  that didn t stop them from completely roasting the governor in truly epic fashion shortly after the occurrence  and   for that  we say  it made the strange affair all very well worth it given the recent stir about trump s small hands  though  it s entirely possible walker was joining in with senator marco rubio and ganging up on him about it  recently  marco took off the gloves  pun intended  and started making fun of trump s spray tan and even suggested he had a small pecker due to the size of his fingers  he s always calling me little marco  and  i ll admit  he s taller than me  he s like    which is why i don t understand why the size of his hands are from someone who s    and   you know what they say about men with small hands  they re probably only doing it because trump has already made it known how much he hates it  trump once went so far as to write the author of an article who called him a  short fingered vulgarian   and   he reportedly still sends hateful messages  talk about insecurity pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter if governor walker truly was trying to take a dig at trump  it ended up hurting him in the process  those weren t even the half of it  it would simply take too long to post every single hilarious response he received  and   we can only imagine the responses will continue throughout the day  as well as into the foreseeable future yes  walker sure does have a lot of time on his hands now that he s no longer running for president  dropped out in september    when he s not signing a bunch of new bills into law taking away the rights of unions  or trying to get rid of a woman s right to choose  walker has a new hobby  showing the world what his fingers look like  if he keeps this up  he may even have a new job as a right wing hand model someday  anything would be better than him being governor featured image via flickr
