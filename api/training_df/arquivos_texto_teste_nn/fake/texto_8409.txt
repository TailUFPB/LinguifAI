john and melissa wood are typical right wing loons  after their daughter told them about her class assignments  john wood set off to laplata high school in maryland in a fit of rage  his daughter  it seems  was taught about islam as part of a world history course  which didn t sit well with the bigoted former marine or his wife according to the woods  their daughter was forced to accept islam as her one true religion and was forced to memorize the five tenets of the faith  they argued that the class only spent a single day on christianity and then moved on to two weeks of islamic training learning to recite things in the course of a history class is what most people would call  studying   but the dad found it so vile that she was being forced to convert to islam that he went to the school and threatened the faculty  resulting in an immediate ban from the property and a no trespass order from local law enforcement while the school contends that the reality of the situation doesn t fit the narrative the bigots have concocted  the woods have decided to sue the school with the help of the thomas moore law center  the right wing crackpot firm that unsuccessfully argues for intelligent design and christian indoctrination in schools on a regular basis  the center said in court filings  a school cannot achieve diversity by punishing and alienating students who hold judeo christian beliefs  while bolstering the doctrines and teachings of other religions  parents must be ever vigilant to the islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism  this is happening in public schools across the country  and they must take action to stop it  yeah  that s not at all what s going on  as the school explained in a statement to wtop  the particular unit in question is on the formation of middle eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the islamic faith and how it  along with politics  culture  economics and geography  contributed to the development of the middle east  other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region  for example  when reviewing the renaissance and reformation  students study the concepts and role of christianity  when learning about the development of china and india  students examine hinduism and buddhism it doesn t matter how you try to explain teaching islam to right wing imbeciles  they see all muslims as a threat the them  they hear the word  muslim  in a public school and their heads explode  because the  amendment says no religion in public places  now tell that teacher to lead those kids in christian prayer before it s too late for them the most ridiculous argument the suit brings is this  the course also taught false statements such as allah is the same god worshiped by christians and islam is a  religion of peace  according to these people a religion of a billion people are out to kill us all  considering if that were true they would only have to get about  people each to kill all non muslims  you have to wonder why it hasn t happened already  you also have to wonder how people can continue to call islam a  pagan  religion when the tribe mohammed came from was directly descended from ishmael  son of abraham  considered the steward of the faith to his tribe and brother of isaac  patriarch of judaism i learned that from a high school world history course the woods are asking for injunctive relief barring the teaching of anything that has to with islam from school grounds and for the trespass order to be lifted  it shouldn t be long before this case  much like all of the other zealot friendly issues brought by the moore center featured image from wikipedia
