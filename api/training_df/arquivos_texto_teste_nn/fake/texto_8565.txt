what kind of man would pull his daughters from the safety of their school and place them in the middle of an armed standoff  a bundy terrorist on january   ammon bundy and his deranged band of gun toting marauders seized the malheur national wildlife refuge in an effort to force the federal government to release two idiot ranchers who illegally set fire to federal land  the pair were sentenced to five years in prison  which is the mandatory sentence for such a crime of course  bundy and others who dare to call themselves a  militia  decided to takeover the wildlife refuge in protest and are hoping to spark a war with federal law enforcement  but they arrived abysmally unprepared and began begging the public to send them supplies to aid in their lawbreaking  which thus far includes treason  domestic terrorism  illegally carrying firearms on federal property  property damage  threatening law enforcement  disturbing native american artifacts  and being total douchebags and now we can add child endangerment and abuse to the growing list according to oregon public broadcasting  a terrorist within bundy s camp actually pulled his little girls   and  years of age  out of their school and brought them to the wildlife refuge opb is not naming the kids  nor their parents  to protect the identity of the children  but the mother and father are active and vocal militants in the armed occupation  both parents have been involved in the incident since its start jan   the children were visible inside one of the buildings thursday evening  one of the little girls asked to come outside by a campfire but was not allowed  the kids were also seen playing and wrestling together in a hallway in their pajamas the kids are from out of state and have been at the refuge since early this week  they spend most of their time out of sight of reporters and visitors so these little girls have basically been held hostage for the last three weeks and have not been allowed outside all this time  they are surrounded by loaded firearms and by assholes of questionable character they have also missed significant school time and they probably aren t receiving proper nourishment either  and as you ll recall  the last time the bundys had a little standoff with federal law enforcement  they were cowardly and used women and children as human shields this is child endangerment and abuse and it s time to arrest these monsters before something terrible happens to these little girls  federal authorities have allowed this dog and pony show go on long enough and we all know that if this were an armed group of muslims or black men  there would be no hesitation to shoot them on site whether they are armed or not  but for some reason  these white rednecks have been given free reign while the justice department looks the other way  two little girls are being forced to stand in the crossfire while ammon bundy gets to come and go as he pleases enough is enough  bundy and his minions have had their fun  now it s time for them to face the consequences of their stupidity featured image  babble
