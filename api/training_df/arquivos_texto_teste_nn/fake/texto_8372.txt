jeb bush was supposed to be the adult among the children in the  republican presidential primaries  he was even considered the inevitable nominee by some  particularly due to his fundraising capability  they sure were wrong  as you will see below jeb never really caught fire among voters  but somehow he did among billionaires and other corporate interests looking to pen a  year lease on an american president  jeb had a total of    million raised for his presidential bid as of february        million was by him directly  with nearly   million more by pacs  on the night of the first caucus in the nation  he had spent a total of    million   about   million of it in iowa alone for all the inevitability his money supposedly ensured  jeb ended up with a humiliating   percent portion of the vote during the iowa republican caucus  this worked out to just over a measly   votes  which netted him one whole delegate  ouch  going with just the iowa money for the ad buys leading up to the caucus  jeb ended up paying about    per vote dang  jeb  https   t co rgvscgsjal pic twitter com   christopher ingraham   cingraham  february    put this into context  ted cruz spent under   dollars per vote he received  and trump spent even less  the pair claimed both first and second place at the end of the night  this begs the question   have we hit the limit of how much money is able to influence an election   while you can t deny the effect that vast sums of corporate money have in politics  all the money in the nation won t polish everyone to an acceptable level of shine  jeb is an embarrassing example of that in the  election cycle while technically jeb has a possibility of finding new footing for himself in new hampshire  the likelihood of a campaign resurrection is low  trump is looking far stronger there with a  percent lead  as cruz comes in second at  percent  jeb is in the rear guard again at a weak  percent  he has the most money to burn  outside of trump  do you think it would help him at all  or is the bush legacy too much of a curse for him to bear featured image from flickr
