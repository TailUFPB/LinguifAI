the national rifle association recently made a pathetic attempt to attack hillary clinton   and it backfired horribly the nra thought it had released a clever video bashing clinton s record of approving arms exports when she served as secretary of state  but instead they validated what gun control advocates have been asking for all along  better background checks in the video  conservative host dana loesch accuses clinton of letting the decision about whether or not to export arms to foreign nations be based on what countries had made donations to the clinton foundation  these were  of course  false accusations   but the nra still tried to shame clinton for something she didn t do  in actuality  the u s  has the highest standards in the world for deciding whether to approve gun sales to foreign nations  but the nra was apparently so focused on bashing the democratic front runner  that the right wing organization completely missed the fact that they d made a great case for background checks when loesch said brilliant  the video also makes another important point   that countries approved for export permits are at least investigated to ensure that countries receiving guns from the united states will be using them  to promote our national security interests and foreign policy objectives   but in america  that s a different story  guns are not only available to our military  but to nearly anyone who can clear just a few legal safety requirements and it gets better  loesch continued to spew nonsense  once again unintentionally making a case for women in other countries and completely ignoring the fact that america has a huge issue with guns and domestic violence  when hillary clinton isn t trying to disarm women and prevent us from the equal opportunity exercise of our pro choice right to self defense  she is approving billion dollar arms sales to countries with horrendous human rights records  countries where women have little to no rights  countries like qatar  saudi arabia  united arab emirates  oman  and others  according to gun reform group everytown research  domestic violence and gun deaths are very closely linked  but the nra is choosing to be ignorant  domestic violence in america is to a significant degree a problem of gun violence  over the past  years  more intimate partner homicides in the u s  have been committed with guns than with all other weapons combined  and people with a history of committing domestic violence are five times more likely to subsequently murder an intimate partner when a firearm is in the house  this attack ad implies that women in other countries could and should be kept safe with strong background checks and rigid gun ownership laws  and by making no mention of protecting american women in the same way  the nra s video suggests that women in this country should suffer the consequences that come with more relaxed gun laws  we could make the argument that in america  we need gun control the most   the united states leads other developed countries  in gun violence by a landslide clinton  on the other hand  is passionate about reducing gun violence   so while the nra tried to soil clinton s record  they instead revealed a huge hypocrisy in their own argument  you can watch the video below featured image via justin sullivan   getty images
