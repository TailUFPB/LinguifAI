trinity lutheran church in columbia  missouri has never paid a dime in taxes  but it seems church officials still believe that they are entitled to get free stuff  at the expense of those of us who do pay them in   the church applied for a grant from the missouri department of natural resources  dnr   the taxpayer funded grants allow qualifying organizations to purchase recycled materials  used to resurface playgrounds the dnr denied the application  citing the state s constitutional barrier against taxpayer funds being used to support a religious organization the exact wording of the state constitution reads  no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury  directly or indirectly  in aid of any church  sect or denomination of religion  and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church  sect or creed of religion  or any form of religious faith or worship  trinity lutheran church responded to the denial by filing suit against the state  claiming  religious discrimination  the trial court ruled against the church  upholding the state constitution and the validity of missouri s  no aid  clause but the church really  really wants missouri taxpayers to pay for its playground resurfacing material  so much so that it appealed the decision  taking the case to the eighth circuit court of appeals  arguments were presented this week the american civil liberties union foundation  aclu   the aclu of missouri and americans united for separation of church and state filed a  page brief in response to the church s allegations that missouri s no aid clause is discriminatory as stated in the brief  which can be read in full here  by barring government aid to religious schools and other religious institutions  these provisions    ensure that no taxpayer is forced to subsidize religion or religious exercise  bolstering religious liberty for all and    safeguard the integrity of  and financial support for  free public schools which  unlike many religious schools  are open to children and families of every faith  sexual orientation  and economic class  as well as children with disabilities  all churches and religious institutions in the united states are tax exempt organizations how often do we hear the  christian  right talk about freeloaders and people who want something for nothing  yet these  religious  institutions cry discrimination because they are barred from taking money from coffers they never paid into we see this happening across the united states  as charter schools and religious schools and private school voucher programs suck money out of the public school system in states like michigan  florida  texas and elsewhere on the bright side  colorado courts upheld the u s  constitution in june of last year  the state s highest court struck down the use of public funds for private school vouchers  a move which protected the state s constitutional barrier against public money  controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatsoever  then in september of   in what was also seen as a major victory for public education  the washington state supreme court found charter schools to be unconstitutional and here again in missouri  we see yet another religious organization lusting to get its hands on public dollars  while pleasantly enjoying the benefits of a tax exempt status the eighth circuit court of appeals has not yet ruled on the trinity lutheran case  as bloomberg reports here  the case could unhinge the separation of church and state clause that has long kept the government from controlling or being controlled by religion americans united for the separation of church and state is tracking the case and will publish the outcome on their website here featured image credit  pixabay cco
