the world no longer sees donald trump as a joke  they see him as a significant threat to international security and a stable economy when donald trump first announced his candidacy for the presidency  most people in america and around the globe thought that he would be just another clown candidate made possible by the ineptitude and extremism of the republican party as in years past when the likes of michelle bachmann and herman cain entered the race but this year  conservatives look determined to use trump as their own personal battering ram to destroy the federal government even if it means bringing about perpetual war and the disintegration of the world economy in the process and that s why the global forecasting service has officially rated trump a high impact threat even though they believe it is unlikely he will beat his eventual democratic opponent  but just in case he does win  the gfs analysed what is at risk if he should somehow ascend to the presidency according to analysis by the gfs thus far mr  trump has given very few details of his policies   and these tend to be prone to constant revision   but a few themes have become apparent  first  he has been exceptionally hostile towards free trade  including notably nafta  and has repeatedly labelled china as a  currency manipulator   he has also taken an exceptionally right wing stance on the middle east and jihadi terrorism  including  among other things  advocating the killing of families of terrorists and launching a land incursion into syria to wipe out is  and acquire its oil   in the event of a trump victory  his hostile attitude to free trade  and alienation of mexico and china in particular  could escalate rapidly into a trade war   and at the least scupper the trans pacific partnership between the us and  other american and asian states signed in february   his militaristic tendencies towards the middle east  and ban on all muslim travel to the us  would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups  increasing their threat both within the region and beyond in other words  trump would be a catastrophe for the united states and the world  his warmongering against the middle east and hatred of muslims could result in new wars and increased terrorist attacks and his hostility towards mexico and china threaten the economic stability president obama has worked so hard to rebuild after the great recession of  furthermore  trump has inflamed racial tensions across the nation to the point where it feels like his continued candidacy is a powder keg waiting to explode into a full fledged race war  trump has also expressed hostility toward women and the lgbt community along with having a decidedly anti science stance  his anti science stance alone is enough to endanger the world considering climate change is rapidly becoming irreversible  should trump become president  it could be many more years before the united states participates in climate initiatives again the global forecasting service also warns in their conclusion that while democrats and republicans in congress will likely oppose trump s more radical policies  it would mean at least four more years of nothing getting done as congress and the white house obstruct each other although we do not expect mr trump to defeat his most likely democratic contender  hillary clinton  there are risks to this forecast  especially in the event of a terrorist attack on us soil or a sudden economic downturn  it is worth noting that the innate hostility within the republican hierarchy towards mr trump  combined with the inevitable virulent democratic opposition  will see many of his more radical policies blocked in congress   albeit such internal bickering will also undermine the coherence of domestic and foreign policymaking in short  the best thing americans can do for ourselves and the world is vote against trump in november  because our safety and financial health depend on it  featured image via flickr
