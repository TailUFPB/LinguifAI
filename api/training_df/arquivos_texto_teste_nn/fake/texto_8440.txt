here s something not everybody knows about  vanity fair s graydon carter once called donald trump a  short fingered vulgarian  in an article  ever since that time  trump has sent him odd little letters defending his small hands  digits  whatever you want to call them you d think trump does this kind of thing for more publicity  there s always that inkling of possibility  but not so  in this case  says mr  carter here he is in his own words  describing how much it bothers trump  and the  lengths  trump has gone to dismiss the writer s claims  just to drive him a little bit crazy  i took to referring to him as a  short fingered vulgarian  in the pages of spy magazine  that was more than a quarter of a century ago  to this day  i receive the occasional envelope from trump  there is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine  on all of them he has circled his hand in gold sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers  i almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because  to me  the fingers still look abnormally stubby  the most recent offering arrived earlier this year  before his decision to go after the republican presidential nomination  like the other packages  this one included a circled hand and the words  also written in gold sharpie   see  not so short   i sent the picture back by return mail with a note attached  saying   actually  quite short   which i can only assume gave him fits  now the internet is finally catching on  and in this day in age of social media  twitter  facebook  and internet memes to boot  the combination is quite hysterical  there s even an entire page on twitter devoted to making fun of trump s fingers  called  you guessed it  trumpfingers but  trumpfingers isn t the only one getting in on the action  a simple search on twitter of  trump fingers  or  trump small hands  will display all sorts of results  as if the internet didn t already have enough memes mocking trump  now there s more on a different subject matter entirely pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via wikimedia it sounds silly once you think about it  but the fact that it bothers trump is even sillier  no one wants to worsen any further trump s apparent body dysmorphic disorder  but nobody said politics was easy  if trump was even halfway as nice to muslims at his rallies as they are to him  we might lay off of it  but guys like him don t deserve any remorse from us if everybody shows up to vote this november  you can rest assured donald trump will never get the privilege of holding up his  short fingered vulgarian  hands to administer the oath of office of president  let s make sure that doesn t happen featured image via facebook
