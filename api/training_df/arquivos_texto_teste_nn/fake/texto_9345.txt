norway has a new immigration sheriff in town  and so far  it appears that she s singing the same tune as president trump on immigration  and oh yeah  sylvi listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either  how far are bleeding heart nations  like sweden  france  the uk  and germany willing to take this mass immigration experiment  before they realize it s too late to turn back  before her appointment to the cabinet on december   listhaug  then agriculture minister  criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over norwegian society like a nightmare  it is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection   asylum association spokesman andreas furuseth told the norwegian news agency ntb listhaug said she wanted  or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in february before the european spring season  when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again she told norwegian nrk public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees some   asylum seekers arrived in norway in  it was a record for the oil and gas rich nordic nation of   million people  which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals  in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring sweden and the arrival of wintry weather nrk said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in norway and  the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day to day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home migrants who arrived on transit visas via russia would not be granted asylum older applicants in the  to  age group would be required to learn the norwegian language and aspects of norwegian society applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum  a grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence   dwwhen angela merkel invited refugees to germany in   tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in  the consequences were pretty immediate  over   went to sweden  leading to well publicised disruption  next door  things were different  norway took in just    this year it has accepted just   so far  to sylvi listhaug  the country s young immigration minister  this might still be a bit too much  we have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in norway to make sure they respect norwegian values   she says   freedom to speak  to write  to believe or not to believe in a god  how to raise your children   also  she says  what not to do  for example   it is not allowed to beat your children in norway  it s unusual for a european government minister to link immigration with child beating  but the  year old ms listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly  the rest of europe  she believes  is coming around to the norwegian position after decades in opposition  her progress party entered government four years ago  a junior partner in a conservative run coalition  her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the   she says  so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of europe   a lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration  we are a libertarian party  we want less government  so people should decide more over their own life  and we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for norway in the long run  while sweden and others saw the migration of  as a blip caused by conflict in syria and iraq  she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend   africa is going to gain almost  million more people by    she says   much of the middle east and africa is fragile  people have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the west and in europe is quite different  so i understand why they would like our life  our kind of standards  but it s not sustainable to integrate so many  why not  norway  with its oil generated trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund  is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues  this  she says  is because they ve been careful   many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow  working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education  those who come to norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues  the case for limiting economic migration is clear  but about half of the registered asylum seekers in the eu  last year were from countries that were struck by conflict  can norway justify taking so few  ms  listhaug is a practicing christian  albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  church of norway  and says her government s immigration policy  when combined with its aid policy  is not just a moral response  but the most effective moral response  for me it s a moral issue as well  you can t just help the ones you see  you have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world  she s referring to the refugee camps in jordan  where both norway and the uk send aid to help those displaced by war  norway gave   million to its jordanian mission last year  almost twice as much  per capita  as britain  the cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget  so as its influx subsides and costs fall  all savings are used to help refugees abroad  some   million has been transferred so far  with more expected next year so to ms  listhaug  it s not a question of whether to help refugees  but how best to do so  we meet after she visited brandon lewis  her british counterpart  who gave her a striking statistic   the immigration minister here in britain said that for the price of helping   young people here  he could help   children in other parts of the world  she sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the  un refugee convention  which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well founded fear of persecution   it was an agreement for its time   she says   but when people travel through  countries to come to a safe haven  i think people can see that this is not right  you could have a safe haven in your neighboring country  so why go so far  western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in  she says  also face a moral question   why should we have a system that works for the people who have money  while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go  people traffickers  she says  thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores   if you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from afghanistan to europe  they say it is between    and      young girls  she says  are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey   also  children are killed  or raped  on their way  so we need to have this under control  ms listhaug provoked fury in sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population  she called it a  no go zone    a phrase that the swedes angrily reject  but she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss  especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking  nor does she mind using sweden as a case study in what not to do   a lot of countries in europe are thinking more like us  like denmark and austria  germany  as well  france has big problems right now with integration  as does belgium  a lot of countries in europe see that we need to have this under control  the norwegian model  she says  is very different and very clear   if you are an economic migrant  you are declined in norway   she says   we send people back to afghanistan if they are not in need of protection  we send them back to somalia if they are not in need of protection   isn t this a rather expensive process   yes  but it s well worth it   police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working   if we find them  we send them out  that has also decreased crime in norway  that s very good  i ask listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless  how does it make her feel  her response comes quickly   i don t give a damn   she says  she thinks her approach is right  and the consensus is wrong  and  as she says  an increasing number of other countries think the same  a new consensus might well be in the making   spectatorukso what do her neighbors in sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers  the swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for listhaug  he openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out of control migration to destroy much of sweden  in the video below  he reminds swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing  in sweden  we have  times more car torchings  do you want this  we have  times more violent killings than norway  is that what you want  well  you should listen to your lefties  and be more like sweden  it s interesting  the migration minister sylvi listhaug  came to sweden to find out for herself  she wanted to find out what not to do in norway  watch
