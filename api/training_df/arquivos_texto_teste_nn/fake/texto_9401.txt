from the washington examiner   roy moore is the embattled republican senatorial nominee in alabama  but two other figures in the party have even more to lose in his race  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   and former white house chief strategist steve bannon first  the obvious  if moore is beaten by democrat doug jones   a leaked national republican senatorial committee poll has the socially conservative retired judge trailing jones by  points  but this is at odds with public polling   mcconnell will be knocked down to leading a   republican senate that may not seem like much in a senate that has no meaningful filibuster for executive and judicial appointments  but where  votes are no more useful for advancing legislation that can t be snuck through the reconciliation process  it is nevertheless significant given that the senate has already had trouble passing major legislation like obamacare repeal and tax reform with the majority it currently has it also would bring the democrats one vote closer to recapturing the senate majority  despite a very daunting electoral map for the upper chamber in   winning such a reliably red state would aid democratic candidate recruitment across the board and embolden the party s ten senators from states president trump carried who are up for re election next year superficially speaking  mcconnell comes out a loser if moore is defeated  but not in the bigger picture  the dec   special senate election in alabama could also be viewed as a front in the proxy war between mcconnell and bannon after leaving the white house  bannon threatened to recruit primary challengers for most of the incumbent republican senators who are seeking re election in   at a joint press conference with trump in the rose garden  mcconnell didn t mince words about how he felt about this gambit  look  you know  the goal here is to win elections in november   mcconnell said last month   back in  and   we nominated several candidates   christine o donnell  sharron angle  todd akin  richard mourdock  they re not in the senate  and the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election  my goal as the leader of the republican party in the senate is to keep us in the majority   he added   the way you do that is not complicated  you have to have nominated people who can actually win  because winners make policy and losers go home  bannon wants more republican senators who will vote against mcconnell  mcconnell and his allies believe the breitbart news chief s intervention in the primaries could lead to fewer republican senators overall  so they have started punching back in september s alabama republican primary  mcconnell went all in on appointed incumbent sen  luther strange and lost  despite the president s backing  bannon made the argument that the candidate trump endorsed wasn t the one who would be most supportive of the trump agenda  for that  he insisted  you needed an anti establishment candidate like moore  bannon  via moore  won both men might have been better off with rep  mo brooks  who was eliminated in the first round of voting  brooks was big on the trump agenda and did not have all the weird sexual baggage that could wind up dooming moore  bannon allies told the washington examiner that the former top trump strategist might have preferred brooks yet mcconnell s political apparatus spent heavily against moore to protect strange  a sitting senator who struggled from the local perception he secured his seat through some kind of corrupt bargain with disgraced former gov  robert bentley  and bannon couldn t very well throw his weight behind a candidate who  despite being ideologically trumpist  endorsed sen  ted cruz  r texas  over trump in the  primaries   especially while still serving in the west wing freed from the white house  bannon backed moore less because the  ten commandments judge  had any particular affinity for the issues that trump ran on last year and more because alabama s political conditions made him likely to beat strange  moore would owe mcconnell and the establishment nothing  but bannon would have chits to cash in and an improved reputation as a kingmaker inside the gop if moore loses in a disastrous fashion  and remember it is courting disaster for this race to even be competitive  in   jeff sessions had no democratic challenger and won over  percent of the vote   it will prove mcconnell s point about the futility of bannon s enterprise before the senate majority is ever really at risk breitbart   american majority founder ned ryun talked about roy moore and the alabama senate race with breitbart news executive chairman steve bannon and siriusxm host raheem kassam on friday s breitbart news daily  broadcast live from the restoration weekend event bannon asked ryun about celebrity lawyer gloria allred s involvement in the roy moore case  representing a woman who accuses moore of assaulting her in  when she was  years old ryan said allred is  basically a human vulture when you look back at some of the things she s been involved in watch lawyer gloria allred  as she skirts the issue of whether or not the high school yearbook being used to prove a relationship between judge roy moore and one of his accusers is a forgery watch forgery expert make case that gloria allred s client is lying about roy moore s signature  remember the incident with arnold schwarzenegger   ryun asked   she brought all these women in front of him  said they re going to sue  they re going to file suit against schwarzenegger  guess what  after the election  absolutely nothing happened  i think a real turning point was that press conference when they pulled out the yearbook and the signature   he said of allred s entry into the moore controversy  referring to an interview with msnbc s katy tur where allred did not come off well ryun said this interview demonstrated that the best way to respond to sensational allegations is to  just throw facts back at them  ryun said there was no doubt in his mind that the allegations against moore were part of an  organized hit   as bannon put it  i ve been in d c  almost  years  and  again  i don t have hard proof  and i will say this clearly  i do not have hard proof  but i strongly suspect it s a very short list of people  all who are associated with mitch mcconnell   whether it s josh holmes  whether it s karl rove  might even be steven law   i don t know  but i strongly  strongly suspect somebody out of the mcconnell camp planted the story  it was planted  this came with the blessing of mitch mcconnell at some point  that he was going to take a political shot at roy moore   he declared
