a conservative columnist and trump supporter dropped a bombshell live on cnn when she accused another guest  who is a cruz ally  of being one of the five women named in the national inquirer as cruz s alleged mistresses  aside of how  women on the planet can possibly be interested in ted cruz  what s even more stunning was when adriana cohen  a boston herald conservative columnist and trump supporter made the accusation on live television and the reaction that resulted watch video here when cnn host kate bolduan asked cohen if she thought the two republican presidential candidates should stop bashing each other s wives  cohen redirected the conversation and said  absolutely  i think we should move on and where we should move to is the national enquirer story that has reported that ted cruz has allegedly had affairs with at least five mistresses   including  you ve been named  amanda  shocked  carpenter raised her eyebrows in bewilderment as bolduan interrupted saying   i m sorry  i don t think that s moving on at all  adriana  cohen said that cruz should issue a statement either confirming or denouncing the accusation  asking carpenter if she would denounce her own involvement or confirm it  to which carpenter said what s out there is tabloid trash  if someone wants to comment on it  they can talk to my lawyer  it is categorically false  and you should be ashamed of spreading this kind of smut  donald trump supporters should be held to account for it  i will not be intimidated  whether the accusations are true or not  the trump and cruz campaigns get more embarrassing by the day and their continuous mudslinging and disregard for any decency during their campaign runs is indicative of why neither should be president  featured image via video screenshot
