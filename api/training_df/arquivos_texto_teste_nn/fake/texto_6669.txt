just when you thought things couldn t get weirder  carly fiorina bursts into song it all happened during the ted cruz rally where he named fiorina his vice presidential choice if he were to somehow magically secure enough delegates for the gop nomination the entire publicity stunt of adding fiorina just reeks of desperation from the cruz campaign  it s very reminiscent of what president mccain john mccain did in  to try to appeal to voters in a last ditched effort to try to become president  and we all know how that turned out nonetheless  fiorina accepted his request to run on his imaginary ticket  so she spoke to the crowd at his latest rally in indiana she spoke in fluent conservative speak  saying things like  a president ted cruz will restore power back where it belongs in the hands of citizens   and  this is the fight of our time  and i believe ted cruz is the man to lead that fight  along with a boatload of other malarkey then  as if from out of nowhere  she started singing about ted cruz s daughters  now  some may think   aww  that sounds delightful   but those people clearly don t know carly fiorina  it was a mixture of weird and very creepy  and most definitely cringeworthy  to the point where you couldn t wait until the moment was over this move by cruz is definitely odd and sort of unprecedented  but it will be interesting to see how it works out for him watch the strange serenade here watch   carlyfiorina bursts into song after  tedcruz names her his running mate https   t co  https   t co   msnbc   msnbc  april    image via video screen capture
