considering left leaning msnbc still signs joe scarborough s paychecks and he s consistently feigned neutrality in the presidential election  it seemed clear that his support of donald trump was meant to remain under the radar  unfortunately for that facade  nobody bothered to tell trump while scarborough was interviewing trump on msnbc s morning joe things reached an awkward tipping point when the republican front runner casually remarked that he appreciated the fact that scarborough and his co host mika brzezinski were his  supporters  while most of the media was against him  it was great seeing you  you guys have been supporters and i appreciate it  and not necessarily supporters but at least believers  hilariously  this sent the pundits scrambling to undo the potentially career ending damage of being tainted with trump s name  after all  it s bad enough that they  in their capacity as journalists  would choose to pull for any particular candidate  but a racist  xenophobic  torture enthusiast one is egregious  brzezinski fares pretty well  she has consistently criticized trump s toxic demagoguery  scarborough on the other hand in his clawing desperation to distance himself from trump  he manages to throw several of his colleagues under the bus as well  well  i will tell you what when you say  supported  you re talking about how actually   you re talking about bob  costa   mika  myself  also halperin  willie and those of us around the table  there were a handful of people who for six months have been saying what happened last night could happen  and the rest of the media world has been mocking and ridiculing what he s done  but while scarborough would like us to believe he s simply a political savant who predicted trump s rise  there is mounting evidence that he really does long for a trump win in december  when trump s campaign was starting to change from  this guy is a complete joke  to  this guy could actually win the nomination   scarborough openly bragged that he helped trump prepare for the first debate  it was largely considered to be a make or break moment for trump and his buddy joe scarborough was there to help walk him through the process  let s allow scarborough to tell it  i ve actually called him up  and i ve said  donald  listen  you need to speak in complete sentences in debates   and he goes   i m up  points  joe   and i m like   good point  donald   he said to laughter he later admitted he met personally with trump to congratulate him on his second debate performance  albeit saying i hope we don t have reporters here  further  there has been rumors that scarborough and brzezinski met up with trump on the night of the new hampshire primary to celebrate his first win  again  he had hoped to keep it a secret  cnn broke the story anyway scarborough and brzezinski visited trump s hotel room on tuesday night while the new hampshire primary results were rolling in  according to two sources with knowledge of their visit  scarborough and brzezinski did not respond to a request for comment after this article was published  scarborough posted a series of tweets accusing cnn of lying about him   your sources are wrong   he wrote  scarborough did not explicitly deny that he visited trump s hotel room  however undermining scarborough s denials  trump greeted scarborough on morning joe by saying  it was great  seeing them the previous evening  oops while it s a wonder that anyone would support a guy like trump  scarborough s fixation isn t entirely out of left field  despite his posturing as a  moderate  republican  he s provided plenty of evidence to suggest a war mongering  egomaniac like trump would get him hot and bothered  when a group of u s  soldiers accidentally floated into iranian waters and were briefly detained  scarborough shot off a series of embarrassing tweets that advocated for a president who was willing to start a world war over it hey iran  you have exactly  days left to push a us president around  enjoy it while you can  after that  there will be hell to pay   joe scarborough   joenbc  january    obama didn t take his advice  instead  he got the sailors released in less than  hours by diplomacy  no shots were fired  scarborough has flirted with supporting trump for too long  to maintain any credibility at all  he needs to either openly admit he s backing the racist buffoon or clarify why he feels so invested in helping him win the election  hotel visits  late night debate prep calls  endless soft interviews on his show  all of this is beginning to paint a pretty clear picture  it s not a good one featured image  screenshot
