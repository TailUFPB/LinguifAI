the republican national convention got off to a rocky start on monday  the evening portion opened with what else but benghazi  patricia smith  who s son  sean smith  was killed that fateful night in libya  spoke at the rnc  this should have been a big deal to the presumptive nominee  but trump is a narcissist trump is ever so worried about benghazi  but apparently not enough to decide not to interrupt this grieving mother s big moment by calling into fox news for a live interview smack dab in the middle of her speech  msnbc and cnn continued to cover smith s emotional remarks  but fox cut away from her to broadcast trump s interview what did he have to say that was so important  not much  he gave a brief preview of what he plans to say on thursday night when he accepts the gop nomination  promising a fairly lengthy speech that will cover many themes   one of them is law and order  o reilly asked if he intended to discuss the recent police killings that have taken place in baton rouge and dallas  and trump said that he would definitely be talking about this issue of course  it s a big issue  it s a horrible issue  and it s going to be a very important one  it s called law and order  we want law and order when he was asked about the black lives matter movement  trump said that some of the protesters are essentially calling death to the police  and that s unacceptable   he promised that if he makes it into the white house he will look into it very seriously   o reilly pressed him on just what that meant  and trump said that he would perhaps talk with the attorney general about it or do something  but at a minimum  we re going to have to be watching  meanwhile  patricia smith was publicly mourning the death of her son at the rnc  slamming hillary clinton for her role in benghazi  benghazi  this has been the gop s favorite witch hunt for years  but trump thinks it is more important to talk about what he is going to talk about  really  no narcissism there  nope  none at all you can watch the interview here featured image via win mcnamee getty images
