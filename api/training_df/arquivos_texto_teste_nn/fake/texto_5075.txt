donald trump still refuses to release his tax returns  so when fox blowhard eric bolling tried to defend him for it he was utterly laid to waste by his own colleague as usual  the panel of fox hosts were busy trashing hillary clinton and attacking her over her recently released tax returns  but bolling claimed that he cares more about the transcripts of hillary clinton s speeches to goldman sachs  remarking that he  really wants  to see them julie roginsky then chimed in suggesting a trade in which trump would release his tax returns in exchange for the release of the speech transcripts which drew approval from the panel  but roginsky pointed out that she doesn t think trump will do it because the new york times reports that his tax returns will show that trump pays zero percent in taxes while clinton paid   percent in federal  state  and local taxes in  in short  his tax returns would be embarrassing  and would spark outrage as it would be clear that trump doesn t pay taxes while hillary clinton does roginsky s colleagues immediately jumped to trump s defense by claiming that he can t release his taxes because he is being audited  but roginsky didn t let that excuse fly  she pointed out that trump is only being audited for a couple years of his taxes and said it doesn t stop him from releasing other years  in fact  an audit doesn t prevent releasing any tax returns at all even if they are under audit bolling  of course  continued making excuses for trump and claimed that he can t release any of his taxes because the current audit could somehow affect his past returns  and that drew a sharp rebuke from roginsky in which she called him out for being a total hypocrite  you are are coming up with kool aid excuses  if this was hillary clinton  you d be the first to demand that she release those taxes  here s the video via youtube indeed  if hillary refused to release her tax returns  fox would immediately begin demanding that they be released and it would be a never ending topic from now till election day  but because trump is the republican nominee  fox news has no problem defending him for refusing to release his own  that is except julie roginsky  she not only would like trump to release them  she s tired of the lame excuses pushed by trump apologists like bolling featured image via screen capture
