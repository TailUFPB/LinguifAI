if signed  the law would make oklahoma the only state in the nation where abortion is totally illegal it s unconstitutional and directly challenges the supreme court s  roe v  wade decision  but republican lawmakers in oklahoma passed the outrageous bill anyway on thursday  the oklahoma senate passed legislation making it a criminal act for a doctor to perform an abortion by a vote of    which basically outlaws the procedure statewide gop state senator nathan dahm  who sponsored the bill  believes it is the state s responsibility to force women to carry every pregnancy to term  since i believe life begins at conception  it should be protected  and i believe it s a core function of state government to defend that life from the beginning of conception   he said governor mary fallin  an anti abortion conservative  is almost certainly going to sign the bill into law  especially when you consider the fact that oklahoma republicans have passed several anti abortion measures over the last few years this latest and gravest attack on abortion rights makes it impossible for doctors to provide a legitimate medical procedure that many women need because the doctor who performs the abortion faces arrest and prison according to the chicago tribune sen  ervin yen  an oklahoma city republican and the only physician in the senate  described the measure as  insane  and voted against it so even the only lawmaker in the senate who actually has a medical degree thinks this legislation is absolutely crazy it doesn t get any more clear how dangerous this bill is than that criminalizing abortion forces women to seek unsafe back alley abortions as they become more desperate to end a pregnancy  and since doctors probably won t risk being imprisoned  it means clinics will shut down  thus depriving women of the option of a safe abortion  in short  oklahoma republicans want the state to go back to a time when women died in droves due to unsafe abortions the center for reproductive rights condemned the bill as a  new low  by oklahoma republicans and it is expected that a legal challenge will be immediately filed should it be signed into law featured image via pixabay
