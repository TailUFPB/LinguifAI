world renowned political theorist and activist noam chomsky has made his feelings about donald trump very publicly known when he openly called trump a  clown  a few months ago   and his message to america is now more urgent than ever in a piece posted on alternet  chomsky speaks directly to progressives in swing states that aren t fond of democratic nominee hillary clinton or trump  chomsky himself isn t completely pro hillary   he is actually quite critical of her on certain things like foreign policy   but he makes an eight point argument that trump is such a danger to this country  progressives would be smart to vote for the  lesser evil  in fact  chomsky flat out says that voting for clinton could very well save the planet because trump is such a major threat to not only americans  but the entire world  in his piece  chomsky points out that on the subject of climate change alone  trump is deadly  he said  one of these candidates  trump  denies the existence of global warming  calls for increasing use of fossil fuels  dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement  the combination of which could  in four years  take us to a catastrophic tipping point  and chomsky hadn t even addressed the fact that trump continuously insults other countries  doesn t have an ounce of empathy in his bones  and is not emotionally stable enough to be trusted with the codes to nuclear weapons  however  chomsky s major take away here is that in this election  americans shouldn t see voting as a moral act   at this point  we need to do whatever we can to prevent a devastating outcome  trump in the white house  chomsky wrote  voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values  or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites  chomsky reached out to progressives in particular when he said  the left should also recognize that  should trump win based on its failure to support clinton  it will repeatedly face the accusation  based in fact   that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration  you can read chomsky s entire piece here  this of course  is hardly the first time chomsky has urged americans to come to their senses about trump  you can watch the famed linguist talk about trump at length in the video below featured image via william b  plowman and scott eisen   getty images
