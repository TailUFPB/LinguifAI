a gay man cornered ted cruz on monday and the republican presidential candidate couldn t handle the simple question posed to him during a forum on abc s good morning america hosted by robin roberts  an openly gay republican restaurant owner concerned about so called  religious liberty  laws being passed by states like north carolina and mississippi asked cruz how he would protect lgbt people from discrimination if he were to become president  i ve noticed a lot of religious freedom laws and somewhat institutionalized discrimination laws happening around the country  what would you as president do to protect me and my husband   todd calogne directly asked and cruz didn t waste time going into spin mode the texas senator claimed that the anti lgbt laws  protects everyone  even though they blatantly allow business owners to discriminate against lgbt customers and employees by shielding their bigotry with the bible under the guise of religious freedom  religious liberty  it applies to jews  it applies to christians  it applies to muslims  it applies to atheists   cruz said even though he has repeatedly stated his intention to violate the religious liberty of muslims and atheists  also  being gay isn t a religion  it s a sexual orientation  and all of us  we want to live in a world where we don t have the government dictating our beliefs  dictating how we live   cruz continued   we have a right to live according to our faith  according to our conscience  and we shouldn t have a right to force others to give up their faith and give up their belief  and i think that keeping government out of the way of your lives protects the freedom of every one of us  cruz dodged calogne s question but robin roberts didn t let him get away with it  a lot of people would say  doesn t everyone have the freedom to be treated equally   she asked   don t we all have the freedom to be equal  of course we do   cruz flat out lied to the faces of every american watching  cruz then declared that  the first amendment protects everyone equally  it protects our faith  before launching into how he intends to push for a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage  which finally gave calogne the answer he had been waiting for  under the constitution  marriage is a question for the states  and so if someone wants to change the marriage laws  i don t think it should be five unelected lawyers down in washington dictating that  if you want to change the marriage law  convince your fellow citizens to change the laws  in other words  cruz would not protect the rights of gay people as president  he would strip rights from them and treat them like second class citizens here s the video via abc  abc breaking news   latest news videos religious liberty  laws like those in north carolina and mississippi allow anti gay business owners to openly discriminate against gay people  it s legalized bigotry similar to the kind experienced by black people in the  during segregation  and republicans are literally hiding behind religion to justify and protect their bigotry featured image  flickr
