no one can accuse duck dynasty star phil robertson of being able to use the few brain his god saw fit to bless him with  nobody can accuse him of not clinging so desperately to his faith that he literally can t see anything else  either  to that end  while speaking at the western conservative summit in denver  he put forth what he no doubt believes is ironclad proof that the son of his god  jesus christ  actually existed what s his proof  it s definitely not scientific proof  it s also not even biblical proof  no his proof is so uniquely out there that it defies description   calendar documents it is  years since jesus showed up  right  so don t tell me he wasn t here by the way  if your calendar is dated of all the human beings who have ever walked on the earth  and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of  em  evidently something rather large went down  wow  he s really got us there this is a good time to start scratching your head while wondering just what manner of derpiness this is  our calendar  dedicated to just jesus  simply because it s the year   don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts  especially considering that the names of most of the months are based on things that are so un christian they re blasphemy robertson could stand to read this little history lesson if he s going to make wild claims about our calendar  although it s entirely possible that he d call it all satan s lies  or something like that  it s really hard to cure someone like him of willful ignorance  he d just come up with more willful ignorance featured image by justin sullivan getty images
