when donald trump banned the washington post from his events  he no doubt thought it was the boldest move yet in his war against the  dishonest  media  the post  however  is far from the first outlet to fall to trump s wrath  to date  trump has actually banned nine media outlets from covering his events  nine  but he won t stop until he s sure the coverage he s getting fits his definition of  honest  and  fair  the new york times  whom trump reviles but somehow hasn t totally banned yet  went to work compiling a list of blacklisted outlets after explaining why trump banned the post  they added  in reality  of course  no one would be more miserable than mr  trump if these bans actually resulted in less coverage of his campaign  that s a truth bomb if ever there was one  trump s need for glowing praise  kowtowing and general ass kissing means he absolutely must hog as much of the spotlight as possible  that includes all the favorable media coverage he can get  but if he thinks that coverage will become more favorable after he bans outlets in fits of rage appropriate to a toddler  he ll be sorely disappointed the truly funny thing about this is that he hasn t thought it through at all  reporters from blackballed outlets can still attend most of trump s events as members of the general public  they can t get credentials  and they can t attend his official press conferences  but they can still go to and cover rallies and other events  that means that trump is spiraling down into some serious delusions if he thinks these bans will solve his imagined problems with the media so who  besides the post  has he banned  and why besides banning entire outlets  he s barred reporters from mother jones  fusion  and the new york times  and claimed credit for getting the new hampshire union leader dropped from a debate after they published a front page op ed denouncing him in demonstration of his racism  the new tri state defender  a traditionally black publication  can t even get responses to emails requesting credentials  yet he ll issue credentials to alex jones  infowars  which is quite possibly one of the most craftily dumb conspiracy sites on the internet trump claims he won t ban any media from the white house press room when he s elected  telling cnn   it s a different thing   he added  when i m representing the united states  i wouldn t do that  but i would let people know if somebody s untruthful  oh  baloney  the people of the u s  will believe that when they see it  however  that could go two ways  one is obvious   he ll keep banning the outlets he hates until there are none left to cover him  the other is that he ll come to his senses  such as they are  and realize that a growing blacklist means less food for his narcissistic ego  either way  he s out of hand with his  featured image by gerardo mora getty images
