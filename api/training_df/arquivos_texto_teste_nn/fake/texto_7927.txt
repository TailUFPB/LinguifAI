for those of us who watched the shameful msnbc  prime time  trump town hall event with the growing sense that the network s moderators  joe scarborough and mika brzezinksi  were feeding trump the easiest softball questions  the smoking gun may have just been found  and in the most improbable of places on an episode of harry sheerer s podcast  the long time simpsons cast member obtained and then played a tape purported  and later confirmed  to be taken on msnbc s set during trump s prime time special  the tape makes it abundantly clear that the network was working hand in hand with the republican front runner to keep him happy and at ease during what was supposed to be a combative  town hall  q a joe scarborough and mika brzezinkski  already long time personal friends with trump  have been fending off accusations that they are in the bag for the candidate for weeks  this tape is exactly the opposite of what they needed as the wrap noted  the discussions  taken during commercial breaks  center around ensuring trump is okay with certain questions  brzezinski can be heard asking trump if he wants her to skip over a tricky deportation question entirely  do you not want me to do  the um  the ones with  um  deportation  we really do have to go to some questions   scarborough responds before trump chimes in with   nothing too hard  mika  brzezinski can be heard saying   ok   directly after trump s remark  the town hall never featured a question about deportation  shearer says the audio came from his  found objects department  and jokes you can cut the adversarial tension there with a knife  a butter knife  but still  at one point  brzezinski tells trump she thought he didn t have a great debate performance  yay  but then scarborough butts in by assuring trump  we were wrong   wait what  the mood remains friendly throughout  so much for tough questions for trump  a man who continually accuses the press of being unfair to him scarborough  in particular  has been a unabashed trump superfan for months  by his own account  he s helped trump prepare for debates and has often gone to bat for the business mogul against whichever group trump happened to offend that day  after trump s massive win in new hampshire  scarborough and brzezinksi reportedly celebrated with trump in his hotel room  the next morning  he was a featured guest on their show listen to the leaked audio below via harry shearer s le show podcast and decide for yourself   leaked audio begins around the  minute mark  featured image via msnbc
