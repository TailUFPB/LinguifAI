on the night that donald trump won his second straight primary  with a massive lead   a despondent glenn beck decided it was time to take action to support his favored candidate  ted cruz  he announced on his facebook page that he would begin fasting on monday to push ted cruz to victory in the upcoming nevada republican caucus   somehow in the post  which raised eyebrows and made eyes roll  the ever melodramatic beck told his fans  i would like to ask you to join me and my family monday in a fast for ted cruz  our country and the nevada caucus  https   www facebook com glennbeck posts  also said he would be spending every waking hour until the caucus on february  devoted to promoting cruz  he s not kidding  on sunday  cruz will leave behind the guy from duck dynasty and replace him with beck  who will host an event for the candidate in las vegas  on monday  beck will again join cruz  this time in reno beck s support for cruz seems to come singularly from his disdain for donald trump  for reasons that remain unclear  beck has a seething hatred for trump that borders on obsessive  it s odd because in so many ways   bigotry  race baiting  xenophobia   the two are very much alike in a hilarious show of how little self awareness he possesses  beck infamously declared that any tea party supporter who favored trump was actually just a racist while he questioned whether trump s supporters are genuine tea partiers  beck said of them   if you were a tea party person  then you were lying  you were lying  it was about barack obama being black  it was about him being a democrat  talk about biting the hand that feeds you  beck is no doubt right that much of the tea party movement was based in racism  but supporting trump isn t contrary to that movement  it s the logical conclusion it s unclear what beck hopes to accomplish by starving himself and his family in order to help ted cruz get elected  yet again it appears that beck is trying to explicitly tie religious ceremony into the race  and fasting appears to be beck s go to way of getting god s attention  just last summer  he went on a six day fast to get ready for an appearance in birmingham  he told his fans  join us in fasting and prayer that we may all be humble enough to not only hear the path of the almighty but we may be willing to walk it with honor  courage  love and unity  last week he boldly declared that god killed supreme court justice antonin scalia in order to ensure ted cruz became president  apparently unwilling to  let go and let god   beck now hopes to nudge him along a little bit more with his mass hunger strike featured image via glenn beck
