the young turks reporter jimmy dore captured some incredible footage at last night s democratic caucus in nevada dore was covering the las vegas caucus  held at the paris hotel in clark county  this is the most highly populated area of nevada  and the county is a must win for presidential candidates hoping to capture their party s nomination earlier in the day on wednesday  a caucus goer by the name of james porter uploaded a disturbing cell phone video to youtube porter documented caucus leaders telling attendees to  come in to caucus without registering   that s a direct quote the video shows a large group of people standing at the registration table  a female official is then heard telling the group not to register to vote immediately after she gives this direction  a male official shushes her  saying  don t yell it  when the officials are questioned about allowing people who are not registered to caucus  one responds by saying   they will register after the caucus  watch the video below what happened after that is even more unbelievable as reported by the jimmy dore show  the caucus was total chaos from beginning to end  there doesn t seem to be any organization to this   dore says the video shows the way the votes were tallied during the caucus  with the unnamed official taking a cursory head count  the video then shows the leader of the caucus writing stuff on his hand no official report was given regarding the head count  or the number of voters caucusing for either candidate it was then announced that  as of today s caucus results  senator sanders has gained seven delegates  secretary clinton has   oh  i m sorry   six delegates  secretary clinton has gained  delegates  at this point it seemed that the caucus was over  but as dore reports  it was at this time that the chairman of the caucus realized he  made two huge mistakes  first  all of the people who were allowed to caucus without ever registering to vote were never directed to return to the registration table at the end of the caucus worse  the caucus ended before delegates were ever chosen for either candidate the video shows the chairman telling people not to leave by this time it s way too late as almost everyone was already gone watch the report from the jimmy dore show below while it s clear that dore  and the rest of the tyt personalities  favor sanders over clinton  the issues documented in these videos should outrage every democratic voter  regardless of which candidate you support there s clear  undeniable evidence that people who were not registered to vote were not just allowed to caucus  they were directed to do so no matter how you look at it  it s not just a violation of the rules of the democratic party  it s also a criminal offense not surprisingly  the videos above are a virtual goldmine for the conservative media  which is reporting on them as  proof of hillary clinton voter fraud   and  proof of democratic voter fraud  the problems with the caucus were not just confined to this single location  voters are reporting that people were writing on other people s ballots  while others claim their names were not recorded to the correct candidate during the registration process the democratic party needs to take these allegations very seriously  especially because there is undeniable proof that unregistered voters were allowed to participate in yesterday s caucus featured image from video screen capture via the jimmy dore show on youtube
