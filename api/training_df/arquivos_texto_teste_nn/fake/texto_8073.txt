a new poll conducted in south carolina on the heels of the state s republican primary reveals the true extent of hatred from donald trump s base   and it is terrifying currently  trump is expected to easily win south carolina  his nearest competitor isn t even close  the landslide is so bad that trump has hardly had to campaign in the state  while others scramble to fight for second place  what makes trump so popular  a look at the values these voters hold gives us the disturbing answer public policy polling asked south carolinians several questions about issues trump has alluded to on the campaign trail and found that many of them support his most hateful rhetoric  some even feel he doesn t go far enough on the question of banning muslims from entering the united states  one third of trump s supporters said they would like to add  homosexuals  to the  can not enter  list  no other candidate s supporters came even close to that level of intolerance  but they weren t finished there s also   support among trump voters for creating a national database of muslims and   support for shutting down all the mosques in the united states  something no one else s voters back  only   of trump voters think the practice of islam should even be legal at all in the united states  to   who think it should be illegal  to put all the views toward muslims in context though    of trump voters continue to believe the policy of japanese internment during world war ii was a good one the message is clear  making america great again means purging everyone who isn t white and christian trump s supporters also felt that slavery wasn t so bad  either  in fact   percent of them said they wished the south had won the civil war  another  percent weren t sure  as ppp dryly put it  trump s were  the only one whose supporters actually wish the south had won   needless to say  an overwhelming majority of his fans   percent  felt that the confederate flag should still be flying over the state capital and as if all of those wistful call backs to a time when white people owned black people were just too subtle  a full   of trump s supporters say they think whites are the  superior race    the only candidate to have double digit support for this racist concept following trump s latest snafu  during the debate  he correctly pointed out that george w  bush had been president during    a republican no no    there was some speculation that he would suffer in the polls  that appears to not be the case  it is ted cruz  in fact  who was found to be the most unlikable candidate in the race   no surprise there  everyone hates ted cruz once they get to know him   meanwhile  trump has actually gained a few points since the debate it s clear that targeting trump on any particular gaffe or talking point won t work  trump s supporters are fanatical  singularly focused  and fueled by intolerance and hatred  trump can continue to attack his fellow republicans or their beloved george w  bush just as long as he doesn t forget to mock and scapegoat minorities as well  his base demands it it is often said that trump s popularity is due to his ability to say what others won t  if that s the case  he s saying an awful lot about the toxic underbelly of the republican party featured image from flickr alex hanson
