in a baffling fit of rage  an oregon state police officer has been convicted of ramming his car into a stopped motorcyclist then kicking the dazed man so hard in the chest that he would need a metal plate and screws to repair his shattered collarbone and ribs  what state police captain rob edwards didn t know was that his department have installed a functioning dashboard camera  it captured the entire shocking scene the  incident with a chase that the victim says he didn t know was happening  the first he learned of edwards  presence was when the cop was running directly into the back of his motorcycle  spilling the man from his bike  the man gets up with his hands raised only to find edwards rushing at him with his pistol held sideways  probably imitating something he saw in a movie  the biker  identified as justin wilkens  barely had time to say  what did i do   before edwards kicked him square in the chest with such force that wilkens would later learn he broke his collarbone and several ribs edwards would later say that he was  frustrated  with wilkens for not complying to his demands sooner  how    and that he didn t realize his car was equipped with a functioning dashcam what edwards didn t know was that the unmarked car he was driving was equipped with a functioning dashboard camera so when edwards eventually struck justin wilkens  motorcycle with his car  then pulled his gun and kicked wilkens in the chest  he did not know that the whole episode would be played   again and again   before a u s  district court jury it s not hard to see why the dashcam was a bitter pill for edwards   thanks to the footage his trial lasted all of three days and he was promptly convicted  he and his department will now have to pay    in damages  bizarrely  wilkens could have received more but the jury decided that a cop pointing a pistol at his head didn t constitute psychological damages  how militarized has law enforcement become in america a cop aiming sideways guns at complying suspects is now considered so routine that courts are suggesting people just get used to it in the past year  the conversation over police cameras has consumed the debate over police abuse  some critics have pointed out that cameras didn t lead to justice for victims of police abuse like  year old tamir rice and in the horrific death of eric garner  but on the other hand  it s hard to imagine cops like edwards receiving any sort of punishment without them  for instances where cops cross the line  video of them doing so can be a godsend to the victims  juries tend to err on the side of the police  but even they can t ignore what they see with their own eyes  usually cops know this as well as anyone  it s no surprise that edwards lamented his dashcam  under the impression it wasn t working  he felt at ease shattering a man s collarbone because he was  frustrated  feature image via youtube
