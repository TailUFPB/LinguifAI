the head of the department of homeland security was at a judiciary committee hearing on capitol hill when  after enduring a lengthy rant about muslims from sen  ted cruz  he finally had enough  as cruz checked the boxes off on his islamophobia checklist  he wound up asking the same stupid question repeatedly to dhs secretary jeh johnson  why is the white house refusing to use the term  radical islam  as national security issues go  this one is somewhere around the bottom of the priority list  as has been repeatedly pointed out by military and foreign policy experts  the term  radical islam  doesn t do a single thing to stop terrorism  while at the same time playing directly into the hands of terrorist groups like isis  as a rule  presidents don t like to engage in that terminology precisely because it works to undermine the fight against global terrorism  ted cruz might even dimly recall how the last republican president  george w  bush  also didn t like to lump all muslims into the category of  terrorists   even he understood that it was self defeating  americans understand we fight not a religion    said   ours is not a campaign against the muslim faith  ours is a campaign against evil  although  have taken very different approaches to combating terrorism  it s strikingly hard to tell the difference between their statements on the divide between the majority of those who practice islam and those who invoke the faith to carry out violence  there are thousands of muslims who proudly call themselves americans  and they know what i know   that the muslim faith is based upon peace and love and compassion   bush once said americans might understand that  but ted cruz apparently didn t at the hearing  cruz demanded to know if president obama or anyone else in the white house had intentionally removed  references to radical islamic terrorism   after several times rebuking cruz  johnson finally snapped  senator  i find this whole debate to be very interesting  but i have to tell you  when i was at the department of defense giving the legal sign off on a lot of drone strikes i didn t particularly care if the baseball card said  islamic extremist  or  violent extremist   i think this is very interesting  but it makes no difference to me in terms of who we need to go after  and who is determined to attack our homeland  as secretary johnson reminded cruz  the war against groups like isis won t be won by semantics  the airstrikes are real  the fighting on the ground  often times most heavily supported by muslim nations  is real  the words a blustering ted cruz wants to use aren t  but johnson wasn t down twisting the knife  the other point i d like to make is that i have to think in practical terms in homeland security  i think this is all very interesting  makes for good political debate  but in practical terms  if we in our efforts here in the homeland start giving the islamic state the credence that they want   to be referred to as part of islam or some form of islam   we will get nowhere in our efforts to build bridges with muslim communities  in other words  stop grandstanding  ted  take a seat and shut up watch sec  johnson make mincemeat of cruz below featured image via youtube
