the first thing that comes to mind when you think of hillary clinton s response to the las vegas shooting is that she s gone on twitter and removed all doubt that she s clueless when it comes to guns and gun control  what s even more unbelievable is she wasted no time politicizing this horrific event while asking everyone else not to  we can and must put politics aside  stand up to the nra  and work together to try to stop this from happening again  she tweeted out several times just digging herself a deeper hole with her ignorance and lack of compassion for the victims  her first tweet let us know she s clueless about the particular weapon used in this crime the second tweet was another dig at the nra and clinton has the nerve to say we need to  put politics aside  when she isn t fox news host christ stirewalt said what everyone is thinking go away
