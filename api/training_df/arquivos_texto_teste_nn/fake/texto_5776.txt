rachel maddow never pulls any punches when it comes to holding politicians accountable  and she made no exception tuesday night when she lit in to presumptive gop  presidential nominee donald trump  in fact  maddow called trump out for what he is  a con artist  not only that  but it seems that trump s campaign is nothing more than a scam to line his own pockets  and maddow seems to be chomping at the bit to prove it it seems that trump s campaign has raised roughly    million in the month of may  of course  raising money is normal for political campaigns  but there s a problem regarding the trump campaign   most of the money he raised went right into his own pockets  or those of his family members  further  more than     meaning more than   million of the roughly   million in expenditures for trump s campaign   has gone to the real estate mogul s own properties  but wait   it gets better  trump is actually paying himself to campaign for president  without further ado  here is a screenshot of that proof  from federal elections commission filings  via winning democrats and twitter looks like the candidate is drawing a salary  pic twitter com   southpaw   nycsouthpaw  june     rachel maddow was having none of it  she unleashed her wrath on trump s apparent scam  and his rolling the dice with a presidential election in an effort to make more money like the con artist we all know him to be  she said  these are not the kinds of expenditures you would expect from someone who s actually running a campaign for president who actually intends to win the presidency  it s more like a concert tour  it s more like a promotional tour for a celebrity who s hocking something than it is like a campaign where you need people to go out and vote for you in november i mean  the biggest expenses are private jets  renting out venues   preferably ones where mr  trump gets to pay rent to himself for using that venue   and also swag  merchandise is what the trump campaign is spending its money on  speaking of merchandise  the campaign gets its hats from a woman who sits on the board at nazi sympathizer eric trump s charitable foundation  the polite way to say this is it s a racket  it s not designed to necessarily win the election   while trump might win  maddow points out that it s pretty clear  it s not the aim  it is a byproduct of what is the principal effort  which is to make money  so  in other words  trump is using a united states presidential election to make money  he doesn t want to be president  he wants to line his own pockets  let s just hope that he doesn t manage to actually win an office he clearly doesn t even want  trump wants power and money  this campaign and this election are nothing more than a scam and a power play for donald trump  we don t need this person as our commander in chief watch the evidence of trump s con artistry at the expense of the american people below featured image via video screen capture
