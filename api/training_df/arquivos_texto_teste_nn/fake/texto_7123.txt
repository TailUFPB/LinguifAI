with donald trump taking the republican party and the nation by storm  it s easy to say that no one really saw him getting as far as he has during this election cycle  and while many of us wish he never threw his name into the ring as a gop contender  it looks as though we re not the only ones who didn t want him to run even though she will be campaigning for him for the first time in wisconsin this coming week  melania trump definitely had her reservations about her husband running in the first place during an interview with the washington post  trump revealed that melania wasn t excited about the possibility of him becoming a candidate  according to trump  she said   we have such a great life  why do you want to do this  and in a very trumpian fashion  trump responded to her as though he s superman needed to come to the rescue of the nation  i said   i sort of have to do it  i think  i really have to do it         i could do such a great job  but melania said  i hope you don t do it  but if you run  you ll win  however  trump being trump and unable to respect a woman s opinion on pretty much anything  he ignored his wife s wishes to just continue on with their life as usual to be with their son and run his business ventures  instead  he decided to run for dictator of the universe  or at least that s sure as hell how it seems it s becoming more clear than ever that donald trump is in this election not for the country  but rather for donald trump  within the mind of the narcissist  he believes that he  with no experience whatsoever in political and diplomatic leadership  can take the reins of the united states of america  and while his applause lines may work on the nincompoops within the republican party for the primary elections  they most certainly will not work in the general election among people who can actually critically think   the democrats  however  we must make sure he and his imbecilic following doesn t even remotely get the chance to win  so remember   no matter who  vote blue featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
