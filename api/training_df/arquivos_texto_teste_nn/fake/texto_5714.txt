as the united states celebrates gay pride  marriage equality enters its first year  and the world partakes in solidarity for those lost in the orlando shooting  pope francis is issuing his own personal decree to fellow christians  apologize for marginalizing lgbt citizens after a holy trip to armenia  pope francis bluntly stated that the catholic church  as well as other christians  needed to apologize to gays and lesbians for  not having comported itself well many times  many times  and called all christians  sinners  for ostracizing them for so many years  i believe that the church not only must say its sorry   to this person that is gay that it has offended  but it must say it  sorry to the poor  also  to mistreated women  to children forced to work  when i say the church  christians  the church is healthy  we are the sinners  when responding to questions regarding german cardinal reinhard marx  who suggested the church apologize  francis doubled down  i will repeat the same thing i said on the first trip  i will also repeat what the catechism of the catholic church says  that  should not be discriminated against  that they have to be respected  pastorally accompanied  the matter is a person that has that condition  that has good will because they search for god  who are we to judge them  francis  using anecdotes from his younger days in argentina  praised the shift of acceptance  saying   the culture has changed   and thank god  christians  we must say we are sorry many times  not only on this  these are the pope s strongest words yet in favor of a broader acceptance of lgbtq in the church  as republican lawmakers  many of whom are catholic  continue down a generous and hateful road of bigotry and discrimination  the real catholics  including the leader of the church  are standing firm against hatred and bigotry although not an endorsement of unions of love between same sex couples  a big step in the right direction   yet again   no doubt  a culture of acceptance makes way for endless possibilities featured image via wikipedia
