for the last couple of months  i ve been seeing numerous stories about the increasing rate of death among middle aged whites  as a middle aged white person myself i was curious  so i ve been looking at the articles  as i did so  i noticed an interesting trend  see if you can spot it a week after it was published by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences  a paper by the princeton economists anne case and angus deaton showing that middle aged white americans are dying in much larger numbers than they used to is still the talk of the town    the new yorkersomething startling is happening to middle aged white americans    ny timesbirth of a plague   newsweekand here s the most recent and perfect example  according to new research into a crisis that is increasingly worrying healthcare officials and policymakers    la timesisn t it amazing how white people dying is suddenly a huge problem that needs to be addressed  apparently  much of the spike is attributable to drugs  drinking  suicide and lack of proper healthcare  that  in turn  is attributable to the great recession as millions of people s lives were destroyed by forces outside of their control not to belittle their suffering  much  but boohoo  the black community has been dealing with this kind of widespread economic destruction for decades  there s a reason that every other corner in a ghetto is a liquor store  drive through parts of d c  and you ll see what i mean  and drug use is rampant and it s not because black people are morally deficient as some people  conservatives  would like you to believe but now that white people are facing the same levels of despair and lack of opportunity  they re responding in much the same way and america is very very concerned about their welfare  we need to do something about this crisis this hypocrisy ties into the sudden about face on the war on drugs  once upon a time  society needed to throw every drug user into to jail for decades at a time to protect society  that most of those arrested just happened to be black was just a coincidence  surely  these days  however  drug use has exploded in white neighborhoods as meth and heroin use are skyrocketing but instead of demands for more mass incarceration  we hear pleas for mercy and understanding  we have to do something to help these poor victims but only the white ones if your blood isn t boiling right now  you haven t been paying attention  murikkka featured image via micetrap
