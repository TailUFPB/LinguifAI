rick scott is an absolutely horrible governor and literally gives zero f cks about the people of florida   even babies  governor scott is being accused of eliminating health standards for children s heart surgery after a hospital donated    to republicans  including his own political action committee in   cnn revealed that st  mary s medical center in west palm beach had an extremely high mortality rate in their pediatric cardiology program  between  and   the hospital had a   percent death rate for open heart surgeries on babies and children  by comparison  the national average was   percent  so many children were dying at the hospital that in  five independent pediatric heart doctors arrived at the hospital to review the program  the doctors were horrified by what they found  and recommended that the hospital stop performing surgery on babies under six months old and not perform any complicated procedures on older children the hospital ignored their advice and more children and babies died  the state of florida was warned by multiple highly respected cardiologists that the hospital had problems  but the state did nothing  actually  that s not true  they did something far worse than nothing two moths after cnn s investigation was published  the state eliminated standards that have been in place for nearly forty years to protect pediatric heart patients  why  because during the same period of time that all of the children were dying in st  mary s  the owners of the hospital  tenet healthcare  donated    to rick scott s pac and the republican party of florida david nykanen  co director of the heart center at arnold palmer hospital for children in orlando  called the move to eliminate the standards after the donations  too much  of a coincidence  the coincidence is just a little too much  it s just a little hard to swallow  tenet s shelly weiss friedberg told cnn that they had nothing to do with the state s decision  at no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office  or with any elected official or anyone on their staff  our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the cardiac technical advisory panel  nyakanen was not convinced  saying  if someone is contributing at that level  obviously they have to have some influence  if tenet healthcare contributed so much money  you d think they have the ear of the governor and the politicians  last month administrative law judge john van laningham agreed that the state should do away with the standards  claiming that suggesting the quality of healthcare would diminish is a little insulting to the health care professionals who personally deliver those services   but at st  mary s the quality was never there to begin with and if anything the state should have stepped in and prevented the hospital from ever operating on tiny humans again  of course  this is rick scott s florida that we are talking about and he cares little about the people of the state he was elected to serve this is not the first time rick scott has screwed over the people of florida when it comes to healthcare  the former hospital ceo medicare thief and house republicans brought the government to a grinding halt when they refused to expand medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor  now that they have done this  it is absolutely crystal clear that florida s gop led government will stop at nothing to help their donors   even if that means killing your children featured image via facebook
