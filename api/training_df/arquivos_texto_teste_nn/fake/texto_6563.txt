target stores are living up to their name by being the literal  target  of anti lgbt  transphobic bigots and professionally offended  christians   who are now showing up at their locations across the country  their intent  it seems  is to frighten patrons into being afraid to use the bathroom  walking up and down the aisles  and wearing shirts depicting stick figures having sex  they shout and scream about how god is the new judge of retail merchandise as they try to convince people the women s restrooms are loaded with perverts below are some videos taken in target stores  showing the  preachers  rebuking people for going to the bathroom  target this is your wake up call  the bible says that from the beginning god made them male and female  he didn t make them transvestites  he made them male and female target  this is your warning  you will be judged according to god s standards  not man s  but god s you need to repent you will be judged  and if there are christians in here  supporting this abomination  shame on you    but you justify this place  you have to stand by the bathrooms because perverts can go in there  because transvestites allowed  apparently  god can create a universe in  days but can t deal with the idea of someone peeing in a bathroom in a department store one of these god warriors  michael merichko  was charged with disorderly conduct following a disturbance inside a target store in illinois  his obnoxiousness  coupled with the fact he was an unhinged white guy  convinced an entire shopping mall to go on lockdown because they thought he was an active shooter via towleroadluckily he was not  but frankly it isn t a stretch to think that some unhinged individual will eventually walk into a target store and start shooting because god told them it was a good idea below is another religious idiot in st  louis who is too obsessed with the idea of people peeing for his own good part   part   the republican party can be thanked for this  if it wasn t for people like ted cruz using religion as a justification for hatred  target would never have had to make a  bathroom policy   transgender people have been using public restrooms forever without god destroying the planet as a result  it took republicans to make it a sudden problem for him featured image via video screen capture
