anyone who watched barack obama break into tears as he spoke of the  children and six adults murdered at sandy hook elementary can tell that the president is a man who truly feels for the victims of gun violence   anyone  that is  who doesn t work for fox news after the president s announcement that he would be doing what congress is unwilling to do   expanding background check and gun safety regulations  including closing the  gun show loophole   all sensible measures    the hosts of outnumbered pounced on the president s plan  arguing that he was violating the separation of powers doctrine  what really bothered them  however  was the idea that a human being is capable of showing emotion that is not fake  and so begins onionghazi  brought to you by our friends at fox news  what was really upsetting was the tears that he wiped away again and again   melissa francis said   you want that for   i mean  we feel frightened about what s going on with isis  and he can t pull that kind of passion for anything about this   she added that she feels  bad about those kids  in newtown  but claimed it s  only about this that he gets so upset about  after a commercial break  andrea  tantaros jumped into the fray  arguing that president obama s tears must be fake because  he would have spoken out a long time ago  if he really cared   especially in favorite conservative talking point  chicago  this is how many years  almost eight years  he s almost at the end of his term  and you haven t heard him go to chicago and really speak out about this issue  and he is uniquely poised to do so  but everything that he s doing will not solve the problem so  i would check that podium for like a raw onion or some no more tears  it s not really believable  and the award goes to  we are in awards season  it just didn t seem horribly authentic   meghan mccain agreed   and maybe it is  i don t know him at all   in any case  she thinks the president should go to chicago instead of  talking about god fearing americans when isis is coming to their hometown and shooting up  people  they say he s just cool  that s the way he is  that he doesn t get emotional   francis chimed in   we haven t seen this in a very long time and it s about something that feels political  that feels somewhat insincere  that feels like it s not going to make a huge difference  it s like bad political theater   mccain opined it s something that was to be expected  president obama showed compassion for murdered children  so the right has assumed what they feel is a duty to for some reason attempt to convince people that he is not sincere   an act that is shameful at best watch it below featured image via video screen capture
