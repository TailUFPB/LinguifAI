students of robert e  lee elementary school in austin  texas  along with their parents  have been battling over the school s name for well over a year as kxan reported here  an advisory panel heard testimony from people on both sides of the argument in january daniel oppenheimer  whose children attend the school  told kxan the name should be changed  saying  it s actually an active deterrent for black families and families of color to attend our school  i think that s reason enough why it s worth thinking about changing  another parent  jessica grogan  expressed similar concerns  telling reporters  i d say my main reason is it is alienating to certain families and i feel like it doesn t represent our community values  watch video from the january board meeting  courtesy of kxan below following the meeting  the campus advisory board recommended that the school board begin taking steps to change the name of the school problem solved  right wrong  because it s texas the school board asked parents and community members to submit suggestions for the new name the leading suggestions were as follows donald j  trump elementary   nominations robert e  lee elementary   nominations russell lee elementary   nominations harper lee elementary   nominations elisabet ney elementary   nominationsthere were plenty of others as well  such as bleeding heart liberal elementary  communist elementary and the illuminati among the least controversial suggestions submitted by texans were generic school  elementary school    bee movie  schoolie mcschoolface and the rubber duckies read all  pages of suggested names here while the original plan was to select from the list of top contenders  it s highly unlikely the school board will approve a name like donald trump elementary it s sad that so many members of this austin  texas community chose not to take the issue seriously  as so many students and parents pointed out  a public school has a duty to ensure that no student is discriminated against and all students feel valued and welcome the school board hasn t said how it plans to proceed with selecting a new name  in light of the submissions received the best option appears to be limiting community involvement as much as possible featured image via linda lawrence via facebook
