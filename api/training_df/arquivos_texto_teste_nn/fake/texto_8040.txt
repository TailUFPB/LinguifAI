in the frenzy over donald trump s meteoric rise in the polls  many voters seem to have forgotten that his closest competitor  sen  ted cruz  is equally nutty  just as much of a liar  and possibly even more dangerous in south carolina  cruz s entire campaign rests on appealing to the state s deeply religious conservative population  unfortunately  he s still losing to trump by a wide margin   even among evangelicals  as a last ditch effort  cruz appears to have tapped his  south carolina evangelical chairman   a conservative pastor named mike gonzalez  to promise christian republicans the one thing that trump won t  an american theocracy on msnbc  gonzalez told host joy reid that a ted cruz presidency would be based in christianity  what about the constitution which strictly prohibits that  easy  explained pastor gonzalez  the separation of church and state is a lie and cruz sees that  well  the reality of it is that this idea of the separation of church and state is a myth  i mean  you bring your faith into the marketplace like you do anything else  so ted cruz is a   will be a president not just  you know who is a preacher and pastor in the white house  that s not the idea  i believe all americans can rally around ted cruz because he upholds the constitution  i believe all americans want to truly uphold the law  some of the laws cruz doesn t believe should be upheld  healthcare reform  he shutdown the government trying to stop it   gay marriage  he tried to shut down the government trying to stop it   abortion rights  welfare programs  the right of a  democratic  president to pick supreme court justices  the list goes on reid wasn t buying gonzalez s crap  immediately  she pushed back on the idea that the constitution was cool with ted cruz establishing a theocracy  the separation of church and state is not a myth  it s a constitutional fact  it s a fact on the ground  it s a part of our constitutional makeup  the founding fathers were explicit that they did not want to have a national church  can a candidate like ted cruz run on essentially saying he would ignore that part of the constitution  if you re saying he s a president who would actually run on the constitution  as mediaite s tommy christopher pointed out  cruz has been pretty explicit about the idea that he would run the white house as if it were his personal church  i m a christian first  i m an american second  i m a conservative third  and i m a republican fourth  and that s part of the problem  is that there are too many people who don t have that ordering correct  it s becoming clear that the voters supporting cruz are hoping to fulfill their wish of reversing many of the secular and progressive laws that have been passed in the last few decades  particularly under obama   as we ve seen with the battle over gay marriage  the issue is never about the rights of other people  but imposing conservative christian beliefs on everyone in america  for that  cruz is their man watch the scary exchange below featured image from msnbc
