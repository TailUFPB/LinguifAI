nbc s today show took the gloves off against donald trump on wednesday morning  rolling a video compilation that will no doubt leave the vainglorious candidate red faced with rage fresh from his victory in florida  which ended the campaign of home town candidate marco rubio  trump moves a step closer to becoming the presumptive republican candidate for president  but nbc rained on his parade by releasing the video he never wanted us to see  the compilation underscores the lack of integrity of the candidate in the video  trump is being asked about a powerful new ad against him  funded by the our principles pac  in which women read out the toxic comments trump has made against other women introducing the segment  host matt lauer takes a clip of trump speaking on good morning america on tuesday  and follows up with his statements on today just a few minutes later  revealing how the candidate gives a totally different story in each interview  this is what happened  he talked to abc first    here s what he said when asked about that ad   lauer states  rolling the footage we see trump on good morning america  stating that  well  you know  i have seen it  and it was a romney deal  lauer then moves to the second clip  saying  just a couple minutes later  he appeared live on this show  here s what he had to say  in the next clip  filmed literally minutes after his previous statement  trump has a completely different story  honestly  i have not seen the ad  so i would have to see it  i have heard about the ad  but i have not seen the ad  so  just minutes apart  trump has gone from saying that not only has he seen the video  but claiming to know that mitt romney is behind it   to revealing that he hasn t even seen the footage so far the trump campaign has made no formal response to the video  but it is highly embarrassing for the candidate who claims to be bringing a fresh  plain speaking approach to politics  but of course  it s no surprise to anyone actually bothering to fact check donald trump  after all  a recent study by politico which analyzed more than  hours of footage from the trump campaign found that candidate lies on average every five minutes  that might entertain some who are viewing this election campaign as if it were a reality show  but if trump makes it to the white house  those voters will be join their fellow americans in a reality most will find unbearable  featured image via screengrab
