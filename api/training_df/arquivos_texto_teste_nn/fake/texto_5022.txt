donald trump thought he could distract america from his insane  self destructing campaign by releasing what he called a  policy proposal  he thought wrong see  trump s latest proposal only did one thing   it highlighted the sheer irony of the entire trump campaign manifesto ideology  while himself being an anti gay  anti woman  anti rule of law candidate  trump wants to put in place a litmus test for immigrants  mostly muslims  that asks them  point blank  if they support women s rights  gay rights  and the rule of law well that didn t go over so well for a lot of people  including hillary clinton  while trump thought he could have everybody fooled  clinton reminded the public just who he really is   an idiot you oppose reproductive rights  support  conversion therapy   and proposed a muslim ban  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  august    other words  trump couldn t pass his own litmus test how can anyone expect a tyrant like trump to be serious on immigration and combating terrorism when he  instead of proposing actual solutions  throws red meat to the nationalism and xenophobic lot that s his base the united states already has a stringent process in place  and no one  not even hillary clinton  is going to let trump get away with an asinine  offensive  and blatantly profiled litmus test of  american values  that term is subjective anyways  with a wide range of applicability being considered hillary clinton has done a good job of pointing out trump s faults   whether they be his taxes  his fraud of a university  his  proposals  and so forth featured image via jessica kourkounis getty images
