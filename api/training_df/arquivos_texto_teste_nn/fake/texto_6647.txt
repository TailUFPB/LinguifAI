ever since former house speaker john boehner aired out his true feelings about republican presidential candidate ted cruz  everyone has been having a field day and running with it it all started on wednesday  when john boehner was asked about the  election during a forum at stanford university  it just so happened that cruz s name came up in the discussion  and boehner couldn t hold back his disgust for his fellow conservative  referring to cruz as  lucifer in the flesh   boehner mocked the texas senator  i have democrat friends and republican friends  i get along with almost everyone  but i have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life  this is a thought that many republicans would actually agree with  as it s been well documented that cruz is one of the least liked politicians   with several of those opinions coming from within the gop  this fact only gets proven time and time again on thursday  the white house hilariously failed to come to cruz s defense during a daily briefing  clearly amused by the republicans  in party fighting  the room broke out in giggles when cnn s michelle kosinski asked press secretary john earnest if he felt obama would agree with boehner s  lucifer  comment  and whether those remarks were appropriate or not earnest  trying to hold back laughter  suggested that boehner was just trying to be as truthful as possible  earnest was barely able to keep a straight face as he replied  obviously  speaker boehner was speaking based on his own experience  i don t know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful  i think he was just looking to be honest about his own view  weighing in on whether boehner s comments had crossed a line  earnest simply said that if kosinski was looking for somebody to come to the defense of one republican who s being attacked by another  you should probably ask somebody else  you can watch the hilarious moment below featured image via adam berry   getty images
