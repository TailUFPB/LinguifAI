republican congressional candidates have been the source of some of the most outrageous campaign ads over the last few years  a new ad from kentucky  district candidate mike pape is one of the most racist examples of this that has come across in a long time in the ad  three apparent mexicans approach a border fence wearing t shirts that say   stop trump   stop ted cruz  and  stop pape   the subtitled  heavily accented actors explain that pape will work to build trump s wall or help cruz repeal obamacare  before saying they must stop him and charge into the country illegally  pape then appears in the foreground to say he approves the message the ad builds on donald trump s racially charged campaign rhetoric and his bizarre promise to  build a wall  between the united states and mexico  paid for by the mexican government on the very first day of trump s campaign  he blamed mexicans for  bringing crime  like rape to america  as well as drugs gaskins is currently running in the republican primary for his district against three other candidates  for the seat that will be opened up due to the retirement of rep  ed whitfield  it is a heavily republican district  with  percent of the vote going to the gop in the  election the ad is a symptom of the problems plaguing the republican party nationally  as the country becomes more diverse  especially with latinos  the gop s hardcore base demands that candidates stick to racist and sexist appeals that reliably get voters to the polls and when republicans attempt to slightly moderate themselves   even with candidates who are otherwise hard conservatives   they are ostracized and excluded  for instance  while former florida governor jeb bush was an orthodox conservative  he argued in favor of immigration policy that was harsh but not as draconian as other candidates  as a result  bush was utterly destroyed in the  primaries and caucuses  even though he had more money than everyone else this ad reflects the current state of the republican party  and it isn t a good look featured image via youtube
