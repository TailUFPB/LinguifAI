last time i checked  the constitution still says declaring war is congress  job as a former lawyer and judge  one would think jeanine pirro would know what the constitution says  but during an appearance on fox   friends on friday morning  she demonstrated why she should never have been allowed to be in the legal profession in response to the devastating terrorist attack in nice  france in which  people have been confirmed dead and  injured  pirro trotted out the republican talking point of blaming president obama for the attack and claimed that he apologizes for america and persecutes christians  if this president would stop apologizing for what we do and what we are and stop saying  you christians  it s your turn  as he did at a prayer breakfast then maybe american would be united in a way that we understand that they re coming  they re here  i gotta tell ya  i m as aggravated as everyone who has sat in this chair today  we ve got a problem at the top of this country   pirro continued before summing president obama s legacy as  weak  one word  weak   she said   he just doesn t have a plan  he doesn t have a policy  he should be in academia  we ve got to declare war on them  we ve got to start having a conversation about surveillance on mosques  they just want to kill us  here s the video via youtube president obama has never apologized for america  nowhere is this clearer than when he visited hiroshima  japan and refused to apologize for the united states dropping the atomic bomb during world war ii  president obama is also not persecuting christians  his policies include all americans and do not target a specific religious sect furthermore  president obama has done the best he can to fight isis with the authority and resources he has available and that has resulted in   isis fighters and half of their commanders being killed by united states and coalition forces and if pirro really wants to blame someone for being weak against isis  she should point her finger at republicans in congress who refuse to exercise their power to declare war on isis  which would give president obama the full power to wage war against isis  but republicans don t want to do that because they would rather put all the responsibility on president obama so they can continue blaming him for each and every terrorist attack that occurs around the world for cheap political points just so pirro and every other conservative out there understands what the separation of powers means  here s the part of the constitution you are blatantly ignoring  because it s either that or you ve never actually read the document you claim to love so much article i  section   to declare war  grant letters of marque and reprisal  and make rules concerning captures on land and water seriously  republicans need to grow a pair and do their jobs if they really believe isis is a major threat to our country  if not  they should shut the hell up and stop attacking the only man in our government who is doing something featured image  screenshot
