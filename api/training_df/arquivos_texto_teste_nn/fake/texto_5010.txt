when it comes to donald trump and his number of apologists sent out to every media outlet to justify his horrific behavior  the media has been less than extraordinary at calling out their utter bullsh t however  leave it to ana navarro  notably a conservative  to absolutely rip trump s number one apologist apart during a recent segment on cnn former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski is now a regular commentator on cnn   remember that the next time trump wants to say the media has a liberal bias  lewandowski decided he would defend trump s racism and awful remarks  and navarro clearly has had just about enough of his shenanigans navarro  laying it all out on the table  brilliantly came back at lewandowski and said  i will tell you something  i will take credit for insulting him  because he s been insulting communities since the first day he launched his campaign  when he started talking about mexican rapists   the reason i can call donald trump names and i can insult him back is because i am the sister of a disabled man and he mocked that disabled man  because i am the friend of a pow and he mocked that pow  because i m an immigrant and he has insulted immigrants  because i m a hispanic and he has insulted hispanics  because i am a woman and he has insulted women  so  yeah  we re at the point where there s insults and name calling  but i would just say that he threw that rock first  he is the one who has lowered the debate to the level that it is at  however  honestly  my favorite part is when lewandowski tried to go after navarro personally trying to discredit her own experience  because this is what trump and his lackeys do  and she swung back with  oh  corey  do me a favor  before you go attacking me   oh  let me tell you something  let me play my little violin for you  ha as it s long been said  the moment you need to enter into personal attacks and not just attacks on policy  you have already lost  both trump and his lemmings  including lewandowski  are nothing but losers who resort to just insulting people because that s honestly all they have  sad watch some of the navarro takedowns here then the absolute destruction of trump apologist corey lewandowski here brava  that deserves a standing ovation  brilliant featured image via video screen capture
