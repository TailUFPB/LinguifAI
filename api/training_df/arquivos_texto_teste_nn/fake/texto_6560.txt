amnesty international recently put out a brilliant public service announcement in turkey  with the hope that they will show people how absurd it is to hate the lgbt community the video was filmed in a turkish aquarium shop over three days and features a  gay  turtle  the organization put eight hidden cameras in the shop and caught a whole lot of dumbf ckery  in the video  potential turtle buyers walked into the store and over to the tank where the turtles were held  they all seemed extremely eager to purchase one of the adorable reptiles  until the employee at the shop dropped a bomb  the turtle they were interested in was gay as soon as the man made the announcement  the customers all reacted with disgust and disbelief  one woman asked  is it contagious   another said the turtle can t be both gay and healthy  a few of them even got angry with the employee for mentioning homosexuality after all of the homophobes leave the store  the screen turns black and a message from amnesty international flashes across the screen  homophobia and transphobia has reached absurd levels in turkey  in last five years  it has caused hundreds of hate crimes and more than  hate murders  love is love  hate is a choice  turkey has been in the news many times over the last few years for this very reason  in   the middle eastern news agency al monitor reported about a rise in  honor killings  of homosexuals in the country and they told a story about an underage teenager who escaped his family s attempt to murder him  i was beaten by family members after they learned i was homosexual  after the beating  my father held a gun to my head  put a quran in my hands and told me to repent  i somehow managed to run away the following day  my family stormed the homes of my friends and battered them  too  i have nowhere to take refuge  my life is in danger   the teenager s story is heartbreaking  but he could still be considered lucky  for now   as many homosexuals in turkey perish at the hands of their own relatives in  honor killings  the video does an amazing job at pointing out how stupid homophobes are  these people were so blinded by their fear and hate that they could not think logically  and that is a common theme among the anti gay community  they never stop and consider that maybe their beliefs are misguided and based on bullshit  it is as absurd as it is terrifying watch https   www facebook com ndebzofficial videos vb    type  theaterfeatured image via video screenshot
