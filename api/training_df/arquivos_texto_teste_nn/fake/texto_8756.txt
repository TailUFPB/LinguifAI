for americans  religion permeates almost every aspect of our daily lives whether we want it to or not  the united states is so religious  in fact  that when  say  a university instructs its professors to hold inclusive holiday parties  rather than focus solely on christmas  many people believe christianity itself is under attack  it is therefore always surprising to see just how non religious other countries have become while america was busy having its pretend war on christmas a shocking new poll out of iceland demonstrates the degree to which young people are abandoning organized religion  the survey of icelanders found that while many older people      still identified as christian  those in their  or younger were astonishingly non religious  in fact  when asked whether they believed the story of a biblical creation  like the kind found in american  creation museums   a whopping    of those  or younger said they did  inversely     said they believed the universe was created during a big bang of those younger than     said the world had been created in the big bang and    believed god had created the world     of those between  and  years old believed the world had been created in the big bang and    believed god had created the world  in all but the oldest age category a majority accepted the big bang theory  only    of those older than  believed in the big bang  and nearly a fourth     believed god had created the world perhaps because of this growing lack of religion  the poll also found that a large proportion of icelanders of all ages expressed support for  the full separation of church and state  but before televangelist pat robertson goes dismissing the entire country as godless heathens  there is a bit of a caveat  as icelandic redditor avar points out  the implication that zero percent of young icelanders don t believe in god is a bit misleading  the poll doesn t go that far now  what many outside of iceland and i d say especially americans need to understand is that even christians in iceland and for that matter in most of europe don t literally believe in the origin story in the bible in anything but trivial numbers  maintaining the literal interpretation of that is very much an american evangelical thing  i bet if you polled priests in iceland and asked them whether they thought the big bang happened you d get a   response rate in the affirmative it s a fair point  in america  we often assume  religious  to mean  creationist  because so much of our religious discourse is consumed by conservative fundamentalists  waking up to the fact that other countries and other churches don t have to be bible literalists to still believe in god can be jarring for some  as part of a television show  an american religious conservative flew to scandinavia to learn about how those countries worship  when he discovered how secular people were  and how even the church embraced things like science and same sex marriage  his brain almost couldn t handle it meanwhile  back in america  the country remains an outlier in the western world  thanks to conservative lawmakers that work to undermine education and special interest groups that push religion into schools  american students still struggle to accept well supported scientific theories like evolution or the big bang  slowly  that appears to be changing  recently  the united states had a bittersweet moment when new polls found a majority of the american public  finally  accepted evolution over creationism  we still have a long way to go to reach iceland s numbers though feature image via wikimedia
