there was literally no chance that the religious right wasn t going to scream bloody murder over georgia governor nathan deal vetoing an anti lgbt bill  but they re taking it a little bit worse than i d expected the group texas values released an angry statement after georgia s governor  nathan deal  announced monday that he would veto so called  religious liberty  legislation  disney and other companies had threatened to boycott the state if the governor signed the bill into law  will disney now ban you from wearing a cross outside your shirt at their parks   texas values president jonathan saenz fumed   will a catholic priest be forced to remove his white collar when he takes a picture with mickey mouse  this is how extreme the attacks now are on religious freedom  it s a zero tolerance policy for religious freedom  because everyone knows that wearing symbols of your faith is exactly the same as openly discriminating against people you don t like  once again  religious conservatives are confusing religious freedom with the freedom to impose their religion on others i probably shouldn t be surprised that the veto is sending conservative christians into a blind rage  they were just told that sopping up to religious fanatics is less important to republicans than sopping up to big corporations  that must come as a shock to the religious right that s spent decades distorting christianity so conservatives would worship the rich and allow corporate america to do whatever it wants with  god s  blessing finding out that you re a useful idiot and that you ve been tossed aside has to sting a little but corporate america is concerned with profit and there is no profit in continuing to discriminate against the lgbt community  quite the opposite as pro lgbt boycotts are far more expensive than anti lgbt boycotts  that s kind of what happens when you re on the losing side of a culture war issue  you lose  and you keep losing until all of your wailing and gnashing of teeth is a buzzing in the background  it s the same buzzing that helps me sleep at night along with a tall  warm glass of conservative tears yum featured image via camelotinn anaheim com
