former secretary of defense robert gates is not a fan of donald trump  and he has no problem telling the american people that the billionaire would be a mistake  on sunday s episode of abc s this week  he did exactly that guest host martha raddatz asked gates what he thought about the speech the republican frontrunner gave on foreign policy earlier in the week and like former secretary of state madeleine albright  gates was not impressed  i think based on the speech you d have somebody who doesn t understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers  for example  he  on the one hand  says we need to be a more reliable ally to our friends  and then in the next breath he basically says we re going to rip up all those burden sharing agreements that we ve had over the decades with them and make them go their own way if they don t pay for everything  during trump s speech he did  in fact  contradict himself  he claimed he was going to take care of our allies  but then he said that many of them aren t paying their  fair share and if he were president he would make those countries  mostly in the middle east   defend themselves  gates also slammed trump for his inability to take advice  one of the things that worries me  martha  is that he doesn t appear to listen to people  he believes that he has all the answers  that he s the smartest man in the room  and i ve worked with some   for some very different presidents  jimmy carter and ronald reagan  george w  bush  barack obama  one of the things they all had in common was a willingness to listen to people who with   who had experience  and then make their own independent judgment  now  they ve gone in different directions but they never assumed they had all the answers  and that s one of the things that troubles me  he definitely does think he knows best and that is a huge problem when you think about how much power he would have as president  just look at his campaign  he continues to insult minorities and women even as other officials in his party tell him to knock it off  he continues to say that he will force other countries to pay for things  even though experts say that is not possible  what would happen if he were sitting in the white house and the secretary of defense told him that his plan to  bomb the hell out of isis  wasn t a good idea  would he ignore his military advisers  the answer is  probably when a person with as much experience as robert gates says trump is a bad idea  the republican party should take him seriously featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
