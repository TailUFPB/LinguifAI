sarah palin knows she s a political outcast  she s proud of it  she thinks because nobody cares what she thinks besides a handful of dense trump supporters who are at his rallies to listen rather than wait for the chance to beat someone up that she qualifies as some kind of revolutionary she actually qualifies as a has been as well as a never should have been  but i digress  there is nothing revolutionary about sarah palin  assuming that she ll be able to just walk into a secure facility without an invite because you can see russia from a remote island off the coast of alaska or because your ever so pure christian family are pros at losing custody battles  beating women and having children out of wedlock is a bit naive palin says she s going  however  and not even paul revere ringin  those bells and warning the british that they r uhhh not gonna take our guns will stop her  in an interview with the associated press  palin said she may have to invite herself   i can t see any of them inviting me   she said  adding that the leaders of the rnc are  afraid of what i might say  ya think  every time this woman opens her mouth yet another round of inane rambling comes out  she has no clue how to prepare for a successful public appearance  which is why she s had so few  she doesn t deserve a stage or a microphone  even if it the republican clown convention we re talking about palin also warned that the rnc had better not mess with trump  who she called  so reasonable  and  full of common sense   she says the people will rise up if they deny their candidate the nomination  how dare they   these arrogant  arrogant political operatives  under the wisdom of the people  we will rise up  and we will say our vote does count  our activism does count  and for those who would try to warp that  those are the ones who need to leave   we don t need to leave  looks like sarah palin is gonna jump onto the trump train as it crashes into cleveland  which will be nothing short of hilarious   especially if they tell her to beat it time will tell  i wonder if the grandkids will be helping her forge an invitation with construction paper and crayons featured image from aaron bernstein getty images
