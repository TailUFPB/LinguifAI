a young man recorded himself as he maliciously abused a young woman  apparently his girlfriend  he then uploaded the video to the internet  the man  who appears to be in his mid to late teens  seems to think that his horrific treatment of the girl in the video is either funny or cool the  second video shows the male seated behind the wheel of his car  the first thing he says is   i just don t want people to act up  the girl is standing outside the vehicle  her arms folded across her chest in a protective stance by the five second mark it becomes obvious that he has her trapped by the hair  which is rolled up in the window of the car at this point he explains  clearly amused with himself  that this is exactly what he has done  pull her hair through the window   he says   roll the window up  he then laughs as he begins to put the car into gear the young woman is clearly terrified  and begins to beat on the window of the car  the driver laughs harder  as she becomes more visibly frightened by his behavior  pleading with him to  stop  stop  he continues to laugh  saying something that sounds like it could be the girl s name   jenny   repeatedly watch the  second video below  via liveleak https   youtu be  video appears to have been uploaded anonymously  the young man who did this needs to be named and shamed  not only that  but the video needs to be turned over to police  so that they can arrest him on charges of domestic abuse in most states  if the police have sufficient evidence to believe that domestic abuse has occurred  they do not need the victim to cooperate or press charges  in order to arrest the perpetrator the young woman in this video may well be too afraid of what this abuser will do if she reports him domestic violence is defined as  a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation  often including the threat or use of violence  the actions of the perpetrator in this video are clearly designed to terrify this young girl  by his own admission  he s using terror tactics to control her behavior or keep her from  acting up  one in four u s  women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime  two out of every three female homicide victims are killed during an act of domestic violence the perpetrator and victim in this video happen to be black  but research shows that domestic violence impacts women from all walks of life  regardless of race  ethnicity  or economic circumstances while black women between the ages of  and  are more likely to experience domestic violence than white women  in all other age groups  black women and white women experience domestic violence at an equal rate  so before you even start to imply that the couple s race has something to do with it  don t  domestic violence is not an issue that is confined to any race while the couple in this video may appear to be young  women between the ages of  and  years are most likely to be victims of intimate partner abuse domestic violence is everyone s problem  between  and   domestic violence accounted for more than  percent of all violent crimes in the u s  it costs society   billion annually in law enforcement involvement  legal work  medical and mental health treatment  and lost productivity while the perpetrator in the above video is unidentified at this time  the internet has a way of finding people out what if the young lady in this video was your daughter  sister or friend our society needs to send a clear message that this kind of terror inducing behavior is not funny and it is certainly not cool  this is a sadistic crime  and the young man that committed it needs to be held accountable for his actions
