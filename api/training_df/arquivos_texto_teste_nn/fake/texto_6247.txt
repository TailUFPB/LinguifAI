debbie wasserman schultz hasn t exactly been kind to the bernie sanders campaign  as chairperson of the democratic national committee  wasserman schultz has a duty to see that the party s primaries are fair and just and that the candidates are treated equally  the sanders campaign has long complained that they have been treated anything but many of the rules the sanders campaign doesn t like aren t new and certainly shouldn t have come as a shock  such as the use of superdelegates and closed primaries in states like new york  but there have been other things the campaign harped on that were met with a brick wall  such as the debate issue  it was almost as if the dnc didn t want anyone to watch they were scheduled so poorly  at a time when people were tuning in to watch the republicans tear beach other to pieces in primetime  the democrats looked like they were almost hiding their candidates  scheduling debates on saturday nights during college and pro football s playoff season the campaign has little recourse  as they are bound by the rules of the dnc  but sanders on a personal level has dropped the bomb that he is supporting wasserman schultz s opponent  tim canova  in his primary run against her in florida s  congressional district  canova  a sanders supporter  is a much closer fit to the senator s platform than wasserman schultz  especially where dark money is concerned  she has repeatedly voted to keep that money flowing through the halls of corruption  where sanders and clinton both have called for it to end there was a time when an endorsement from bernie sanders may not have seemed like that big a deal  those days are over  sanders has amazing influence with young people  and if enough in the miami dade area come out to vote for the guy sanders supports  wasserman schultz could very well be out of a job  asked about sanders  endorsement of her opponent  she said  i am so proud to serve the people of florida s  district and i am confident that they know that i am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in congress  even though senator sanders has endorsed my opponent  i remain  as i have been from the beginning  neutral in the presidential democratic primary  i look forward to working together with him for democratic victories in the fall the congresswoman will have to a little bit better of a job convincing people she s neutral  actions speak louder than words featured image by andrew burton getty images
