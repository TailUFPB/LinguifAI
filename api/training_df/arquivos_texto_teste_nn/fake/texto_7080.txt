donald trump has caused plenty of heartache for americans  especially those of muslim and mexican descent  as a result of his racist and vile rhetoric  he s left the world wondering how he s the gop fronerunner for the nomination to run in the general election for president of the united states  fortunately for americans and the rest of the world  we are slowly but surely watching the unhinging of donald trump  his recent remarks about women are just one in a series of trump crazy talk sessions that have left his campaign losing serious momentum  however  trump has a way with words and he always blames someone else for his misfortunes  this time  it came in the form of a temper tantrum with a reporter here s the video   msnbc s chris jansing asked trump if there would be any changes in his campaign staff in what was most likely a reference to a new york magazine article that reported infighting among his staff members   no  it s just the media again  i get the most unfair media  this is the first time i ve been asked this question  nobody has called me about this  we are number one in every category   said trump jansing then asked if trump was concerned that his staff didn t know that wisconsin conservative radio host charlie sykes was against his candidacy  which set him up for a brutal interview last week  believing that he won the debate with sykes  trump said   you go into the enemy camp sometimes  he is not a very smart guy  not a very bright guy  sometimes you go into unfriendly territory  that s part of the game  here is the transcript from the rest of the interview jansing   is wisconsin unfriendly territory  trump   no  you said about a radio talk show host  jansing   so you re just talking about the radio host  trump   that s what i mean about the dishonest media  jansing   i m asking you a question  allowing you to answer it  trump   excuse me  excuse me  excuse me  you re asking me about a show host and i said he was unfriendly territory  then you say is that wisconsin  it s so dishonest  no  no  that s called you know what s that s called  dishonest media  dishonest reporting  i think i m going to do great  watching trump get frustrated is reminiscent of how he s been frustrating most of america the last few months  featured image via screencapture
