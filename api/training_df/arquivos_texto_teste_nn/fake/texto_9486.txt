silly  silly donna brazile  she s publishing a book detailing turmoil in the democratic party during the  campaign  highlighted by her concern that hillary clinton was seriously ill and might need to be replaced by joe biden or bernie sanders was the democrat party setting up joe biden to replace hillary when she accompanied him to his hometown in scranton  pa  the media completely ignored hillary s inability to walk or stand unassisted in front of  and inside joe s childhood home  that was all caught on this incredible  but mostly hidden video  in the video below  hillary can be seen using the arm of the homeowner for support while reaching for the railing next to the stairs to stabilize herself  she can be seen repeatedly grasping for the railing outside  and then later on  when hillary s inside the home  she seems unable to stand on her own  as she grasps for the backs of chairs and the kitchen table watch earlier in the day  vice president joe biden was forced to help the seriously ill democrat presidential candidate hillary clinton down from the podium where she spoke at a small rally what s the big deal  there s no news here because all this was well known and covered at the time by the big national newspapers and networks  right wrong  if brazile were rehashing things we knew  there would be no book and no bombshell headlines now instead  she has thrown open a new and very big window on    and exposed yet again the consequences of the political biases of the democratic media the missed stories are not merely the result of mistakes or sloppy reporting  brazile s book is a revelation in that it shows that many left leaning journalists didn t so much cover clinton as cover up for her put it this way  how is it possible that the leader of the democratic party was talking to colleagues about trying to replace its nominee during the general election because of health concerns  and none of the thousands of journalists covering the campaign got wind of it it s not possible   if the media had been playing it down the middle and holding both candidates to the same standard of scrutiny  but big media missed a big story because so much campaign  news  coverage was tilted toward defeating donald trump and electing clinton anything that could possibly suggest trump was unfit for the oval office   bingo  front page  top of the broadcast on the other hand  anything that could hurt clinton was downplayed or ignored  nothing to see here  move along the coverage of clinton s health was a prime example of the tilt  her coughing fits  especially a long one on labor day  and a history of falling were pointed out by the popular drudge report  some republicans and smaller  conservative leaning sites to suggest she was not being honest about her health but her campaign always denied anything was wrong   allergies  the candidate  and her flacks insisted  caused the persistent coughs  and major news organizations mostly nodded their heads and stayed mum  accepting the official denials without skepticism the dam cracked a bit on labor day  when an nbc reporter filed a  word  four paragraph story that said clinton had been unable to finish her speech in ohio because of a coughing fit the truth was dangerous  so the praetorian guard sprang to clinton s defense  the nbc reporter  andrew rafferty  was mocked and insulted  first by the campaign  and then by journalists  including some msnbc commentators who turned on their colleague as if he had violated a secret oath cnn joined the clinton amen chorus  and at the washington post  political writer chris cillizza denounced the topic of clinton s health as  a totally ridiculous issue  and declared it a  sure fire loser  for trump  it s hard to plausibly insist  based on the available data  that clinton is ill   insisted cillizza  who is now at cnn five days later  clinton was unable to walk on her own and collapsed at the   ceremony in manhattan as she tried to get into a van  the campaign insisted she was just  dehydrated  until a short video of the incident aired  then admitted the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier in other words  the claim of allergies was a big fat lie  that prompted brazile to contemplate starting the process of replacing clinton  writing in her book that the campaign also was  anemic  and had  the odor of failure   she says she considered numerous tickets to replace clinton and sen  tim kane  and decided that biden and sen  cory booker  d nj  would be the best it s not clear how long she deliberated or how many people she talked to  but brazile writes that biden called her on sept    in the end  she says  she made no move because she couldn t disappoint clinton s supporters for entire story  nyp
