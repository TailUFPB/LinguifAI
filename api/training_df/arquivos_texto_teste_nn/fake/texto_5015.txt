mikhail baryshnikov is one of the greatest ballet dancers of all time  hailing from the soviet union  he was born during the cold war and knows exactly what soviet russia was like   and continues to be like today   under vladamir putin baryshnikov was already a world reknowned ballet dancer when he chose to escape the communist hellscape to live in america  where he continues to proudly live today he has never endorsed a political candidate beyond doing his civic duty by exercising his right to vote  but this election is different in donald trump  baryshnikov sees a man who is too close to russia and putin  he sees a man who would make america closely resemble the old soviet union where freedom of speech is stymied and tyranny rules  he sees a man who would close america off to the rest of the world and a man who would stamp out any opposition against him under his boot heel and that s why baryshnikov has chosen to endorse hillary clinton for president in a video he released on wednesday along with a written statement  while watching the presidential election unfold  and hearing donald trump s flirtations with the kremlin  i feel compelled to add my voice to the mix   specifically regarding immigration   something i am obviously familiar with  i have never publicly endorsed a political candidate before  or inserted myself into politics in any way other than by voting  but this video is a direct call to action  we must elect hillary clinton as president in november  forty two years ago i left a country that built walls to come to a place without them   baryshnikov said in the video   but today  as a citizen of the united states  for the first time  i m hearing rhetoric that reminds me of the soviet union of my youth  where it was a crime  and continues to be  a crime to be different  baryshnikov referred to trump as a  dangerous totalitarian opportunist  and went on to voice his support for the democratic nominee who opposes him  the america i love welcomes people of all nations  all religions  and supports all forms of human expression  america welcomed me  an immigrant  and that welcome has made my life possible  i trust her to lead us in the right direction  to protect the rights of all citizens  and to provide sane  steady leadership in a complex world  here s the video via youtube donald trump is a wannabe dictator who hates facts and thinks he can do whatever he wants and say whatever he wants  he wants to oppress people based on their race and their religion and their sexual orientation  he treats women like objects and uses fear and hate to advance his agenda  this sounds frighteningly a lot like something you would find in the soviet union  but while trump fits in with russia  his political agenda runs counter to american values if elected president  trump would destroy those values and he would be putin s puppet  and then conservative fears of fema camps would come true  except that in russia they call them gulags featured image via screen capture
