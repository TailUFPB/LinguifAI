fox news host tucker carlson is so desperate to defend assault weapons that he accidentally made the case for why they should banned during the sunday morning edition of fox amd friends  carlson argued that it s useless to ban assault weapons because terrorists will just go out and use crock pots to kill people instead  this is an attempt to control and disarm the population  and they re using terror as a pretext to do it  and they should just admit that   carlson said the call to once again ban assault weapons has been strong ever since the mass shooting in orlando that killed  people and wounded another   isis sympathizer omar mateen was able to buy his assault weapon because republicans in congress refuse to ban suspected terrorists from purchasing and owning guns even fox news hosts bill o reilly and gretchen carlson have declared their support for banning assault weapons during their own programs on the conservative network anna kooiman explained that supporters of an assault weapons ban reason that a person will do less damage if they are only able to carry a knife or something much less deadly than an ar   which is a weapon of war and not something that was designed for civilian use but carlson claimed that crock pots should also be banned because terrorists used them to kill people  too  well  a crock pot caused those killings at the boston marathon  i think we need to regulate those or ban them  there s no reason you should be able to buy a crock pot at walmart ever again  and that s not only wrong  it s a false equivalency as raw story points out  the boston marathon bombers used a pressure cooker  not a crock pot  as their weapon of choice  and they were only able to kill three people with it  the orlando shooter  on the other hand  used an assault weapon and ended the lives of  people  if carlson really wants to compare a kitchen utensil to a gun  he should start looking for a better argument because if mateen had been using a crock pot or a pressure cooker there would be more people alive today here s the video via youtube featured image via screen capture
