not long ago  the hacker collective known as anonymous declared war against michigan s republican governor rick snyder in a new campaign called  opflint  the declaration came  as they always do  in the form of a slick youtube video  where they called for snyder s arrest  less than  hours after anonymous released the video  a major cyber attack has been confirmed in flint anonymous did not make any specific details on what action s  they will take in order to help the people of flint  they say in the video  that  we must remind the city officials of flint we do not forget and we do not forgive   the spokesperson in the video says   the crimes committed by gov  snyder as well as other city officials will not go unpunished  the next day a cyber attack rocked the hurley medical center  that s the hospital where dr  mona hanna attisha first noticed there were elevated levels of lead in children s blood in flint here s the video  hurley medical center has it systems in place  which aid in detecting a virus or cyber attack   hospital spokeswoman ilene cantor said   as such  all policies and protocols were followed in relation to the most recent cyber attack on our system  patient care was not compromised and we are closely monitoring all systems to ensure it security is consistently maintained  it hasn t been confirmed that the cyber attack is connected to anonymous  however  it would be a pretty big coincidence for anonymous to make this threat  and then for a completely random hack to occur  i think it is pretty safe to assume that if it was anonymous who did hack the hurley medical center  it was in an effort to get info on the situation  not to actually harm the hospital  or at the very least  to let the snyder administration know that they mean business speaking of snyder  he should be very concerned about the potential threat of a massive data breach  in his state of the state address on tuesday  snyder promised he would release all of his e mails in a show of transparency  that promise just turned out to be another slap to well  at this point  the entire nation  who is watching him like a hawk  here is an example of what  transparency  means to snyder that s not the kind of bullsh t you want to be pulling with a hacker group breathing down your neck  with all things anonymous  it is important to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism  that being said  it will be interesting to see if they escalate their fight with snyder and the rest of his cronies in the near future  especially since his administration has landed michigan s government the honor of being ranked worst in transparency featured image credit  video screenshot via youtube
