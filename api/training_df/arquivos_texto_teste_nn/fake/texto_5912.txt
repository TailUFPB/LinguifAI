conservatives are already praising god for the murder of  or more people at an lgbt night club in orlando  florida on saturday night  a gunman walked into the club with an assault rifle and began shooting people  so far  at least  are confirmed dead but police say the death toll could be as high as  but it didn t take long for republicans to merely offer  thoughts and prayers  instead of vowing to take actions that would make their nra masters very angry some republicans  however  have absolutely no compassion for those who were slaughtered because they are anti gay bigots who believe the victims got what they deserved the following morning after the terrorist attack took place  texas lt  governor dan patrick posted a vile bible verse on twitter citing galatians   which reads   do not be deceived  god cannot be mocked  a man reaps what he sows  here s an image of the tweet via the houston chronicle in other words  patrick thinks that the people shot and killed at pulse orlando had it coming because they were at a gay night club  according to conservative  christians  like patrick  being gay is a sin against god punishable by death twitter users immediately blasted patrick for his lack of compassion   have you no shame   one user wrote texas democratic party chair gilberto hinojosa also condemned the tweet  hate and violence have no place in america   he said   unfortunately  texans in mourning for our families in florida woke up to an embarrassment from their lieutenant governor  lt gov dan patrick  please apologize immediately  make this right  we are better than this  but patrick has not apologized nor has he expressed condolences to the families of those who were killed  he merely deleted the post make no mistake  many conservatives are cheering this act of terrorism today and they should be ashamed of themselves for it featured image  youtube
