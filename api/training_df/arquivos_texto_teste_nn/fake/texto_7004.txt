bill o reilly has a segment of his show in which he sends professional insufferable prick jesse watters out to harass people for the amusement of o reilly s aging  senile audience  the very cleverly named  watters  world  is not supposed to illuminate the viewer so much as make them feel better about hating the people being harassed  this week  watters and his punch me face took on the students of princeton university and it didn t go well in one of the most bizarre segments on fox news you ll ever see  bill o reilly sent his interviewer to princeton to say the word  ghetto  to black students   and it went pretty much as you d expect jesse watters  who often interviews people on the street for the o reilly factor  visited the school s campus and asked students of different races if they were offended by various loaded words and phrases  such as  ghetto    black crime    slum    islamic terrorism   and  white privilege  now  i m not exactly a fan of college pc culture but there s a difference between someone crying about  cultural appropriation   get over it  if it s cool  other people are going to want to try it  and being offended by the word  ghetto  with its obvious and well known racial overtones  that being said  i was delighted to see just how badly watters  the human weasel hybrid  failed to  expose  pc culture run amok not only did expert douchebag watters not find anyone that fit the stereotype he was looking for  the ones he tried to shoehorn in had to be obviously edited to seem irrational  and even then  they really didn t  one black student responded quite reasonably to being asked about people using the word  ghetto  by saying  i feel like they should be more careful in their choice of words   and another simply walked away from an obvious trap  other students either refused to take the bait or gave a measured and intelligent response  it s that kind of elitism  classism  that kind of snobbery  is counterproductive  it dehumanizes people  the whole segment flopped horribly  paid stalker watters told one student   you re a woman and you re white  that s how you got into princeton  and he used a bad edit to make it seem like she responded by saying  and i m actually kind of upset about that   that s how hard he had to try to make the segment work  even o reilly admitted that  they didn t seem as crazy as some of these other college kids  when it was done it s doubtful that o reilly s viewers will see it that way as they yell at the tv for those damn kids to get off their lawn but for everyone outside of the fox news bubble  this was just embarrassing for watters and his obnoxious bullying here s the cringe inducing video  featured image via screen cap
