across the nation  mainly the south  there have been a number of  religious freedom  laws popping up  now   religious freedom  is actually code for  freedom to discriminate against gay people  as it once was  freedom to discriminate against black people  not too long ago the state of mississippi just passed one of the most discriminatory bills yet  but titled it  religious liberty accommodations act   which  is pretty accurate considering the state is trying to accommodate religious bigots and their discrimination  the bill hb  has yet to be signed by republican gov  phil bryant  but knowing his  religious liberty  history  he ll undoubtedly put pen to paper now  the bill itself is pretty damn blunt in its hatred towards the lgbt community  it states  the mississippi legislature finds the following  a  leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between same sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be addressed through legislation  b  after the legalization of same sex marriage  religious adoption and foster care agencies in massachusetts  illinois and the district of columbia were forced to close because of their sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage etc  etc  first of all  who are these asshole  legal scholars  who clearly got their degree at liberty  university  or somewhere similar what is pretty damn interesting is the fact that the bill doesn t only attack the rights of the lgbt community  it also goes after heterosexual couples who aren t married yet  it stipulates that sex should only be between a man and a woman after marriage  the sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions protected by this act are the belief or conviction that  a  marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman  b  sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage  and c  male  man  or female  woman  refer to an individual s immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth  yikes  there goes any and all premarital sex  i wonder how heterosexual people will feel with government entering into their bedrooms  so much for being anti big government  this pretty much takes the cake on an infringement of personal rights all across the board  not only does is purposefully discriminate against the lgbt community by taking away equal access  it also infringes upon the freedom of straight people to have sex before marriage last time i checked  the bible isn t the constitution  but hey    religious freedom  amiright  featured photo by m  mckeown express getty images
