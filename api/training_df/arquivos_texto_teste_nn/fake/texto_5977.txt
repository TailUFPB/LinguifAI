in   when old  white men turned on anita hill  a monster was awakened  and that monster was the fury of the woman  in the  election  women let the old boy s club know exactly how it felt   they elected a democrat for president  and they made unprecedented gains in the house and he senate  the  election was called the year of the woman  and it was all thanks to one woman   hill   who stood up to the good old boys and now that the  democratic primary is almost over  with hillary clinton reaching the threshold to claim victory  women will come out of the woodwork  at an even faster pace  and enact real change vox contends that should clinton win the presidency  just her mere presence in the white house will be enough to spur a growth of women running for office clinton s gender is the most obvious way she stands out from everyone who s held the presidency before  but people inside and outside the campaign have hesitated to argue explicitly that it matters  but it does matter  enormously  a woman president would be   by far   the biggest  most salient  and most important example of a successful woman in american politics likely inspiring secondary and tertiary waves of women s election runs and election victories using analysis from political consultant amelia showalter  vox shows that when women are even mentioned as potentially running for office  female involvement in the whole process increases by a percentage point  when a woman is elected as a state attorney general  participation increases to two percent  when elected governor  it increases to   percent  when elected senator  it increases to   percent should clinton be elected president of the united states  with the sort of name recognition she has  the amount of female participation in the process  elected and unelected  would increase astronomically  and that measure doesn t include the throngs of women clinton will choose to fill her cabinet analysis also shows that when women have representation  such as the presidency  and their identity politics   abortion  equal pay  childcare   are adequately represented by women  they will cause a ripple effect that will essentially bring male legislators onto their side  as tali mendelberg  christopher karpowitz  and nicholas goedert show when women are many  they are more likely to voice women s distinctive concerns about children  family  the poor and the needy  what s more  when women are more numerous and therefore more vocal on these topics  men become more vocal too  and these effects are associated with more generosity to the poor women  in a sense  could liberalize the country by being elected to office  how do they get elected to office  they are inspired to run  and how are they inspired to run  they see other women  like hillary clinton  achieve high office it s a ripple effect that will usher in the much needed change in washington  after all  it s been proven that women in congress  when they are in charge  get more done in a more bipartisan fashion hillary clinton is going to help continue that featured image via kevin winter
