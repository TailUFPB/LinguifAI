almost a decade after targeting the black community with subprime loans and economic ruin  the big banks are still punishing black homeowners because racism is totally dead in america according to a new washington post analysis  the higher a zip code s share of black residents in the atlanta region  the worse its housing values have fared over the past turbulent housing cycle nationwide  home values in predominantly african american neighborhoods have been the least likely to recover  across the  largest u s  metropolitan areas  homes in  out of  zip codes where blacks are the largest population group are worth less than they were in   that s twice the rate for mostly white zip codes across the country  across metropolitan atlanta  nearly  in  largely black zip codes still have home values below that point  years ago if you ll recall  subprime loans were supposed to be mortgages given to high risk borrowers so they could take a stab at the american dream of owning a home  but then the financial sector figured out how to make a ton of money by pushing crap loans onto an unsuspecting public  naturally  they targeted minorities because  again  racism is dead in america even well off african americans  like the ones in some south dekalb subdivisions  were more likely to be given subprime loans when they should have qualified for better ones  nationwide  black families earning around    a year  according to research by sociologist jacob fa ber  were more likely at the height of the bubble in  to be given a subprime loan than white families making about     the problem  faber argued  wasn t that professional blacks didn t understand that they qualified for better loans  they were targeted for bad loans  subprime lenders viewed them  faber argued  as particularly profitable targets this is not the first time banks have targeted the black community  redlining was the practice banks employed to keep  those people  out of white neighborhoods  they literally drew a red line on the map to signify which areas blacks were allowed to buy homes in and which areas were off limits  the subprime debacle was less overt but no less racist  but even now  the banks are not done screwing over black homeowners in atlanta and its suburbs  along with dozens of other cities  the national fair housing alliance has also documented that banks have done a poorer job maintaining foreclosed properties in largely minority communities than in white ones properties that fall into disrepair are known as  blight  and drag down property values  and through the wonders and magic of systemic racism  it just  happens  to occur more often in black neighborhoods  but remember  racism is dead in america so it must be the fault of black communities this ongoing assault on african american homeowners is a direct result of white supremacy in this country  it doesn t matter if it s a deliberate act or just implicit racism  the result is the same   the banks are hurting wealthy black communities because they know the system is rigged heavily against them  when white people complain  something gets done  when black people complain  they re just whining and then we wonder however in the world did white people accumulate so much more wealth than black people and pretend it s because we re inherently superior amerikkka featured image via getty
