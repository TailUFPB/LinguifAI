rather than placing the blame for the terrorist attacks in brussels with the terrorists where it belongs  fox news focused on blaming something totally unrelated instead on multiple occasions during their coverage of the bombings that took the lives of over  people in brussels on tuesday morning  fox news hosts and contributors all made sure to blame political correctness for the attacks  even though acting like a decent human being had nothing to do with the evil acts committed by a group of extremists in a video compilation put together by mediaite  several fox hosts and contributors are shown citing political correctness as the cause of the attacks and urging americans to disregard any consideration of the feelings of people who are discriminated against  as long as political correctness and fear of being called a bigot dominate we can t have the conversation   said one fox contributor at the beginning of the video  another alluded to donald trump and how he is leading the republican primary because he isn t politically correct  because that s somehow something to be proud of yet another fox talking head called for dropping political correctness because that the only way to  protect the homeland   there was even a suggestion that the only way to fix the threat of terrorism in our world is end political correctness  one fox nut even claimed that political correctness is  literally killing us in this country   laura ingraham even repeated that being pc can kill  fox also complained about how they are hit with charges of islamophobia whenever they cover isis and terrorist attacks here s the video via youtube but the problem is not that fox is covering isis and terrorist attacks  it s that they usually always attack all muslims as if the entire muslim population is guilty of the attacks committed by a few religious extremists who do not represent the muslim world  just like the kkk doesn t represent all christians here in america being politically correct does not cause terrorist attacks  hate and intolerance does and you won t hear fox news talk about that at all  they d rather waste their time whining about how they can t be hateful and intolerant of muslims without being called out for being the racists they are it s important that we treat innocent muslims with respect and dignity during this tragic time  discriminating against them also makes things worse and gives isis new potential recruits to target for a  news  outlet that constantly claims to be aligned with christianity  fox news sure does like war  hate  and bigotry when what we need right now is love and unity also  how much more despicable can fox news get using yet another terrible deadly act of violence to push their own political agenda instead of simply reporting the news and showing sympathy to the dead featured image via screen capture
