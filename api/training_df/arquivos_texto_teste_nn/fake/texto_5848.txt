if you re dissatisfied with debbie wasserman schultz as the head of the dnc  hillary clinton has some good news for you  while one cannot simply remove the dnc chairwoman from her position  and while she will retain her title  wasserman schultz has been stripped of most of her power  cnn reports hillary clinton s campaign is taking the reins of the democratic national committee  installing a new top official on thursday to oversee the party s day to day operations through the general election brandon davis  national political director for the service employees international union  will become the general election chief of staff for the democratic party  his selection formalizes the coordination of the clinton campaign and the committee  a stark contrast to donald trump who is currently at odds with his party now  this sort of thing is rather common   but it is expected to alleviate some of democrats  concerns about wasserman schultz s rather lackluster leadership abilities  this is in fact what happens   former democratic party chairman  howard dean  told cnn   debbie will still have the title  but somebody else will be the effective operator of the dnc  it s hillary s pick   and  of course  hillary could have picked anyone she wanted  including wasserman schultz   but  of course  she didn t  perhaps realizing that the chairwoman is not the right fit for this or many other jobs  we basically just turned it over to him and i left the building to him  he ran the dnc   dean said  explaining how he transitioned to simply raising money for barack obama after his campaign took over the party   it was very clear i wasn t going to be running the dnc as soon as there was a nominee  it has long been suspected that dws was working in cahoots with the clinton campaign  while it is true that the democratic nominee has benefited from the party leader s numerous blunders   including a terrible debate schedule that kept the party out of the public eye   it seems that it was just incompetence that appeared to be assistance  or  if debbie was providing assistance in hopes of a reward  clinton did not return the favor  in any case  the democratic party is stronger with debbie wasserman schultz sidelined this decision comes on the heels of a meeting between clitnon and bernie sanders  who has long called for new leadership in the dnc  sen  sanders and secretary clinton met in washington on tuesday evening and had a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that donald trump poses to our nation   said michael briggs  sanders  spokesman  in a statement following the meeting   sanders congratulated secretary clinton on the campaign she has run and said he appreciated her strong commitment to stopping trump in the general election  it is unknown how or if sanders influenced clinton s decision to strip wasserman schultz of power  we have a lot of work to do over the next five months to make sure that donald trump does not become president   clinton campaign manager  robby mook  said while introducing davis to the party s staff   with so much at stake in this election  we could not ask for a better partner in that mission than the team here  now  we just need an election to make this  firing  permanent featured image via getty images andrew burton
