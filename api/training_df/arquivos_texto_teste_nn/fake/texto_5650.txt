many new minimum wage increases took effect on friday  and fox was quick to lose their sh t over it fox business host stuart varney discovered that   minimum wage laws go into effect today in  cities across five states  and proceeded to wax nostalgic along with his panel of guests about the days when there were no minimum wage laws or child labor laws in this country panelist tammy bruce warned that it will a cause  a march towards robotics  as if robots taking over a jobs is something that s never happened before   you re going to have kiosks that are going to be able to sell things to people   she continued  this we ve learned from seattle  and some other cities that have already implemented it  that jobs are lost  that this  it s   the burden is put on the back of other struggling people  you will fire individuals in order to maintain that the salary requirement of the others that you have there  and others  of course  are putting   fast food places are putting in robotics  and kiosks  so you can order your own food  this is what s going to happen  in fact  the seattle minimum wage increase has not caused the sky to fall as bruce and her fox colleagues have been claiming since it was first passed  many workers are bringing home more money to pay bills and take care of their families  prices for products have not shot up as conservatives warned and it s still too early to tell if the wage increase is slowing job growth varney then turned to wwe has been john layfield  who makes a living being a loudmouth on television  layfield spoke from the nation of bermuda  and giddily explained that bermuda does not have a minimum wage and that children work for tips layfield  there actually isn t a minimum wage here  right now  you see some of these young kids   i run a program for at risk kids   down  sacking groceries  about age   and they work off tips  so there isn t actually a minimum wage here bruce  that s how it used to be layfield  and it actually works fine  the problem i have with this   minimum wage is why   because it looks good on a bumper sticker  you re not talking about fixing anything  tie it to inflation  or a basket of wages  so you take it out of politics and union hands  that s all it is except that it s really not working fine  as it turns out  there is a significant income gap in bermuda and poverty affects many locals because unskilled workers from overseas are willing to work for very little which means great wealth for those who don t have to pay their workers very much because there is no minimum wage law  and children are forced to help out by working for nothing more than the hope of a decent tip but varney continnued to whine about the wage increases here in the states because people in poverty will now be able to bring in    a year  panelist elizabeth mcdonald complained because she thinks anyone in an  entry level job  should be in poverty  even if they have a family to support  she even claimed that college tuition will go up because young workers are making more varney    an hour  for a forty hour week  is    a year  i mean  what  elizabeth macdonald  it s supposed to be an entry level job  it s not supposed to be a career  and  by the way  awol in this debate   when you have things in the  administration like raising overtime pay depending on the skill set  and minimum wages  watch out college tuition goes up varney  that s right  because of all those people who work minimum wage in the colleges  you ve got that right of course  college prices were going up long before the minimum wage increase came into being  but don t tell that to fox business  the truth will hurt their feelings  if they have any here s the video via media matters the bottom line is that increasing the minimum wage is not only fair it helps the economy in general every year  corporate fat cats receive salary increases of millions of dollars while the workers who make the business successful see their wages stagnate  this forces many workers to apply for federal aid to make ends meet  raising the wage helps workers take care of their families and makes it unnecessary for a lot of them to apply for aid  it also helps boost the local economy because workers will use their increased earnings to buy goods  thus pumping more dollars into area businesses that will use those extra profits to pay their own workers a higher wage and hire extra workers if there is more demand in other words  fox hosts are fearmongering again and if they had their way  americans would work for pennies and children would work for even less featured image via screen capture
