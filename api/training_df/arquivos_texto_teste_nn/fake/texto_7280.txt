the game plan for republicans isn t exactly difficult to figure out  they control their uninformed base through fear  if you re a republican  it s because you re afraid  afraid someone will take your paycheck and give it to someone who chooses not to work  afraid that the economy is about to crash because  teenagers  working for minimum wage might get a raise  afraid that isis lives in your neighborhood  that the obama administration put them there and any minute now they ll be pounding on your door to take away your guns the fear is  quite simply  ridiculous  terrorists rule through fear  they use it to control people  is it really any wonder that when some right winger goes nutty and starts shooting people indiscriminately that we call them terrorists  they are born of the party of fear the latest sleazy tactic of republicans comes from their fundraising committee  rather than send out the kinds of mailers that you may see from the dnc that tell a story and ask for a donation  the rnc is sending out a fundraiser that looks like a bill  obviously aimed at swindling the elderly and uninformed  the mailer comes in an envelope with a giant red  notice of delinquency  on the front  inside  the chairman of the rnc himself notifies the addressee that they have  funds  past due and if they know what s good for them they ll pay it s a tactic that may be legal  that doesn t make it any less despicable  for reince priebus to allow his name to be printed on the bottom of this trash right along with hiss signature proves that the gop cares only about the money  rachel maddow does a great job of exposing this travesty  which was sent to her watchdog site  sendittorachel com  by a concerned citizen  watch her tear this scam to pieces below featured image via screen capture
