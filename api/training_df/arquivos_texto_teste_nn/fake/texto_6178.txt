maine s governor paul lepage is a tea party idiot who refused medicaid expansion under obamacare  and all the federal funding that comes with it  the medicaid expansion part of obamacare was designed to help people obtain coverage who earned too little to qualify for insurance on the exchanges  but too much to qualify for medicaid  lepage screwed over tens of thousands of maine residents with his decision  and one woman was not going to let him get away with it if she could help it the woman  who was identified as laura  falls into that gap between qualifying for obamacare and qualifying for medicaid  she called in while lepage was being interviewed on maine public radio specifically to blast him on behalf of the   maine residents who are still without health insurance because of him  i m actually one of the people affected by the health care issue in maine  so lepage is wrong in saying that people aren t affected or that wouldn t get the insurance  i would get the insurance if we accepted that money federally  lepage has been perpetuating the lies that no coverage gap actually exists  and that maine wouldn t qualify for federal funds anyway because their medicaid program accepts people with incomes of up to  percent of the federal poverty line  so  of course  he insulted laura by asking her why she doesn t qualify for medicaid  her response was  i make too little money to be on obamacare  it s expected that if you go to obamacare that you re going to make a certain amount of money so you can afford the premiums  but if you make    a year to that  lepage replied that she does qualify for medicaid  and she retorted  you don t get medicaid unless you re pregnant  disabled or over   this woman is a social worker  so her job includes helping people get access to certain things  including medicaid  therefore  she would know this stuff far better than the oppose obama at all costs tea partier that s in the governor s mansion there  the fact that she herself makes too much money to qualify for medicaid  but too little for obamacare  was the final nail in the coffin of that conversation here s why  lepage s office was hilariously forced to release a statement later in the day admitting that the governor was wrong about the qualifications for medicaid and the expansion  the state  because of its law  would not qualify for the full  percent of federal reimbursement for the first three years  and then the  percent every year after that for people between  percent and  percent of the federal poverty line  it qualifies for  percent reimbursement there however  for the   maine residents who currently fall into the coverage gap  maine would qualify for the full federal reimbursement  so laura triumphantly destroyed lepage s own talking points on the air  forcing his office to clarify things for listeners later on how embarrassing  we re laughing so hard it hurts featured image by mattgagnon  licensed under public domain via commons
