elizabeth warren may not be in the spotlight as often as she used to be  but we assure you she s still there  fighting away  anytime she sees something that doesn t quite look right  you can bet she s the last person in a room afraid to speak up about   especially when big banks are involved on friday  senator warren was reading a story like the rest of us mere earthlings  and was so outraged by it that she took to her facebook page for a viral call out  her target  jeb bush  his super pac  and former aig chairman hank greenberg the billionaire republican donor just gave   million to the right to rise group to keep jeb from falling out of the race  it s basically keeping him alive to duel it out just before the nation s first primaries begin  but   that s not the reason for her dissatisfaction  it turns out  warren still has a bitter taste in her mouth stemming from the economic collapse of   which saw his company receive a  huge bailout from the bush administration  after doing a disservice to the american people  she doesn t forget these things it seems her full post is featured below  but this part of it is the most headline worthy  without a doubt  i m not sure what s more disgusting  that jeb bush is pinning his presidential hopes on his brother s bailout money  or that bailed out ceos are trying to buy elections  pic via facebook the wall street journal first reported the contribution on thursday  although he refused to talk about it in an interview with them  we wonder why  you feel strongly enough about the man to give him   million  but don t want to talk about it  strange senator rand paul also saw the irony in it  as well  he tweeted out almost a full day before senator warren how odd it was for bush to be accepting money to  bail out his campaign   especially when that money came from  his brother s bailout money  pic via twitter why does anyone seem surprised  this is just politics as usual  you scratch my back  i ll scratch yours  it s worked this way forever  heck  it s even legal  bush used to work as an  advisor  getting paid millions from investment banks just shortly after he left the governor s office in   it s not like he s expected to do any special favors for all these generous contributions he s receiving from these big banks  people need to lighten up   if you didn t catch the sarcasm in that last part  we promise to do a better job next time featured image via screen capture
