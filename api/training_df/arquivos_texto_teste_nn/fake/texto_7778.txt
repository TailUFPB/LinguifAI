on friday  former president bill clinton encountered a rude protester during a campaign event in bluffton  south carolina and proved that he was not to be messed with the protester  who claimed to be a marine veteran  confronted bill about his wife s involvement in the  attack in benghazi  libya and was met with deafening  boos  from the  person crowd  still  bill heard the army vet out  but unfortunately did not get the same respect when he tried to give him an answer  bill said  you listen to me  as i ve heard you  i m not your commander in chief anymore  but if i were  i d tell you to be more polite  bill tried to be cordial  but as the unconfirmed vet repeatedly demanded to know if hillary had lied about the four american lives that were lost during the attack  clinton lost his patience and said  if you shut up and listen to my answer  i ll answer it  his mind has been poisoned by lies  and he won t listen  even as the marine was being escorted out of the audience by security  he continued to shout at bill clinton  which encouraged another audience member to harass bill in his place  the second protester shouted over the crowd s  boos   she lied to those families  so all of those families are liars  then the crowd came to bill s defense  telling the protester  you re watching too many movies  as she was also escorted out of the event  throughout the entire incident  the former president maintained his composure and remained calm while these two idiots tried to call his wife out and pathetically fail after the protesters were gone  bill defended hillary and revealed that she lost many  personal friends  in the attack  he said  you can imagine how she feels when people make these charges  it s amazing that right wingers just can t let benghazi go  there was nothing to be lied about or covered up  but so many conservatives will do anything to keep smearing hillary s name because she s such a big threat to them you can watch the event footage below  featured image via screenshots
