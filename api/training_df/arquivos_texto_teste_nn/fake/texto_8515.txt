a blizzard fell upon washington d c  over this past weekend  basically shutting down the whole city  including the u s  capitol building  it left many people digging out for days  and some may still be trying to find their cars under the mounds of snow  however  not everyone took this as an excuse to sit at home  some folks chose to put on their warm coats  lace up their boots  and get to where they needed to be  after all  the country needs them now  this may or may not be indicative of the future  but it seems women were they only ones to trudge through the snow to get to the capitol to get back to work  yes  women  at least in the senate chamber and because she was one of the few people who decided to show up to work on tuesday  sen  lisa murkowski  i ak  took over the job of handling senate business  and as she did so  she stated  as we convene this morning  you look around the chamber  the presiding officer is female  all of our parliamentarians are female  our floor managers are female  all of our pages are female  adding  something is genuinely different   and something is genuinely fabulous  murkowski was there alongside sen  susan collins  r me  who was exercising control over the senate gavel not to let the moment escape without something thoroughly honest being said  murkowski also noted  perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women  that put on your boots and put your hat on and get out and slog through the mess that s out there  damn right it does  women know how hard it is for them to get elected  they aren t about to sit back and let a few snowflakes get in their way  they re going to show up  and they re going to get the job done featured image  flickr
