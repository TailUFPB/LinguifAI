while it s convenient to stereotype girls as small mishmashes of sugar  spice  and everything nice  as small humans who spend most of their time playing with their dollies and trying on princess dresses  it s important to remember that every person is a unique individual  each with his own interests  for instance   year old pennsylvania girl hilde kate lysiak loves reporting the news   lives for it  in fact on saturday  lysiak received a tip that there was heavy police activity on ninth street in selinsgrove  so she did what any good reporter would do   she headed over to check it out  hilde ended up scooping the world on a rather grisly murder hours before adult run news agencies showed up to cover the story  and while her  competitors  were still misreporting information related to the crime  hilde was getting facts straight from the scene  she worked with police and neighbors to get the story out quickly and accurately  posting her article on facebook with the headline   exclusive  murder on ninth street  she even posted a short video direct from the scene while the  real  news agencies scratched their heads the washington post reports that hilde is the daughter of a former new york daily times reporter who got her hooked on chasing stories  she writes on a wide range of topics  but her true passion is crime  i just like letting people know all the information   hilde told the post monday   it s just what i really want to do  and crime is definitely my favorite  unfortunately  some spoilsports felt that little girls shouldn t be embarrassing the  real  news with her excellent reporting  you are nine f cking years old   one grown up told her   what the f ck is wrong with you   the former mayor of selinsgrove called it sensationalist trash  i m disgusted that this cute little girl thinks she is a real journalist   another alleged adult said   what happened to tea parties   another said that nine year old girls should be  playing with dolls  rather than  trying to be reporters       while her detractors view a straight report that includes nothing but the facts and quotes from neighbors and police as  sensationalism   hilda has a better description of what happened  i got a good tip from a source and i was able to confirm it  she also received numerous not so nice messages in her facebook page s inbox informing her of how little girls should  and should not  act  so  she did what any good reporter would do   she gathered up the comments  read them  mean tweets  style  and served up a verbal smackdown to those who say that little girls should not report the news  because of my work  i was able to inform the people that there s a terrible murder  hours before my competition even got to the scene  in fact some of the adult run newspapers were reporting the wrong news  or no news at all  all the while  the orange street news was out covering the murder  she said before directing a special message to the people who think she should be playing with dollies instead i know this makes some of you uncomfortable  and i know some of you want me to sit down and be quiet because i m nine  but if you want me to stop covering news  then you get off your computers and do something about the news  there  is that cute enough for you  hilde has been running her paper for two years  and it doesn t look like she intends to stop anytime soon   not should she  everyone who attempts to stifle her creativity and passion should be ashamed of themselves  but they won t be watch her lay the smackdown on her haters below featured image via screengrab
