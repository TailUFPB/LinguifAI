the republican party has been wishing that america would be more like russia in recent years and they may very well get their wish with donald trump as it turns out  donald trump is connected on many levels with russian dictator vladamir putin  the most alarming of which are the financial connections that are keeping him afloat as his liquid assets decrease and his debt continues to rise into the hundreds of millions of dollars according to bloomberg  while trump brags about being a billionaire  he still has major debts that he owes trump s debt almost doubled  to an estimated   million from   million  as he drew down on a   million line of credit from deutsche bank ag for a hotel project in washington at the same time  trump s liquid assets shrank to about   million from   million  based on the high end of value ranges for those assets listed in his financial disclosure form and because us banks are smart enough to deny trump any loans  the republican nominee has had to rely of outside support for capital  and that has mostly come from wealthy russians who are close to putin the washington post reports since the   trump and his family members have made numerous trips to moscow in search of business opportunities  and they have relied on russian investors to buy their properties around the world  russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets   trump s son  donald jr   told a real estate conference in   according to an account posted on the website of eturbonews  a trade publication   we see a lot of money pouring in from russia  indeed  trump has been desperate to build a trump tower in moscow for over  years now and if he is able to become president and do some favors for russia and putin he would get closer to achieving his business goal in fact  even some of trump s top advisers have close ties to russia trump campaign chair paul manafort  has done multimillion dollar business deals with pro russian oligarchs  and worked for recently ousted putin backed ukrainian president viktor yanukovych  yanukovych s downfall sparked the  russian invasion of ukraine in which they seized the crimean peninsula two of trump s advisers  carter page and michael caputo  worked with gazprom  which is the government controlled natural gas corporation  as talking points memo described it   imagine if most or all of the us energy industry were rolled up into a single company and it were personally controlled by the us president who used it as a source of revenue and patronage  and there s trump s foreign policy adviser former general michael flynn  he cozied up to putin at a dinner in moscow in  with all of that being said  trump s foreign policy ideas would strongly favor russia at a time when putin has never been more dangerous  especially to europe not only has trump been talking about fundamentally weakening nato by pulling us support  which would give russia an opportunity to flex its military muscles to take over some eastern european countries  page suggested earlier this year that trump could lift economic sanctions placed on russia since   which would help some of his russian business buddies  and in what has clearly been under reported on by the media  trump and his team successfully strong armed the gop into ditching the party platform condemning russia s aggression toward ukraine the gop s support of assisting ukraine against putin and trump has been rewarded handsomely for this treachery as putin has directed russian state media to blare out support for trump s campaign  russian hackers also hacked into the dnc to give trump information to use against the democrats in short  trump would be nothing more than a puppet of vladamir putin should he be placed in the white house  it would the first time in american history that the leader of the free world is controlled  especially by a russian ruler who disregards human rights and subverts democracy  ronald reagan would be spinning in his grave  what was the point of the cold war if the united states is just going to become a russian satellite state anyway if republicans think that president obama is similar to former british prime minister neville chamberlain  they haven t seen nothing yet  because at least chamberlain wasn t hitler s puppet featured image via youtube
