oklahoma state republicans have completely gone off the deep end with this one  the party  with the help of a few sellout democrats  passed a state law by a vote of    that would illegally seize the licenses of doctors who perform abortions the measure does include a clause that protects doctors in the case of  life of the mother  or to preserve her health  however  there was no mention of an equivalent exception for rape or incest the stupidity of this law can only be described as  astounding  due to its obvious unconstitutionality  it will be reversed in court once costly taxpayer funded litigation starts  after what will likely be equally expensive appeals one republican  brian crain  was the only member of his party that voted against the law  it isn t clear if he is against the law or voted against it because it was amended heavily without allowing time for a review  however  the fact he is pro life pro forced birth seems to indicate he would have voted for it  one other republican senator  ervin yen  was against the bill but claims he  accidentally  voted for it  that s a new way to explain bad votes for sure the oklahoma state medical association is against the law for obvious reasons   one being that it is blatant and unconstitutional intimidation of doctors  it also places an undue burden on women seeking to exercise a constitutional right the precedent that a law like this could set is downright terrifying  if you can sabotage a person s career for doing a legally protected thing  you can do it for other legally protected things   you taught your students evolution  you lose your teaching license   the list of these kinds of things would grow long in a short amount of time no word has come from oklahoma republicans about how this law will ensure job creation  lower taxes or a reduction in the cost to state welfare programs featured image via
