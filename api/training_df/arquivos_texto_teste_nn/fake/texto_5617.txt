ramadan is a holy month that all muslims celebrate  they fast from sunrise to sunset  unable to eat  drink  smoke or even have sex  muslims try not to fight  curse  lie or sin during ramadan because such acts are considered profane unless you re isis  then it s a signal to slaughter as many people as possible the spokesman for the islamic state said in late may that jihadists should  make it  with god s permission  a month of pain for infidels everywhere   another extremist distributed a manual for using poisons  adding  in poor english   dont forget ramadan is close  the month of victories  this is like being a christian and going on a killing spree christmas morning in the name of jesus  sure  you could rationalize it as a gift to the son of god but  really  you re going against everything the holiday stands for and that s the point here  radicalized muslims are no longer really muslims any more than the westboro baptist church is really christian  both are cruel  twisted distortions of their respective religions  the problem is that far too many americans  mostly  but not exclusively  right wingers  are all too eager to lump   billion muslims together with the tens of thousands of violent lunatics that terrorize the rest of the world consider this  isis has about   fighters  that s it  let s say that for every fighter  there are  people that are totally sympathetic to their cause  hell  i ll be super generous and double that  that gives us    evil  muslim extremists  that s still just    of all the muslims in the world  yet  somehow  we re supposed to be afraid of the other    of them  we don t hold anyone to that kind of standard  if we did  we would have strung up every catholic priest as a pedophile years ago or locked up every white male as a probable serial killer but we don t  of course  because that would be insane  but we do it to muslims anyway  the reality is that isis and those like them have weaponized their religion and in doing have abandoned the very religion they claim to fight in the name of  remember  the overwhelming majority of their victims are muslims who refuse to follow their warped interpretation of islam what is clearer is that the manipulation of the goals of ramadan are another way in which jihadists have interpreted the religion in a way most muslims deplore  another example is the jihadists  wide use of takfir  or the branding of others as infidels who deserve death  the islamic state has used this concept to justify the killing of other muslims  be they shiites or fellow sunnis whom the group deems to be insufficiently devout such views course through the jihadists  ramadan propaganda  if    of the people you kill for being infidels and heretics are of the religion to claim to represent  you re the one that is blaspheming against that religion  it s time the west figured that out and started acting accordingly featured image via wikipedia
