a man ranting about nazi germany had a strange encounter with msnbc host and college professor melissa harris perry at the iowa caucuses this week  perry was with some of her students in a hotel lobby in des moines where a man she doesn t remember ever speaking to came up to her and began speaking  oddly acting as if they were in mid conversation harris perry wrote about the odd incident on her website when he started he speaking it was like he was picking up in the middle of sentence  finishing a conversation we had begun earlier  but i couldn t remember ever meeting him  so what is it that you teach  i am a professor of political science  my wife is a professor of communications  does she teach here in iowa  what i want to know is how you got credentialed to be on msnbc  i am not sure if it is how he spat the word credentialed  or if it is how he took another half step toward me  or if it is how he didn t respond to my question  but the hairs on my arm stood on end  i ignored it  told myself everything was ok  well  it is not exactly a credential  i began  but why you  why would they pick you  perry said the man now sounded angry and began to get closer to her  as the victim of a previous violent crime  she became more upset and agitated at the provocation  the situation escalated i freeze  he speaks  and moves closer  is there a knife under the coat  a gun  worse and i can t hear all the words  but i catch  nazi germany  and i catch  rise to power   but i can t move  i am lulled by a familiar powerlessness  muteness  that comes powerfully and unexpectedly  it grips me  everything is falling away  until in my peripheral vision i catch sight of a ponytail  the movement of an arm  the sound of familiar young voices and i remember  my students she jumped up and rejoined her students  telling the hotel authorities about the bizarre encounter  though they don t appear to have taken any action while he only got second place in the caucuses  donald trump s campaign has made an appeal to extremist racists and bigots  speaking in a racist manner that was previously only done behind closed doors  now they re coming out into the light  and apparently trying to intimidate progressive figures like harris perry  who have often been the target of attacks and ridicule by conservative and conservative media outlets like rush limbaugh and fox news featured image via youtube
