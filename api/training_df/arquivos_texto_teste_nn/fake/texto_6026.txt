brock allen turner  a  year old former student at stanford university  was sentenced to six months in jail for raping an unconscious woman on campus in january  the prosecutor in the case recommended that turner should receive a sentence of six years in prison  however  judge aaron persky sentenced turner to six months in jail saying that  a prison sentence would have a severe impact on him   i think he will not be a danger to others   persky also cited turner s lack of a criminal record and his young age as justifications for the short sentence the victim in the case is a  year old that had a blood alcohol level that was twice the legal limit  she has no memory of the incident  her testimony in the trial is public and is a powerful indictment of turner s actions  the testimony begins with the  year old woman saying  you don t know me  but you ve been inside me  and that s why we re here today   she recounts the horror of having to find out that she was found with her clothes turn off from her behind a dumpster in public during the testimony  she addressed turner personally telling him that  you took away my worth  my privacy  my energy  my time  my safety  my intimacy  my confidence  my own voice  until today  i am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt  she concluded her testimony  speaking to all women who have been victims of sexual assault  and finally  to girls everywhere  i am with you  on nights when you feel alone  i am with you  when people doubt you or dismiss you  i am with you  i fought everyday for you  so never stop fighting  i believe you  as the author anne lamott once wrote   lighthouses don t go running all over an island looking for boats to save  they just stand there shining   although i can t save every boat  i hope that by speaking today  you absorbed a small amount of light  a small knowing that you can t be silenced  a small satisfaction that justice was served  a small assurance that we are getting somewhere  and a big  big knowing that you are important  unquestionably  you are untouchable  you are beautiful  you are to be valued  respected  undeniably  every minute of every day  you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you  to girls everywhere  i am with you  thank you  it seems that in this case that the punishment did not fit the crime that was committed  what turner did is not something that can be undone  once again  the united states criminal system has been exposed as a cruel joke  it s a system where criminals get away with a slap on the wrist and non violent offenders can be locked away for life featured image from stanford university
