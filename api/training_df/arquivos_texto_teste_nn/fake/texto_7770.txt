the national rifle association  nra  has been very vocal about their belief that guns are totally not a problem in america  you can often find the group posting things on twitter and facebook about how awesome and safe firearms are  they contribute millions and millions of dollars to republican candidates to spread this wonderfully false message about their weapons of  freedom   so  when a school shooting happened in madison  ohio on monday we looked at their social networking accounts to see what the organization had to say about the incident and we found  nothing a  year old boy walked into madison junior senior high school during lunch on monday and opened fire with a   caliber semi automatic handgun  two boys   and   were hit with freedom projectiles and two other students were injured during the panic that ensued after the shooting one student  shelby kinnin  was sitting at the table next to where the shooting occurred and described what she saw  i heard the gunshot go off and then i saw one of the kids go down and grab their leg and fall  and then everybody running out of the building  i didn t know what it was at first  i thought maybe it was a chip bag  but then i thought that s too loud for a chip bag to pop  the shooter ran out of the school afterward and police used a k  to find him  he was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder  two counts of felonies assault  making terroristic threats and inducing panic it s really not that surprising that the nra is ignoring the latest in a long list of school shootings  for one thing  the police have not yet said how this kid got his hands on a gun  but he is  years old  how many different ways can a child get a gun  he either took it from some second amendment  nra worshipping family member or he managed to buy it  not very likely  from someone who stole it from some other person who believes the only way to have freedom is to own penile extensions of course  they are going to keep quiet  they can t say anything without sounding like the imbeciles that they are  and if for some reason they do decide to address this  the statement will sound like  well  this is why we shouldn t have gun free zones   because in the underdeveloped mind of an ammosexual moar gunz  is always the answer thankfully  no kids were killed this time  but these children will likely have emotional scars for the rest of their lives  and the shooter will likely spend a very long time in prison for something that could have been prevented if adults had acted responsibly watch  featured image via video screenshot
