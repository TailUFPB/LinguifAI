earlier this week  trump tried to stroke his vanity to maximum advantage by asking politico for copies of their magazine that feature his face on the cover  because  you know  he s important and everyone must be reminded of that at all possible moments  politico is one of many media outlets that trump has banned from his events  though  and they are understandably unhappy about it  nevertheless  they did as trump bade  but with a stunning reply accompanying the magazines national editor kristin roberts sent him a pointed note with the magazines  which do have an illustration of trump on the front  she said  we are happy to provide mr  trump and his team with the politico magazines that you requested we hope mr  trump enjoys reading it in his spare time  in the spirit of open communication  perhaps this would be an appropriate time to ask when you will deliver to our reporters the credentials that we have requested for his many events  i know they would greatly appreciate it  politico just dropped the mic here  it s almost a shame they couldn t do this onstage or on television  where they could literally drop the mic  because that s the only way this would be more perfect it s not very clear why trump banned politico from his events  but some suspect it has something to do with unfavorable coverage of his former campaign manager  corey lewandowski  trump and his campaign have actually banned several outlets from their events  and individual reporters from many more  because they aren t stroking his ego enough to make it grow the politico cover in question could be seen as portraying trump in a poor light  or as flattering  depending on how one looks at it a photo posted by tracie ching   tracieching  on jul    at   pdtnobody can accuse politico of pandering to trump  though  and a quick google search   trump   politico   reveals all the horrible  evil  nasty things they ve said about him  trump hasn t tweeted about this  and it doesn t seem he s made a statement about it either  so he can t be too upset yet or maybe he s just too busy calling hillary  crooked hillary   and accusing her of rigging the debates to care right now  still  politico got him good featured image by gustavo caballero getty images
