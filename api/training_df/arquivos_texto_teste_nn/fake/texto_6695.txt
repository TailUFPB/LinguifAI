sure  we get it you trolled them teehee  trolling is fun  trolling for a cause is even more fun  liberal trolling is a fantastic world full of wonderful people who come together to attack ultra conservative pages still calling for obama s execution and to expose the stupidity of the right to as many young people as possible  what you don t find in the world of liberal trolls are trolls who troll each other this election  things have gone poorly for the mud slinging internet portion of our democratic primaries  who have taken to the field of battle on flat screens with mouse in hand and keyboard at the ready  this thing called bernie sanders happened  and a lot of people got on board  i got on board  i m still on board  if he wins i ll happily usher him into the white house  if he loses  i ll support former first lady  senator and secretary of state hillary clinton  that eliminates me from contention in the ridiculous war between the extremist camps of both of these campaigns bernie or bust  which is the dumbest political philosophy of all time  was born of those who are yet to belong to a party for real but want to vote for bernie no matter what  it s a die hard movement that will die hard once the reality of a donald trump presidency hits america  on the flip side  you have the  hil bots   who are now infiltrating bernie sanders support groups on facebook with an age old trolling technique that works to have a group removed  if only temporarily  by becoming members and posting lewd pictures  groups of them could then report the images to facebook  whose automated system will take the page down and refer it to a human being for review while the groups are back up  it was still just a nasty little trick  what makes this worse is that these are liberals fighting with liberals  once we start trolling our own we turn into the fractured right  conservative groups and pages are divided over trump vs cruz  if we could have been the adults in the room  we could have taken advantage of that while our candidates had an issues driven campaign instead  what we have are violent groups of internet pranksters  ready to shake things up by inconveniencing bernie supporters for a few hours  causing them to get their  hillary is a crook  memes from somewhere else  honestly  we really should be above this casey there is awfully proud of herself  you can see the whole discussion where she confesses in a piece on u s  uncut  it will be nice  from a troll s point of view  when the primaries are over and reality sets in  whether you re bernie or bust or a die hard hil bot  you re going to learn that we have two excellent candidates for president  their roles started out as expected  with sanders pushing clinton further to the left and clinton becoming a better candidate for it  then something happened  and people like me who thought they would support hillary no matter what when it was our consolation prize in  after the democalypse  we like sanders  we d love to see the radical change he s talking about  he s exciting  and real  and extremely fair  i m proud to have been a part of something in american politics that special on the other hand  hillary clinton isn t some consolation prize  she s the most qualified person in the room  she s the only one of the candidates ever to spend significant time in the oval office  and while republicans occupied it she sat on the senate  her reputation as a progressive voter has some of the realities of life attached to it  she s been a politician and a businesswoman all of her life  she has relationships with people that couldn t possibly be considered a bad thing when a call from her becomes a request from the white house  if hillary clinton wins the nomination and you stay home because internet memes have convinced you how horrible she is  you weren t a democrat to begin with anyone who thinks that the republicans should win out of spite doesn t appreciate what handing all three branches of government to the gop would do to this country  that s the real fight  please stop bickering about superdelegates  rigged voting machines  tax returns and urine samples and focus on removing as many republicans from office while simultaneously providing a landslide victory for our eventual nominee featured image via facebook getty images
