giddy with the news that an egyptian commercial airplane had disappeared on route from france to cairo  donald trump wasted no time in taking an undeserved victory lap for his proposal to ban muslims from the united states  unable to contain himself  he also went a step further and blamed hillary clinton for the plane s disappearance   because why not immediately after announcing that he was positive the plane went down due to islamic terrorism  a conclusion he came to before even a single fact had emerged   trump released a breathless statement to the effect that clinton s lack of support for a muslim ban was the root of all international terrorism  his evidence  a list of acts of terror that had occurred both before she became secretary of state and after she left look at the carnage all over the world including the world trade center  san bernardino  paris  the uss cole  brussels and an unlimited number of other places  she and our totally ignorant president won t even use the term radical islamic terrorism  and by the way  ask hillary who blew up the plane last night   another terrible  but preventable tragedy  she has bad judgement and is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country s history if one were to take trump s advice and ask hillary  who blew up the plane last night   she would probably defer to the experts  who would tell you  we don t know  so far  the investigation has turned up few clues and has only just begun although suspicion pointed to islamist militants who blew up another airliner over egypt just seven months ago  no group had claimed responsibility more than  hours after the disappearance of flight   an airbus  flying from paris to cairo three french investigators and a technical expert from airbus arrived in cairo early on friday to help investigate the fate of the missing plane  airport sources said egyptian prime minister sherif ismail said on thursday that it was too early to rule out any explanation for the disaster  the country s aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure on twitter the next day  trump was again telling his supporters that he was the solution to terrorism look where the world is today  a total mess  and isis is still running around wild  i can fix it fast  hillary has no chance   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    far his plans to  fix it fast  include bringing back torture  banning muslims from the united states  and killing the wives and children of suspected extremists in the middle east  those vague policies have already made their way into terrorist propaganda videos and are being used as recruitment tools on fox news  which went from trump skeptic to trump cheerleader with breathtaking speed  the unanimous opinion seemed to be that acts of terror are great for trump  the bodies haven t even been recovered from the mediterranean sea  and fox host stuart varney was bragging about what this could do for trump s poll numbers  i also think this may be good politically for donald trump  he s already tweeted out  saying this is probably terrorism he s the guy who is saying  hands off  keep muslims out temporarily whist we figure out who comes in  an incident of this type is surely a plus for donald trump  there is  of course  absolutely zero evidence that banning muslims from the united states would stop terrorists from hijacking an egyptian airplane  but why should that stop fox from running with the narrative  if trump tweets it  it must be true featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
