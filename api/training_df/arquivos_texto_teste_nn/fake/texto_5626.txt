donald trump just heard that hillary clinton won t face charges from the fbi and he went ballistic conservatives have been frothing at the mouth over the prospect of hillary clinton being arrested and jailed over whatever imaginary crimes they believe she has committed  but after meeting personally with the fbi about her so called email  scandal   it is now expected that the investigation will be dropped and no charges will be filed this comes on the heels of the republican report on benghazi that cleared clinton of any wrongdoing after four years and   million spent trying to find anything to pin on the former secretary of state ever since it became clear that hillary would be his opponent  trump has referred to clinton as  crooked hillary   and has used both benghazi and the email probe as the centerpieces of his attacks against her  but now that the fbi and house republicans have found no evidence against her  trump has lost his two favorite attacks and he had a complete meltdown about it on twitter on saturday  it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton   the republican nominee wrote   what she did was wrong  what bill did was stupid  it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton  what she did was wrong  what bill did was stupid   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    trump is referring to is bill clinton s brief exchange with attorney general loretta lynch last week  the two were coincidentally at the phoenix airport at the same time  so clinton stopped by to see her since the two have known each other for a long time   going back to when he appointed her as a u s  attorney in   according to lynch  while it may not have been wise for the two to chat in private  the conversation was innocent and had nothing to do with the investigation  they spoke about golf and grandchildren  lynch said  and frankly  lynch should be given the benefit of the doubt but you can t tell that to trump  who also declared on saturday night that the system is rigged because the fbi didn t charge clinton like he wanted them to do  it was just announced by sources that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton  like i said  the system is totally rigged   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     donald trump is going to have a hard time using benghazi or the email probe against clinton in a general election in which most people are not paranoid conservatives who see conspiracy theories everywhere they go  it will work on conservative crowds that are easy to work into a frenzy because they already hate clinton with a murderous passion  but the republican benghazi report that exonerates her combined with the fbi declining to charge clinton over emails basically gives the american people four months to forget about it because they won t care in a couple days if they ever really cared at all since this whole circus was manufactured by republicans anyway in an effort to pin some sort of scandal on her  but just like republicans failed to pin manufactured  scandals  on president obama  republicans have failed once again because hillary clinton did nothing wrong featured image via joe raedle getty images
