the studio of superheroes will leave georgia rather than make movies in a state that bullies gay people the first amendment defense act passed the republican dominated georgia legislature earlier this month  but has yet to be signed by governor nathan deal should the bill become law  it will allow conservative  christians  to use their religion as a shield to justify bigotry and discrimination toward same sex couples and give religious organizations the ability to fire gay employees at will the bill has caused an uproar and many companies have stopped or are threatening to stop doing business with the state if it becomes law that includes the nfl  which promptly told georgia officials that such a blatantly discriminatory law would cost atlanta the superbowl bid they have been desperately seeking and now marvel and disney have made an even bigger threat as most of us know  many of disney s marvel films are shot in georgia because of the state s advantageous tax incentives  captain america  civil war was just recently filmed at pine wood studios in atlanta and such a massive production means jobs for people in georgia and a boost in the economy but if georgia chooses to enshrine bigotry into law  marvel will take their heroes elsewhere  disney and marvel are inclusive companies  and although we have had great experiences filming in georgia  we will plan to take our business elsewhere should any legislation allowing discriminatory practices be signed into state law   disney said in a statement that should worry georgia officials to the core it makes sense that disney would pull the marvel cinematic universe away from georgia if this bill passes  after all  it s hard to imagine trying to film characters who believe in equality  fairness  and inclusiveness in an environment that promotes the exact opposite georgia would be well advised to scuttle this bill before it costs them dearly  because pissing off captain america is not a good idea featured image  marvel s the avengers
