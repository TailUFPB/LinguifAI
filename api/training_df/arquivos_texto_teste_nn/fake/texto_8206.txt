after bernie sanders  win in new hampshire on tuesday night  so many people contributed to his campaign that actblue  the fundraising service used by democratic candidates  is having trouble processing the donations  that s because during his victory speech  sanders said  i m not going to new york city to host a fundraiser on wall street  instead  i m going to hold a fundraiser right here  right now  across america  my request is please go to berniesanders com and contribute  so there it is  that s our fundraiser  pretty quick   sanders concluded  that  fundraiser  brought in more than    million dollars in one night for sanders   it was a yuuuge night for the democratic candidate here is the victory speech that broke the internet sanders supporters took to twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through  act blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to sanders huge night  contributions are processing  receipts are a little delayed  keep the donations coming    actblue   actblue  february    customer service team is always available for support  just email  and someone will get back to you   actblue   actblue  february    actblue laid out what happened to cause the issues  in a blog post  last night s spontaneous fundraiser  the one that raised    million in less than a day  broke our external processor s response systems  that s some amazing grassroots power  like we said  we over prepare  so we were ready for that  but the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message  which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed as a certain hilarious snl skit pointed out  we all know that bernie sanders  average campaign donation is   dollars  the people powered campaign has already smashed president obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions  the fact that people are making smaller donations to sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising  since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can  supporters can continue to donate to sanders  campaign throughout the primary season that might have something to do with why sanders  raised more money than hillary clinton s campaign in january  in january  sanders received   million dollars in donations  while clinton raised   million dollars rest assured  anxious berners   the campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore  be happy  this is  probably the best problem any candidate could ever have during an election featured image from video screenshot via youtube
