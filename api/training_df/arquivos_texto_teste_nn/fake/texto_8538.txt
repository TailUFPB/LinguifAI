talk about blowback  last summer  texas governor greg abbott initiated an investigation into planned parenthood following the release of a series of deceptively edited videos claiming to have caught the healthcare provider engaging in fetal organ harvesting and selling the parts to biomedical research facilities via some sort of grisly underground marketplace but instead of catching planned parenthood red handed  a grand jury has officially indicted the perpetrators of the videos  david daleiden and sandra merritt  while also exonerating planned parenthood of any wrongdoing the ap via talking points memo david daleiden  founder of the center for medical progress  was indicted on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs  another activist  sandra merritt  was also indicted on a charge of tampering with a governmental record  it s the first time anyone in the group has been charged criminally since the videos started surfacing last year texas becomes the eighth state to exonerate planned parenthood  while casting serious doubt on the veracity of the obviously deceptive videos  yet most of the gop presidential candidates  along with most of the conservative movement  continues to treat the videos as if they represent hard evidence of planned parenthood s allegedly evil motives and illegal activities  congressional republicans  along with state republicans  used the videos as convenient excuses to vote in support of crushing the healthcare clinics it s entirely likely that republicans will continue to attach their reputations to the videos in spite of the indictment and the various exonerations adding to the irony of the indictment  daleiden is being accused of attempting to illegally purchase fetus organs   the very practice he was attempting to expose  even though it didn t exist in a statement announcing the indictment  harris county district attorney devon anderson didn t provide details on the charges  including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs  anderson s office said it could not provide details until the documents charging daleiden and merritt were formally made public  which was expected later monday get ready for the sound of anti choice heads exploding  as well as the demagoguing of the grand jury itself as somehow an obama naral ppfa conspiracy featured imaged via video screen grab
