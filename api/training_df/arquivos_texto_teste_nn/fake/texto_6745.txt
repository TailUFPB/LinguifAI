bill maher had every one of his panelists in stitches as he read these during real time on friday night  the hbo host noted that us weekly ran a list of  things we don t know about hillary clinton  after lampooning some of them  maher declared that the other candidates deserve equal time so he and his staff put together  things we don t know about ted cruz and read some of them during the show  and guest panelist van jones couldn t help but laugh his ass off  which greatly amused maher  i spent my entire freshman year of high school stuffed in a locker   maher began about cruz  as a child i used to imagine what it must be like to have an imaginary friend  my nickname at princeton was f ckface mirrors don t show my reflection  i named the stick up my ass   hank  at that point  jones was laughing so hard that maher told him he should take some heart medication  and then he continued  my cuban half once robbed my canadian half at gunpoint  my children love to play hide and seek  sometimes for weeks at a time  jesus once descended from heaven just to punch me in the face  here s the video via twitter  i smell with my tongue   and  other things you didn t know about ted cruz  thanks to  billmaher  watch https   t co ptoajbnmbc  real time   realtimers  april    is without a doubt the most hilarious take down of ted cruz to date  and he totally deserves it while republican front runner donald trump seems to be saying stuff just to make conservatives happy even if he may not necessarily truly believe what he is saying himself  ted cruz actually does believe the bullshit he says  ted cruz is probably the most dangerous candidate in the gop field  but the good news is that most americans  including his own republican colleagues  hate him  and that makes him the perfect fodder for comedians like bill maher featured image  screenshot
