marco rubio may have come in third in the iowa caucus behind both ted cruz and donald trump  but for reasons that remain unclear his team   and the media   are treating it like he just locked up the presidency   don t break out the champagne just yet  rubio fans  third place finishers almost never end up winning the nomination  but clearly thrilled with the narrative that he had pulled off a political upset by coming in third rubio delivered a tone deaf  victory  speech about how no one thought he could do it  come in third  that is  so this is the moment they said would never happen  for months  for months they told us we had no chance  for months they told us because we offer too much optimism in a time of anger  we had no chance  for months they told us because we didn t have the right endorsements or the right political connections  we had no chance  they told me that we have no chance because my hair wasn t gray enough and my boots were too high  to political insiders watching the speech  there was growing bafflement  anyone with any familiarity with one of obama s most iconic speeches   when he won the iowa caucus in   a very real upset   noticed immediately that rubio was pretty much plagiarizing the sitting president almost verbatim here s obama s  they said this day would never come  they said our sights were set too high  they said this country was too divided  too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose  but on this january night  at this defining moment in history  you have done what the cynics said we couldn t do  like any copy cat  rubio s version paled in comparison to the original  obama s speech was forceful  aspirational  and concise  it set the tone for obama s entire campaign  here was an underdog who no one believed could do it  handily beating the favored choices  as a result  obama s comments felt earned  rubio is using a more  fake it til you make it  approach hilariously  obama s former speechwriter was one of the people scratching their heads at rubio s carbon copy  he scorched rubio s campaign in a tweet he could ve at least thanked obama for the opening line https   t co   jon favreau   jonfavs  february     rubio couldn t thank obama for giving him his speech  rubio has  like all republicans  continually bashed the president to score cheap political points  ironically   and this really is shaping up to be the year that irony jumped the shark   rubio may owe his entire presidential campaign to obama s history making one just eight years ago  like obama  rubio is young and relatively inexperienced in national politics  he s considered a long shot  but one who hopes to appeal to younger generations however  before we start viewing rubio as a conservative obama  let s remember the things that separate the two  obama was young  but he was also a great magnetic personality  the vibrancy of his campaign and his own charisma gave him a huge boost  where so far rubio blends into the background of nearly every stage he takes  he also has a history of politically motivated flip flops  a romney esque ability to change with the direction of the wind and come out looking like both a moral coward and a shameful opportunist but perhaps the most telling sign of rubio s paper thin comparison to obama is the fact that he has so little to say that he needs to borrow the words of obama just to have a coherent message at all  obama   love him or hate him   was his own man  rubio is whoever you want him to be  and that s pretty sad feature image via flickr
