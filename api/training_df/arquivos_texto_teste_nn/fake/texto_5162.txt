republicans have long held the deep south in their grip  but there are signs that may be changing  fivethirtyeight com is looking at georgia right now  which has consistently voted for republican candidates in every presidential election going back to   however  hillary clinton and donald trump are virtually neck and neck there  and there are other races that show georgia possibly turning purple this year the atlanta journal constitution just released a poll showing hillary leading trump  percent to  percent  while that is within the margin of error for that poll  other polls likewise show a very tight race there  trump is still favored to carry georgia and its  electoral votes  with a  to  percent chance of winning  according to fivethirtyeight s polls only and polls plus models  respectively  this poll shows a growing chance that trump will lose there hillary would have a  percent chance of winning if the election were held today  georgia doesn t have a huge chance of being the state that decides the outcome of november s election  but the fact that it has a chance at all is astounding  given the rabid conservatism there  with a georgia win  fivethirtyeight s electoral maps give hillary  to  electoral votes even if she loses ohio  pennsylvania  and possibly florida it s not just the presidential race that s making georgia stand out  senator johnny isakson is struggling to keep his seat amidst a tight race with his democratic opponent jim barksdale  isakson only has a six point lead right now  compared to his previous two elections  both of which he won by more than  points nationwide  another poll shows that more people favor a democratic congress than a republican congress  six years of tea party obstruction  childishness and general craziness has likely soured people s opinions of the gop  and the train wreck that is donald trump isn t helping  in fact  isakson s race  along with sen  kelly ayotte s and others  is confirming gop fears that trump s poisonous influence is starting to harm down ticket races georgia s stunning transformation into a battleground state is due in part to its changing demographics  there s a swiftly growing black community there  and the black community nationwide tends to vote overwhelmingly democratic  trump s shunning of so called  political correctness   along with his blatant racism  is probably amplifying that effect like what s happening in utah  this is an interesting and surprising development  georgia is well known as a republican stronghold  now  it s further evidence that the gop s stranglehold over many states is weakening photo of hillary by justin sullivan getty images  photo of donald trump by alex wong getty images  images merged by rika christensen
