during an interview on cnn sunday morning  jake tapper pressed donald trump hard asking for some shred of evidence that the presumptive republican frontrunner s claims regarding the iraq war are true trump attempted to position himself against hillary clinton s vote in favor of the iraq war  i have a very strong temperament  but i have a temperament that s totally under control  and  mentions that i ll bring us into war  she s the one that wanted to go into iraq  she raised her hand  she didn t know what the hell she was doing  she raised her hand  i said  i don t want to go into iraq  iraq is going to destabilize the middle east  and i was  percent right   trump told tapper now  this might actually be a legitimate talking point if this were a normal election and trump wasn t trump  however  that is not at all the case  that s why tapper decided to call out trump s statement that he was against the iraq war before it started here is a transcript of the exchange jake tapper  can i just say one point on that  i have looked so long and hard for any evidence  trump  i ll give it to you    they had newspaper articles tapper  right  but the war started in  trump  it did  but you know what  you look at   i did an interview with howard   and that interview was the first time i was ever asked the question  don t forget i was an entrepreneur  i m a real estate person tapper  but didn t you say to howard that you thought it was a good idea trump  this was before the war started  long before the war started and it was a very  like  i don t know  first  nobody ever asked me the question  when you re do what i did nobody was talking about a lot of the questions that you ask me today  and i was   i sort of like  well  i don t know  maybe  i don t know  by the time that started  i was totally against it  and from  on  there s a lot of proof of that  because  as you know  there was articles in magazines  there was a lot of articles tapper  yeah  a year after the war started trump  no  no  but i was against it from before it started  and if you go back and look at that interview  and i ll get it for you if you want  but that interview was substantially before the war started  it was the first time i was ever asked the question  and even that  it wasn t like  oh yeah  we should go in  it was a very  like yeah  maybe tapper  the only thing i would say  and then we don t have to belabor this point  is if there is evidence of you being against the war strongly before the war actually started  i would love to see that trump  ok  but i think there is evidence tapper  i just haven t seen it trump  i think there is evidence  i haven t been asked that question before  nobody said that to me before  i think there is evidence  i ll see if i can get it  but i will say  from the beginning of   i mean i ve had articles  and i mean there are magazines  tapper   no question trump  i was against the war a long time ago and it destabilized the middle east  and that s exactly what i said was going to happen while the political theater of watching trump try to back up one of his claims without there being any actual evidence to back his claims is always entertaining  trump accidently exposed a huge weakness of his in the interview  no one cares what trump has had to say about anything before this election cycle  his greatest achievement in the political realm until now was his fanning of the flames that was the birther conspiracy theory no one cared in  what trump had to say about the iraq war then  trump has alleged that the reason that there isn t any evidence of his disapproval of the iraq war was because no one asked him about it  who would ask the trump of  his opinion on any matter of seriousness  he was reality television star  he didn t matter that being said  if trump did actually have such strong feelings against the iraq war  why didn t he bring it up  trump had the money and social capital to launch a campaign against the iraq invasion that could have possibly have had an actual impact yet he didn t  that s because trump is a selfish opportunist and taking a stand at the right time in history is not in his nature you can watch the interview below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
