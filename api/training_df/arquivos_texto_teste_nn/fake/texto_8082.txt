after the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia  many people have offered up their opinions on what should happen in regards to who should replace him  it is the president s constitutional duty to nominate someone for the role  however several republicans have voiced their dissent  including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  directly after the announcement of scalia s passing  mcconnell wrote on facebook a message of condolence for his family alongside this remark  the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice  therefore  this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president  however  according to sarah burgess on twitter  mcconnell contradicts his own current views  in the   kentucky law journal  mcconnell wrote  at the outset  the senate should discount the philosophy of the nominee  in our politically centrist society  it is highly unlikely that any executive would nominate a man of such extreme views of the right of the left as to be disturbing to the senate  however  a nomination  for example  of a communist or a member of the american nazi parly  would have to be considered an exception to the recommendation that the senate leave ideological considerations to the discretion of the executive  political and philosophical considerations were often a factor in the nineteenth century and arguably in the parker  haynsworth and carswell cases also  but this is not proper and tends to degrade the court and dilute the constitutionally proper authority of the executive in this area  the president is presumably elected by the people to carry out a program and altering the ideological directions of the supreme court would seem to be a perfectly legitimate part of a presidential platform  to that end  the constitution gives to him the power to nominate  as mentioned earlier  if the power to nominate had been given to the senate  as was considered during the debates at the constitutional convention  then it would be proper for the senate to consider political philosophy  the proper role of the senate is to advise and consent to the particular nomination  and thus  as the constitution puts it   to appoint   this taken within the context of modern times should mean an examination only into the qualifications of the president s nominee  according to himself  mcconnell would have to agree president obama is within his full right and duty as commander in chief to nominate someone who he deems appropriate for the role of supreme court justice  even if that means  altering the ideological directions of the supreme court   he should still see that to be  perfectly legitimate  however  with the times being as they are during an election year  you can see why republicans are terrified of an obama nominee  because the implications would be huge surrounding several cases  including cases surrounding voting rights to say the least  it s not surprising that mcconnell is a giant hypocrite contradicting even himself and his own view of the law  hopefully he ll come to his senses sooner rather than later featured image  flickr
