nbc s meet the press tried as much as possible to be charitable to the trump campaign during a segment in which they projected the electoral college map in a trump vs  clinton general election  but as host chuck todd discovered  when the math is against you  it just won t work todd opened the segment by repeating one of the tropes that republican frontrunner and likely nominee donald trump has repeated for several months now  that he can somehow put states that have favored democrats  in play  and flip them over to the republican party immediately it became clear that the republicans face a huge uphill climb on election day  factoring in states that have voted for either party on a consistent basis over the last four elections  the nightmare for trump and the gop is revealed  with  electoral votes for clinton and only  for trump  in a contest where  votes are needed  she s almost there without any so called  swing  states being contested  democrats have been able to bank on states like california  new york  pennsylvania with a lot of delegates  in addition to very reliable states like maryland  massachusetts  illinois  and new jersey staying in solid territory for the party by contrast  after texas  it s hard to find solid republican states with a lot electoral college heft to them  on a map the wide expanses of states like wyoming  nebraska and the dakotas may seem impressive  but their sparse populations limit their impact on the electoral college todd then showed a scenario in which more recent swing states that have divided between the parties in recent elections have been counted  if trump won ohio  virginia  and florida under this scenario  he still comes up short   and the reality is all of those states in the two most recent elections went to president obama then the funniest   or saddest   point was made by todd  for trump to win if he somehow won those states  again  highly unlikely  he would need to find votes in colorado or nevada  those states also went democratic in the most recent election  but that isn t even the biggest obstacle to a trump triumph  todd pointed out that those are states with large latino voting bases  also known as the community trump has alienated and attacked   characterizing them as rapists and murderers from the first day he was a presidential candidate no election is set in stone  and it is more than half a year away to the general contest  but make no mistake  especially with donald trump as its nominee  the republican party is the one behind the eight ball  facing a series of odds that make them the most likely to lose the entire race featured image via screen capture
