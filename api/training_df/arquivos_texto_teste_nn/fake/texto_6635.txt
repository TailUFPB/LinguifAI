as the gop s fight to control which bathrooms transgender people can and can t use continues  one of their main talking points has been how  dangerous  it is for trans individuals to be allowed to use the same restrooms as women and children despite how false that argument is  there have literally been no instances where a transgender person has assaulted someone while using the restroom that matched their gender identity   this misleading stance actually sweeps an extremely important issue under the rug   who the majority of sex offenders really are chad butler  the district attorney of nashville  tennessee  has prosecuted hundreds of sex crimes and has found the recent anti trans  bathroom laws  in states like north carolina extremely frustrating  in speaking to wsmv channel   butler revealed that throughout the entire length of his long career  he has never prosecuted a case against a trans individual  not one  so who are the real threats  butler says that sexual predators are overwhelmingly  heterosexual men  as long as i ve been doing this job and the hundreds of cases i ve reviewed  i ve never once had a transgender person come across my desk as an offender  butler believes that the ongoing arguments over transgender people s bathroom rights actually distract the public from real dangers  specializing in crimes against children  butler revealed that although these discriminatory anti trans laws are supposedly meant to protect children  they don t  the real threat  he says  are the people the children come in contact with every day  butler said  a majority of my cases are fathers  stepfathers  uncles  boy scout leaders  coaches  youth ministers  preachers  people that are already close to the family that the family trusts  butler called the claim that trans people are a threat to children statistically unfounded and off base   these accusations only encourage parents to be weary of the wrong people  it is actually very frustrating because it sort of takes the dialogue and the conversation away from where it should be  what butler believes will actually keep children safe  is open discussions about consent and sexual abuse at an early age  butler says that one of the most important things parents can do is educate their children  and believe them if they come forward because more times than not  children are molested by someone close to the family  a child is more likely to be sexually assaulted in their own bathroom than a public restroom by a stranger  you can watch butler shut down the gop s anti trans rhetoric below wsmv channel   featured image is a screenshot
