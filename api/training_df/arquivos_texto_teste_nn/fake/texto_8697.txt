during an interview on cnn s state of the union on sunday  donald trump was questioned by host  jake tapper  on his religious beliefs and support among the socially conservative  right wing christians things have been getting heated between republican primary frontrunner donald trump  and the runner up ted cruz  to say the least  cruz has been surging in the polls as trump maintains his lead  while trump s lead appears to be unshakable  his support is also static  so the two have been at each other s throats trying to win over voters  in order to win over those voters  they have to convince people that they are the true spokesman for god and the christian religion in that arena  cruz has a major advantage over trump   during the family leadership summit  last july  trump made the mistake of saying something somewhat reasonable to a crowd of hardcore social conservatives  he was asked if he had asked god for forgiveness  trump responded  saying  i m not sure i have  i just go on and try to do a better job from there  i don t think so  i think if i do something wrong  i think  i just try and make it right  i don t bring god into that picture  i don t  he tried to explain away the gaffe  but it was too late  for those not in the know  asking god  and or jesus  for forgiveness for their sins is the first and most important thing you can do as a christian  for many  trump might as well have said that he is not actually a christian this was brought up early in the interview  trump was asked the question again  to which he replied that he has  a good relationship with god   tapper then goes on to question trump about his behavior that has been seen in tabloids for the past two decades  trump says that  he has been living a  good life  now for the past few years  so that shouldn t matter let s compare that to cruz  who has a  strap on  set of god s armor  whether is trying to take away the rights of lgbt people  or claiming that atheists should not be able to hold public office  cruz embodies all the terrible qualities that are revered by right wing christians based on the sentiments expressed in the interview  i don t think trump has any idea how these people work  trump can stir up and exploit hatred towards minorities without it coming back to hurt him  but pandering and exploiting the christian right takes both skill and experience  two things trump has neither of if the republican primary race was a  s boy band  trump would be the bad boy of the group  many conservatives might be attracted to him  but cruz is the one they are going to invite over for sunday dinner  they might even let him say grace you can watch the interview  below featured image credit  screenshot via youtube
