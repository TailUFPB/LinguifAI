the atmosphere created by conservatives and their anti transgender witch hunt is becoming more and more apparent by the day  the trend started by north carolina  with texas in the process of following suit  is to restrict bathrooms to  gender at birth   in other words  a transgender woman with double dee breasts who is wearing a miniskirt would be required to subject herself to harassment by going into the men s room to do her makeup  to most  this is not in any way reasonable  as someone who identifies as a woman  she belongs where she is most comfortable  the women s restroom  but to the uneducated  unwashed religious bigots in our country  she should have to live her life in a constant state of discomfort but the hysteria has reached a point that even cisgender  biological women who identify as women  must worry about the backlash when one of god s chosen imbeciles decides they don t look feminine enough  one such woman is aimee toms  who was recently rudely informed that she doesn t belong in the women s restroom  why toms was minding her own business  simply washing her hands at a walmart in danbury  connecticut on friday when another woman approached her and informed her  you re disgusting   and  you don t belong here  at the time  toms was wearing a baseball cap and had very short hair  so she says she can understand why someone might think she is transgender  while her appearance doesn t matter one iota  the reason her hair was short at the time will make the bigot she encountered feel very  very stupid  in a video she posted online  she informed her new hater  do you know why my hair is so short  in january  i made my third donation to pantene s beautiful lengths program  do you know what they do  they take hair donations and they make them into wigs and they give them to cancer patients free of cost  now  i am damn happy to rock a pixie cut if some kid gets my hair and gets to wear it  and that s worth it to me you know what isn t worth it  being discriminated against in a bathroom by some fucking asshole who thinks they have a right to decide what gender i am and that they have a right to judge me for it  after experiencing the discrimination they face firsthand  i cannot fathom the discrimination transgender people must face in a lifetime   she says   can you imagine going out every day and having people tell you you should not be who you are or that people will not accept you as who you are  at this point  the hate is getting ridiculous  most people have used a restroom with someone who is transgender at some point in their lives without noticing  if daytime talk shows are any indicator  there is a hefty supply of men who have had sexual relations with a woman who happens to have a penis   and they didn t give a flying f ck at the time  people are people  transgender people are people who happen to have been born into the  wrong body   so to speak  there is no harm in a society allowing people to simply be who they are without fear of reprisals  unfortunately  the american right disagrees because reasons watch toms lay the smackdown on the haters below https   www facebook com never shout aimee videos vb    type  theaterfeatured image via newstimes
