this racist literally committed the hate crime in the name of donald trump on saturday morning  khondoker usama and his friend were getting gas for their vehicle at a kwik shop in wichita  kansas when they saw a white man hurling obscenities at a black man  upon seeing usama and his friend  the man focused on them  then suddenly it turned onto us  calling us  brown trash  go home  trump will win   usama recalled  you want to live in this country  you better leave   the man warned usama and his friend  who is hispanic usama stood up to the bully and told him   this is my country  who are you to tell me that  that s when the white man became violent  according to the wichita eagle the exchange was heated  usama said  and he tried to defuse the situation  but his friend got punched and taken to the ground  he said he tried to get between the attacker and his friend but then was pushed himself  he thought he saw the attacker reaching for his pocket and feared he had a weapon  he said  so he backed away and called   he kept kicking the student who was laying on the ground   usama said   he was kicking him  it was a gut wrenching scene  he saw that i was calling the police and got back on his motorcycle and circled around us and was saying  trump  trump  trump  we will make america great again  you losers will be thrown out of the wall  usama says he didn t know the man who attacked him and his friend  but he also doesn t  know why anyone would do anything so hateful and so wrong to any individual  this isn t the first time a trump supporter has physically assaulted a person of color  although many of the incidents usually occur at trump rallies in north carolina last week  a white trump supporter sucker punched a black man being led out of the rally by security  at the same rally  another white trump supporter slapped a back man and yelled obscenities at him and trump rallies in st  louis and chicago nearly turned into race wars as white supporters hurled obscenities  racial epithets  and threats of violence towards protesters  some protesters were even assaulted  yet donald trump claims no one has gotten hurt at his rallies and he has called for more violence as for usama  he urged others to speak up if they find themselves being verbally or physically assaulted  there may be other people who are fearing the same thing  so this is really important in the times we are in  the challenges we are facing as minorities in this country  we better get united and we better speak up  make no mistake  donald trump and the republican party are responsible for these racists and their actions  his white supporters literally think they are entitled to be assholes toward minorities and trump only makes them feel bulletproof and immune to prosecution because he has said he would pay for their legal defense if they get arrested for assault or hate crimes if trump becomes president  this is what his america will look like  an america where white racists have free reign to harass and attack people of color at will because they have the blessing of the white house to do so  that s a scary and dangerous america to live in  featured image via youtube
