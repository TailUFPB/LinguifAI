john mccain is no stranger to war and torture  he experienced it first hand when his plane was shot down in vietnam and he was captured by the vc  his descriptions of what he endured in  are horrific at best that makes him possibly the most qualified man in congress to speak on the subject  his seat as chair of the armed forces committee also gives him a certain insight into what the united states did to prisoners in violation of the geneva convention and the treaty we signed outlawing torture with  other countries in  for candidates like donald trump and ted cruz to declare that waterboarding  a simulated execution by drowning  is in any way acceptable isn t just dangerous  it s criminal  mccain reminds us that after world war ii  japanese generals were tried  convicted and hung for their role in torturing pows  which included waterboarding mccain makes a powerful statement about the role of waterboarding or any kind of torture for that matter  it s been so disappointing to see some presidential candidates on the campaign trail engaged in loose talk about reviving waterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques  it might be easy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric  but these statements must not go unanswered because they mislead the american people about the realities of interrogation  how to gather intelligence  what it takes to defend our security and at the most fundamental level what we are fighting for as a nation  senator mccain s words had to sting those candidates who love to pander to the extremists of the right  the fear mongering they engage in creates a perfect atmosphere for a mob mentality that demands we torture people  even if it isn t good interrogation technique because hate prevails with the ignorant good for you  senator  it s comforting to see republicans standing up to the degenerates your base has decided to endorse  now if you could just do something about them https   www facebook com cspan videos  featured image via screen capture
