on monday morning  donald trump appeared on fox   friends and raged over his loss in colorado  the republican frontrunner s tantrum was so bad that it caused a gop senator to absolutely lose his shit on twitter senator cory gardner was livid that trump has been bashing the state after his loss  especially since the rules for delegate counts were set up months ago  however  it was only after his embarrassing defeat that he decided he no longer wanted to play by the rules   typical trump  after all of the whining  senator gardner decided to put the donald in his place in an epic rant if you can t figure out the colorado gop delegate process how can you figure out how to balance the national budget   cory gardner   corygardner  april    if you cannot navigate the  cologop convention what is your plan for putin   copolitics  cory gardner   corygardner  april    can you protect israel at the un when you re completely baffled by the  cologop convention process   cg  copolitics  cory gardner   corygardner  april    how on earth are you going to defeat isis if you can t figure out the  cologop convention   cg  copolitics  cory gardner   corygardner  april    answer to those questions  of course  is that he has no plans  he never has  he tells his  poorly educated  supporters that he does  but he can t give out all of his secrets because someone might  steal  his ideas  his supporters  in turn  tell everyone else this load of baloney as if it s completely normal that a man who is running for president of the united states is refusing to tell people what he is going to do for the country  the senator had a lot more to say spoke to dozens of trump supporters this weekend  listened to his surrogate speak twice  not  person complained abt process until he lost   cory gardner   corygardner  april      tedcruz showed up to the  cologop convention   realdonaldtrump only sent a surrogate  cruz swept  elections are won by those who show up   cory gardner   corygardner  april    glenn came out of nowhere to win  cologop convention for us senate  that should be the story  not  realdonaldtrump s temper tantrum   cory gardner   corygardner  april    ve attended co gop conventions for years  it requires organization   attn to grassroots to win  cruz had it  trump didn t  end of story   cory gardner   corygardner  april    should be the end of the story  but trump is a terrible loser  instead of just admitting that cruz won fair and square  someone must have cheated  it s a conspiracy the reality is that trump throws these fits because it furthers the narrative that he is the underdog fighting against the big  bad gop establishment  and because his supporters do not have the common sense of a toddler  they believe him it s not every day that a republican senator so thoroughly owns trump  so we must give credit where credit is due  bravo senator gardner featured image via  andrew renneisen getty images  altered
