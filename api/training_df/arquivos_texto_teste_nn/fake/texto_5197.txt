the gop implosion is about to be set off as influential republican leaders are on the cusp of staging an intervention with presidential nominee donald trump yes  you read that right   three months before a presidential election  a candidate is being given an ultimatum by their party leaders about cleaning up their act or dropping out of the race you couldn t even make this stuff up for tv  let alone reality according to nbc news key republicans close to donald trump s orbit are plotting an intervention with the candidate after a disastrous  hours led some influential voices in the party to question whether trump can stay at the top of the republican ticket without catastrophic consequences for his campaign and the gop at large republican national committee head reince priebus  former republican new york city mayor rudy giuliani and former house speaker newt gingrich are among the trump endorsers hoping to talk the real estate mogul into a dramatic reset of his campaign in the coming days the  intervention  comes as trump has repeatedly been attracting negative press for a slew of gaffes  including attacking the khans   whose son was killed in battle    kicking out a crying baby at his rally  selfishly accepting a purple heart  and backstabbing fellow republicans running for reelection in the last several days  influential republicans  from policy advisers under reagan to congressman richard hanna and mega donor meg whitman  have publicly stated they will be voting for hillary clinton over the gop nominee  heck  even john mccain s granddaughter is voting for hillary clinton  it seems that with every passing day another republican wakes up and realizes how truly damaging trump is of course the trump campaign denied such an intervention was in the works and pathetically tried to convince the public that the campaign was more unified than ever  republicans are more scared that he will drop out of the race  something that seems very unlikely as of right now  the trump train has derailed and is heading on a crash course into a ditch can anyone remember a time in our american electoral history when a presidential candidate was forced to undergo an intervention to clean up his act  this is something completely unheard of  but lo and behold  it s happening right before our eyes remember when republicans told us he would change his tune when he secured the delegates needed to be the nominee  guess that was just another lie  and now they are paying the price  and  if democrats show up to vote in november  it will pay off beautifully featured image via alex wong getty images
