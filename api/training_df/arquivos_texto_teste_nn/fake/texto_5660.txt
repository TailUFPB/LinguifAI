we all know that trump supporters are crazy  but a man in new york city s times square took it to a whole other level on thursday  the clearly disturbed man is nyc s  year old krit mcclean  he was reportedly shouting about donald trump at the top of a ledge  and was completely naked  authorities and bystanders stared as he blew kisses at the crowd that stopped to watch the show  and was shouting  donald trump where are you  it all started when mcclean took to the square early thursday morning  stripped naked in front of a disney store near  street  removed the watch from his wrist  hurled it at a nearby woman  and began shouting incoherently  a security guard told mcclean to get dressed  but the order was ignored  he also was combative when police arrived  shouting get that bitch debbie  i want to talk to debbie   after that  mcclean said he needed to meet with trump then  mcclean was atop a  foot ledge shouting   donald trump where are you  donald trump where the f  are you    officers on the scene report that he was grabbing and waving his private parts at them  did some sort of dance  and then jumped from the ledge  but unfortunately missed the safety apparatus that first responders had down below for him  and hit the pavement instead  he was carted off to bellevue  a psychiatric institution in new york city  and is reportedly in stable condition now  this man is clearly mentally ill  but i find it very telling that he appears to be obsessed with donald trump  even in the middle of some kind of psychotic break  that isn t to make fun of mcclean  of course  it s just a very interesting connection  may he make a full recovery featured image via dna info
