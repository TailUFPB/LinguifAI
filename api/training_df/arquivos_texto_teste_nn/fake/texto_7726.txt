for the longest time  donald trump has been advocating for the complete and utter repeal of obamacare   yet through all his talking he hasn t released a plan of his own   that is until now  on wednesday  the donald laid out a seven point plan  which is so lacking in detail and void of specifics that a high school student could fit the entire thing on one page  double spaced even so   what s the first thing he wants to do  by getting rid of obamacare altogether  as he says  trump will allow insurers to discriminate once again against people with pre existing conditions  giving insurers the option not to provide coverage as they see fit  along with all the other protections obamacare provides  for a full list of those shelters  visit here  trump has said in the past that he would replace the pre existing condition rule with something else  something  much greater  but he must have forgotten about that promise because he didn t offer any alternatives  not in this one page plan while obamacare may seem complicated to some  getting rid of common sense provisions like this should alarm every american  and  trump isn t alone on this  paul ryan  the new speaker of the house  was forced to admit that popular rules like this  even among republican voters  would end up going away along with obamacare so   that s number one   gut anything and everything  even if it makes sense   just because it s something obama came up with  got it what else is in there trump wants to allow insurers to compete across state lines  you might remember this if you watched the debate last week  where rubio got the applause of the night for making fun of trump about it  this was before trump made his entire plan available  and the only thing he could think of was this aspect of it   get rid of the state lines   you could hear him say  over and over it s possible this is the only real part of donald trump s plan that he cares about  after all  this was the only part he could remember when called out on the debate stage in front of everyone the other remaining  points of trump s plan  are as follows healthcare reform is much more complicated than this  however  this seven point plan doesn t tell us much  all it really says is what republican voters want to hear and   here s another doozy  he made a statement trying to link his strict immigration policies as being one factor in limiting the cost of health insurance for illegal immigrants  but what he really did was admit that illegal immigrants only cause a tiny fraction of the total cost of healthcare  donald trump says illegal immigrants cost the u s    billion annually  but total health care spending in the u s is around    trillion  that s not even a drop in the bucket  this is just further proof  straight from the source  that illegals aren t driving up the cost of healthcare like republicans claim it s possible that the real reason trump s plan is so short is because he s perfectly happy with insurance companies filling in the small details instead of the government  we ve already been there and done that  it didn t work for the majority of americans before  and it won t now  either featured image via facebook
