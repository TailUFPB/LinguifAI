facebook is in the middle of a charm offensive targeted at conservatives  and is hosting a meeting between company founder ceo mark zuckerberg and conservative media figures like glenn beck and fox news host dana perino the meeting is happening just six months before a presidential election and in the first election where social media sites like facebook  and twitter  have become more influential than ever after accusations of anti conservative bias began to burn facebook last week  the social media giant quietly reached out to republican party leaders to douse the brush fire it contacted the republican national committee  whose chairman  reince priebus  had publicly demanded that facebook  answer for conservative censorship    and the national republican senatorial committee  which had blasted out a fundraising email lumping the ostensibly neutral tech company in with the  liberal media   according to a gop source  the national republican congressional committee  the gop s main house campaign arm  also heard from facebook  the source added the firestorm began after a story on the tech site gizmodo used an anonymous conservative who claimed to be a former facebook employee as the source for a story alleging that facebook was excluding conservative news sources from its trending topics area  a valuable source of traffic for news outlets soon after the piece came out  facebook denied the allegations and revealed its internal rules for what sites are featured in trending topics  but the damage has been done as they have done for years complaining about the  liberal media   conservatives are now targeting the  liberal bias  at facebook  certainly  zuckerberg appears to personally lean left  and most employees of a modern tech company are not going to be rush limbaugh style right wingers  but the allegation doesn t have much of a leg to stand on  conservative sites like fox news have been shown to trend on facebook what this ends up being is an influential media outlet who now feels they have to curry favor with the right wing  bending over backwards so that very loud conservatives don t attack them in the same manner they attack the new york times and msnbc then  as often happens in conservative media  when false stories and lies about the left surface  facebook will be obligated to trend them and send traffic and aid in the spread of false information   as long as they aren t attacked for  liberal bias  it s an excellent strategy for the right to get what it wants in yet another form of media featured image via flickr
