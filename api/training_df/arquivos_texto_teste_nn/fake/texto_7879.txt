two pasty white republican men decided that out of every problem that exists in their state of illinois  the biggest concern for lawmakers should be focusing on actively harming the lives of single mothers and children john d  cavaletto and  keith wheeler  filed a bill    to deny any form of state aid to a child  if that child does not have a  father s name  on their birth certificate  the proposed law makes an allowance for another family member to be substituted who will provide financial support for the child if a father can t or won t be listed a portion of the bill reads as below  provides that if the unmarried mother cannot or refuses to name the child s father  either a father must be conclusively established by dna evidence or  within  days after birth  another family member who will financially provide for the child must be named  in court  on the birth certificate  provides that absent dna evidence or a family member s name  a birth certificate will not be issued and the mother will be ineligible for financial aid from the state for support of the child  source  chicagoistso basically what republicans are trying to do  it seems  is completely abolish all welfare by either saying you don t need it  because you have a financial benefactor listed  or you don t get any because you don t have someone to pay for your child s needs  what the hell kind of logic is that this is not the first time republicans have attempted to actively sabotage the lives of women and children who are in the most desperate of need  last year  state rep  jeanne ives made remarks along a similar theme during a budget related debate  you need to have verifiable need  you better know who the daddy is and whether or not he can afford that child and whether or not the taxpayers should be funding that or if there s actual child support he can provide  source  chicagoista verifiable need   like not having a known father to ask for help  is this real  it s so comically absurd that it literally satirizes itself if there is a bright side to this insult to women and humanity  it s the fact that the bill will likely die a quiet and quick death in the house due to the democratic supermajority that illinois currently has to protect it from these evil people think about it this way  republicans would outlaw all contraception and abortion  even in cases of rape  a woman undergoes that heinous assault  and she can t get an abortion because republicans  love life too much  to let her make that choice on her own  after  months of getting no help with prenatal care or the hospital bill when she gives birth  republicans would immediately deny that child they  protected  from abortion any form of state assistance for the next  years pro life  indeed featured image via youtube
