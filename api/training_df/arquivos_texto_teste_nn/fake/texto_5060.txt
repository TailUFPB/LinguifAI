a prominent conservative  christian  is calling for women to be prohibited from having any leadership roles in our society whatsoever american family association radio host bryan fischer bellowed about the probability that a woman will be the leader of the united states during his show on friday as usual  fischer claimed that god specifically reserves leadership roles for men only  even in the home and used the bible as proof  that s always the pattern in the word of god  the kings were all males  when you had a departure from that with jezebel and athaliah  it was not a good thing  it did not work out well  leadership in the church is reserved for men  leadership in the home is reserved for men  in other words  in god s economy  he has designed leadership and authority in society and in the church and in the home to be exercised by men i think you could make a good case that leadership in culture  society  politically as well as in the home  that that is something in god s economy that s reserved for men  what if somebody had the courage to go on national tv  somebody of some kind of prominence or visibility  and said   look  i m going to vote for trump because he s a man  i don t believe that women should be entrusted with high political office    that s the position i happen to take  here s the video via right wing watch of course  fischer merely cherry picked two examples of female leadership in the bible while blatantly ignoring all the other examples of female leadership what follows is a list of female leaders in the bible as put together by religioustolerance org exodus    miriam  the daughter of aaron was a prophet and one of the triad of leaders of israel during the exodus from egypt judges      deborah  a prophet judge  headed the army of ancient israel  kings     chronicles   huldah  a prophet  verified the authenticity of the  book of the law of the lord given through moses    the book of deuteronomy  she triggered a religious renewal acts    philip the evangelist had four unmarried daughters who were prophets romans    paul refers to phoebe as a minister or deacon of the church at cenchrea the gospel of philip  was widely used among early christian congregations  it portrayed mary magdalene as the companion of jesus  in a position of very high authority within the early christian movement the gospel of mary described mary magdalene as a leader of jesus  disciples  she delivering a passionate sermon to the disciples after his resurrection  this raised their spirits and inspired them to start evangelizing the known world in short  fischer apparently has never actually read the bible  it s either that or he only reads the parts he agrees with and he is not the only conservative  christian  who wants to place women under the boot heel of men the christian right wing s favorite fake historian david barton called for stripping women of the right to vote two years ago  and a more recent example would be conservative  christian  pastor steven anderson who called for women to not only be banned from voting but also called for confining them solely to the home opinions like these are the reason why women need to band together and put a woman in the white house this november  conservatives need to be put in their place for their extremist views and that place is definitely not in a position of leadership  but in the fringes where they can never hurt anyone again featured image  screenshot
