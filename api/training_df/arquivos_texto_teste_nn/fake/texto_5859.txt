ever since the horrific act of senseless violence that was perpetuated on lgbt venue pulse nightclub in orlando  florida  the most hateful preachers imaginable have been coming out of the woodwork to praise the shooter s actions  one of those preachers is roger jiminez of sacramento  california s verity baptist church  he posted a  sermon  that spread like wildfire where he said  as a christian  we shouldn t be mourning the death of  sodomites  let me go ahead and start right there  as a christian  we shouldn t be sad or upset  thankfully  youtube has removed jiminez s rant due to violations of its hate speech policy  jiminez  however  is holding to the beliefs expressed in the sermon  and even goes so far as to suggest that the government should be killing people for being lgbt  firstly  he says that he does not have one iota of remorse for posting his hateful video  the bible does teach that homosexuality deserves the death penalty  leviticus   says that if a man lie with mankind like he does with a woman  both of them have committed an abomination and will surely be put to death  romans  says that they which commit such things are worthy of death  jiminez went on to add that  if people die who deserve to die  we don t need to be mourning that   perhaps the one redeeming quality this horrible excuse for a human being has is that he has no love lost for the shooter either  this gunman there that shot people up  the bible says he deserves to die  he died and we shouldn t be mourning his death  either  that s the whole point i was making  and it s been taken out of context  but then  he goes on to essentially incite violence while saying he s not inciting violence  all the while calling on the government to execute lgbtq people  i m not calling people to arms  and i m not telling people they should go do this  what i m saying is that if the government followed the laws of god  that s what they would be doing  and if the government did that  i d be fine with that  i would be fine  i would be totally okay with that  if the government did that  that s what they would do  if we lived in a righteous nation  in other words  this jiminez character is essentially calling for a queer holocaust  right here in america in   this is where the government really should draw the line  whether jiminez is calling people to arms or not  this is the sort of hate speech that causes situations like orlando s tragic massacre  this is literally giving deranged  hateful individuals permission to go out and kill people they deem worthy of death it s roger jiminez that the government needs to be doing something about  not lgbtq people watch the nauseating remarks below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
