proving once again that conservative  christianity  is a religion of pure hate   a clerk in west virginia decided it wasn t enough to process the marriage license of a newlywed lesbian couple  she also had to scream her anti gay religious beliefs at them samantha brookover and amanda abramovich went last week to get married  according to the charleston gazette mail  the couple had loved ones and cameras in tow the west virginia couple said debbie allen  the deputy clerk who processed their marriage license  gave them a biblical earful  they say allen huffed and puffed  slammed things around then yelled at them for two or three minutes about her views that what they were doing was wrong in her eyes and god s allow me to be blunt for a second  no one  but no one  gives a flying fuck about your views ms  allen  they are as abhorrent and ugly as your soul  period  got that  ok  let s move on this is the lie at the heart of the right s demands for  religious freedom   they don t just want the freedom to practice their religion  which they already have   they want the  freedom  to impose their religion on everyone around them  they literally feel persecuted because they can t persecute others without consequence to see this in action  pay attention to what allen says about her unwanted screed  i just told them my opinion   she told the paper   i just felt led to do that  i believe god was standing with me and that s just my religious belief  when people start to pressure gilmer county  where allen is employed  to fire or rebuke the clerk in even the mildest fashion  she is going to squeal about  christian persecution  and she ll be the next fox news warrior in the fight to defend christian values  that aren t actually under assault but at least she didn t try to deny them their marriage license  so that s a bit of progress  right  murika  featured image via thetab com
