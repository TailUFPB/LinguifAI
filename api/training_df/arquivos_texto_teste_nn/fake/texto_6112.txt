a group of about   christians planned to attend next week s reason rally in washington  d c   so they could hand out literature and about    in subway gift cards  the purpose was to show the atheists that would be there some so called  christian love   however  the d c  police have put a stop to that  saying they would have to get a separate permit  and stay on the other side of the national mall  because such a gathering constitutes a protest organizer ray comfort told christian newswire the following  in what is so often a cruel world  we tried to show a little kindness and it didn t work  so it now looks like we will be eating subway sandwiches for the next  years  oh  no  what to do  what to do  comfort will still be allowed to film the event  because his film crew is too small to need a permit  since the reason rally is free and open to the public  comfort is now encouraging christians to go as individuals  and not as a group  so they can still proselytize to the atheists there  that s their m o    force their religion down the throats of anyone who doesn t believe in any way possible while comfort can understand the perspective of the police they re trying to maintain peace there s a solid chance that there will be christians there who don t get it at all  and only see their so called  mission from god   to convert these heathens  for instance  eric hovind  writing on creation today  said  on june    we will be gathering in washington  d c  to share the love of christ with a group of people who practice the religion of selfianity  that s right  they self identify as  atheists  in order to become worshipers of themselves  oh  please  hovind is one of those that thinks atheists  and other non christians  are the root of what s wrong with the world  he won t be the only one there to think that way  either hovind calls his blog post  reason hits the reason rally    in a lame attempt to demonstrate that christianity is the only reason there is  he s one of those that will probably end up hounding the atheists that attend there is one good thing to come out of this  some readers of the friendly atheist were able to convince ray comfort to give those subway gift cards to the homeless  that there is true christian love   helping the downtrodden  they need to spend more time doing that  and less time trying to convert people to their religion and taking over the country featured image by brambmanu  licensed under cc by sa   via commons
