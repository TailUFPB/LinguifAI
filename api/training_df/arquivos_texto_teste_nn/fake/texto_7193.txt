in israel  dehumanizing palestinians and calling for their destruction has become the norm  only a few days after chief israeli sephardi rabbi yitzhak yosef said that non jews should not live in israel unless they  serve jews  another influential israeli racist has come out publicly  in this case to incite against palestinians and their supporters  transportation minister israel katz called for the  civil targeted killing of non violent civil rights leaders who call for the boycott  divestment  and sanctioning of israel until it conforms to international law here is what author richard silverstein had to say about katz s statement  made in hebrew  the phrase he used  sikul ezrahi memukad  derives from the euphemistic hebrew phrase for the targeted killing of a terrorist  the literal meaning is  targeted thwarting     but the added word  civil  makes it something different  katz is saying that we won t physically murder bds opponents  but we will do everything short of that  one may rightly ask what business a transportation minister has conducting targeted killings  physical or otherwise  against anyone   though everything in israel is in service to the national security state  has transportation fallen under that bailiwick as well  we are entering dangerous territory when an israeli cabinet minister engages in wordplay that verges on putting a bull s eye on the backs of non violent activists   if there are israel apologists out there who dismiss the significance of such rhetoric they are sadly mistaken   in this torrid political environment in which israeli leftists have become criminals and wounded palestinian youth may be summarily executed in the street   it is only too easy to forsee palestinian activists like barghouti  bds leader  having a bounty on their heads  in addition  bds activists this psychopath is inciting against are not just palestinian  they are from all over the world  including the united states  in fact  american activists are at the forefront of the bds movement  moreover  we want to keep in mind the life and death power israel has over the palestinian people  it has become the norm not only to incite against palestinians but to kill them in cold blood  only a few days ago  an injured palestinian who was incapacitated and lying on the ground was murdered by an israeli soldier  you can watch the video below   many israelis consider the soldier a hero and are calling for his release israel s life and death stranglehold over millions of palestinians makes statements like katz s even more dangerous because many israeli jews do not see palestinians as humans  after all  israelis were lounging in chairs on hilltops and cheering as thousands of civilians were being killed in gaza in the summer of   israeli politicians have a long history of frightening language against palestinians  whether it is israeli justice minister ayelet shaked s reference to palestinian children as snakes  or israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s continuous incitement  katz s statement is just the latest round of israeli politicians tripping over each other to dehumanize palestinians watch video here   featured image via video screenshot
