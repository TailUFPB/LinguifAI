it s not news to say that donald trump is a phony  he s neither a great businessman nor as wealthy as he says he is  he contradicts his own words far more often than he contradicts the words of his opponent so  who is the real donald trump  and does he believe a single word of what he says  well  we can t know that for sure  but what we do know is that in   trump was a hillary clinton supporter  in fact  he called her  fantastic  in a fox news  yes  fox news  interview  now  to be fair  he also said he was a fan of rudy giuliani and mitt romney  he also  despite not knowing much about him  called barack obama  very capable  even eight years ago  trump was asked whether he would ever run for president  he said he would probably never run because  you read this right   he s  too honest  here s the video that s wasn t the first or the last time trump praised the woman who s standing in his way of becoming dictator in chief  last month  clinton put out an ad showing trump heaping her with praise the ad features the words   donald trump reveals the truth about hillary clinton  and shows trump saying on fox news   hillary clinton  i think  is a terrific woman   in another clip  trump praises her and bill clinton  saying   i know her very well and i know her husband very well  and i like them both they are just really terrific people  the ad also quotes trump praising hillary clinton as a  smart  tough and a very nice person   and said   she really works hard  and i think she does a good job  source  timedoes it really matter what trump said about hillary clinton in the past  he can t even keep his story straight about what he said yesterday  the damage here is not that he s contradicting himself  his supporters really don t care about that  the damage here is that trump s supporters hate hillary clinton even more than they like trump  if we could somehow play this on a nonstop loop at walmart or wherever trump supporters congregate  we might see a rash of exploding heads featured image via video screen capture
