sarah palin did something entirely expected of her  yet so irrationally stupid that it is almost baffling following the arrest of her son for drunkenly beating his girlfriend and making threats with a semiautomatic weapon  she found a way to blame president obama at a trump rally  where nonsensical bullshit is accepted as fact without question by the vapid  racist buffoons that make up the billionaire s base  palin said that ptsd and obama were the true culprits in her son s woman brutalizing  ammosexual ways  i can talk personally about this  i guess it s kind of the elephant in the room  my son like so many others  they come back a bit different  they come back hardened  they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country  and that starts from the top  it s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder  if they have to question  if they re respected anymore  it starts from the top  the question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder  do you know what we go through  do you know what we re trying to do to secure america and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us  i can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some ptsd and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with   palin said   and it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them  track palin served with the alaska based  infantry division s  stryker brigade combat team for a single year in   while george w  bush was still president palin s nonsensical claim didn t sit well with veterans   or with cnn political commentator donna brazile  who put palin on blast wednesday  you have known me for a long time  so i m just gonna say it  she s a liar   brazile told anderson cooper   that s a damn lie   she pointed out that house republicans slashed    billion  with a  b   from president obama s requested budget for veterans  services  which included a   million reduction  for medical care   the sort of thing that would help veterans with ptsd  i care for all veterans   i am the daughter of a veteran  and to go out there and to insinuate that the president of the united states is trying to hurt veterans when in fact he is trying to put more resources so that we can give our young and old veterans the care we need  that s just a damn lie  you can say donna brazile said it  i approve this message  of course  should be held responsible for his own personal behavior   trump supporter jeffrey lord contended when asked if palin was right to blame obama   but we have been told time and time and time again that there is a serious problem within the va treating veterans  and i think that s the point she s trying to make   he did not explain how in the world blaming obama brought attention to any issues with the va  drink the water  jeff   brazile shot back   drink the water  watch brazile smack caribou barbie down below featured image via wikimedia commons
