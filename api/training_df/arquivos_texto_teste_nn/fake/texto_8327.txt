yesterday  republican presidential front runner donald trump got an unexpected question from a voter during a new hampshire town hall on cnn the man confronting trump was joseph manzoli  who described himself as a father with three daughters  manzoli asked trump what every self respecting parent in america should be asking themselves  what kind of role model would the next president be for my children  manzoli asked  i have three wonderful daughters at home  and i want nothing more for them than to look as their president as a role model  throughout the course of this campaign  you ve said some disparaging comments about women  about people from other countries  other religions  and about everybody who s disagreed with you  explain to me how i can look at my daughters and have them look up to president trump as a role model  you can see how trump answered below trump joked and asked if cnn had put manzoli up to asking such a question before trying to convince his audience that he had loads of respect for women and had employed a staggering number of female executives  he said  nobody has more respect for women than i do  thirty years ago  i had a woman building a major  major construction job in new york city  and that never happens  that just didn t happen    i have so many women executives  i have been great to women  and women have been great to me  they ve done a great job  trump clearly forgot to mention his infamous long standing  one sided feud with fox news anchor megyn kelly  his appalling comments about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  as well as his long history of misogynistic behavior toward women  he also failed to tell this concerned father that sexism is just as alive in the background of his campaign as it is in his interviews and speeches  according to a former staffer  trump s only paying his female staffers half of what his male employees are making for the same job  what a role model trump was just as insincere when he addressed his own comments about minorities like immigrants and muslims  in defending the extremely racist and offensive things he s said about immigrants  trump answered  i do bring up things that people don t want to bring up  i talk about immigration   stronger than anybody else  i talk about building a wall  if you look at new hampshire  you have a tremendous heroin problem  it s coming from the border  and then he had the nerve to claim that tons of people were  agreeing with  his proposal to ban all muslims from coming in the united states  when i brought up the muslim problem  you know  it s very interesting  i brought that problem up and all of a sudden  the world started going wild  and now the world is agreeing with me  we have to do something  there is a serious problem  if trump is going to be the next role model for our younger generations  america is in deep trouble  featured image from video screenshot
