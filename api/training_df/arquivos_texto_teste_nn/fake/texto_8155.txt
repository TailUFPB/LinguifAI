the only thing more irritating to a woman than a mansplainer is perhaps his more dangerous cousin  the gunsplainer twitterto address the horrible type of person  cosmopolitan teamed up with everytown for gun safety  a movement that aims to end gun violence  to form the campaign singled out to raise awareness and empower unmarried women about gun violence and the danger associated with firearms singledout orgthanks to this initiative  a humorous how to guide has been released that shows women how to deal with a man who repeatedly and condescendingly explains to a woman why she d be safer if she had a gun    also known as a  gunsplainer   here s the hilarious short film it almost seems insane that an adult would make some of these arguments  but the male actor s lines echo the exact arguments that have been used by the national rifle association and gun nuts all over america in the video  a gunsplainer named gary tries to pick up a woman named jessica in a bar  they get into a discussion about guns  and jessica reveals she is in the service  which only eggs gary on  before jessica can run away  gary has launched into full gunsplaining mode  putting the responsibility on victims to defend themselves with guns  he reveals that he takes his guns literally everywhere with him  because  these guns are the only things standing between us and tyranny   soon  he s opening his jacket to reveal an entire collection of guns hanging around his torso  all the while  he s using sexist pet names like  schnookums  and  lady soldier    which only repulses jessica even more toward the end  gary actually insists that hammers were the real threat to americans  his idiocy proves too much for jessica to stomach  so she walks away right after gary calls her a  pistol   in parting  she says  guess that s why i m going to have to shoot you down  not only is gary straight up irritating  but pretty much every argument he makes is wrong  it s actually been proven that guns don t keep women safer  according to a study  women  with access to firearms become homicide victims at significantly higher rates than men   women in america are also  times more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other high income countries  unfortunately  there are gunsplainers like gary all around us who are in denial of the facts and keeping america a dangerous place  hopefully with more awareness and initiatives like singled out  the truth will make it through featured image is a screenshot
