new e mails obtained by media outlets show that there was coordination between the chicago police department  the independent police review board  and the mayor rahm emanuel s office over video footage that shows chicago police officer jason van dyke shoot laquan mcdonald  times chicago activists and others have hammered the rahm administration over the delayed release of the video  mcdonald was shot to death in october    yet  the video of the shooting was not released until november     mcdonald was killed by the chicago police department during chicago s mayoral election  releasing the video would have been put the emanuel under national scrutiny  this has led many to believe that the mayor s office and the cpd were working in a collaborative effort to delay the release of the video to avoid being hurt politically in one e mail  attorney jeffrey j  neslund explained to city lawyers that the video is going to be very bad for the city  i submit the graphic dash cam video will have a powerful impact on any jury and the chicago community as a whole  this case will undoubtedly bring a microscope of national attention to the shooting itself as well as the city s pattern  practice and procedures in rubber stamping fatal police shootings of african americans as  justified   critics of emanuel and major media publications have called for rahm emanuel to resign the associated press reports that the e mails that were released shows that emanuel s aids were well aware that releasing the video would be politically explosive  one e mail in late july even showed that emanuel s aids were concerned that people that people were beginning to view the case as a cover up  as you might imagine  the timing and details discussed in the sun times article and growing interest in the mcdonald incident has not worked in our favor  and is helping to  stir the pot    emanuel aide vance henry wrote in another e mail  henry wrote in october  saying that officials would be  smart to act timely and strategically  in reference to mcdonald s death and another case where a chicago police officer killed a  year old woman named rekia boyd these e mails will not help the mayor s office convince people that the delay of the video was not politically motivated this alleged cover up is not the only  sin  that is  catching up to  emanuel  as rick perlstein describes  the sudden but well deserved fall of rahm emanuel  in the new yorker  emanuel s political career has been defined by his war against teachers  privatization schemes  and his efforts to make the democratic party unrecognizable from the republican party by fighting against  liberal theology   as he describes it featured image credit  daniel x  o neil via flickr  cc by
