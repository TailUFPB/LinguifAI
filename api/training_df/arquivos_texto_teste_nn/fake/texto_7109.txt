an internal memo leaked from donald trump s campaign to the national press shows that his cultish campaign team is not dealing well with the campaign s most recent round of negative press  the memo was leaked to the washington post from a republican operative in touch with trump s inner circle the memo  from senior trump adviser barry bennett  doesn t look good entitled  digging through the bull    bennett s memo urged trump campaign manager corey lewandowski   who was charged with battery last week for yanking a reporter   and others to ignore critics who have questioned whether trump s campaign for the republican presidential nomination has waned  america is sick of them  their idiotic attacks just remind voters why they hate the washington establishment   bennett wrote  citing tracking poll data favorable to trump  donald trump    bennett declared  as if he was scoring the past week   washington establishment media   by nature  most campaigns devolve into a bunker mentality  but this document reads more like a personal letter to donald trump to buck up after a disastrous week  rather than seriously citing any data or giving strategy advice to trump and his team  the memo follows the candidate s well worn pattern of attacking its detractors while pumping up the boss  it s more evidence of the trump campaign being more like a cult than an operation designed to elect a commander in chief trump stumbled badly over a key issue  abortion  this past week  he offered multiple positions on the issue  while also advocating for  punishment  for women who have the procedure   something that would happen if republicans get their wish in outlawing abortion  but also a topic more skilled republican politicians know how to avoid he s also in a bad place in wisconsin  polling behind senator ted cruz ahead of the primary there after being ahead of him by  percent a month ago in the most recent national polls  trump is on a path to be a disaster against both hillary clinton and bernie sanders  memos divorced from reality don t help that featured image via flickr
