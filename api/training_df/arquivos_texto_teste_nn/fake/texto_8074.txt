in a showdown with the u s  government  israel is demanding that its current aid package be drastically increased by an enormous margin  with the current aid agreement of   billion over ten years set to expire in   israel now wants that increased to   billion over the next ten years where is all this money going to come from  the u s  taxpayer of course  instead of using this money to support the poisonous water afflicting flint  michigan  we give billions away to a state that perpetuates the most protracted military occupation in modern history  committing countless of human rights violations against the palestinians what s insane is that american politicians haven t even paid attention to flint s water crisis  even though the lead poison in the water may have caused brain damage to thousands of american children who drank it  in a startling display of both disdain and stupidity  republican senator and presidential candidate marco rubio didn t even know what was happening in flint days after the crisis broke  he said  i d love to give you a better answer on it  it s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in michigan on these sorts of issues  rubio continued  saying that he s unable to give  a deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be  other than to tell you that in general i believe the federal government s role in some of these things  largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue  the comical yet sad aspect of all this is when the republican presidential candidates ignore flint  an american city filled with american poisoned children yet grovel to prove their loyalty to israel  a foreign country and  i must point out again  a terrible violator of palestinian human rights  the question is why would they grovel on a level that makes it embarrassing to watch as an american  the answer lies in what pro israel billionaires can do for you as a politician for example  sheldon edelson  the militantly pro israel billionaire  spent tens of millions of dollars supporting mitt romney against president obama in the previous presidential elections because he thought obama was soft when it came to israel  now  republican candidates are groveling for his support and money  marco rubio already has a  supporter in billionaire norman braman  he is rubio s largest campaign donor with an estimated    million  braman is staunchly pro israel  funding an israeli settlement in occupied palestine  settlements are illegal under international law and are in contradiction to u s  foreign policy in the region  if you listen to rubio s rhetoric on israel  he s religiously on board with israel s insanity so  when all is said and done  these signed  sealed  and delivered politicians who grovel to a foreign government must pay back the support they received during an election year  this comes in the form of robbing tax payers of billions of dollars and ignoring an urgent issue like the flint water crisis  in all likelihood  israel will get its billions and our cities and people will continue to be ignored watch video here featured image from wikimedia commons
