newly released surveillance video shows that a texas police officer lied when he arrested a young father in front of his two children  claiming the man pointed a gun at him twice the video  just released by khou  shows julian carmona s vehicle pulling into a parking space at a houston  texas convenience store  his two children were in the back seat of the vehicle the off duty officer who claims the man pointed a gun at him  identified as william wright of the houston police department  was driving his own personal vehicle at the time of the encounter in the first few moments of the video  carmona can be seen pulling in behind the officer s pickup truck  before parking his own vehicle carmona says he was in a hurry to get inside the store because he had to use the restroom  he admits that there was a gun in the pocket of the driver s side door carmona says that as he was getting out of the car  the gun somehow fell out of the car  i don t know if i hit it when i opened the door  or hit it with my foot everything just happened so fast   he told khou the video shows carmona opening the door to his vehicle  then bending over as if to pick something up off of the ground  he immediately turns back toward his own vehicle  apparently to return the fallen object to the car it s at this point that officer wright can be seen getting out of his pickup truck with his gun drawn on carmona  i put my hands up like   sir   i apologized right away   carmona said   sir  i apologize   because the first thing that come to my mind  i dropped a gun in front of an officer  without even knowing it  wright ordered carmona to the ground  placing the man in handcuffs as his children watch from the car at one point his young son can be seen getting out of the car as his father lay face down on the ground  he comes behind me  he starts handcuffing me and my son comes out of the truck  that was the last thing i wanted   he told khou in his official report  wright wrote that carmona pointed a gun at him twice  causing him to fear for his life he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon  a felony offense under texas law but the video clearly shows that the texas father never pointed a gun at officer wright it should not go without saying that carrying a gun in a vehicle with two children riding inside is a terrible  terrible idea from the video and carmona s own statements  it appears that he intended to leave the gun in the car with his children while he used the convenience store bathroom  that is something no parent should ever do be that as it may  it s not a crime in the state of texas carmona has a legal permit to carry a concealed weapon in an apparent effort to discredit him  police brought up a  charge which was dismissed through deferred adjudication what s more  video from inside the store shows that officer wright has stopped there to purchase beer  something officers in uniform are barred from doing under department policy regardless of how you feel about concealed carry laws  there s no justification for this kind of dishonesty and abuse of power on the part of police here s more on this story  including footage from the surveillance video  via khou featured image via video screen capture via khou
