a mother s heart wrenchingly true facebook post is going viral following yesterday s senate vote on gun legislation  despite her having written it just a few days after the orlando massacre  to put it bluntly  senate republicans have a bad habit of saying they re voting for law abiding gun owners  and for gun owners  rights  when they vote down gun legislation  they aren t  they re voting against children   even extremely young children  innocent children  american children  their children and grandchildren  politicians   take a look  this is your child  your children  your grandchildren  your great grand children and future generations to come  they will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions  they are barely  and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats  i do not know what will be harder for them  trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door  stacey wehrman feeley took a picture of her three year old daughter standing on top of their toilet  and she originally thought this was simply the hijinks of a young child and she wanted to show her husband  then her daughter told her what she was really doing  she was practicing for lockdown drills at her school an innocent three year old is practicing for lockdown drills  why should a three year old even have to worry about gun violence at her school  or anywhere else that prompted the long facebook post that contains the above paragraph  but that s not all she said  feeley also said  no one thinks gun control will be   crime control  but maybe  just maybe  it helps   or   or    who knows unless we try  why on earth are there not universal background checks  where is a universal registration database  why are high capacity magazines ever permitted to be sold to anyone other than direct to the military  is that really necessary to protect yourself or hunt for that matter  what about smart guns  where are they  that is the question  isn t it  republicans tend to parrot the nra s line that these measures won t stop criminals or terrorists  so we shouldn t enact them at all  democrats  too  do that to some degree  but not the way republicans do  cnn called yesterday s votes  tough election year politics   and mentioned longstanding disputes over what would be effective  sadly  they re correct when they say this was expected there s a reason the gop is called  the party of no   they d rather do nothing at all than piss off their handlers  all while manipulating and controlling language to sound like they re the good guys what feeley is saying isn t   i have the solution   it s  we need to start somewhere  and all these ideas have been on and off the table for years  why has nothing been done   and that s the question that all our politicians need to start answering  it s also a question that the nra needs to start answering  since they re among the loudest  more guns  voices out there the face that politicians particularly members of the party of no need to see isn t just the face of the victims in orlando  or the victims of shootings that already happened  it s the children who have to live in a world where they aren t safe anywhere  even at home  because congress patently refuses to even try read her full post below featured image via embedded facebook post
