for more than a century  countries around the world who found themselves rich in crude oil have held industrialized nations dependent on it hostage  since the first ford factory pushed out a production automobile  forever changing the way we travel  those countries with the means to fuel the internal combustion engine have prospered the united states has prided itself on being peacemakers since world war ii  but all too often we are held captive by what would otherwise be third world nations  often ruled by religious zealots and ruthless dictators  the first gulf war was the perfect example  kuwait  a long standing ally and major supplier of oil to the u s   was toppled within days by saddam hussein  who wanted control of their port and their oil  the united states had no choice but to step in  calling it a humanitarian mission and sending hussein back to baghdad  but stopping short of toppling his regime once the oil was secured  suddenly  it became far more important to put out oil field fires than it was to remove a ruthless murderer from power our government and our allies have to protect the interests of their people  in doing so we are stuck dealing with people like the saudis  who have a royal family with good intentions but are ultimately ruled by fundamentalist clerics at the local level  human rights violations far exceed what we would consider acceptable if they weren t such a large supplier of oil to nato countries  there are examples of the same kinds of abuses from all over the oil rich world  but the black gold tends to keep anyone from being held accountable so how could we make it possible to rid the world of tyranny and oppression bought and paid for with crude oil  by eliminating it from the equation  elon musk and tesla have just announced that we are one giant leap closer to that goal with the rollout of the model    a production model fully electric car that will be available by the end of  for a starting price of     with the power to go from zero to  in six seconds and more than  miles on a single charge  the tesla model  could realistically change the world once an idea becomes a reality  the next step is to make it affordable  while   may seem out of reach for many  it s certainly right in line with the    average selling price of a new car in america  from there the technology should migrate to other modes of transportation  the world is a changing place  and this major step in our socioeconomic evolution is a milestone we should all be ecstatic to see https   www facebook com cnn videos   featured image from jordan pix getty images
