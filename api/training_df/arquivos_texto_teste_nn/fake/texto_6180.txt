jimmy kimmel landed a rare  on air appearance from donald trump on the may  edition of his show  and wasted no part of the segment in grilling trump on everything  possibly the most interesting twist  however  came when kimmel read a question from bernie sanders  who will be tonight s guest on  jimmy kimmel live   the question  hillary clinton backed out of an agreement to debate me in california before the june  primary  are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country prior to the california primary  trump  ever the attention whore  replied with something surprisingly philanthropic  yes  i am  how much is he going to pay me  because if i debated him  we would have such high ratings and i think i should take that money and give it to some worthy charity  if he paid a nice sum for a charity i would love to do that  trump later said that whatever network picked it up could donate the money to charity for this debate the sanders campaign wasted absolutely no time in responding to trump on this game on  i look forward to debating donald trump in california before the june  primary   bernie sanders   berniesanders  may    would be a truly interesting debate  especially given that primary season isn t over yet  despite all expectations that both nominations would be locked up by now  there have already been so many monkey wrenches thrown into the primaries that one would think nobody would notice this one  however  one would be very wrong   this could throw the biggest monkey wrench yet into the works  depending on how the two candidates interacted with each other and the moderators in such a setting as of the time of this posting  there was no formal arrangement to actually hold this debate  and setting it up could be a logistical nightmare for the campaigns  that could change quickly  though  depending largely on whether the networks see any potential in it  honestly  they d be idiotic not to want to do it  it s hard to imagine that anybody in the country wouldn t want to see these two put their arguments side by side in a debate format as bernie said   game on  featured image via michael vadon gage skidmore flickr  images merged by rika christensen
