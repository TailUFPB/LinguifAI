after an anti lgbt witness demonstrated her ignorance of transgender people  a house democrat openly called her a bigot for the record during a house judiciary committee hearing on wednesday  gail heriot of the u s  human rights commission made it pretty clear that she probably should not be part of that body when she testified in writing that transgender people are living in a fantasy world where they are only pretending to be members of the opposite sex  if i believe that i am a russian princess  that doesn t make me a russian princess  even if my friends and acquaintances are willing to indulge my fantasy   heriot wrote   nor am i a great horned owl just because   as i have been told   i happen to share some personality traits with those feathered creatures  republicans are currently waging war against the federal government s public bathroom policy that protects transgender people from discrimination  which was a response to anti lgbt policies passed in red states such as north carolina where transgender people can only use the restroom that corresponds with the assigned gender on their birth certificate needless to say  heriot s testimony made people angry  including california rep  zoe lofgren  i ve got to say  i found this rather offensive   lofgren said upon reading the testimony   it says to me that the witness really doesn t know anything and probably has never met a transgender child who is going through  in almost every case  a very difficult experience finding themselves  indeed  being transgender is not a fantasy  it s reality and the struggle is very real  not only do transgender people have to deal with discovering who they are  which often includes therapy and and medical treatments  they have to deal with bigots who have don t understand what they are going through lofgren was so offended by heriot s testimony that she literally called her out for being a bigot for the record  i think you re a bigot  lady   lofgren told heriot after she attempted to interrupt   i think you are an ignorant bigot  iowa rep  steve king protested on behalf of his fellow bigot by accusing lofgren of being  out of order  but the california democrat shut him down  too  mr  chairman  it is my time  and i would just like to say that we allow witnesses to say offensive things  but i cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged   she said here s the video via youtube lofgren was right to call out heriot for the bullshit she wrote  as a member of the human rights commission  she should be on the front lines fighting for transgender people to enjoy those same human rights that the rest of us enjoy  instead  she s nothing more than a bigoted crony doing the bidding of transphobic republicans featured image via screenshot
