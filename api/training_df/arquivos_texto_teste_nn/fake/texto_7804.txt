republican front runner donald trump refused to distance himself from the ku klux klan and former kkk grand dragon david duke  who has endorsed him  trump s reasoning  he has to do research on them before rejecting their endorsement trump s statement comes as the anti defamation league called on him to reject endorsements from white supremacist groups   cnn s jake tapper asked trump if he was willing to disavow white supremacist endorsements  here is part of the interview below  trump said  i don t know anything about david duke  i don t know anything about what you are even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists  so  i don t know  i mean  did he endorse me or what s going on  because i know nothing about david duke  i know nothing about white supremacists  and so  you are asking me a question that i m supposed to be talking about people that i know nothing about  but tapper wouldn t let him off the hook so quickly  and pressed on  would you just say  unequivocally  you condemn them and you don t want their support  trump said  well  i have to look at the group  i mean  i don t know what group you re talking about  you wouldn t want me to condemn a group that i know nothing about  i d have to look  if you would send me a list of the groups  i will do research on them  and certainly i would disavow if i thought that there was something wrong  the ku klux klan   tapper interrupted  trump replied  you may have some groups in there that are totally fine  and it would be very unfair  so  give me a list of groups and i ll let you know  okay  i m just talking about david duke and the ku klux klan here   said tapper  honestly  i don t know david duke   trump remarked   i don t believe i ve ever met him  i m pretty sure i didn t meet him  and i just don t know anything about him  to claim ignorance is trump s way of dodging the question  trump knows that the majority of his supporters are racists and as is typical of a politician  you don t want to upset your supporters  thus  he s remained hush hush on the overwhelming support he s received from racists around the country trump has succeeded in normalizing bigotry and hatred for minorities  it s going to be up to each of us  should he become the republican nominee  to go out and vote against him in the general election  featured image via screen capture
