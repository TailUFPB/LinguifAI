mathew barzun  the united states ambassador to britain  just delivered some devastating analysis regarding british schoolchildren s views of the u s  barzun explained during a radio interview  that british children associate the u s  with gun violence to the point where the two ideas are virtually synonymous part of barzun s job is to go to schools where he talks to british youth about american culture  during his three years  he has spent serving as an ambassador  barzun has visited  schools  he laments the fact that he is routinely questioned by those he speaks with about topics such as gun violence  police brutality  and donald trump  i find it hard to explain our nation s idea of freedom   barzun says about american gun culture   how we won our freedom from this country with guns  and that  until a group of people decide to make this  their issue number one  two and three  we will remain stuck  it isn t hard to believe that a nation that has put in place effective measures to diminish gun violence and police brutality cannot understand how the u s cannot do the same thing it is a travesty that children around the world are growing up with this strong association between the u s  and gun violence  though i am not surprised by it  i agree that people need to step up and make gun violence a more important issue  that being said  i think it is also important that people stand up and demand an end to the corporate takeover of the united states government  until we can stop the nra from buying our elected leaders  such organizers will hold us hostage indefinitely featured image from carl court getty images
