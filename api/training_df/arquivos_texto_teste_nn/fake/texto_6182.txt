there are many good things in the bible   messages of love  charity  and goodwill toward others   and then there are the parts that should be ignored by even the most devout of christians  one such segment  in particular  is deuteronomy     which states that women should be forced to marry their rapists  even stipulating the amount that the rapist must pay for the woman or child he raped  it is likely this passage that led idaho  christian  keith strawn to drive his  year old daughter to missouri where he forced her to marry her rapist just like the bible says most fathers would seek justice if a  year old man raped and impregnated his  year old daughter  strawn will spend  days in jail after forcing her to marry aaron seaton  her rapist  the  biblical  marriage lasted  days  ultimately  strawn s daughter miscarried  but he had an interesting defense of his decision to marry her off to her rapist  reports in august   strawn took his  year old daughter and then  year old aaron seaton to missouri to consent in their marriage  seaton  now   pleaded guilty to a rape charge in april and is believed to have impregnated her  the victim miscarried seaton is serving a  year prison sentence  court records show strawn  harbored and protected  seaton by allowing him to live with his teenage daughter  if you get them pregnant then you marry them   strawn told  during the hearing strawn s attorney argued that he receive a six day jail sentence   less time than creationists believe it took god to create all of existence   and probation because his client s decision to marry off his daughter to her rapist  might have been a religious motivation   the victim  told me herself that her father asked her several times during the trip to missouri  and even the day of the marriage  if it was something she wanted to do  the attorney said  as though that mattered  i love my daughter very much and i would never do anything to intentionally harm her or put her in harm s way   strawn told the judge   i made the wrong decision  and i made that decision in duress  it is unclear if seaton paid strawn the required  silver pieces for his daughter  as is required by the bible  nor did he explain what he meant by  duress  strawn was originally charged with two counts of felony injury to a child and one of accessory to rape  as part of a plea agreement  two charges were dismissed and strawn agreed to plead guilty to a single count of felony injury to a child  the sentence was  days more than the prosecution s recommended  day sentence   which i am sure we can all agree is pretty awesome  though it could and should be longer watch a report on this horrific abuse below featured image via screengrab
