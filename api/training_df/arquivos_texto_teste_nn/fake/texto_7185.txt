donald trump s trainwreck interview with chris matthews wasn t just notable for his abhorrent views on abortion  but also because he took the time to remind people that he hasn t stopped being a horrible racist  too in a window into what a trump presidency might realistically look like  trump told matthews that he wasn t above playing favorites for his friends when he imposed his ban on muslims entering the united states  while the majority of muslims would be blocked regardless of circumstance  his  very rich muslim friends   i e  the ones he has business deals with  can get a pass  he trusts them   because they make him money  i have actually believe it or not  i have a lot of friends that are muslim and they call me   trump said  when asked about his plan by msnbc s chris matthews  the event s moderator   in most cases  they re very rich muslims  ok  matthews then asked trump if his rich muslim friends would be able enter the country under trump s muslim ban   they ll come in   trump said   you ll have exceptions  trump has often brought up his  muslim friends  who he routinely claims call him non stop to tell him what a great job he s doing at being xenophobic towards muslims  it might be tempting to claim that these muslims are fictions of his imagination  a cheap talking point to justify his reprehensible plans for very real muslims  however  it appears he really does have a few muslim friends  but not exactly salt of the earth types  he means autocrats in middle eastern nations  as the daily beast wrote about in late  there s one type of muslim trump really loves  the ones that make him big bucks  you see  if a muslim can show trump the money  then all those concerns he has with muslims go right out the window of his private jet as he jets off to the gulf to cash in for example  trump loves hussain sajwani  head of the dubai luxury real estate company damac properties  trump has called the muslim sajwani a  good friend  and a  great man   among other accolades  and in may   the donald even flew off to dubai to spend time with his muslim friend as they announced the massive real estate project they were teaming up to create in the united arab emirates trump  of course  has no qualms with working with muslims if they can make his bank account grow  suddenly  the people whose faith he thinks is hellbent on destroying america  aren t so bad  this duality makes his bigotry that much worse   he s really not that committed to it  like any good hate monger  trump scapegoats muslims to rile up his deeply anti muslim base  it s led to vicious hate crimes against innocent muslim americans  including assaults and arson  it s also led to trump s surge in the polls  but underlying the smears and falsehoods  is a calculated stab at winning an election via exploitation of fear and hate so of course he would let his  very rich muslim friends  in  his islamophobia isn t personal  it s business featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
