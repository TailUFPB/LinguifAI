on tuesday  the senate and house of representatives voted on bills to combat the zika virus  of course  as usual  it turned into an  us against obama  fight  however  one republican was super pissed off about it and slammed his own party for playing games with people s health  senator marco rubio the zika virus is a huge threat for the united states  but congress hadn t bothered to address it until this week  the illness is passed by mosquitos and if it infects a pregnant woman it could cause the fetus to develop severe abnormalities  president obama has asked congress to allocate    billion to fight the virus  the house of representatives did what they always do and gave the president a fraction of what he asked for     million the house s refusal to fully fund the bill really  really pissed marco rubio off and he blasted them  as well as senate republicans  during his speech  i support fully funding the requests made  people say the president s request  fine  it came from the white house  but it s really the scientists  requests  the doctors  requests  the public health sector s requests for how to address this issue  oh shit  rubio said something has been backed by science  he must have forgotten how much his republican colleagues hate science the senator went on to say that  people have already been infected in florida  puerto rico is being ravaged by it and the senate needs to take it seriously  why take the chance that at some point this summer we could have a significant and serious outbreak in the united states of america  and everybody here is going to be back in their home state doing their campaign stuff or whatever you re doing this summer  and you re going to have to come back here and either deal with it and explain to people why  when doctors and medical experts were warning us that this was a significant risk  we decided to lowball it   again  little marco seems to have forgotten who he is speaking to  republicans do not care if something will hurt the people  hello government shutdown of     the only thing they care about is the fact that the obama administration asked for the funding  the gop congress has one mode  obstruct  that s it  that is basically what they do from the beginning of their terms to the end of their terms  hell  they refuse to even hold supreme court nomination hearings because they are politicking so hard finally  rubio called out the house for their dangerously underfunded bill  why are we taking this chance  it makes absolutely no sense  i would also say that while i am happy that today  hopefully  the senate is about to take action on this issue  i m concerned about what i hear coming from the house their funding measure isn t even    billion  it s   million  quite frankly  that s just not going to cut it  the senate ended up passing a    billion package to combat zika but that is not enough  it should have been fully funded  unfortunately  the republican congress does not take the health of americans seriously  if there happens to be a huge breakout  i guarantee we will hear these very same members of the gop blame it on obama  because if there is one thing stronger than their obstructionism  it is their obama derangement syndrome it was nice to see marco rubio actually show up for work for once and do his job  maybe if he d done that more often he wouldn t be leaving the senate at the end of his term with his tail between his legs watch his full speech below featured image via video screenshot
