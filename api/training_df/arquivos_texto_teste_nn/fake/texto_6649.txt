it s now official  carly fiorina needs help  i m talking real  pharmaceutical grade  billed at   an hour professional help  because she s seeing things that are not there again  this is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those planned parenthood videos  which were so obviously fake that not even other republicans talk about them anymore megyn kelly invited fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in god s name she agreed to be  of all people  ted cruz s vice presidential candidate  he s the only person that republicans genuinely hate more than trump  yet she thought this was a good idea  so  what s the deal kelly asked fiorina why she chose cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates  fiorina immediately insisted that her math  this is the imaginary stuff now  says that ted cruz can win  she even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he  would be the gop nominee  here s some non carly math  cruz has  delegates  he needs   to win  there are  still available  even if he won  percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly  delegates short  it s mathematically impossible for ted cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary  yet she still said she believes ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see carly fiorina actually said that the majority of republicans do not want trump to win  to which megyn kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment  trump has beaten cruz by up to  percent in the popular vote in some states recently  apparently that isn t a majority anymore kelly then went on to point out that even though trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party  there is no alternative  cruz is still in it  but nobody is uniting behind him to stop trump  of course  fiorina responded by telling kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to cruz   which again only she can see carly either sees things that do not actually exist  or she intentionally lies  i don t really know which is worse  but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president it s  all over again  we have another mentally flawed person in the vp seat for republicans   except this time  it s so bad she won t even get to the general election  carly fiorina should think long and hard about that  sarah palin made it closer to the vice presidency than she ever will  that has to sting watch carly fiorina prove how she can fail even in the most friendly of surroundings below featuerd image via video screen capture
