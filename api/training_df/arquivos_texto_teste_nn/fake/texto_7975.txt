during a segment of last week tonight  john oliver discussed the issue of voter disenfranchisement  republicans have everything to gain by making it harder to vote one of the hot button issues of the day is republicans  creation of laws that force people to have valid identification when they vote  the genius behind the plan is that it seems so innocent to require people to show identification in order to vote  however  it has been shown that it can be far harder to have all the valid identification that some states are now requiring than one might think  oliver notes how hard it can be just to get an id due to the times that id issuing offices are closed  and in some parts of the country  the offices that issue ids are hardly ever open  in   a study found that in wisconsin  alabama and mississippi  fewer than half of all id issuing offices in the state are open five days a week  and in sauk city  wisconsin the id office is only open on the fifth wednesday of every month   and only four months in  even have five wednesdays   oliver says those republicans wish to see vote the least are minority voters  who traditionally back democratic candidates  that s why during the segment  john oliver points out how much these anti democratic schemes disproportionately hurt black and latino voters  studies have shown these restrictions tend to disproportionately impact african american and latino voters  in texas  for instance  experts found that african american voters were nearly twice as likely to lack voter id  and latinos were nearly two and a half times as likely  it s just one of those things that white people seem to be more likely to have  like a sunburn or an oscar nomination   says oliver the republican party is dying due to demographic and ideological changes  instead of changing their party s platform  they would rather sink to these pathetic voter disenfranchisement schemes you can watch the segment below featured image from video screenshot
