ron reagan  the late president reagan s son  is understandably indignant over any idea at all that donald trump is anything like his father  in fact  he s angry that the gop even nominated trump   this is not his father s party at all  to make matters worse  mike pence compared trump s foreign policy ideas to reagan  and that was just too much for young ron reagan he let loose on pence  trump  the entire campaign  and the gop in an interview on msnbc  he first addressed pence s ridiculous assertion that trump s foreign policy is anything like ronald reagan s  campaign s  broad shouldered approach   one thing he left out  i suppose  is that my father wasn t pathological  my father would ve been humiliated and embarrassed by what has happened to his party  the republican party  and would be humiliated and embarrassed that they have nominated somebody like donald trump to be president of the united states  as bad as st  ronnie was  at least he carried some credibility  trump has no credibility   how can he when every word out of his mouth is a lie  and when he changes his opinions as often as anyone with a shred of personal hygiene changes their underwear  ron touched on that  too  when he launched into his full scale attack  trump should not be in this race  he s an absurdity  he s a travesty  and that is the reality here  i know it s difficult for journalists to deal with this  we re used to covering presidential races where we grant credibility to both sides  but that is not the case this time donald trump is not   i had the dubious pleasure of reading the transcript of his speech today  it s full of the usual empty jargon  this is a man who knows nothing about the world and cannot be president of the united states  ron went on by saying that a president trump will be a national emergency because of his severe inexperience with the world  and his inability to learn  well  pretty much anything  watch his full comments below  via msnbc trump s foreign policy ideas are so insane that republican foreign policy experts are saying his plans will badly undermine the u s    something trump himself will never acknowledge  for instance  he wants to beat china into submission on trade  but his ideas are more likely to  wreck our country s credibility  economy  and leadership in very short order   particularly in asia that s the opposite of what trump keeps peddling  but that s where ron s statements come into play  trump is an absurdity  a carnival sideshow  or a silly  outlandish cartoon  despite the gop s attempts to turn him into a serious candidate  he s continued down his own path and virtually cost himself the election already  and it s only august st  reagan might be responsible for a lot of our current ills  but even he could actually run things  trump can t even run his own businesses  let alone mount a serious campaign for president  ron is right   he shouldn t even be in the race featured image via screen capture from embedded video
