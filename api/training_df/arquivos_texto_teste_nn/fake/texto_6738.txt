as the democratic primary heats up heading into yet another  super tuesday   where pennsylvania  rhode island  maryland  delaware and connecticut will decide who to support for the  presidential election  questions  and hostilities  are flaring up yet again over the designation of superdelegates questions remain whether or not hillary clinton will be able to amass the   delegates needed to secure a nomination without the support of superdelegates  clinton s campaign says they are not worried about falling short  but jane sanders  wife of presidential candidate bernie sanders  thinks otherwise  however  after a crushing blow in new york  team sanders has had to come up with a new strategy if they hope to win the nomination   that strategy  according to reports  is to persuade superdelegates to back him  a move the clinton campaign has cried foul on but in all  it really doesn t matter one way or another  what many people may not know is the superdelegate system  since its introduction in the  election  has never determined who the democratic nominee is that s right  superdelegates have never been responsible for putting walter mondale  michael dukakis  bill clinton  al gore  john kerry or barack obama on the national stage for the general election  in   the primary showdown between barack obama and hillary clinton was even closer than it is now  and still superdelegates weren t responsible for obama s win while appearing on fox news with maria bartiromo  debbie wasserman schultz  head of the dnc and a congresswoman from florida  reminded audiences of this crucial fact  as hostility intensifies within the party politifact decided to fact check this claim  using information and second opinions from a multitude of political scientists  and concluded that wasserman schultz is right  with one little detail left out   and gave the rating as  mostly true   writing the first election where democrats used superdelegates was in   where they helped mondale secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention  it s not clear that they were the  determining  factor  some say mondale would have won without them since that time  a democrat has won the nomination early enough where the superdelegates haven t mattered what that means is the elections between two candidates  or more  in the democratic primary have never been so close that superdelegates were needed to break the  tie  or push one candidate over the edge to victory  by the time the conventions have rolled around  it s been clear who the people  and pledged delegates  have picked only mondale got help with superdelegates  but sources differ on whether they determined his win essentially  the superdelegates have been a symbolic vote by those within the democratic ranks as to see which direction they want the party to head in  but why should we have them  then  according to the wasserman schultz  their purpose is to make sure that party activists who want to be delegates to the convention don t have to run against much better known and well established people at the district level  so whether or not you love them or hate them  just remember they have never been responsible for nominating the candidate you love or hate  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
