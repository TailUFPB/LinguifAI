on the heels of the mass shooting at pulse nightclub in orlando  florida  the right wing is spinning a false narrative referring to the area where the shooting took place as a  gun free zone  we can dispel that myth with the simple truth  if it had truly been a  gun free zone  as the right wing claims  then  people would still be alive  more than  others would not have been injured by bullets that came from one or more guns  the simple fact that more than  people were shot by a lone gunman is proof that the zone in and around pulse was not  gun free  the fact of the matter is that we can never really have a  gun free zone  unless some kind of enforcement exists to make sure that guns are kept out  omar mateen managed to bring in a handgun and an assault rifle  plus  other devices   the nature of which are unknown at this time according to the los angeles times mateen purchased both of the guns he took with him legally in the state of florida  both of the guns were purchased within the last week  these purchases were allowed  in spite of the fact that mateen had been on the fbi terrorist watch list the law center to prevent gun violence awards the state of florida an f grade for its disturbingly lax gun laws which clearly fail to protect the public here s a list of some of the problems with the state s gun laws as a result of the state s failure to pass sane gun control legislation the number of gun homicides in florida has been rising steadily for the right wing to pretend that the pulse orlando mass shooting occurred because of a gun free zone  rather than because state lawmakers have failed to take measures to protect the public from violent  dangerous people with guns is beyond pathetic it s way past time for florida republicans to act to protect the people of their state by passing reasonable gun control policies image credit  mandel ngan afp getty
