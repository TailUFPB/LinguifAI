cnn host fareed zakaria made a pretty damning point about donald trump s extremism on monday night zakaria dedicated a few minutes to discuss the rise of donald trump in the republican party  pointing out that his extremist rise is no different than the rise of islamic extremists in the middle east  a main cause of the rise of extremism in the world of islam has been the cowardice of muslim moderates who  for decades  chose not to condemn bad ideas and ugly rhetoric   zakaria said  clearly referencing the fact that moderate republicans here at home allowed conservative extremism  or christian sharia law  to fester within the party until it turned into a full blown infection that threatens to kill the party and ruin america  fearing that they would be seen simply as ideological weaklings  they avoided confronting the cancer in plain sight  it is now clear that a similar dynamic has been at play in the world of conservatism   he continued zakaria then praised mitt romeny for condemning trump  but criticized him for taking too long to do so and for gratefully accepting trump s endorsement in  even though he was still the face of the birther movement  what is different about the conservative movement   zakaria says  is that  some of its mainstream members have embraced the rhetoric and tactics of the extremes  he then noted that it was newt gingrich who began this shift in the  by circulating a memo calling for republicans to smear democrats with words such as  failure  pathetic  disgrace  and incompetent   all of which have been used by trump during this current election zaharia then destroyed the republican notion that president obama is at fault for trump s rise within the gop and offered a better explanation  republicans have fed the country ideas  decline  betrayal  and treason  they have encouraged the forces of anti intellectualism  obstructionism  and populism  they have flirted with bigotry and racism  trump merely chose to unashamedly to embrace all of it  saying plainly what they were hinting at for years  in doing so  he hit the jackpot  the problem is not that republican leaders should have begun to condemn trump last year  it is that they should have condemned the ideas and tactics that led to his rise when they began to flourish in the last century  here s the video via youtube in other words  moderate republicans should apologize for waiting so long to call out the extremism within their own party and now it s just a question of whether this extremism can be defeated before it is too late featured image via video screen capture
