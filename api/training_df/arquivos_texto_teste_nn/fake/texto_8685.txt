if there s one quality republican voters are looking for in a candidate  it s being a christian  you don t have to know much about foreign policy  or domestic issues  or for that matter  the constitution  but if you say you re a christian  well  that s your golden ticket into the hearts of gop voters everywhere  knowing this fact  for the past several months republican frontrunner donald trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a christian  how much he loves the bible  and even that it s his  favorite book  unfortunately for trump  his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great christian who follows the bible is all crumbling down  this was incredibly evident at a campaign event at liberty university in lynchburg  virginia monday morning in front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their bible verses  trump says  we re going to protect christianity  i can say that  i don t have to be politically correct two corinthians     that s the whole ballgame  he then goes on to call liberty university  liberty college  and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say  because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the bible trump is referring to is second corinthians  not  two corinthians   however  if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd  but don t really know what you re talking about  it s going to read  two corinthians  the verse he s referring to is  now the lord is the spirit  and where the spirit of the lord is  there is freedom   which does indeed sound like the perfect republican slogan to try to pander to  freedom  loving  christians  everywhere  however  too bad trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about and as fellow candidate marco rubio s faith outreach director said  so honestly  two  corinthians    it won t matter  nothing seems to matter   eric teetsel   ericteetsel  january    and it likely won t watch the moment for yourself here          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt  two  corinthians  right  two  corinthians    that s the whole ballgame  posted by buzzfeed politics on monday  january    featured image  facebook
