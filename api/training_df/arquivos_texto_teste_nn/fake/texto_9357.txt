if it wasn t for people like vietnam veteran william e  staehle  who made the decision to publicly defend the character of roy moore in an op ed  the only picture the american people might have of the former judge  is the one painted by the leftist media and the rabid democrat party  that struggles to identify a single legitimate reason for alabama voters to  support their candidate doug jones i served with roy moore in vietnam in    where i knew him to be an altogether honorable  decent  respectable  and patriotic commander and soldier  i have had no contact with him since he and i were captains and company commanders in the  military police battalion  stationed at the base camp called camp land  just west of danang i knew him well in my first four months in country before i was re assigned within the battalion to another location  during that time  i grew to admire him i am bill staehle  residing in asbury park  new jersey  i am an attorney  practicing law continuously for  years  i began my career as an assistant united states attorney  and for the past  years  i have been the managing trial lawyer for the staff counsel office of a major insurance company allow me to relate to you one experience involving roy that impressed me while in vietnam  there came a time when another officer invited roy and me to go with him into town after duty hours for a couple of beers  that officer had just returned from an assignment in quang tri province north of danang  and we were interested to learn of his experiences i had not met him before  and i don t believe roy had either  on other occasions with other officers  we would go to the officers  club at the air force base  but on this occasion  he told us he knew of another place in town when we arrived at the place and went inside  it was clear to roy and me that he had taken us to a brothel  that officer appeared to know people there  as he was greeted by one or two young women in provocative attire the place was plush  there were other american servicemen there  alcohol was being served  there were plenty of very attractive young women clearly eager for an intimate time in less time than it took any of the women to approach us  roy turned to me and said words to this effect   we shouldn t be here  i am leaving  we told the officer who had brought us that we wanted to leave  he told us to take his jeep and that he could get a ride back later  which he did  roy and i drove back to camp together that evening  if i didn t know it before  i knew then that with roy moore i was in the company of a man of great self control  discipline  honor  and integrity  while there were other actions by roy that reinforced my belief in him  that was the most telling i reject what are obvious  politically motivated allegations against roy of inappropriate dating behavior  what i saw  felt and knew about him in vietnam stands in stark contrast to those allegations i sincerely doubt that roy s character had changed fundamentally and dramatically in a few short years later  he deserves  in my view  to be heard on the issues that are important to the people of alabama and our country roy was a soldier for whom i was willing to put my life on the line in vietnam if the occasion ever arose  fortunately  it did not i was prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with him then  and i am proud to stand by roy now   william e  staehle  asbury park  new jerseyvia  yellow hammer
