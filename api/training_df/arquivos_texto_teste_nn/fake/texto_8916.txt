it s no secret that senator john mccain hates ted cruz  although he has tried to hide it by repeatedly calling the republican presidential candidate a  friend   it s hard to look past the time he called him a  wacko bird  he has also been very vocal about his disdain for cruz s government shutdown tactics and in  he said that he basically disagrees with the candidate s entire platform  with all of this in mind  it was really no surprise when mccain added his opinion to the ted cruz citizenship controversy by now  you have probably all heard about donald trump questioning whether or not ted cruz was qualified to be president because he was born in canada  the constitution says that only a  natural born  citizen can sit behind the desk in the oval office  and the gop front runner implied that he didn t know if cruz was a legal candidate during an interview on wednesday on phoenix radio station  kfyi s chris merill show  john mccain said  he didn t know  if ted cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in canada  i know that came up in my race because i was born in panama  but i was born in the canal zone which is a territory  barry goldwater was born in arizona when it was territory when he ran in    asked if the supreme court might have to weigh in on the  natural born citizen  issue  mccain said   it may be  that may be the case  it is likely that john mccain doesn t really question whether or not cruz is eligible to be president  instead it seems as though he was trolling the senator a little bit  but if he does actually question his right to run  he may be trying to get the party to disqualify the tea party maniac although mccain has made some pretty stupid political decisions in the past  cough  sarah palin cough   he is basically a moderate republican and not as loony as the teabillies who have hijacked his party  that means he knows that even though the constitution does not specifically define  natural born citizen   the consensus is that if a person is born to american parents  even in a foreign country  they are  natural born  what s really funny about this whole non scandal is that we are seeing the republican party target their own candidate in the same way many attacked president obama   and he was actually born in the united states oh the irony featured image via salon
