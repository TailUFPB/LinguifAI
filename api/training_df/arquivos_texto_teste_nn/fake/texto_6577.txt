what would you do if you had a known video voyeur come up to you  well  candice spivey of jacksonville  florida just laid a verbal smack down on one guy named jeffrey polizzi when he forgot he had approached her before  she took her own phone out  called him out on video and then proceeded to chase him right out of the yulee  florida target spivey wrote in a faceboo  post  when he approached me yesterday he did not remember who i was  until i called him out on it in this video  adding  he starts out his conversation with the same punch line he uses here in the very beginning of this video saying   hey there i don t mean to bother you but i just bought this maxi dress for my wife at ross and i was kinda worried about the sheerness of it  spivey explains what happened the first time she got approached by polizzi  whiles he s asking these questions he s filming you with his cell phone  and i knew he was by the way he was holding his phone  i had this feeling there was way more to what he was doing than just asking questions  it was very routine for him like he s been doing this for a long time  so i went immediately to the front and reported him  they called the cops and he was banned from that publix  it was not illegal what he was doing  when spivey was approached by polizzi again in target  she sprung into action  she confronted him  and as she was chasing him  shouted for someone to call the police  unfortunately  he s still out there  so spivey asks that if you run into him to contact the nassau county sheriff s office  who is currently looking for possible victims according to the daily mail  police confirmed polizzi has previously been charged with video voyeurism and issued an appeal last week for any other potential victims to come forward since then  scores of women have complained that they were approached by the man in similar scenarios  the biggest thing spivey wanted out of this video and confrontation was to make sure this slimeball s face gets out there to the public to warn them  it s unbelievable  yet believable  that a man like this is free to walk around and not be taken into custody with several victims claiming it was him let s hope he gets caught soon by more than just spivey  but by the police watch the confrontation here featured image via video screen capture
