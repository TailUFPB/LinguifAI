while we re on the subject of lying to the fbi  when will hillary clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our secretary of state   former national security adviser michael flynn admitted friday to making false statements to the fbi  entering the first guilty plea in special counsel robert mueller s russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators a source close to flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty  rather than endure a drawn out court battle as part of the deal  flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top trump transition officials though the individuals are not named  court documents show flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including russia over a united nations vote   discussions tied to one of flynn s false statements the documents also say flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in december to ask what to communicate to the russian ambassador about sanctions  that official and flynn discussed how they didn t want russia to  escalate the situation   something flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call according to the plea deal  flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully  truthfully  completely and forthrightly  with the probe  with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed  flynn  a retired army lieutenant general  becomes the first trump ex white house official charged in the special counsel probe his tenure at the white house was brief   he was fired for similar conduct  pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the russians   and flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for turkey and other issues  the fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation friday that flynn was cooperating and offering information to mueller s team as for the past discussions between flynn and transition officials  it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to  but a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of trump transition activities told fox news that then president elect trump directed flynn during that period to contact the russians   while also directing him and his team to contact  other countries  the transition team felt that the obama white house had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum   the former official told fox news in a statement  white house lawyer ty cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than flynn  nbc news tweeted cobb s statement today  michael flynn  a former national security advisor at the white house for  days during the trump administration  and a former obama administration official  entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the fbi  the false statements involved mirror the false statements to white house officials which resulted in his resignation in february of this year  nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than mr  flynn  the conclusion of this phase of the special counsel s work demonstrates again that the special counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion  breaking  president trump s personal attorney releases statement after flynn plea  nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than mr  flynn   pic twitter com   nbc news   nbcnews  december    citizen journalist jack prosobiec asked a very good question about the tactics that were used to gain access to trump administration officials by the obama regime michael flynn charges come after he was illegally wiretapped and unmasked by the obama administration and susan ricewhen are those charges coming   jack posobiec     jackposobiec  december    judicial watch president tom fitton and aclj president jay sekulow lay out the case against barack obama officials and the felonies they committed when they leaked and improperly disseminate classified information and unmask members of the trump transition team  jay sekulow explains to sean hannity  that   the concern is the intelligence apparatus in the united states has rules  that they have to follow  like every other agency  and it appears that in the waning days  or maybe the last year of the former administration  they viewed those laws as advisory opinions and not law  when the unmasking allegations first surfaced  senator rand paul  r ky  had plenty to say about the unmasking of michael flynn on march     george stephanopolis asked senator rand paul about his thoughts on the unmasking of michael flynn  senator paul suggested that the person responsible for unmasking general flynn should be in jail  paul went on to say that you cannot allow this unmasking to take place   or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed  here s an excerpt from their conversation published by politico stephanopoulos  finally  sir  you re also a member of the senate foreign relations committee  we see the president standing by that claim about president obama  it s caused a rift now with british intelligence over the weekend  how big a problem is this for the president s credibility  how does he fix it paul  i think that we know one thing for sure  that the obama administration did spy on flynn  now  whether it was direct or indirect  somebody was reading and taking   a transcript of his phone calls and then they released it it is very  very important that whoever released that go to jail  because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to the new york times there can only be a certain handful of people who did that  i would bring them all in  they would have to take lie detector tests  and i would say  including the political people  because some political people knew about this as well but we need to get to the bottom of who is releasing these highly classified conversations  and if the president was surveilled  he probably wasn t the target  i don t know that he was or wasn t  but if he was  they probably targeted someone in a foreign government  but then they listened to the conversation with americans stephanopoulos  you don t believe president obama ordered an illegal wiretap of president trump paul  well  what happens is it s different than that  we target foreigners all the time  but they talk to americans  they talk to the president  they talk to the national security advisers  and they re supposed to be masked but there was something alarming the other day  general hayden admitted that people all the way down to some of the lowest analysts can unmask who the american is  so  someone unmasked general flynn and they re a low level analyst  we need to be looking at their computer and find out if they unmasked that conversation and if they spoke with the new york times you have got to put those people in jail  because you cannot allow this to happen  or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed this is a huge  huge problem  bigger than anything else that s being discussed is the fact that private conversations from the intelligence community s perspective are being leaked to the press  that s not like a leak that says  oh  the president watches tv in his bathrobe  this is important to national security  you can t let it happen rand paul was asked again about the unmasking of michael flynn on msnbc s morning joe show  paul told the leftist hosts backdoor searches are illegal and that they could be politicized  paul said that susan rice should be placed under subpoena and she should be asked   did you talk to the president about this and did president obama know about this     paul went on to say that the susan rice  unmasking  was a witch hunt started by the obama administration because of sour grapes on the way  out the door  watch  starting at the   mark
