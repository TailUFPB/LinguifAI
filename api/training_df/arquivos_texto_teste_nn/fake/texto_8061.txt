republican front runner donald trump loves to tell americans how great he is at just about anything   but one thing he ll never brag about is how good he is at making himself look like a complete idiot trump displayed this not so hidden talent perfectly on monday  when he likely misinterpreted a reporter s question about children born of immigrants  that or the candidate has flip flopped on one of his policies again  the question was asked during a south carolina press conference  and the reporter opened by mentioning one of trump s gop rivals  fellow candidate jeb bush  the reporter began   you have accused jeb bush of being weak on immigration trump  possessing less manners than a toddler  interrupted the reporter and called bush  weak  period  the reporter continued  referring to obama s  deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  initiative  which protects younger illegal immigrants from deployment  there are over   young people known as dreamers who have deferred action given to them trump cut the reporter off once again  telling the audience that obama s executive action on the matter was  great    a surprising response considering how hateful the gop candidate has been to immigrants when the reporter asked trump what dreamers could expect under his presidency  trump s response got even more bizarre   and it started to look like he didn t understand the reporter s question at all  never one to admit a mistake  trump boldly launched into a puzzling rant about  dreamers    although only he knows what he meant by that  he said  i want dreamers to come from this country  you mentioned dreamers  i want dreamers to come from the united states  i want the people in the united states that have children  i want them to have dreams also  you can watch the baffling footage below  via msnbc although trump does have quite a history of changing his views on policies  it s probably safe to say that he was just too stupid to understand what the reporter was really asking him  considering all the racist  offensive things that trump has said about illegal immigrants over the past several months  it s not likely that he had a change of heart   he s just dumb  featured image from video screen capture
