the democratic party is poised to have a convention filled with powerhouse speakers that will dwarf the lineup of has beens the gop deployed the republican national convention had unemployed actor scott baio and desperate republicans who actually decided to show up  the democratic party will have new jersey senator cory booker  vermont senator bernie sanders and they will have massachusetts senator elizabeth warren in a spot that could very well set her up as hillary clinton s successor elizabeth warren has successfully gotten under the thin skin of donald trump for months  every time he attacks her on twitter she responds by destroying him in recognition of her efforts and her status as a defender of the poor and middle class in america against corporate exploitation  warren has been chosen to deliver the keynote address at the dnc this week warren will be only the third woman to deliver the keynote speech  the first being rep  barbara jordan in   followed by beloved former texas governor and women s rights crusader ann richards in   and while neither of those two women would go on to run for president  elizabeth warren stands on the cusp of history in the making  hillary clinton looks to become the first female president in american history  if she wins and serves with distinction  it could pave the way for warren s rise as her successor in  should she be willing to take on the mantle as you may recall  a man named barack obama delivered the keynote address at the dnc convention in   four years later he became the first african american president in the united states while the keynote address does not guarantee anyone of future presidential aspirations  it does mean a great deal to those who care about what the message of the party is  warren is decidedly on the progressive wing of the democratic party  so she will more than likely focus on progressive issues such as raising the minimum wage  better healthcare  climate change  and working with our allies abroad while promoting tolerance and diversity  clinton may not have chosen warren as her running mate  but giving the keynote is a high honor and it gives warren the opportunity to put progressive policies in the spotlight  this is especially important as hillary continues to woo supporters of bernie sanders to her campaign this keynote selection screams that hillary clinton is inching more to the left as progressives have been hoping and it gives progressives a bigger place at the table than they have had in many years  combined with the platform changes bernie sanders was able to insert  this could signal a progressive agenda is on the way if sanders  supporters are patient enough to let it happen gradually instead of all at once the shift to the left could also mean that a more progressive candidate than hillary clinton could very well succeed her  that means progressivism has a bright future if they make sure a democrat is elected to succeed president obama in november  because donald trump sure won t advance progressive policies featured image via chris somodevilla getty images
