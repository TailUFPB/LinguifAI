republican front runner donald trump  who recently threatened america by saying there would be riots if he wasn t made the gop nominee  has just made an even more insane  terrifying prediction  he s going to win with guns  pretty much giving the thumbs up to gun violence during a saturday rally in phoenix  arizona  trump made his supporters grand promises of how  we are going to win   amongst these promises was an ominous threat  shouting over the crowd s cheers  trump yelled  we re going to win with our second amendment  we re gonna win big league with our second amendment  you can watch the unbelievable moment below  where trump delights his gun loving fanatics if trump s comments weren t disturbing enough  this particular rally was also overcome by a horrendous amount of brutality  in once instance  police officers released pepper stray on anti trump protesters for little to no reason  arresting several  in another incident  a trump fan drove a jeep right through a crowd of protesters  even on social media  trump fans were calling for protesters to be  tear gassed and shot  trump s preference of using tactics such as bullying  violence and threats seem to be limitless   every week  he raises the bar and encourages his fans to up the ante  too  in the past  he s promised to  ruin  the lives of protesters by arresting them  and vowed to pay any legal fees that may result from his supporters attacking protesters  and then denied it   trump even threatened to punch a protester himself  all of these things have actually happened been said by trump and many of them have happened   so the fact that he is riling up his loyal gun nut followers and talking about their second amendment rights is all the more terrifying  and let s not forget that trump actually said that he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and still rise in the polls someone should probably tell the rnc that ohio  where the gop convention will take place this summer  is an open carry state  since it s not likely that the rnc will take the safety measures to prevent guns from coming into the convention  hopefully there will be enough  good guys with guns  to take on trump s gun toting minions if he doesn t get the nomination  featured image via quietmike org
