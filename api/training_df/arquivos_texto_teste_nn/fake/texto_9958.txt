president trump s secretary of education  betsy devos spoke today at george mason university s virginia campus  devos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by barack obama  that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases devos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses   survivors  victims of a lack of due process  and campus administrators  have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved  a student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus  if he or she isn t urged to keep quiet  or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement  the case goes to a school administrator  who will act as the judge and jury  the accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered  if there is a hearing  both the survivor and the accused  may or may not be allowed legal representation  whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties  the notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims  a better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not students  families  school administrators are generally not lawyers  and they re not judges  we shouldn t force them to be so for justice to be served the era of rule by letter is over  through intimidation and coercion  the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach  with the heavy hand of washington tipping the balance of her scale  the sad reality is that lady justice is not blind on campuses today  watch liberals immediately attempted to twist the facts in this decision to uphold the law by allowing every american the right to due process  into  trump adminstration supports rape on college campuses   liberals are so used to a president and an administration who flagrantly disregards the law  they can t even comprehend why due process is one of our most sacred rights twitter user  makada does a great job of explaining to the leftsits who are criticizing devos and presdient trump that men should be entitled to the same rights as women  and that it is not okay to determine that they are guilty of sexual assault without a fair trial in a court of law leftists are tweeting  stopbetsy because she wants men to be innocent until proven guilty  i guess liberals don t believe in due process   makada     makada  september    are a few of the uninformed responses to devos  statement today let s start with dingbat of the year  democrat rep  nancy pelosi s reaction to devos  announcement   betsydevosed s remarks are another salvo in admin s attacks on women   survivors by destroying robust title ix enforcement   stopbetsy  nancy pelosi   nancypelosi  september    a leftist uses a quote by joe biden  you know her argument is very likely baseless what could devos and trump possibly have to gain by taking away title ix protections for college women   stopbetsy pic twitter com   amy siskind   amysiskind  september     according to amy siskind  restoring the rule of law is   just the next step on our path to authoritarianism   liberal logic  lol devos wiping away title ix protections for college sexual assault is just the next step on our path to authoritarianism      amy siskind   amysiskind  september    wouldn t be true to your leftist ideology if you didn t throw race and sexual orientation into your argument that has absolutely nothing to do with either one  lol betsy devos won t protect lgbtq and non white students from discrimination or sexual assault victims  who does she protect   stopbetsy  britt     september    then there were a few people on twitter who reminded the left about cases where the alleged  victim  was found to be lying about her rape  after she destroyed the accused rapist s life of course   stopbetsy  remember your hero mattress girl  she lied about being raped   destroyed a young mans life   titleix allowed that to happen  pic twitter com   deplorable r z rbak   mediajuggernaut  september    joseph watson provided a very telling video that dispels the misconception of out of control rape on college campuses that needs to be protected by the left are  in  women raped at college hint  no  stopbetsyhttps   t co   paul joseph watson   prisonplanet  september
