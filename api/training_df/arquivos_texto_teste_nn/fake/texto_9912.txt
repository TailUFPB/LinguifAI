the sympathetic  and borderline communist  women of the view were more than happy to give hillary a spot at the table to explain why it was everyone else but hillary s fault she lost the election  but wait  did hillary really lose the election  according to the not funny comedian and co host joy behar  hillary really didn t lose the election  when behar reminded hillary that she actually won the election  but lost because of that pesky electoral vote rule  hillary seemed quite pleased with behar s ignorance and nodded in approval the best line  however  came when the queen of the view stepped up to assume her responsibility as the most important voice on the panel and to offer hillary her thoughts on why she lost  hilariously  whoopi s opined that hillary s loss had nothing to whatsoever to do with her crooked politics or high unlikeability numbers with both men and women voters  no  according to goldberg  it was a simple matter of historical data lol
