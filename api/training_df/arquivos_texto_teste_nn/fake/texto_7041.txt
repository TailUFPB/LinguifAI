it seems there s a bit of infighting happening between the democratic candidates that really isn t called for  while hillary clinton was pressed to say if she thought bernie sanders is qualified to be president  she time and time again has said that it s up to the voters to decide  but has never said he s not qualified  yet  this seemingly was taken as an attack and bernie responded in slight  and it kind of goes against his promise to run a clean campaign sanders  quite literally said   i don t believe that she is qualified   in regards to clinton  he then went on to list reasons he believes she s not qualified  all of which were just positions he just disagrees with her on  but not a means of disqualification  if anything  clinton may be the most qualified candidate in modern history  so his remarks were clearly uncalled for while the internet went into a tizzy slamming sanders for saying clinton is unqualified  everyone was waiting for what the democratic front runner would say in response speaking with reporters thursday morning  clinton  being no beginner in receiving uncalled for jabs  shrugged off the attack  saying  well  it s kind of a silly thing to say  but i m going to trust the voters of new york who know me and have voted for me three times   twice for senate and once in the presidential primary  adding  look  i don t know why he s saying that  but i will take bernie sanders over donald trump or ted cruz any time  so let s keep our eye on what s really at stake in this election  reiterating that as far as new york is concerned   that s up to the voters  the voters will decide that  clinton could have gone negative  but she chose to take the high road and reiterate that if bernie happens to take the nomination  he s a far better choice than anything the republicans have to offer  something sanders used to say himself about hillary this is what every democrat voting needs to remember  all this bickering back and forth will amount to nothing if a republican wins in november  both hillary and bernie are far better options  and that is clear  please remember  no matter who  vote blue featured photo by andrew renneisen getty images
