president obama got real and raw with cnn s anderson cooper during a televised town hall meeting on gun violence   potus addresses the  conspiracy  that  we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns  https   t co afzfmmsvgc https   t co   cnn   cnn  january    was speaking about the right wing conspiracy that he is in favor of mass confiscation of guns when cooper interrupted him and asked   is it fair to call it a conspiracy  a lot of people believe this deeply  that stopped the president in his tracks  and he angrily turned to the anchor  i m sorry cooper  yes  it is fair to call it a conspiracy  what are you saying  are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy  yes  that is a conspiracy  i would hope that you would agree with that  for years president obama has had to keep his emotion in check  knowing that flashes of anger and outbursts would instantly give his political opponents fodder for tired  old lines of attack about the  angry black man  but cooper s indulgence of the right wing myth of gun confiscation came at the wrong time in obama s presidency  he has a year left in office  with no more elections left to fight without the need to soothe the egos of those spinning wild yarns without any connection to reality while anderson cooper isn t a right winger like the figures littering the airwaves on fox news  his invocation of a  both sides  talking point was almost as bad  obama s actual actions and proposals on guns bear no resemblance to the right s ongoing characterization of them as a  gun grab   and even less so the idea that obama supports  gun confiscation  the people promoting that idea   the nra  rush limbaugh  fox news  and other figures on the right are simply pushing a conspiracy theory on par with the idea that the   terrorist attacks were an inside job or that the government is covering up alien abductions  it is patently absurd for cooper to give credence to this wild eyed assertions  and obama understandably was put off by cooper giving it credibility on air featured image via twitter
