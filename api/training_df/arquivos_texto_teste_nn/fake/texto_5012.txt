if you ve never had to suffer through any of trump s surrogates trying to participate in debates on cnn  consider yourself lucky  even donald trump jr  had something nasty to say about the surrogates  incompetence  and he delivered some epic bashing that might even make his own father say  you re fired  in an interview on sean hannity s radio show  trump jr  threw his father s surrogates under the bus for being absolutely awful at defending his father  claiming that these people couldn t do their jobs correctly  trump jr  seemed to think that the media was conspiring and going out of its way to make trump supporters look stupid  as if they need any help with that  in trump jr  s diss  the younger trump was not only speaking about the professional  experienced trump loving pundits that cnn regularly has on its shows such as campaign spokeswomen katrina pierson  kayleigh mcenany  and former campaign manager corey lewandowski  although he didn t call out any specific names   trump jr  also accused cnn of picking trump fans  from the street  to go up against  professional  democrats in debates  trump jr  said  the worst  are when they have a panel of eight professional   liberal  but professional  people on a panel  and they find like one trump supporter from the street  who has no real political knowledge  and they just happen to be a supporter  and they put that person up against  people who do this for a living and try to make it seem like that s a fair fight  apparently  trump jr  was so upset about people not being able to defend his father properly that he said the campaign had gotten  so ridiculous i can t even watch it anymore  unfortunately  trump jr  is oblivious to the fact that he should probably include himself amongst the pundits that continue to fail miserably at saving trump s image you can listen to the interview below featured image via alex wong   getty images
