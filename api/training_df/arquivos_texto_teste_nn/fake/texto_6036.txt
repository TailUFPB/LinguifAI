while speaking at the massachusetts institute of technology  mit  commencement ceremony  matt damon took a moment to take a quick jab at donald trump  he suggested that maybe we re living in an alternate environment  one that is simulated and controlled by others  because how else could one explain trump being the republican presidential nominee during his impassioned speech  damon also told the audience of new graduates  there is more at stake today than in every story that has ever been told  he told the graduates that it is up to them and those like them to get out there and start tackling the world s many problems  however  he especially spoke of one problem  and that is what bankers did to millions of americans during the housing crisis that took place nearly a decade ago damon said  let me say this to the bankers   specifically the ones that brought you the biggest heist in history  adding  it was theft  and you knew it  it was fraud  and you knew it  and you know what else  we know that you knew it  also driving the point home that if we were to pass these bankers on the street  they need to know that we have absolutely no respect for them damon also added one very important point  i don t know if justice is coming for you in this life or the next  but if it does come in this life  her name will be elizabeth warren  hell yeah it will be  and warren  of course  being the u s  senator from the great state of massachusetts where mit resides damon  like many of us  is fed up with how there are rules for bankers  and then somehow different rules for the rest of us  and he also knows that there are those who are fighting for us  those like senator warren  who will try to make sure another financial crisis like the one a decade ago never happens again watch a clip from damon s speech here  featured image via video screen capture
