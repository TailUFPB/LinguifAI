millions of americans across the country have concealed carry permits that allow them to carry their guns with them almost everywhere they go  the vast majority of these people  including my brother  have the common sense to purchase holsters to place their deadly weapons in  but then we have dumbasses like the one in augusta  kansas who thought  i don t need no stinkin holster  i ve got a perfectly good sock   as you can imagine  this isn t going to end well two people were hurt in an  accidental  shooting at augusta high school s graduation ceremony over the weekend  according to augusta police chief tyler brewer  a man was adjusting his gun when it went off  hit him  ricocheted and hit another woman  the shooting took place in a crowded stadium and was completely preventable  but the man was apparently an imbecile police told kwch  the gun owner has a permit  and was carrying a small  semi automatic gun in his sock  the gun in his sock was uncomfortable and he was apparently adjusting it when it went off he  was  carrying  his  gun  in  his  sock  his sock his sock the brilliant  brilliant man ended up with a bullet wound in his foot and the woman with one in her calf  they are both expected to be okay  chief brewer said he plans on pursuing charges against the idiot because the shooting happened on school grounds  imagine that  a gun owner who used his sock as a holster broke the law  didn t see that coming the nra and the silly republican politicians who are in their pocket claim that democrats want to steal their firearms because we want stricter gun control laws  this is completely false  of course  and to my knowledge president obama has still not carried out his nefarious gun grabbing plot  but right wingers still believe it is going to happen  they argue about even basic laws like mandatory safety classes  seriously  this shouldn t be a problem but it is and hundreds of people every year are hurt in shootings  like this one  that could have been prevented if the gun owner knew how to handle the weapon they so enthusiastically carry but what do i know  i m just the sister of someone who owns an arsenal of guns and i ve never been shot once  i wonder why that is  oh yeah  cause my brother knows that a sock isn t a fucking holster featured image via the chive
