republicans this election cycle have the difficult task of trying to convince the american voting public that they would be a better choice than a democrat  after all  it is president obama that has led the nation out of one of the worst economic recessions since the great depression  and the numbers simply don t lie  jobs are up  unemployment is down  and more people than ever have access to health care  so  when republican candidates want to appeal to their voting base that somehow all of these facts are bad  they have resorted to lies and propaganda politicking one of the worst spreading the lie that the country is down in the dumps  even though all evidence points to the contrary  is republican presidential frontrunner donald trump  he s been touting his ridiculous slogan  make america great again  since he began  however  america already is great  so it leaves one to wonder what exactly he wants to bring our nation back to  the failed fiscal policies under republican leadership  pre civil rights discrimination  keeping women out of the workforce  who knows  really fed up with this atrocious lie is none other that president obama  and speaking to reporters on friday at the white house  the president said  that is progress  six straight years of job creation the numbers  the facts  don t lie  then taking a direct shot at trump s ridiculously idiotic slogan that implies the nation isn t already doing well  obama says  i think it s useful  given that there seems to be an alternative reality out there  from some of the political folks  that america s down in the dumps  it s not  america is pretty darn great right now  and making strides right now  speaking further on why president obama chose to go after trump s slogan as he did  white house press secretary josh earnest reiterated the president s sentiments  saying  the longer term trends were further cemented in this month s job numbers there s a vigorous political debate going on in the country  the debate in the general election will be focused on whether or not we build on the progress that we ve made over the last seven years   or are we going to turn back to the policies that actually led to the  great recession   and that s just it  republicans keep going after obama  but truth be told  things have gotten remarkably better and just keep continuing along that trend  if anything  the president should be wearing a hat reading   made american great again  featured image  pete souza instragam
