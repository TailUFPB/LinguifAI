once again  it seems as though someone associated with the trump campaign will receive special treatment  according to reports  the billionaire s campaign manager  corey lewandowski  will not face the music for manhandling former breitbart  reporter   we use that term loosely  given the nature of the right wing garbage dump   after roughly grabbing her during a campaign event after mistaking her for a member of the  liberal media  palm beach county state attorney david aronberg says that  despite the attack being caught on video  the billionaire s right hand man will not be prosecuted for what is clearly a crime because reasons after fields asked trump a question  lewandowski grabbed her  apparently attempting to throw her to the ground  fields says she was able to maintain her balance  but she was left with bruises after the attack lewandowski initially denied the allegations  but after video surfaced he had no choice but to admit to what he did  but  of course  he says it was ok to physically assault a woman because he thought she was a member of the  mainstream media  he hates so much  prosecutor s office told me they would inform me of decision tomorrow  if reports true  guess they decided to leak to reporters first  ugly   fields tweeted after news of the decision leaked  for those asking  office of prosecutor asked  weeks ago if i d be ok with an apology from corey  i said ya but haven t heard back about it  with evidence of the attack  an admission  and a video that clearly shows the assault  one must wonder why aronberg would refuse to prosecute lewandowski  who was charged with a misdemeanor count of battery last month you can bet that if it was anyone else  that person would have had to face what he did watch the attack below featured image via cnn
