there have been many musical artists who have demanded that donald trump cease and desist using their tunes to rile up the crowds at his campaign rallies  and the lead guitarist for the iconic rock band queen  brian may  has just become the latest  may found out that trump had used the queen hit  we are the champions  at an event  and immediately spoke out  saying to fans who made him aware of trump s use of queen s songs  i will make sure we take what steps we can to dissociate ourselves from donald trump s unsavoury campaign  he also says that as a matter of policy that queen does not usually allow their music to be used by politicians  period  and wrote on his own personal website  this is not an official queen statement  but i can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given  we are taking advice on what steps we can take to ensure this use does not continue  regardless of our views on mr trump s platform  it has always been against our policy to allow queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool  our music embodies our own dreams and beliefs  but it is for all who care to listen and enjoy  just a little while ago  rem s music was used by trump  and the response from former lead singer michael stipe was nothing short of delicious  go fuck yourselves  the lot of you   you sad  attention grabbing  power hungry little men  do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign  in other words  rock stars don t want a damn thing to do with donald trump  he really better be careful  because he s going to wind up with even more lawsuits and legal trouble than he already has  face it  donald   the only musician who wants you using his music is ted nugent  and that s really not saying much at all  keep it up  and you ll piss off all of hollywood  and that is definitely not something you want to do featured image via jordi vidal getty images
