a couple of artists purchased the bus that donald trump used while campaigning in iowa  the artists have turned the bus into a spectacle of political satire  they have made many changes to the bus  including changing trump s campaign slogan from   make america great again  to  make fruit punch great again  one of the funniest things about the bus wasn t even added by the artists  the bus was initially rented from a party bus rental company  so it features a stripper pole  the artists left it in  as they saw it as a perfect metaphor for trump and his campaign  the bus used to be used as a party bus and the trump campaign leased it from them  but they never removed the stripper pole  so we re kind of using that as kind of a metaphor for trump  like all good satire  the bus is only changed slightly  the artists added elements that fictionalize reality  in order to better examine it  the small changes lead people to come look at the bus  with them not initially realizing what the bus actually is  people come over and they re all excited and they don t even read that it says make fruit punch great again   said mary mihelic  an artist who is part of the anti trump bus project according to the  the guardian   and they re just totally taking pictures and then you ll hear someone say   honey  it s a gag  it s a gag   and we just crack up  the artists explain their intentions behind the installation in a video that is embedded below  they claim that their work is meant to be non partisan  that being said  they say that they really  really do not want trump to be the next president of the united states you can watch a video about the mobile installation  below  featured image from video screen capture
