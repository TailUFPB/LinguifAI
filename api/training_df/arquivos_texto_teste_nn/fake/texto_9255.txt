after two days of being criticized by mostly female   and even some male  members of congress  over multiple allegations of sexual misconduct  democrat al franken just announced he s resigning from his us senate seat  democrat representative john conyers met a similar onslaught of criticism from fellow house members earlier in the week  which left him feeling isolated from his own party as he faced multiple allegations of sexual assault  misconduct and even accusations of a veiled death threat by one woman after years of looking the other way while numerous women courageously stepped forward to accuse former president bill clinton of sexual assault and even rape  democrats not only looked the other way  they nominated his wife who was accused by the same women of enabling his behavior as their choice for president of the united states so why the sudden outrage over franken and conyers  could it have something to do with the upcoming election for senator in alabama  where hard core conservative republican judge roy moore appears to be ahead in the polls against democrat candidate doug jones  despite being accused by several women of sexual misconduct that took place decades ago  so far  the motives or tactics of almost every one of moore s accusers has been called into question  but this is not just any race  it s a race that the democrats have dumped millions into  in hopes of taking a senate seat they would otherwise have no chance of gaining in a deeply red state that overwhelmingly went for trump in   democrat senate candidate doug jones has never run for political office  opposes tax cuts for the rich and supports an expansion of medicaid under obamacare  the  year old also is staunchly pro choice  putting him at odds with embattled republican senate candidate roy moore  who is staunchly pro life there s one thing we know about the democrats they know how to fight  if the democrats can make an  hour show of how  moral  they are  because they are suddenly able to rally against sexual predators in leadership roles in their party  even though they spent decades ignoring the clinton s  or the biggest elephant in the room  perhaps they can convince voters to support democrat doug moore over the  moral less  republican backed candidate roy moore  and gain a senate seat they could only have dreamed about  months ago  the democrats haven t won a senate seat in alabama since  let s face it  senator franken resides in a solidly blue state who went for hillary in   there s not much likelihood that they ll elect a republican to replace him  when it comes to the  year old conyers  he s not only nearing the end of his career  he s a representative in detroit  where it doesn t matter who runs as long as they have a  d  behind their name  it s a   safe seat so if sacrificing a few members of their own party means gaining a senate seat  it s all worth it  right  after all  the media wouldn t dare call out their allies in the democrat party for their decades of hypocrisy  and for their undying support of accused rapist bill clinton and his lovely  enabling wife meanwhile  the blue state of minnesota still loves al franken minnesota s star tribune calls senator al franken  d mn   a star in his party after eight years in the senate  franken had emerged as a powerful voice on progressive causes and forceful critic of the trump administration  frequently generating national headlines with aggressive questioning of trump s cabinet officers  he was a star attraction for the democratic party  raising millions of dollars for candidates around the country and appearing frequently on nationally broadcast talk shows and in other high profile venues franken s celebrity preceded his political career  he was hired as a staff writer for  saturday night live  in its first season in  and quickly became a regular on air performer as well  he served two long stints on the show s staff  the second ending in   after that  he published several bestselling books of political satire from a liberal point of view and hosted a nationally syndicated radio show for several years franken  who had been a vocal champion of women s rights and a popular  in demand spokesman for various progressive causes  found himself caught up in a growing cultural movement around outing bad behavior toward women by men in positions of power  by abandoning franken along with former u s  rep  john conyers  who resigned earlier this week  democrats are drawing a distinction between their party and republicans at a time when president trump has thrown his full weight behind alabama senate candidate roy moore  accused of sexual abuse of underage girls a democratic source told the star tribune that dayton is likely to appoint lt  gov  tina smith and that she is not expected to run in the special election  year old representative john conyers  d mi  was the longest serving house member in us history
