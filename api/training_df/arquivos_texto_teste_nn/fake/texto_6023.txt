the war of words between donald trump and elizabeth warren just reached an epic new height  on saturday  during the democrats of massachusetts state convention  warren did the best thing that you can do to a bully like trump   gave him a taste of his own medicine warren has blasted trump multiple times over the past few months  yet nothing she has said compares to the no holds barred verbal punches she threw out during her speech at the convention speaking about the giant predatory scheme that was trump university  warren likened the presumptive republican presidential candidate to a sleazy car salesman  it was like a used car dealership except that s not fair to used car dealerships   warren told the audience   his playbook said to look for people with problems  they make good targets  trump even encouraged his sales force to go after elderly people who were trying to build a little financial security  warren continued   now  trump university failed and that s no surprise  think trump airlines  trump steaks  trump magazines  trump vodka  trump casinos  trump mortgage  trump games  trump travel  trump ice  trump network  trump radio  and trump new media company  these were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck  here s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples  pain  he wants to be commander in chief  but he s only qualified to be fraudster in chief  warren s evisceration of trump is both thorough and rooted in factual evidence  the speech is a glorious indictment of trump s fraudulent schemes and should serve as a reminder of just how terrible a trump administration would be for the united states  trump s campaign  much like his business schemes  is nothing more the exploitation of those who are desperate enough to believe that a has been reality tv star has anything to offer in the way of being a true leader you can watch the speech below featured image via  video screenshot
