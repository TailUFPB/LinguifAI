when ken nwadike  founder of free hugs project  attended both a donald trump and bernie sanders rally in order to offer free hugs to attendees   he inadvertently summed up the core difference between the two in an effort to make america love again  nwadike provided his free hugs at the wisconsin rallies of both candidates  at the trump rally  his offers were met with hostility  flagrant racism  and even threats of physical violence one woman shouts at him   white is better  a man tells him    i don t want any drugs    as if that could be the only thing on offer from a young black man in america when one man tells nwadike he hates him  nwadike responds that  the feeling is not mutual    explaining that he has love in his heart for all people  even those who don t agree with him  the man responds   first of all there is no love in this world  really  you have to wonder how he feels about his parents  his friends  his community   no love  really another woman yells   are you for trump  i will punch you if you are not   she pulls her arm back and balls her fist  in preparation to launch a genuine punch the whole scene is very scared  very angry  very hateful people   unwilling and unable to engage with affection  compassion  and understanding  whipped into a despairing  disgusting mob by their candidate  it is sad  and hopeless things looks quite different at the bernie sanders rally  nwadike can barely keep up with the demand for hugs  men and women  boys and girls  all fly at him enthusiastically  keen to reach out and accept the love and affection of another human being  the attendees are visibly much more racially diverse  open  communicative   and frankly  happy  the mood is joyful  hopeful  and there are smiles and welcomes going around like wildfire the video serves as a window into two americas featured image via screencapture
