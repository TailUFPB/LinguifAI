when you re running for office  especially when you re running for president of the united states  you re going to say and do whatever is necessary to get votes to put you into office  however  part of your job as a candidate is to also make sure you are not only holding yourself accountable for the things that you say  but also for what the people in your supporting crowds are saying  for instance  when john mccain stood up for barack obama back in the  election when one of his supporters was saying awful things about the then senator it seems sen  marco rubio  r fla  has yet to learn that very important lesson  and it may come back to haunt him  at a recent campaign event in north myrtle beach  south carolina  rubio was addressing the crowd and telling everyone that if he were to become president he would never close down the military base at guantanamo bay  cuba  it was after these remarks that a person in the crowd decided to shout   waterboard hillary   which was a clear reference to both the torture that occurred at guantanamo as well as how some people would like to harm and torture former secretary of state hillary clinton now  rubio  clearly hearing what had been said because he chuckled  decided to just laugh it off and ignore it  he knew it was bad  because he said he didn t want to make a deal of it as the media was there to record everything  and record they did  they recorded rubio shrugging the entire thing off instead of asking the man not to say such a terrible thing  which  in all honestly  would ve made rubio look like a better human being  however  knowing jerks like donald trump are leading in the polls after not only allowing horrible things to be said  but saying horrible things himself  rubio probably figures his base will enjoy these sort of shenanigans needless to say  rubio shrugging off a call for torture on a former first lady and secretary of state as well as a current candidate for president isn t at all surprising  but it doesn t make it any less appalling here s the video  video featured image  cnn
