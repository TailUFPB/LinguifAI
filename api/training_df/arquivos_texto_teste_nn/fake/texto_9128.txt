 history shows that we can  if we must  tolerate nuclear weapons in north korea  those words were written by former national security adviser susan rice on thursday in the new york times  in arguing for appeasement towards kim jong un it was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with barack obama s feckless foreign policy   and it explains why the world that president donald trump inherited is so dangerous and unstable the obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the u s  could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone   breitbartnoah rothman of commentary magazine wrote a brilliant article about the  death rattle of obama s reputation   in his article  rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former president barack obama took our nation down  and why the successes of president trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against trump in defense of obama s failed legacy the members of barack obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual  former cia director john brennan accused donald trump and his administration of engaging in  outrageous    narcissistic  behavior typical of  vengeful autocrats  by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the united states in the united nations  as though that were unprecedented  it is not  james clapper  obama s director of national intelligence  all but alleged that the president is a russian  asset   perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former democratic president s foreign policy professionals were placed in the new york times by obama s national security advisor  susan rice  in her estimation  america has abdicated its role as a  force for good  rice s attacks on the republican administration deserve the most attention  if only because they are the most apoplectic  donald trump s recently released national security review paints a  dark    almost dystopian  vision of the world  rice contended  his world is full of  hostile states and lurking threats   rice claimed that there is  no common good  in trump s worldview  what s more  there is no  international community  and no  universal values   there are just  american values  rice acknowledges that moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace   western values   and u s  sovereignty  she implies that trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that  in fact  it was obama much more so than trump who has failed to see the obvious barack obama was inarguably the least atlanticist president since the end of world war ii  within a year of russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former soviet republic of georgia  obama scrapped george w  bush era agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to central europe  in   the last of america s armored combat units left europe  ending a  year footprint on the continent  by   there were just two u s  army brigades stationed in europe  the folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when vladimir putin became the first russian leader since stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring ukraine a year later  putin intervened militarily in syria  where u s  forces were already operating  resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the cold war  putin s move in syria should not have come as a surprise  barack obama outsourced the resolution of the syrian conflict to moscow in   if only to avoid making good on his self set  red line  for intervention in that conflict despite the norm shattering use of wmds on civilians  even rice s chief complaint about trump  his failure to condemn putin s brazen intervention in the  election  didn t elicit a reaction from barack obama until the final month of his presidency by contrast  and to the surprise of just about everyone  the trump administration has been tough on russia  trump has ordered harsh sanctions on moscow s iranian allies for violating united nations resolutions a course the obama administration declined to take even if it allowed hezbollah terrorists with direct links to putin to operate with impunity  he ordered long overdue airstrikes on putin s vassal regime in syria  halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process  trump not only declined to lift obama era sanctions on moscow  as many feared he would  but expanded them  this administration closed russian consulates and annexes in the united states  it has targeted putin allies like chechen strongman ramzan kadyrov under the magnitsky act the same act that kremlin cutout natalia veselnitskaya lobbied the trump campaign to scuttle  trump has even gone so far as to open u s  arms sales to ukraine  representing a significant blow to putin s ambitions in europe  it is without a doubt that trump now has a stronger record on russia than barack obama ever did  no wonder susan rice is so angry rice further alleged that trump recklessly accused china of being an  avowed opponent  of the u s  rather than just a competitor  and then insisted that china has not  illegally occupied its neighbors   tell that to brunei  malaysia  the philippines  vietnam  or taiwan  each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the south china sea that the people s republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases  rice suggested that trump s  realists  decided to  lump  beijing in with moscow  not because it is a rising military and economic power  but because they wanted to  placate  american nationalists  though this white house declined to defibrillate the trans pacific partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse  it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with beijing to isolate pyongyang than obama did  as the north korean nuclear crisis intensifies  china has backed fresh sanctions on north korean financial institutions  cut off all access to chinese iron  lead  and coal  and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the stalinist state by as much as  percent  and all in the space of one year rice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the u s  should labor  lgbt people  people in poverty  people with aids  people under   et cetera  rather  the document insists that all mankind  regardless of conditions or accidents of birth  are objects of u s  interest  rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security  good  climate change is not itself a threat to american national security but a threat multiplier  as the weather has always been  save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of u s  free trade obligations  rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante  in nearly all respects  it was obama s white house  not trump s  that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the u s  and the world less safe as a result even as early as march of   it was clear that the obama administration s foreign policy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of american interests abroad  they had every reason to be  for now  at least  the trump administration has declined to govern as trump campaigned  not as a populist firebrand but a conventional republican  susan rice and her former white house colleagues have every reason to worry  but not for the united states  their reputations  however  are another matter
