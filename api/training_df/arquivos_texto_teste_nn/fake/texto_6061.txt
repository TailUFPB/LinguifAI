on wednesday  rachel maddow made a comparison between the overt racism of donald trump s current campaign and the polite racism of rick santorum s campaign in   during the segment  maddow raises some interesting questions about trump and the normalization of racism in the  political cycle racist policies have been a major part of the gop s platform since they adopted the southern strategy  since it is no longer considered polite to be openly racist  the gop had to come up with a racist agenda that is coded in the language of economic policy  on occasion  a republican candidate slips up and the veil covering their racist attitudes falls away maddow points towards the time when santorum infamously stated on the campaign trail that he doesn t  want to make black people s lives better by giving them somebody else s money   santorum quickly tried to backpedal on the gaffe  saying that he actually said  blah people   much like the rest of santorum s political career  it was both very sad and hilarious things have changed since   with black uprisings taking place all across the united states in  and   a movement was born that demanded that people finally recognize that black lives matter  because the u s  is extremely racist  that simple demand was meant with a huge backlash from ignorant and racist right wingers  the same thing can be said in regards to muslims  mexicans  and just about every other racial group in the u s  while racial minorities demand to be treated equally  the right fights harder and harder to maintain white supremacy so with racial tensions running high and matters of racial justice becoming an ever more partisan subject  trump entered the  primary election fully exploiting that tension  his rallies have nearly turned into all out race battles  his racist rhetoric is up front and he is unapologetic about that  in the segment  maddow points towards one of his recent statements involving the judge who ruled against him in a lawsuit over one of trump s most horrendous scams  trump university while it is probably true that trump is normalizing racist language  he is also exposing the racist foundations that modern gop is built upon  that s causing deep fractures to form among republicans  the gop cannot continue being the party of racists  in a nation that is rapidly becoming more diverse  so while the normalization of racist rhetoric is terrible   it is important to keep in mind that we are witnessing the death throes of a dying political party you can watch the segment below  featured image via video screenshot
