over the last few days  republican presidential front runner donald trump is finally getting a taste of his own medicine by gop rival marco rubio  who finally woke up and realized that the most effective way to deal with a bully like trump is to mock him relentlessly it s been documented that many bullies   especially those that bully like trump   actually behave that way because of they re deeply insecure  it seems that rubio has finally caught onto this fact and is using it to his advantage  but no one can humble and put trump in his place quite like president barack obama  it s worth bringing back an epic moment from five years ago  when obama absolutely destroyed trump with the utmost class at the white house correspondents  association dinner the dinner was the day before the scheduled raid on osama bin laden s compound  and it was obvious that obama was on point that night  obama not only called trump  fox news and their fellow conservatives out on their birther conspiracies and ridiculous obsession with his birth certificate  but made them look like complete imbeciles in front of the entire audience   who was loving every second of it once obama singled trump out exclusively  the donald practically tried to melt into his seat and he squirmed his way through the entire assault  when speaking about trump s credentials and experience in political matters  obama hilariously brought up trump s behavior on the reality show celebrity apprentice and sarcastically complimented him on his  leadership   obama teased  ultimately  you didn t blame lil john  or meatloaf  you fired gary busey  these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night  well handled  sir  the audience was eating it up  but then obama delivered the final blow  stating that trump would certainly  bring some change to the white house   obama showed everyone just what a trump presidency would look like when he unveiled this epic  and probably accurate  image white house correspondents  dinnerif you have any doubt about the effectiveness of obama s brutal delivery  just take a look at trump s face as the president expertly mocks him everyone but trump was giggling at the ridiculous prospect of trump for president   and yet here we are several years later  when trump actually has a terrifying chance to become the gop nominee if rubio or cruz can t defeat him  in all honesty  these two could learn something from obama   he knew just how to show trump who was boss featured image is a screenshot
