in an amazing take down of cliven bundy s terrorist spawn  fox news host megyn kelly explained how the law works and gave the right wing loon just enough rope to hang himself with on live television during the monday night edition of the kelly file  ammon bundy appeared on the show to defend the armed takeover of a federal wildlife building in oregon in protest of a pair of ranchers being sent to prison for setting fire to federal land bundy made an oft repeated claim that the federal government has no legal authority under the constitution to own land  as usual  bundy is just another right wing extremist who is totally wrong about the law according to the property clause of the constitution  the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states  politifact has also rated this claim as  pants on fire  in the past  as their final verdict states the underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about  years of supreme court decisions  the legal scholars we reached  regardless of any political leanings they might have  agreed that the constitution clearly grants washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless despite this  poor megyn kelly had to sit and listen as an ignorant fool tried to explain his argument to her  keep in mind that kelly is a trained attorney prior to letting bundy embarrass himself  kelly destroyed the idea that the prosecution of dwight and steven hammond was illegal  the hammonds set fire to federal land and a court of law found them guilty and they were sentenced to five years in prison  the united states attorney general charged them for burning  acres of federal public land that the hammonds had leased for grazing in order to cover up the illegal killing of several deer the hammonds appealed their case all the way to the supreme court and lost and surrendered themselves to authorities after denouncing bundy s group of armed domestic terrorists  you know the argument on the other side   kelly said  these ranchers   who you support but are not directly involved    had their day in court  they were found guilty  and it went all the way up to the us supreme court  which denied their appeal  isn t that the way it s supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law  bundy dodged the question by trying to ask kelly a question  which she refused to answer because she asks the questions on her show  and that led to bundy bumbling his way through arguing that the federal government can t own land kelly then changed the topic to bundy s brother ryan and remarks he made to the oregonian newspaper that he was prepared to  kill and be killed  for the cause  well  ammon bundy walked that back in quite a hurry  suggesting that his band of gun toting rednecks are just putting on an act  well  i have a family  i have six children  a beautiful wife  i have a wonderful home  i have a business  several employees  i m not here to die  i m here to defend my freedoms and my liberties  and will i  yes  but it s not going to come to that  here s the video via raw story in short  it appears the right wing gun nuts are all talk and no walk  they were just hoping the federal government would react but the group has received nothing but ridicule from all sides  even ted cruz is urging them to end the pathetic standoff  and after this on air schooling by megyn kelly  it looks like the ridicule is only going to make these ammosexuals an even bigger punchline featured image via video screen capture
