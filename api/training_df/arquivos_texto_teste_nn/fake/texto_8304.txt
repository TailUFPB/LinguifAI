if there is one thing that s immediately clear by attending a republican presidential rally or looking at the demographics of fox news it s that the modern republican party is not so  modern  after all  they are old  and each year  they lose more of their supporters to father time  while being replaced by a far more progressive youth understanding the basic math of this problem can sends shivers down the spine of a republican political operative  how can they expect to compete with the democratic party with their supporters entering their   sadly  the most obvious answer   update your archaic policy positions  stupid    never occurs to them  instead  they are going to try to  fake it   they ll pretend to be cool one shot at this sad new attempt to cling onto relevancy comes in the form of  millennials rising   a conservative super pac that aims to show the youth that the republican party can be  hip  and  dope  and  on fleek   their ads are pathetic as they sound here s one supporting jeb bush seems like it was made by an old guy desperately trying to figure out what is cool  right  that s because it kind of was in an investigation by the intercept  reporters found that  millinnials rising  is  percent funded by old rich guys  the principle backer is a  year old billionaire who  earned  his fortune by being the grandson of an oil baron of the    total raised by the super pac      or  percent  comes from the snowy haired   year old billionaire robert a  day  he is the grandson of superior oil founder william myron keck and a former investment manager  day has also given   million to the pro bush super pac right to rise the rest of the super pac s backers are all about equally far into their golden years zooming out  the silliness of a bunch of rich old guys funding a super pac intended for  year olds is exactly why the republican party is such a mess  rather than come to accept that things like homophobia and regressive social safety net positions are out of sync with where america   especially its young people   are at  they try to throw money at the problem  unfortunately  all the instagram filters and vine loops in the world can t convince young people that republicans aren t the party of backwards policies to give us a sense of what is coming  mitt romney desperately tried to win the  millennial  vote in  by throwing a fortune into ads at them   he still lost them  to  obama easily won the youth vote nationally   percent to  percent  with young voters proving the decisive difference in florida  virginia  pennsylvania and ohio  according to an analysis by the center for research and information on civic learning and engagement at tufts university it wasn t even close feature image via youtube
