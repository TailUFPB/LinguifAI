say what you want about the gop but they really don t like half measures  in the span of just  years  they managed to not just alienate themselves from much of their base  they also managed to piss off the two fastest growing voter demographics in the country  millennials and latinos according to polling done by the pew research center   percent of latinos view republicans favorably which is surprisingly high considering just how ugly donald trump has been  but it s a little less surprising that the unfavorable percentage is at   by comparison  the black community has a favorable unfavorable opinion of  percent for and  percent against just to be clear  the black community has been crucial in several states to electing democrats  if  or more likely  when  the latino vote reaches the same levels in terms of turnout and anti republican sentiment as the black community  states like texas and arizona will turn blue and stay that way  on the other hand  latinos view the democratic party  percent for and  percent against  expect those numbers to rise as more latinos take office with a  d  next to their name the picture is just as grim for republicans among millennials  a whole whopping  percent have a favorable view of the gop and  percent of them will pass  thank you very much  the millennials  in case you didn t notice  recently passed the baby boomers in size as the boomers die off from old age  sure  they don t vote as often as the boomers  but they will and soon  that makes them the about to be most powerful bloc of voters and they re no fan of republicans you might have been thinking that millennials obviously hate the democrats just as much  buuuuuuut  you would be wrong  in fact  of all the generations  millennials are the only ones the democrats are above water with   percent favorable versus  percent unfavorable  and since over the next   years  millennials are going to be taking over the party that doesn t spew nonstop racism  sexism and anti gay bigotry  how do you suppose elections are going to go  to the left or to the right dear republicans  game overthe only way for the gop to survive is to attract  millennials  latinos and the black community  but the only way to do that is to reject the culture war nonsense that pushed all those groups away in the first place  on top of that  they would also have to reject the constant attacks on the poor and sucking up to the rich  that would drive away both parts of republican base  the rich and the the terminally stupid  in other words  either republicans reject everything that the republican party has stood for for the last  years  or  not so  slowly wither away what a lovely time to be a liberal oh  and just as an afterthought  in case you thought old white people would come to the rescue  they hate republicans even more than millennials  sorry man  that s gotta sting featured image via monika graff getty images
