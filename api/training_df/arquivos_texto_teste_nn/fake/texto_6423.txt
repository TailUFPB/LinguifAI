it s hard to believe that so many people are so remarkably stupid and bigoted in north carolina  but alas  they really seem to be  of course  not the entire state  but there does seem to be a rather large group of the population that believes transgender individuals are out to cause harm  when in reality  those who are transgender are actually just living their truth and should be treated with dignity and respect for doing so with the passage and signing of   better known as the now infamous  bathroom bill   it s basically given citizens of the state permission to be the bathroom police  to be clear   has nothing to do with bathroom safety  and everything to do with being discriminatory bigots to the transgender community now  because of this legislated discrimination  the rowan salisbury board of education is now allowing students to bring pepper spray into school bathrooms  you know  to  protect themselves   which in all honesty just gave permission to every bigoted child in that state to use this allowance as a  get out of jail free card  to those they want to physically abuse by means of pepper spray  think about it  you can already hear the  i thought they were going to attack me  excuses piling up  and administrators being like   well  in that case board member chuck hughes  who is in favor of the pepper spray and referenced  in his argument  said  depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues  it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom  not knowing who may come in  keep in mind  this also means that students will seemingly be able to have pepper spray on their person at all times while in school  surely there will be no complications with such a thing  sarcasm  this school board just made it perfectly fine for students to openly harm transgender individuals  individuals who just need to use the restroom like everybody else  it s outrageous and should be illegal  but instead  it s openly condoned by even the highest office in the state  chances are  north carolina governor pat mccrory would approve  disgusting featured image via
