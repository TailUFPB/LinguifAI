after the release of a series of fraudulent  hidden camera  videos purporting to show planned parenthood engaged in illegal body part trafficking  republican lawmakers pounced  in red state after red state  republican governors demanded investigations into the allegations   in fact  they had been waiting for this moment for some time  the pro life activist group responsible for the videos had been coordinating with conservative politicians for months and the bedfellows   republicans and activists   worked together to create anti planned parenthood legislation timed with the release of the tapes  ultimately  not a single investigation found evidence of wrongdoing  planned parenthood clinics around the country were exonerated one by one  in a twist  the anti abortion group that made the tapes  center for medical progress  did get indicted for criminal charges stemming from using fake identification but while it s certainly a victory for justice that planned parenthood came out squeaky clean and the anti abortion group s leaders are facing prison time  it wasn t a total victory  planned parenthood devotes almost all of its budget to helping men and women have affordable access to healthcare  they don t have the money to waste on endless witch hunts  given the lack of evidence of wrongdoing  it s pretty clear that republicans were hoping to bankrupt them on trumped up charges  rather than actually catch them in a criminal act thankfully  the unsung heroes in this story are the lawyers who agreed to represent planned parenthood and other abortion groups  they didn t do it because they were going to get rich  in fact  they ll get nothing  they did it because it was the right thing to do highlighting that point is derek foran  a partner at a corporate law firm named morrison   foerster  in an interview with the new york times  foran walks us through his thought process when he was asked to represent the national abortion federation pro bono the organization  the national abortion federation  had trouble finding a law firm to represent it pro bono  morrison   foerster  which previously handled abortion rights cases  received the request and emailed lawyers at the firm about the inquiry  mr  foran raised his hand and  soon after  secured a court order stopping the group from releasing information from the organization s meetings why would he stick his neck out for a group that had no way of paying him  his answer is both uplifting and brutally honest  i don t like bullies   mr  foran  who was born and raised in ireland  said in an interview this week   and these guys were not only trying to bully women  they were trying to bully poor women  foran isn t exaggerating  planned parenthood predominately helps the poorest women in the country  aside from providing women access to their constitutional right to have an abortion  the clinics also do life saving medical check ups and tests  shutting them down is a clear message from republican lawmakers to american women  we do not care about you  it s bullying foran  representing naf  decided to hit the  bullies  back to protect the vital work that planned parenthood was doing  they filed a lawsuit against center for medical progress in san francisco  thankfully  his job was made a bit easier because fox news   in its rush to praise the anti abortion activists   was giving the fraudsters a ton of airtime   all of which was being used to build a case against them  i turned on fox news and they were open right away about what they did   foran told reporters unlike the lawsuits and investigations directed at planned parenthood  foran s goals were never malicious  he didn t intend to  destroy  any side of the issue based on a fanatical belief in his own ideological superiority  he was simply standing up for what was right  our lawsuit is not about pro choice versus pro life   he said   what you can t do is defraud people  lie and go about manufacturing tales  these guys are accountable under the law just like everybody else  and that s the missing piece in many of the stories covering the planned parenthood videos  they are lies  carefully fabricated to achieve an agenda  no matter where you stand on the issue of abortion  this type of smear campaign is just wrong pro life activists are  of course  despondent over their recent change in fortune  after scoring a victory with the release of those tapes  planned parenthood continues to thrive  and the videos and the group which produced them have been thoroughly discredited  the lawmakers who once thought they could defund and bankrupt women s clinics are losing every battle  things have gone just about as badly as they possibly could have on nearly every front feature image from flickr
