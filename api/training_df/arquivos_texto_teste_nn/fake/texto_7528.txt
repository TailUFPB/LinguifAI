when caitlyn jenner first announced that she was going to embrace her true self  the lgbt community was behind her and with good reason  the former olympic athlete and longtime motivational speaker had the opportunity to be an amazing spokesperson for the transgender community but then she screwed it up  instead of supporting her new community by condemning the republican party s bigotry  she has stood firm and refused to acknowledge it  now  she has dug herself a hole that it seems like she may never get out of last week on the season premiere of i am cait  jenner said that republican men have never been anti lgbt and are for  everyone s rights   we pointed out how ignorant a statement that was on monday  but it seems that she wasn t done being a dumbass  because on the previews for the next episode she said this about donald trump  um  i m not a big fan because  i think  of his macho attitude  i think he would have a hard time with women when he doesn t even realize it it doesn t mean he wouldn t be good for women s issues  i think he would be very good for women s issues i don t think he s out there to destroy women or takes things away or do any of that kind of stuff  jenner is so out of touch with reality  it s almost sad  donald trump would be absolutely horrible for women s issues  he was once pro choice  but now he s not  he insults women all the time  he doesn t support marriage equality  and he s just an all around horrible human being meanwhile  in the same clip she called hillary a  f cking liar  she s literally supporting a guy who politifact has found to be dishonest seventy six percent of the time  but has the audacity to call clinton a liar  her ignorance is breathtaking and it s really no wonder the lgbt community wants nothing to do with her anymore  with friends like jenner  they don t need enemies like trump watch featured image via video screenshot
