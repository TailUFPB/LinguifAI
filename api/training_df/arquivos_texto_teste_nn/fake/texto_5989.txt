when donald trump began his one man quest to smear the judge presiding over his trump university lawsuit using appalling racial rhetoric  it was offensive but not surprising  after all  this is a man who began his campaign by labeling mexicans  rapists  and  murderers  in his very first speech  what was surprising was the sheer level of cowardice on display from trump s fellow republicans  faced with a candidate who said muslims and mexicans can t be his judge  conservative politicians tried to distance themselves from the comments  but not actually call it what it is  racism sen  mitch mcconnell  for example  managed to avoid the term  racism  a total of three times in one interview  the sidestepping was so egregious that it prompted senate minority leader harry reid to call mcconnell out on the senate floor as an example of  republican spinelessness   likewise  many other republicans released statements saying they found the comments  unacceptable  but never articulated why  the vagueness was surely intentional  it s going to be hard to win a general election in an increasingly diverse america when your candidate is openly spewing racism  standing up to that sort of hate mongering would take courage   and that s something that is solely lacking in today s gop however  one man who seems to have little interest in the toeing the party line for an unapologetic bigot is sen  ben sasse  r neb   who said what his fellow republicans were thinking but terrified to say  donald trump s smears on his judge are racism  it s as clear as day public service announcement saying someone can t do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of  racism    ben sasse   bensasse  june    isn t wrong  trump has repeatedly said that the judge in his case is out to get him because of his  mexican heritage   judge curiel isn t mexican  he was born in indiana  but the very fact that he is of hispanic ethnicity makes him suspect in trump s eyes  in a sit down with cnn s jake tapper  trump admits as much tapper  i don t care if you criticize him  that s fine  you can criticize every  decision  what i m saying is  if you invoke his race as a reason why he can t do his job trump  i think that s why he s doing it sasse is one of the few republicans left who hasn t caved to the pressure to stand behind trump as the nominee  unfortunately for the republicans that had hoped to cower behind their wall of silence and ride this out  sasse made that all but impossible  trump s comments are the  literal definition of  racism   and they need to own up to that or risk looking complicit in those statements  sasse has given them an opportunity to come clean  it s now up to them to take it featured image via alex wong getty images
