on friday  president obama gave climate change activists a small  but potentially game changing victory  u s  interior secretary sally jewell will temporarily cease giving out permits to new coal mining leases on federal land  this pause will take place while the federal government s coal program is brought under review  it has been about thirty years since major changes were made to the program  how do we manage the program that is consistent with our climate change objective  there is no short answer   interior secretary sally jewell said during a news conference   it is also clear that we need to take into account the science we have now on the environment and climate change  there is no certainty to how long this leasing pause lasts  reuters reports that it could last as long as three years  this is not good news to the coal industry  which has been in substantial decline for the past few years  due to a combination of regulations  and competition from other fuel sources  such as natural gas and the massive cost decrease in solar  and the hard work of climate activists  big coal has been forced to survive by exporting coal  we have an obligation to current and future generations to ensure the federal coal program delivers a fair return to american taxpayers and takes into account its impacts on climate change   jewell said what does this mean for the climate  according to climate central  this is big deal  they report that  about  percent of all the coal produced in the u s  comes from mines on federal public lands  mainly in the west  as of the end of   there were  active coal mining leases on more than   acres of public lands in wyoming  utah  new mexico  montana and colorado  with an additional   acres in kentucky  alabama and west virginia burning coal and other fossil fuels for electricity is the largest single source of human caused greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change  accounting for about  percent of all u s  greenhouse gases  now of course  without congressional action  an incoming president could end this pause  but a republican victory seems unlikely  and the democratic candidates do not have a lot of love for big coal  bernie sanders has pledged to halt all new federal leases for fossil fuel mega projects  sanders could do this without the need of approval from congress  a move like that would be a giant victory for the planet and all the people who live in it featured image credit  by the official white house photostream       via wikimedia commons
