what s happening in flint  michigan is absolutely criminal  not only is the water there poisoned and leading to children being diagnosed with lead poisoning  but those who are ultimately responsible are not being held accountable  this needs to change  and several people have been calling for michigan governor rick snyder  r  to resign  he s the man who put the officials in charge who changed flint s water source  officials who insisted the water was safe to drink one person stepping up and demanding accountability is actor producer matt damon  he has been involved  for a while now  in providing clean water around the globe and co founded water org with gary white  both men are absolutely appalled over whats happening in flint  because as they work hard to bring fresh water to third world nations  people in our own nation are going without clean water  damon told the daily beast  at the very least he should resign  at the very least  listen  everybody s entitled to a fair trial in the united states of america  but that man should get one  and soon  that s just my personal opinion in terms of the work that we do  to see it happening in flint  every parent in america feels it on a visceral  deep level  because we ask the question   what if that was my child   it s unconscionable in flint  and it s unconscionable that  million people around the world are dealing with that every day in the developing world  those are the communities we interact with  and that s the mission of water org  to end that suffering for those children  and those parents  gary white continued that sentiment  saying  we should be outraged about flint  that shouldn t be happening in the united states  but it also drives home the point that it shouldn t be happening anywhere  flint is the reality for many developing countries around the world  and knowing that race and socioeconomic status definitely play a role in how certain communities are treated not only here in the united states  especially in flint  but also around the world  damon added  my sincere hope for our country and our world is that this greater connectivity is going to lead to a greater empathy and an awakening to the plight of our fellow citizens  these are huge systemic injustices we re talking about that hopefully everybody is waking up to  the question then is  what do we do about it  it will be interesting to see where we go from here  the first step in doing that will be to hold those responsible for this outrageous neglectful act accountable  starting with gov  snyder  many  including filmmaker michael moore are even calling for his arrest  and asking for a thorough investigation  unfortunately  for the people of flint  mi  the damage is done  the harm from the lead poisoning is irreversible  justice must be served  and resources allocated to the people of that community to deal with any and all ongoing issues  we also need to make sure this never ever happens again  not only in flint  but everywhere in this nation and around the globe featured image  wikimedia wikimedia
