rachel maddow noticed ted cruz bragging about being endorsed by ted nugent  and she didn t let him get away with it last month  ted cruz boasted about being endorsed by a pastor who thinks hitler was sent by god to exterminate jews  and now he s boasting about gaining the support of a man who thinks jews who support gun control are nazis in disguise as maddow pointed out on friday night  cruz s website proudly displays a message crowing about nugent s support of the texas senator  ted nugent says ted cruz is his favorite presidential candidate   blares the headline on cruz s weebsite maddow then listed the other slimy people who ted cruz is proud to call supporters of his campaign one of those supporters is anti gay conservative pastor kevin swanson  who wants to execute all gay people  cruz actually shared a stage with swanson in iowa late last year and bragged about it instead of distancing himself from him another supporter of cruz is pastor mike bickle  who once said that hitler was sent by god to exterminate jews because they refused to convert to christianity  cruz embraced bickle s support last month and now cruz is openly bragging about being endorsed by nugent  who not only went on an incredibly anti semitic rant about jews who support gun control  he also shit his pants to avoid being drafted during the vietnam war  has called for the assassination of president obama  and has a fascination with pedophilia  if you re senator cruz and you put this up on your website proudly embracing an endorsement from ted nugent   showing off  campaigning even tonight on the fact that you are the choice for president of ted nugent   then you do kind of own this   she argued   just like you own the guy who said that god sent hitler to kill all the jews  because you campaigned on his endorsement  too  just like you own it when the guy saying every gay person in america should be executed  because you attended his event  you shared a stage with him  you did not have to do that  honestly  this year  ted cruz is shooting the moon on this stuff  i don t know how long it s gonna be before the beltway notices this pattern and realizes it might be a real issue for him  here s the video via msnbc earlier in the segment  maddow noted that cruz also spoke at bob jones university  a christian indoctrination camp that forbids homosexuality  forbids interracial dating  and supports segregation as if it is stuck in the  the bottom line is that ted cruz is a dangerous religious zealot who should not be allowed anywhere near the white house  or the us senate  or any public office for that matter  his views and supporters are just too extreme in this country and go against our values as a nation  featured image from flickr
