while it s not nice to criticize people  per se  for attempting to sing one of the hardest songs ever to sing  one person s rendition of the star spangled banner at a donald trump rally in eugene  oregon  was flawlessly criticized without words zach lapidus posted a video to facebook of a split screen of himself on piano pretending to accompany the person singing the national anthem to be honest  once the key modulations were hit they were on point  but there were modulations on nearly every line of the song  in fact  almost every key seemed to have been hit at one point or another during the song  and lapidus seemed to nail every single one of those key changes the star spangled banner is a tough song to play by any musician  and even harder for vocalists  because the range from the lowest notes to the highest notes are nearly two octaves  credit should always be given to those who attempt to sing the national anthem  and even more credit given to those who can do it well  unfortunately  this was not one of those times this article isn t so much to make fun of the singer   although  she is at a trump rally and that should be ridiculed  but rather this is to compliment lapidus on his accompaniment and ability to pick up on all the modulations  well done maybe this is the version of the national anthem taught at the trump school of music  https   www facebook com zach lapidus videos  featured image via video screen capture
