on tuesday morning  cnn carol costello completely shut down an interview when a conservative guest  and passionate donald trump supporter  went off on a ridiculous rant about hillary clinton the  cnn newsroom with carol costello  interview started to go south toward the end when one of costello s guests  trump fan and newsmax host steve malzberg  tried to derail a discussion about the republican front runner s misogyny and sexist rhetoric by targeting clinton and her husband  malzberg bragged about the business mogul s approach with women  when you get one on one    especially if it s hillary   donald trump will go places nobody is willing to go  where the media at this point isn t willing to go  bringing up clinton s women who say they were intimidated by hillary  having them come forward and speak  a litany of issues that you can t even imagine  costello interrupted malzberg and said   i m thinking that might not be a winning argument for donald trump right at this moment   which is absolutely correct  considering that trump has been pummeled for his recent comments that women should be punished for seeking abortions but malzberg foolishly continued on  even though costello s objections were backed up by fellow guest judson phillips  who is a ted cruz supporter   malzberg added  do you know how many young women in this country don t even know that bill clinton was impeached  no  maybe they ve heard of monica lewinsky  they don t know the women that have accused bill clinton of sexual improprieties and that say they have been threatened and intimidated by hillary clinton  then  malzberg decided to bring up another truly bizarre talking point   clinton s involvement in an old child abuse court case from   malzberg started  a girl who was raped by a pedophile that hillary clinton bragged about getting off  shocked that malzberg would even mention this  costello started to shut him down  saying   oh  come on  malzberg cried  wait  wait  let me finish   while costello refused to entertain the conversation  he argued  what do you mean  you don t want to hear it  that hillary clinton is on tape bragging about  as a lawyer getting off on a technicality  that woman now says   hillary ruined my life   that s not fair  costello had had enough of the insane conversation  and said  i m going to leave it there  and goodbye  thanks for joining me  before ending the interview abruptly  you can watch the awkward moment unfold below  at about the   mark in clinton s memoir  living history  clinton addressed that  case  confessing that she had only been out of law school for two years when she was assigned that case  she said that although she  didn t feel comfortable  with the case  she couldn t very well refuse the judge s request   clinton knew she had  an ethical and legal obligation to defend him to the fullest extent of the law   and did her best  after that case  clinton went on to set up arkansas  first rape hotline featured image via screencapture
