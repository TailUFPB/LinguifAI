republicans who have been behind successful presidential campaigns are now speaking up on the slowly unraveling disaster that is donald trump s effort  and it isn t good  these long time republicans are now facing the very real prospect that trump s horribly run campaign will also drag down other members of the party on the ticket and cause long term damage which could take forever for the right to recover from many of them want to abandon ship back in   the party largely gave up on nominee bob dole once it became clear he had little chance of winning  so it s not without precedent  nevertheless  it s a jolting prospect now  with roughly three months still left before the nov   vote and weeks before the three presidential debates republicans who have devoted their professional lives to electing gop candidates say they believe the white house already may be lost  they re exasperated by trump s divisive politics and his insistence on running a general election campaign that mirrors his approach to the primaries  based on his campaign record  there s no chance he s going to win   said sara fagen  the political director for former president george w  bush   he s losing groups of people he can t get back  fagen is no moderate squish  she was a right wing conservative member of the  george w  bush re election campaign  and whatever the issues were with the morality of bush s campaign that year   iraq  terrorism  corruption  etc    it is impossible to argue that it wasn t a well run and well organized campaign that beat out senator john kerry s effort that year the wall street journal described her role on that campaign as a  data whiz  and said she  helped perfect political micro targeting  that is the technique used to target campaign prospects based on their interests and likelihood to be supporters of a candidate  the bush  campaign pioneered this  and it was used in a massive way by president obama in his overwhelmingly successful  and  campaigns  it s how modern elections are won   or lost trump has not invested in campaign basics like that  and even in states where he should be on the ground with organizers that could give him a shot at winning  he isn t doing it  instead  he is focused on feeding his base voters red meat  filled with bigotry  which turns off the voters he needs to win and republicans know it  and the veterans see the likelihood of a massive wipeout coming featured image via flickr
