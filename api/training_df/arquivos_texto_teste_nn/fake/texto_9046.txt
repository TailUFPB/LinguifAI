bill cosby was america s favorite dad for a long time  however  there was a dark side to the comedian and television icon s legacy  for years  there have been whispers that cosby was drugging and sexually assaulting young women  many of whom were young  starstruck  naive and believed that cosby could help with their entertainment careers in recent times  though  cosby s alleged dirty deeds came back to haunt him  and nearly  women came forward to reveal to the world what he had done  finally  with the statute of limitations on one of the cases just days from running out  cosby was arrested for sexual assault on new year s eve  cosby sent out a tweet to his  friends and fans   who support him despite the damning evidence against him and the huge number of women saying he violated them  while there are certainly many cosby apologists out there  most people at this point believe the women  it turned out that sending this tweet was definitely the wrong thing to do  twitter pounced on the disgraced star as he  in my opinion  so richly deserved  billcosby i get the friends and fans things  bill  but what do you say to the victims   steve elzer   steveelzer  january    billcosby having any ladies over tonight for quaaludes and rape   augie march     january    billcosby forgot u were on here   i was following you  your past has finally caught up to you  there isn t a known level of shame for u yet   gobucks   timstatic  january    billcosby enjoy getting roofied in prison   joe  edition   joealv  january    billcosby seriously  you   your wife need to be locked up   mary kastelic   marykastelic  january    billcosby no  thank you for sabotaging your own legacy and tarnishing people s childhoods  tryin not to pass judgment  but  c mon dude  kenny baker     january    billcosby what would you do if you found out there was a slight chance someone drugged and raped your wife or daughter  would you be cool    stephen slade   stephenslade  january    of people pointed out that cosby is innocent until proven guilty  which  to be fair  is true  however  considering the fact that he admitted under oath that he used quaaludes on women he wanted to have sex with well  let s just say the cards are stacked against him this really just goes to show that america has a major issue with victim blaming and refusal to believe women who are victimized  especially when a beloved celebrity is the one being accused  being rich and famous with a lot of fans and influence should not mean that one is above the law  and that is what has been the case with cosby for years  yes  he should have his day in court   but so should the victims  justice is what is important here  not a television legacy featured image via bill cosby twitter raw story
