in what some may assume is a misspeak and others may attribute to a freudian slip  sarah palin took to facebook to go after rapper azealia banks  to be honest  the two of these ladies fighting is a mind numbing assault on everything good and decent  because both women are outrageous in their own regards  the two have been trapped in a twitter battle that s gotten kind of ugly trying to end the battle  in her own condescending way  was palin when she took to her medium of choice  facebook  she wrote  hey female rapper   listen up  little darling  no one has any idea what you re wigging out about in these bizarre  violent rants against me  but you re obviously not exercising enough intelligence to acknowledge you ve been sucked into believing some fake interview in which i supposedly offered comments representing the antithesis of my truth in this life  you re blessed to have been given an influential platform  so have i  why don t we strengthen both our platforms and work together on something worthwhile   like condoning racism  along with empowering young women to defend themselves against a most misogynist  degrading  devastating assault perpetrated by evil men   rape thanks  and now i ll go through my young daughter s playlist to make sure there hasn t been any inadvertent addition of any anti woman  pro rape garbage that you seem to endorse  which perpetuates the cultural challenges we face in america  i encourage other parents to do the same god bless you ms  banks  as you consider a change of heart   sarah palin mediaite seems to have captured the original post via facebookof course  she either didn t know what  condoning  means or she really meant it  either way  she s clearly been notified of how horrific she sounded  because her post was deleted and re posted with the word  condemning  instead here s the thing  palin is backing the most racist candidate running for president   donald trump  his outright bigotry towards latinos  muslims  etc  isn t even thinly veiled  he boasts his hatred for the  other  right in the open  so while palin may have written the wrong word initially  she clearly is  condoning racism  and misogyny by backing trump featured photo by mark wilson getty images
