this is pure gold that perfectly demonstrates that republicans don t give a damn about a problem until they experience it personally on thursday  arizona republican senator jeff flake joined his conservative colleagues in voting down an amendment that would have put an end to the airline industry practice of reducing the size of seats in order to cram as many passengers as possible into planes in a clear move that puts profit over the comfort of customers according to the washington post  the amendment would have  empowered the faa to set new standards  in consultation with experts  for seat dimensions that maintain  the safety  health and comfort of passengers  and as usual  republicans sided with the lobbying arm of the airlines and killed the amendment  but one republican already humiliatingly regrets his vote against the measure after boarding a flight and taking his seat  flake discovered that his own legroom was seriously impeded and trying to use his laptop was even more uncomfortable so  he took a picture and posted it to twitter   okay  so perhaps my vote against this bill was a tad impetuous   flake wrote here s the post via twitter okay  so perhaps my vote against this bill was a tad impetuous  pic twitter com   jeff flake   jeffflake  april    is a fantastic example of a republican experiencing what it is like when karma comes knocking at your door to teach you a lesson  especially since twitter users couldn t resist roasting flake and republicans for voting against the amendment here are just a few of the hilarious responses   jeffflake that s what you get for being a knee jerk conservative republican  now  about that supreme court vacancy     lee cox     april    jeffflake  joshtpm and how much did the airline lobby pay for that vote   il volo maui   rickiadoroiv  april     jeffflake  republicans have a record of only voting for things that affect them personally  now you want more leg room  typical   desperada   dsprada  april    jeffflake may you be seated next to a colickey baby on every flight   dawn gulick   dawngulick  april     jeffflake  paulisci wow  what will it take for him to realize he was impetuous about gun control   evan jacobs   esjacobs  april    jeffflake if more politicians were required to travel coach  then maybe they would have voted otherwise  no love for us commoners     msmenz   iammsrizzy  april     jeffflake that s what happens when you simply knee jerk your reaction  try  thinking  once in a while      ianinamerica  april    should have thought more about this issue before just casting a vote against the amendment for the sake of voting against anything that might make the lives of the people easier and less frustrating  instead  he only regretted his vote after dealing with uncomfortable airline seating first hand  which has become a typical republican trait if every republican experienced losing a child to gun violence  we would have gun control immediately  if every republican experienced being denied healthcare  universal healthcare would be a reality  if every republican experienced the pain of sending their child to fight in a war  the hawks would turn into doves  if every republican were paid minimum wage  they would vote for a national raise instantaneously  and if every republican had to ride coach when they fly  they would vote in favor of more legroom on airlines  or at the very least  they would regret their opposition to each of these measures sadly  until more republicans experience the realities that americans live with every day  we can expect them to keep obstructing until they get personally fired by voters who decide not to sit and take it anymore featured image via twitter
