at a campaign rally in cedar rapids  iowa  republican presidential front runner donald trump prefaced the caucus by inviting his loyal supporters to  knock the crap out of  protesters   and that he would take care of the legal consequences of any resulting violence trump began his invitation by saying he d received a warning from his  wonderful security guys   he continued by referencing a recent incident where a heckler threw a few tomatoes at him during a rally  there may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience  so if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato  knock the crap out of them  would you  seriously  okay  just knock the hell   i promise you  i will pay for the legal fees  i promise  i promise  it won t be so much  cause the courts agree with us too  here s the footage of trump encouraging his fans to be violent at his rally this isn t much of a surprise from trump   and without a doubt his supporters will be more than happy to take him up on that request  trump s supporters have earned themselves a reputation for roughing up protesters  and trump has done little to stop the violence   in some cases  he has even supported it and egged the crowd on previously  trump came to the defense of his fans after they kicked and punched a  blacklivesmatter protestor when he said   maybe he should have been roughed up   in another instance  trump ordered security to throw a protester out of an event in vermont without the heckler s coat  enthusiastically noting that  it s about ten degrees below zero outside  by the way  it s illegal to encourage people to commit violent crimes  according to iowa state law  anyone  directing abusive words or making a threatening gesture which the person knows  or reasonably should know  is likely to provoke a violent reaction by another  can be charged with disorderly conduct  in a perfect world  trump would be forced to spend  days in jail because his minions just can t resist following his orders  unfortunately  what will actually happen is his approval rating will go up  featured image from video screen capture
