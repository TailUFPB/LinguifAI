after this past monday s iowa caucus where the results on the democratic side were in a statistical dead heat  many were left wondering how bernie sanders couldn t seal the deal and left hillary clinton to walk away with the victory  well  saturday night live has filled in the gaps and explained what truly may have happened this past monday in iowa snl created  bern your enthusiasm   an obvious play on host larry david s show curb your enthusiasm  a show that is greatly missed  but that is neither her nor there  and on this week s episode of  bern your enthusiasm   it showed david as sanders not fully committing to all his voters who presented themselves to him in precarious situations sanders didn t want to shake the hand of one iowa voter because she sneezed into her hand right before she was about to greet the senator  thus leaving her and her family just standing there angry  then later  as sanders went to get coffee  because he didn t want the   milk his office had for him  he refused to help another one of his voters in a medical emergency flash forward to the caucus results  and it shows sanders lose by    which his staff estimated was about five voters  in other words  the voters that he pissed off that day it was the perfect hybrid of curb your enthusiasm and the frustration sanders must have felt that cold day in iowa when he lost by just a few votes things might be looking up for sanders in new hampshire this coming tuesday  but until then  at least this week s snl will keep him warm with laughter as he heads back to new england from the saturday night live set where he also had a cameo in another sketch watch here for larry david s spot on performance as bernie sanders video featured image from youtube
