marijuana legalization is on the cusp in america  there are proven medical benefits and evidence that it s more effective as a painkiller for people with chronic pain than opiates  it relieves nausea in cancer patients and stress related to ptsd  it s a nifty plant  whose commercial counterpart also offers an array of revolutionary products that are cheaper and stronger marijuana is here to stay  as more states move to legalize  cases will begin moving through the courts of citizens being denied their  amendment right from a state where pot is a crime  in order for that to happen  however  pot has to really not be a crime  when you get to the federal level  it simply is  marijuana is in the same class as cocaine and heroin  two drugs known to destroy peoples  lives with serious psychological and physical addiction eric holder  former attorney general  told pbs that he thinks that is wrong  holder said in a recently released frontline interview  you know  we treat marijuana in the same way that we treat heroin now  and that clearly is not appropriate  so at a minimum  i think congress needs to do that  then i think we need to look at what happens in colorado and what happens in washington  what is unfortunate is that at one time  eric holder actually did have the power to at least initiate unilateral marijuana legalization through studies done by health and human services  in the case of marijuana  there are two options to legalize courtesy of brookings yes  that means that eric holder had the keys to the shiny new pot plant but he never used them  he passed them on  instead  to loretta lynch  who has stayed out of the marijuana issue completely no that it really matters at this point  marijuana has far too many benefits  you re talking medicinal  production  research  retail counter  all of those things equal jobs which equal revenue  it means people doing life for a half pound of schwag can be let go  it means our upside down legal system is going to have find something other than a little bit of pot to keep their machine running it also takes the dealer out  nobody needs them  their cartels  their smuggling operations   none of it  now that pain pills have brought the war on drugs into wealthy white neighborhoods where the evolution from oxycontin to shooting up heroin is a shocking revelation  law enforcement and treatment professionals can focus their attention where it belongs it seemed when the drugs were reserved for low income and minority neighborhoods the answer was jail  now all of a sudden it s treatment  as long as everyone benefits then so be it featured image from wikipedia
