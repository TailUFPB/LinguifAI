no one wants to admit that they re losing  especially if you ve been fighting really hard to gain votes  but ohio gov  john kasich really doesn t seem to want to admit he is losing  after all  he s only won one state so far in the republican presidential primary  and that one state is the state where he is governor so  when demetri sevastopulo of the financial times directly asked kasich about his potential path to victory  and reminded the ohio governor that he s only won a single state  kasich got rather angry and even snatch the voice recorder from the reporters hand sevastopulo asked  governor  if you get to the convention in cleveland and you have only won ohio do you think you re qualified to be the nominee  kasich bites back  they ll be no  if    there s not  if  in there  they ll be when  and listen  at the end of the day the republican party wants to pick somebody who actually can win in the fall sevastopulo cuts in and reiterates  but if you ve only won ohio then kasich turns to him and says  can i finish  with sevastopulo saying  if you answer the question  kasich clearly losing his patience replies  i m answering the question the way i want to answer it  you want to answer it  it was at that moment that kasich tears the voice recorder out of sevastopulo s hand  points it at the reporter and asks   what do you think   with sevastopulo perfectly replying   i think you should answer the question  it seems fairly obvious kasich doesn t want people to tell him that he s probably not going to be the nominee  despite his best efforts to stay in the race until the end  his best hope is a split convention where he can garner up the necessary delegate votes  but even then  with only one victory  it s not looking very likely people will choose him over other candidates the truth hurts  and kasich doesn t handle it very well watch the interaction here in bizarre moment  johnkasich snatches my recorder as annoyed at question about only winning ohio  benmarinojourno pic twitter com   demetri sevastopulo   dimisevastopulo  april    photo by eduardo munoz alvarez getty images
