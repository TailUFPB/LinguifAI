mitt romney watched his dream of becoming president fly right out the window in  when he made the infamous   percent of americans are looking for a handout  speech at a private fundraiser that was secretly recorded and released to the public  romney alienated himself from half the american population in one fell swoop  handing an electoral landslide to president obama  he re surfaced in  with a quick stint pre campaign test  only to decide he wouldn t run again in late january of this year  however  mittens made sure his fec paperwork was in order to be listed as a candidate for the election  while most presume he did what he had to to secure a spot on the ballot in case he gets nominated at a brokered gop convention  there could be far more ominous issues with mitt romney and his political future the republican party is in a panic  donald trump is looking like he will be able to secure the nomination with more than  percent of the delegates  making a brokered convention an impossibility  trump would at that point be the republican nominee for president this november  which would fracture the gop into an unrecognizable shadow of its former self  so what would the plan be at that point  to steal the election from under the noses of the american people and hand it to his own running mate  paul ryan  to decide with a vote in the house of representatives it s not really that complicated  either  according to the  amendment  if no candidate reaches the number of electoral votes necessary to secure the presidency  a ballot will be cast by the house to decide the victor  if the gop runs mitt romney and paul ryan against their own candidate as a third party choice  chances are that outcome could come to pass  the morons lining up to vote for trump aren t the typical party base  while he has the fringe vote locked up  as well as the independent low information voter  he ll never take the koch loving regulars away  those people would rather vote for hillary clinton and take their chances on  than watch trump destroy their party and our country so then  in an all out battle between donald trump  hillary clinton and mitt romney  all the republicans have to do is squeeze out enough votes from two candidates to keep clinton under the  electoral votes needed to be elected  while that scenario seems crazy and unlikely  it has happened before  with enough voter obstruction and cleverly played lawsuits  we could witness a travesty that would give the republicans control of all three branches of government  effectively destroying our country as we know it republicans are no good at winning elections fair and square  if they had to rely on the people to elect them  they would have died  years ago  people think they are refusing to consider a supreme court justice just because obama is the nominating president  while that may be partially true  it also plays into the strategy of giving the vote to the house  if the republicans contest enough results in blue states where conservative judges sit on federal benches  appeals to scotus would end in   ties  leaving the lower court rulings in effect the whole thing is an archaic constitutional mess that should have been addressed and done away with decades ago  but alas  it s here for this election cycle and it could jump up and bite our country where the sun refuses to shine featured image by gage skidmore
