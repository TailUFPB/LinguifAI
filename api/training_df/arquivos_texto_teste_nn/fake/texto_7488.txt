republican frontrunner donald trump is leading the pack by appealing to the very worst aspects of human nature  and the battle is on the find the sentence that truly expresses the horror and contempt this news generates in the rest of us  we think trevor noah might just have found it speaking on the daily show  noah said  i hope there are two donald trumps   that way he can go f ck himself yep that just about does it but noah s whole rant delivered a brutal drop kick to the trump campaign and its cynical use of every dirty tactic in the book to gain power   with near total disregard for the consequences  we laugh  but it s still more likely there s only one donald trump  who is just a cynical  manipulating man  manipulating his followers and his enemies and the media without any concern for what he s doing to the country  that s possible  that s probably the truth  but i do hope   i do hope   that there are two donald trumps  because that way he could go f ck himself  turning to the ever escalating racist violence spilling out of trump rallies across the country  noah didn t mince his words either  here s the truth  donald trump didn t just create an atmosphere for violence at his rallies  he engineered it as carefully and deliberately as matt damon did when he was growing potatoes on mars  finally the host appealed to fans of trump s opponents to avoid confronting trump fans  or attempting to shut down their rallies  saying  if you come in  and you actually try to silence them  it s like trying to put a fire out by putting wood onto it  you ve given trump the villain that  up until now  he was making up  the issue of course  with failing to confront trump and his merry band of agitators  is that fascism is the genie you can t put back in the bottle donald trump  and his fellow republican candidates  have pulled the most noxious  toxic  racist  sexist behavior back into the mainstream the republican establishment knows they have opened pandora s box  a box that they cannot now close  they hoped to leverage its toxic contents by turning it into votes for their establishment candidate  instead  donald trump and ted cruz have been given the chance to take over  two men who would have been unelectable in almost any ballot in modern times  whatever hell these candidates and their followers reap upon the country  it will taint the republican party forever featured image via screengrab
