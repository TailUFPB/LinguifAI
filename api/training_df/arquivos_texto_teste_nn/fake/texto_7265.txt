the wisconsin department of justice just released an email that was exchanged between members of the scott walker administration that is so outrageous it has to be read to be believed the document was sent by wisconsin s former corrections secretary ed wall  to scott walker aide rich zipperer wall is currently on paid leave  as the fbi and state attorney general s office conduct a massive investigation into allegations of abuse inside wisconsin s juvenile prison system according to the milwaukee wisconsin journal sentinel  wall is just one of many members of walker s administration implicated in the juvenile sex abuse scandal the journal sentinel reports   state officials at the highest levels have known of attacks and sexual assaults at the prison without either contacting or fully disclosing the details to county officials  family members of victims and even law enforcement   since at least february  the paper goes on to say  the pattern of not sharing glaring problems continued for years  and meaningful change came only after the public learned late last year of the probe into lincoln hills and the sister facility on its campus  copper lake school for girls  the email exchanged between wall and walker s aide sheds a light on what might have been going on in walker s administration  which would impede the sharing of information details of the email  published by the milwaukee wisconsin journal sentinel here  indicate that these walker officials would do just about anything to avoid transparency wall wrote  i know that you didn t want me sending this electronically or to the office because of the  open  records issue  so i elected instead to send it to your home in writing and would ask that you feel free to shred it once you ve looked it over  nobody will know that i sent it and this is strictly between you and me  i understand the concern the administration has over creating records  rich  but i can t let that harm me or my family worse that we ve already been harmed  wall asked that he be reinstated to his old job  and went on to say that he didn t want to have to get a lawyer to make it happen  he also implied that the governor himself was on his side in the matter in a statement to the milwaukee wisconsin journal sentinel  wall s attorney referred to the statements in the email as  an unfortunate use of language  meanwhile  scott walker spokesperson laurel patrick pointed to the fact that the document wasn t shredded  as a way to show how honest and transparent the walker administration is if anything  the fact that this email wasn t shredded is just one more indication of how completely incapable walker officials are of doing anything right for once though  the bungling of walker staffers might actually help the citizens of wisconsin  instead of hurting them now that wall s email has been inadvertently exposed to the public  the people of wisconsin have a better idea of what they re fighting against  beyond that  federal and state investigators now have a better idea of what it will take to shut walker s criminal enterprise down once and for all featured image via wikipedia
