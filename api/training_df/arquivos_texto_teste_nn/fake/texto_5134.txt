if you ve never watched donald trump read off a teleprompter  you re really not missing out on anything  part of what makes trump  well  trump  is the fact that he s so off the cuff and could literally say anything at any moment however  when his campaign team and the republican party rallies around him to actually appear to be a serious candidate and deliver actually policy messages  you ll see trump awkwardly use the teleprompter  he reads from it like a teenager reading shakespeare during english class in high school  he knows that the words he s saying mean something  but he himself actually has no idea what he s saying so  because he s just reading without any concept of the topic he s talking about there are bound to be missteps  awkward moments  and things he just says absolutely incorrectly  be it a name  city  or the actual word  cities  in fact  during trump s recent  economic  speech in detroit  michigan  he talks about cutting regulations  because really  who needs safe products  he also wants to bring jobs and wealth back into  titties  like detroit  yes  titties  not cities now  this slip of the tongue on any other candidate can easily be look past  but not for trump  a man who s built his career around  well  titties  so  it s easy to say that we now know what s truly on trump s mind  and it s not u s  economic growth watch the moment here featured image via video screen capture crooks and liars
