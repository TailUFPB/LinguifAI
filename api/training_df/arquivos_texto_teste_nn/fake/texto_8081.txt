msnbc s chris hayes has consistently proven to be a strong voice in the liberal movement  alongside rachel maddow  he is one of msnbc s most gifted bullshit detectors  capable of sounding the alarm around republican lies and nonsense wherever it might occur  that s why it was so disappointing to see him fall into the low brow dredge of trying to stir up a  clinton hates obama  false narrative to help fan the flames of democratic in fighting this election season on friday  hayes used a segment on msnbc s all in with chris hayes to go after bill clinton for sounding  off message  and out of sync with his wife s campaign  his show ran a clip of the former president speaking at a recent hillary rally  and quoted him as saying that the current president  that would be barack obama  isn t a  change maker  hayes  if that s clinton s winning strategy  she might want to make sure her husband is in the loop  bill seemed to go a bit off message last night in tennessee while campaigning for his wife clinton  she s always making something good happen  she s the best change maker i ve ever known  a lot of people say  you don t understand  it s different now  it s rigged  yeah  it s rigged because you don t have a president who is a change maker sounds bad right well actually  as legions of disappointed fans pointed out to hayes throughout the weekend on social media  the clip hayes showed was painfully out of context  if msnbc s editing team had kept it rolling for just a few seconds longer  audiences would have seen that clinton was channeling president obama s naysayers  and not speaking for himself  just one sentence later  clinton quite literally ends with a pro obama crescendo that has the entire audience applauding by monday hayes seems to have read the writing on the wall  or the mentions in his twitter feed  and issued an on air apology and played the entire clip that debunked his  off message  narrative bill clinton s supposed criticism of obama fall apart when you see him add  but the president has done a better job than he has gotten credit for  and don t you forget it  hayes couldn t help but half defend his indefensible editing saying it was still arguably true   but concluded by agreeing with his critics  in cutting off that clip  we didn t allow you the chance to make that judgment for yourself in the full light of context  we shouldn t have done that  in full light of the context  the entire point of the segment falls apart  the better option would have simply been to not run the  story  at all  during this divisive time  people are angry enough as it is  they don t need manufactured scandals to feed the ugliness feature image via msnbc
