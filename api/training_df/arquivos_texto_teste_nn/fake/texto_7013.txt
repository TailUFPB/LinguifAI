florida governor rick scott isn t up for re election  his creepy  skeletor like appearance is secured through   his flip flopping political ideologies  war on women s health care and ridiculous rules forbidding state workers from so much as saying the words  climate change  aren t going anywhere  his refusal to expand medicaid because his own state s failures serve as some kind of an imaginary warning sign is set in stone why  then  did the most powerful man in the sunshine state feel it necessary to have a youtube ad produced attacking the woman who recently called him out for being an a  hole  because he is an a  hole  why else  poor ricky decided to go the route of butthurt little toddler who was scolded by his mother in public  causing him to hold his breath until someone made it right his pac obliged  of course  most likely fearful that he would don his grim reaper outfit and send them to the depths of hell with a touch from his evil sickle   let s get working produced a one minute video  naming the woman the  latte liberal  and attacking her for  sitting around coffee shops complaining and demanding public assistance   in case you haven t seen the interaction between them  enjoy  crypt keeper scott could only stand there and take credit for the economy recovering from a recession his state s housing market bubble helped create with that disturbing smile on his face that is rumored to consume the souls of small children and fluffy kittens scott answers her criticism with  we ve a million new jobs   yes  that s true  unfortunately  far too many of those jobs will serve to lift unemployed people up and dump them into the  medicaid gap  of income between qualifying for medicaid and subsidies for the health care marketplace  scott didn t have anything to say about the signing of archaic abortion laws and deep budget cuts to any clinic that provides any abortion services  including planned parenthood that video has gone viral  with more than  million views  and for poor little ricky  that just couldn t stand  he felt the need to release this attack on a woman who clearly had the interests of the average person in mind when she gave him a piece of her mind the answer to criticism from a republican governor is about as stereotypical as can be nowadays  the ad s narrator calls her names and dumps rhetoric about how many jobs have been created in a state whose economic growth and unemployment numbers basically mirror that of the rest of the country then they find it more appealing to attack her political views rather than address the issue of healthcare  because all those people who want silly things like affordable ways to see a doctor are just lazy whiners looking for public assistance rick scott  as usual  is completely disconnected from the reality of the people he  serves  featured image from screen capture
