we all rely on the media every day to know what s going on in our world  many media sources these days have an opinion informing the content they provide  but the majority usually try to avoid outright lying about things  that doesn t seem to be the case in what s happening right now in oregon there is an ongoing armed insurrectionist seizure of a federal building happening at the malheur national wildlife refuge hq in oregon  depending on what news source you rely on for your  facts   you might be unaware of the reality of the situation to bring you up to speed  dwight hammond    and steven hammond    lit fires in an attempt to protect some of their property from invasive plant species  they ended up burning federal land   twice  their actions netted them an eventual conviction for arson  which they served time for  after they were released  their sentences from a previous judge were found to be illegal   due to them being too short for the minimum sentencing requirements   and they were sent back to jail for longer sentences  the second conviction is what set off the protests  and caused cliven bundy s idiot militia to take up arms  to be fair  the hammonds never asked anybody for help  especially not the bundys here is where this all takes an incredibly weird turn  many media outlets have been picking up this story  but the major ones are pants on fire lying about the event below is an excerpt from the fox news reporting of the situation  remember  fox news  article published at   midnight at the earliest some local residents feared the saturday rally would involve more than speeches  flags and marching  but the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs  flowers and pennies as marchers reached the courthouse  they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door  their message  civilians were buying back their government  after the march passed  two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies a few blocks away  hammond and his wife susan greeted marchers  who planted flower bouquets in the snow  they sang some songs  hammond said a few words  and the protesters marched back to their cars dwight hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison jan   as ordered by the judge source  fox newsbelow are excerpts from oregon live  this is the exact story fox news credited at the bottom of their article for the information in their reporting  oregon live s story was posted with the updates on weapons and threats of violence at   pm and again at   am in phone interviews from inside the occupied building saturday night  ammon bundy and his brother  ryan bundy  said they are not looking to hurt anyone  but they would not rule out violence if police tried to remove them  they said  the facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the hammonds   ammon bundy said  we re planning on staying here for years  absolutely   he added   this is not a decision we ve made at the last minute  neither man would say how many people are in the building or whether they are armed  ryan bundy said there were no hostages  but the group is demanding that the hammonds be released and the federal government relinquish control of the malheur national forest he said many would be willing to fight   and die  if necessary   to defend what they see as constitutionally protected rights for states  counties and individuals to manage local lands source  oregonlive combelow is a video of oregon live s local news coverage   the people walking around in combat gear carrying long rifles

january     let s call this for what it is  these are three major news outlets that operate   with up to date breaking coverage on everything   except this one story  all of the articles were posted at a time equal to or later than the local news which covered the full details   including the part about the guns and threats of violence  all three news sites credited the local news but chose not to report what the local news actually said  even mischaracterizing it from social media  this was not a journalistic mistake  this was corporate media propaganda  i would be any amount of money if a group of armed minority citizens seized a federal building  coverage would be vastly different featured image  custom image via wikicommons
