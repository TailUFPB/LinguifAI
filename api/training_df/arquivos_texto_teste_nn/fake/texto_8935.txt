either ammon bundy himself or a clever imposter has taken twitter   and the media   by storm  the head of the oregon moron militia  bundy is the textbook case of the modern  murican  patriot   he is either just being himself and having a twitter fest of spewing out right wing talking points or someone has decided to channel him  guessing the bundy esque things he might say the rant was late night  when the cold of the oregon forest may have demanded a little something to make a person forget what aches  more than a dozen tweets went out from the account  including a retweet of an interview bundy did with a local blog  here are a few examples as thomas paine said  it is the duty of the patriot to protect its country from its government   citizensforconstitutionalfreedom  ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january    are not about fear  we are not about force  we are not about intimidation   citizensforconstitutionalfreedom  ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january    came here in protest because of the force and the intimidation that we have seen in this county   citizensforconstitutionalfreedom  ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january    that being said  we will not be intimidated by the federal government for taking stand for something we strongly believe in   ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january    even went so far as to compare the moron militia to rosa parks we are doing the same thing as rosa parks did  we are standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom   ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january     reporters now say the account is believed to be a fake  tony dokoupil of msnbc tweeted this people  ammon bundy is not operating a twitter account  i stood with him last night as tweets supposedly from him went out   tonydokoupil   tonydokoupil  january    seems to be compelling enough  a reporter who was there at the time says bundy isn t on twitter at all  that seemed like the case for sure when the account was suspended by twitter  which has a process of verifying identities of celebrities and others in the news  then usa today reported that the account was suspended and that it was re instated another theory may be that much like many people on twitter who have become public figures  ammon bundy has someone  smarter  than he is running his account  with all the freedoming and interviews he s doing  bundy probably doesn t have time for the social media onslaught for the movement  which has obviously been even less successful than the movement itself alas  the account is still alive and well and as of wednesday at just after  am est tweeted this the last thing we want is an armed confrontation  we want this to end peacefully without anyone being harmed   ammon bundy   ammonbundy  january    s the first real evidence that the account may not be real unless ammon bundy s goal of remaining for years to give a bird preserve to loggers  miners and ranchers has changed  or maybe he s just cold featured image via twitter
