if you ve been on the email list for president obama  as well as the democratic national committee  then you probably woke up to an email this morning from the president  for the most part  he s kept quiet in regards to who he would like as the person to come after him as commander in chief  there s been speculation  but nothing definitive  and to be honest that s really best  whoever wins should win on their own merits however  in the email sent out  president obama told it like it is  he gets directly to the point and lets us know that we cannot  no matter what  allow a republican to win the white house  their divisive and hateful rhetoric is absolutely un american  yet  more to the point  the president points out that the democrats have two fantastic choices  and that no matter what their differences may be  they actually share more in ideology than they disagree here s the president s message in a few months  i ll be heading into the voting booth to cast my vote for the next president of the united states  and  like so many of you  i ve spent this primary observing the candidates and the parties  and what they represent and i have to say  this has been a difficult period for the republicans  they re trying to figure out what they re standing for   whether they will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods  whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws but the good news for democrats is that we know what we believe  we believe that climate change is real and that we must do something about it  we believe in raising the minimum wage  and that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job  we believe that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants  we believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect  no matter their race or religion  gender or sexual orientation we have two fine democratic candidates who  no matter their differences  share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party  and in november  we re going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president thanks barack obamahe then asks us to pledge to vote for a democrat this november and say  you re in   and while there will definitely be folks who disagree  because they wanted their candidate to win the primary  the bigger picture is what everyone needs to keep in mind we simply cannot allow a republican back into the oval office  the last time we did  or rather the supreme court did   we ended up with two unfunded wars  one of which was based on lies  and a recession that brought us to the brink of utter collapse  we ve come too far to turn back now we need to pull together for the good of the nation  let s listen to president obama and follow his lead  and come november  vote blue no matter who featured photo by mark wilson getty images
