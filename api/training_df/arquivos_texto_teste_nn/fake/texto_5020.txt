jayme liardi makes no secret of the fact that he s isolationistic and xenophobic  and also seems to support  or at least sympathize with  nazi ideology  that s not hyperbole   he actually does at least appear to be sympathetic to the nazis  if not an outright supporter now he s created a group for young trump fans and other young xenophobic conspiracy theorists with a name that bears a striking resemblance to the hitler youth  it s called the trump youth  while they don t mention trump s name anywhere other than in their own name  the purpose is clear  donald trump represents an end to globalism  an end to multiculturalism  and an end to what liardi clearly sees as the myth of equality in a video he s made for the trump youth  he speaks of the parasites that we must throw off our backs  these parasites  they want war  they want destruction  they want slavery  and they re getting it  and unless we hold them accountable  unless we take justice into our own hands  and throw these parasites off our backs  the world will come to chaos   he goes on to preach fear about the  new world order   which is made up of the globalists that are trying to destroy the world  watch his entire fear laced spiel below  the trump youth are the  hero generation  what does that whole thing sound like  it s not just that liardi sees globalists as parasites  nazis considered the jews to be parasites that fed on society  and were the root of their problems from the end of wwi  into wwii  in this war for the very existence of the german people  we must daily remind ourselves that jewry unleashed this war against us  as early as  the f hrer said   we were also those who for the first time made major efforts to explain to the people a danger that had crept up on us  and which millions of people did not recognize  even though it threatened to ruin us all  the danger of the jews the german people has recognized that the jew has crept in like a parasite not only into our people  but into all the peoples of the earth  and that it is attempting to corrupt the original racial characteristics of the peoples in order to destroy them both racially and as states  and thereby rule over them   on his own website  liardi says of wwii  wwii was a turning point in human history  a battle of opposite ideologies  nationalism vs globalism  international communism vs  nazism our world today is the world of the victors  the world of the so called allies on one path you have globalism  this is the world of capitalism communism  the world of blind  equality   all races  cultures and ethnicities are the same  the sexes are the same  each individual is essentially the same  in our sameness  in our equality we are all one homogenous goop  rootless and without an identity  able to be exploited by the tyrants  our alleged representatives that we have in power today  if you have no identity  one will be installed into you by the kosher forces of the state   so there you have it  a blond haired  fair skinned young man trying to create a group to fight for the same nationalism for which the nazis fought  that he calls the group the trump youth indicates he may be a white supremacist himself  since it s evocative of the hitler youth and since trump has received endorsements and support from known white supremacists  but don t call them that  they don t like it  liardi is definitely a racist  a nationalist  and a conspiracy theorist  and he wants to gather other xenophobic racists to bring trump s ideology to fruition  possibly even if trump doesn t get electedfeatured image via screen capture from embedded video
