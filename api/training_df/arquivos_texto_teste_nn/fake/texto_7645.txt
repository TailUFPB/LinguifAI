yes  this actually happened during a panel discussion on meet the press on sunday  detroit free press reporter stephen henderson explained how republicans are not believable when they try to distance themselves from donald trump s racist hate speech because they have been doing it for decades in coded language and through the policies they push there s also a substantive credibility problem here   henderson said  i mean  you have republicans saying   trump is not one of us   and yet  a lot of the things that he s saying are said in coded language by other republicans  i wrote a column last week about paul ryan  for instance  saying   this is not a party that preys on people s prejudices  and yet  you can think of lots of examples of republicans doing exactly that  going back to ronald reagan  giving a states  rights speech in neshoba county  mississippi  in   this goes on all the time in coded ways  trump is saying some of these things more explicitly  and that makes them  you know  it makes you uncomfortable too and that made the old conservative white lady next to henderson angry  so she expressed her desire to choke him because how dare he call out republicans for being racist  and what about all those poor white supremacists who people unfairly refer to as bigots  no  it doesn t make me uncomfortable  it just makes me want to choke you because it s ridiculous and it s the creation of trump   said former reagan and george w  bush consultant mary matalin  because conservatives do not consider themselves bigots or homophobes or misogynists  okay  what cruz won at cpac  and he won overwhelmingly  he is expanding the electorate by bringing like minded libertarians  young people  trump is expanding the electorate by getting people who are sick of being called bigots  because they want to secure the border  this is not a race race  okay  let s not go there  let that sink in for a second  matalin actually expects us to believe that conservatives are not the racist  sexist homophobes that we all see them as   even though they have persecuted gays with anti gay laws and hateful rhetoric  persecuted women with draconian laws meant to take away a woman s right to make decisions about their own reproductive health along with denying women pay equality  and have made it quite clear that they hate black people due to the way they have treated the first black president over the last seven years  and that s just the tip of the iceberg henderson laughed at matalin s desire to choke him  however  it didn t sound like she was joking  but he responded anyway  in disagreement  of course  i think it is  i mean  i think there s no question that what he is doing is appealing to race  and republicans have done that for a long time  here s the video via crooks and liars i m sure the republican party is pleased that at least one of their pawns is still brainwashed enough to believe that conservatives are somehow a diverse lot who care about the plight of women  minorities  and gay people even though the gop has done nothing to help any of these groups  all they have done is attack them in an effort to take away their rights  and if they had their way  henderson wouldn t be allowed to speak unless a white person gave him permission to do so  featured image via screen capture
