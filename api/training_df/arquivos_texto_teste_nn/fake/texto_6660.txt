the hopes and dreams of millions of bigots finally came true when three cops on a power trip confronted a lesbian in a public restroom and shoved her outside  why  because they  thought  she was a guy in a video titled  lesbian harassed and forced to leave a public restroom because the police insist she s a man  three officers  two males and a female  can be seen in a public women s restroom telling a woman referred to her friends as a  dyke  that she has to leave  this is despite the fact that several of her friends are standing right there telling the cops that she is  in fact  a girl now to be fair to the cops  the woman in question didn t have id and was dressed like a guy because women never do that in america  completely unheard of  and  even worse  she was fairly flat chested and that s something else that s simply inconceivable  everyone knows that woman always have curves so you can identify them as chicks  so  clearly  there was absolutely no way the cops could know whether or not this was a woman other than  you know  the woman and her friends saying that she was  but since when do whiny civilians know better than the police  frankly  i m surprised they didn t force her to drop her pants to prove it here s the disturbing video this is exactly the kind of prejudice republicans have been hoping to inspire with their  bathroom laws   they know that people only need the thinnest of justifications to vent their hate and we see here the result  as far as i m concerned  the cops knew damn well that she wasn t a man or they would have arrested her  that they didn t even threaten it tells me that bullying was the intent and nothing else  again  exactly what republicans wanted the right has lost the culture war against the lgbt community and what we re witnessing now is the last desperate attempts by bigots to turn back the clock to  better times   i hope this woman sues the crap out of the police for violating her civil rights and they all lose their jobs  we have enough power tripping assholes on the streets as it is featured image via screencap
