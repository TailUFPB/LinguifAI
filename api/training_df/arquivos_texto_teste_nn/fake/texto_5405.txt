donald trump has long insisted that he is going to build a massive wall along the u s mexico border  and force the mexican government to pay for it  most people  regardless of political affiliations  find the idea to be nothing short of absurd  well  trump is determined  and now he has explained that mexico will pay for that wall or else abc news reports that trump details his plan for the wall on his campaign website  and boy is it a doozy of bullying and strongman tactics  trump s campaign says  it s an easy decision for mexico  make a one time payment of  to  billion dollars to ensure that  billion continues to flow into their country year after year  the cash flow to mexico that trump is rambling on about here is a reference to mexican immigrants living in america who wire money to help relatives in their native country  this is clearly something trump doesn t like  he calls the practice of helping one s family financially if said family happens to live in mexico  de facto welfare for poor families in mexico   because of course he does  how will he stop people from wiring money  well  he ll force each and every person who wishes to transfer any money at all to mexico to prove to the government that they are here in the u s  by legal means  never mind the massive undertaking such an operation would be  of course  what trump wants  trump gets if that isn t shocking enough for you  there s more  trump says that if that isn t enough to make mexico bankroll his silly wall  then he will turn to  canceling visas   which is something he wants to do anyway because he calls the issuing of visas to mexican nationals one of our greatest leverage points  in this whole insane border wall plan if the threatening of the visas of mexican nationals currently in the united states and all the other nonsense he s laid out here doesn t force mexico to submit to the donald s authoritarian plan  then  by god  he ll jack the prices of visas and that will finance the wall to keep all those mexicans from immigrating to the united states if this so called  policy  plan doesn t tell people how insanely dangerous donald trump is  there s nothing that will  this is  on a legal level  questionable at best  and most likely flat out illegal  but it s donald trump  and laws and the constitution don t really seem to matter to him when it comes to his insane policies that target all the people he doesn t like make no mistake  this man is dangerous  and has no business anywhere near the white house featured image via joe raedle getty images
