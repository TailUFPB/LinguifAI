you have to love this  a florida man greeted president trump today with a question that the president told him to ask the press   where was obama on the last hurricane   then he answered his own question   obama was playing golf during the last hurricane remember that  obama didn t want to interrupt his vacation to travel to see hurricane survivors not one peep from michelle either  what a difference a presidency makes flashback to martha s vineyard   where was president obama when the most serious natural disaster happened during his  years in office  he was golfing on martha s vineyard  and refused to leave his golfing vacation to assess the situation president obama is stirring resentment over his refusal to interrupt his martha s vineyard vacation to survey the louisiana flood   the worst u s  natural disaster since    while drawing comparisons to president george w  bush s hotly criticized response to hurricane katrina in the same state homeland security secretary jeh johnson defended mr  obama at a press conference thursday  insisting that the president is  closely monitoring  the situation but that he will not cut short his two week breather in the tony massachusetts resort  the president can t be everywhere   mr  johnson told reporters in denham springs  louisiana louisiana gov  john bel edwards  a democrat  backed him up  saying at the press conference that he is  not complaining in any way about our federal partnership  even so  mr  obama s lack of urgency is drawing unflattering parallels to the federal response in   when mr  bush was branded as uncaring and even racist for not touching down during a flyover two days after hurricane katrina    washington times
