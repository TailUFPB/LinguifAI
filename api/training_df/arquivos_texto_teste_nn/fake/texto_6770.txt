the plans for the republican convention have suffered an embarrassing snag  because the country s leading and most renowned performers are refusing to play at the event  in short  the gop is being boycotted by america s finest entertainers and performers the gop planned a concert on july  to kick off their convention  but performers are simply refusing to play ball  seemingly after a number of rejections  the party got desperate and tried to trick performers into playing by selling the gig as a benefit for veterans  they managed to convince eagles singer songwriter joe walsh to play under this ruse  but when walsh rumbled their plans  he immediately pulled out and issued a furious statement  it was my understanding that i was playing a concert which was a non partisan event to benefit the families of american veterans on monday  july  in cleveland  the admat i approved said this specifically  today it was announced that this event is  in fact  a launch for the republican national convention  in addition  my name is to be used to raise sponsorship dollars for convention related purposes  therefore  i must humbly withdraw my participation in this event with apologies to any fans or veterans and their families that i might disappoint i am very concerned about the rampant vitriol  fear mongering and bullying coming from the current republican campaigns  it is both isolationist and spiteful  i cannot in good conscience endorse the republican party in any way  i will look at doing a veteran related benefit concert later this year  and joe walsh wasn t alone  powerpop legends cheap trick told the guardian they were also offered a staggering amount of cash by the gop to play the convention  but also turned it down as a matter of principle   they explained  the republican national committee called our office and offered us    to play at their convention in cleveland   we turned it down  then we had second thoughts  maybe we should have accepted it   but we would all have got swastika guitars made  at this rate the gop convention will be rocking it out to ted nugent  followed by a chuck norris marital arts display  the party is now so toxic  even formerly open conservative performers won t taint themselves by association featured image via flickr creative commons
