on monday  president obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws  republicans  predictably  went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional   in the world of the gop gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever  ever try to make this country a safer place because  freedom one day after announcing his executive action on gun laws  president obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action  the president was introduced by mark barden  whose son daniel was killed in the  massacre at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut  and when obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation  callous republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new speaker of the house paul ryan was one of those people speaker paul ryan  r wis   spoke to yahoo news s katie couric  on thursday  where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on tuesday  the republican responded  i was affected by it  but i thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when james foley was beheaded  when san bernardino and paris occurred  that s the kind of reaction i had when those occurred  really  he can t understand why the news of twenty first graders being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional  these children  six and seven years old  were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them  they were literally riddled with bullets  all of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying  but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small  but paul ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry  okay ryan wasn t done yet  he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction   what i think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies i think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating isis as he is in trying to frustrate the law abiding citizens  second amendment rights  this scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems  as if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal  he thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical isis fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists   why  because going after  law abiding  citizens like dylann roof  adam lanza and the hundreds of other white american terrorists we have in this country is tyranny  seems legit ryan opened his mouth and proved to us  once again  why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next november  if we sit at home  we are just giving the gun nuts of america  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones  we are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us  the united states has become a war zone and the weapons of choice are as easy to buy as toilet paper  how scary is that  murica featured image via gage skidmore
