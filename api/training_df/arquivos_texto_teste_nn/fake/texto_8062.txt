it was only hours after supreme court justice antonin scalia s death was confirmed that senate republicans threatened to block any nominee that president barack obama might try to fill scalia s seat with  most notably  majority leader mitch mcconnell and republican presidential candidate ted cruz have spoken out against the president s obligation to nominate a replacement but not every republican is brainless  as one prominent goper verified on monday in an interview with cnn s chris cuomo  alberto gonzales  the attorney general under george w  bush  is speaking out against mcconnell and the gop to throw his support behind obama  in the interview  gonzales said  i know there s a big debate going on right now about whether or not obama should nominate someone  from my perspective having worked at the white house and the department of justice  there s just no question in my mind that as president of the united states  you have an obligation to fill a vacancy  gonzales continued  giving republicans a not so subtle hint to get the hell out of obama s way and let him do what he was elected to do  i suspect president obama is going to do his job  and after he does his job and nominating a hopefully qualified individual  the senate will do its job eventually on its own calendar  the bottom line from my perspective  is the president has to do his job in nominating a qualified individual and then the senate does it s job in assessing whether or not this person is qualified for a lifetime appointment on the court based upon experience  based upon ideology and based upon integrity  clearly disappointed in the circus his party has become  gonzales leveled the gop and slammed the hypocrisy of his conservative colleagues in trying to prevent obama from seeking a nominee  he said  if the shoe were on the other foot  and there was a republican in the white house and democratically controlled congress  i would expect the republican president to make a nomination when ready  you can watch gonzales in action below one of the gop s nominee blocking tactics has been to claim that obama can t fill a supreme court seat in an election year   which is completely false  scotusblog specifically says that there is no tradition of leaving a supreme court seat vacant because of an election year  the historical record does not reveal any instances since at least  of the president failing to nominate and or the senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election  whether the senate republicans like it or not  obama is determined to choose a nominee next week  featured image from video screen capture
