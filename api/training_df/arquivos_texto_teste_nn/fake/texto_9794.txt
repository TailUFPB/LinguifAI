show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance   soeiro added trump s package reportedly included such seuss classics as  green eggs and ham    the cat in the hat  and  one fish  two fish  red fish  blue fish  soeiro criticized seuss for being the only author represented in trump s donation  citing controversy over some of his illustrations  you may not be aware of this  but dr  seuss is a bit of a clich   a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature   she told trump  another fact that many people are unaware of is that dr  seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda  caricatures  and harmful stereotypes  according to the school library journal when social justice warrior  lizz phipps soeiro isn t influencing the minds of young children with her progressive drivel  she s working to influence the minds of the parents  once a week  she invites a speaker for casual meetings with parents at the library  guests have included the mayor  school committee members  and local artists  following president trump s executive order banning travel from six muslim nations  she invited a representative from the council on american islamic relations and an attorney from the muslim justice league to speak to an audience including some  muslim families about their rights  the lawyer met with individual families afterward  the library s collection reflects phipps soeiro s commitment to social justice  titles such as margarita engle s drum dream girl and debbie levy and elizabeth baddeley s i dissent  ruth bader ginsburg makes her mark spark discussions about government and fairness  during a field trip to city hall  students sat in council chambers and asked questions of city leaders  so in other words  a donation of books from the wife of our republican president just didn t fit into the public school library that employs a narrow minded liberal librarian  the cambridge school system on wednesday released a statement noting the opinions soeiro expressed do not represent the district  in this instance  the employee was not authorized to accept or reject donated books on behalf of the school or school district   it said  we have counseled the employee on all relevant policies  including the policy against public resources being used for political purposes    circaso there you have it the librarian is being  counseled  and not fired if this story happened two years ago  and we inserted michelle obama s name into the story instead of melania trump s  does anyone think this would be a major news story with the school librarian s face plastered all over every major news network liz phipps soeiro can be found on twitter at   cportspecialhere is the nasty letter that was written by liz phipps soeiro in reply to melania trump s sweet gesture dear mrs  trump thank you for the ten dr  seuss titles that you sent my school library in recognition of this year s national read a book day   sent second day air  no less  that must have been expensive   i m proud that you recognized my school as something special  it truly is  our beautiful and diverse student body is made up of children from all over the world  from different socioeconomic statuses  with a spectrum of gender expressions and identities  with a range of abilities  and of varied racial  ethnic  and religious backgrounds  according to the white house website  you selected one school per state by  working with the department of education to identify schools with programs that have achieved high standards of excellence  recognized by state and national awards and blue ribbon awards  each of those carefully vetted schools received ten books  seuss isms   because a little bug went kachoo  what pet should i get   the cat in the hat  i can read with my eyes shut   one fish  two fish  red fish  blue fish  the foot book  wacky wednesday  green eggs and ham  and oh  the places you ll go   my students were interested in reading your enclosed letter and impressed with the beautiful bookplates with your name and the indelible white house stamp  however  we will not be keeping the titles for our collection  i d like to respectfully offer my explanation            my school and my library are indeed award winning  i work in a district that has plenty of resources  which contributes directly to  excellence   cambridge  massachusetts  is an amazing city with robust social programming  a responsive city government  free all day kindergarten  and well paid teachers  relatively speaking   many of us can t afford to live in the city in which we teach   my students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science  multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance  the american association of school librarians has a great infographic on these findings  many schools around the state and country can t compete  yearly per pupil spending in cambridge is well over     our city s values are such that given a huge range in the socioeconomic status of our residents  we believe that each and every child deserves the best free education possible and are working hard to make that a reality  most classrooms maintain a   split between free reduced lunch and paid lunch   this offers our title i school and the district a lot of privilege and room for programming and pedagogy to foster  high standards of excellence   even so  we still struggle to close the achievement gap  retain teachers of color  and dismantle the systemic white supremacy in our institution  but hell  we test well  and in the end  it appears that data   and not children   are what matters  meanwhile  school libraries around the country are being shuttered  cities like philadelphia  chicago  and detroit are suffering through expansion  privatization  and school  choice  with no interest in outcomes of children  their families  their teachers  and their schools  are those kids any less deserving of books simply because of circumstances beyond their control  why not go out of your way to gift books to underfunded and underprivileged communities that continue to be marginalized and maligned by policies put in place by secretary of education betsy devos  why not reflect on those  high standards of excellence  beyond only what the numbers suggest  secretary devos would do well to scaffold and lift schools instead of punishing them with closures and slashed budgets so  my school doesn t have a need for these books  and then there s the matter of the books themselves  you may not be aware of this  but dr  seuss is a bit of a clich   a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature  as first lady of the united states  you have an incredible platform with world class resources at your fingertips  just down the street you have access to a phenomenal children s librarian  dr  carla hayden  the current librarian of congress  i have no doubt dr  hayden would have given you some stellar recommendations another fact that many people are unaware of is that dr  seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda  caricatures  and harmful stereotypes  open one of his books  if i ran a zoo or and to think that i saw it on mulberry street  for example   and you ll see the racist mockery in his art  grace hwang lynch s school library journal article   is the cat in the hat racist  read across america shifts away from dr  seuss and toward diverse books   reports on katie ishizuka s work analyzing the minstrel characteristics and trope nature of seuss s characters  scholar philip nel s new book  was the cat in the hat black  the hidden racism of children s literature  and the need for diverse books  further explores and shines a spotlight on the systemic racism and oppression in education and literature  i am honored that you recognized my students and our school  i can think of no better gift for children than books  it was a wonderful gesture  if one that could have been better thought out  books can be a powerful way to learn about and experience the world around us  they help build empathy and understanding  in return  i m attaching a list of ten books  it s the librarian in me  that i hope will offer you a window into the lives of the many children affected by the policies of your husband s administration  you and your husband have a direct impact on these children s lives  please make time to learn about and value them  i hope you share these books with your family and with kids around the country  and i encourage you to reach out to your local librarian for more recommendations  warmly  liz phipps soeiro school librarian
