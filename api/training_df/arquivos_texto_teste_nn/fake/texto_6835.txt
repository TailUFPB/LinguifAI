the race is heating up as new york heads into their primary this coming tuesday  currently  polls have hillary clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points  clinton  who is ahead nationally by more than  pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates  will need to win her home state to continue momentum after sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks a new york win for clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs  and with that will come superdelegate support but the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the democratic primary  supporters who back vermont senator bernie sanders have decried the system  feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support supporters within the sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state but that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up  another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates  however  that hasn t stopped the demands  and it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism  either  while these delegates have been regarded as  shills    bought and paid for  and  establishment  one superdelegate wants to remind the nay sayers of one thing  they are still human senator tammy baldwin of wisconsin  congress  first openly lesbian senator  is also a superdelegate  and she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions  on msnbc s morning joe  the progressive senator claimed if sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in july  she will cast her vote for him  however  as clinton continues her popular vote lead  she s supporting the former secretary of state  she added  nervously  i am a human being and a superdelegate  to put it plainly  based on how the rules are set up  baldwin is free to vote her conscience  and her conscience says hillary clinton for now  those who back senator sanders point to the fact he beat clinton by  points in wisconsin  thus baldwin is somehow obligated to back him it is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who  in their own right  have been elected within the democratic party   whether it be a position within the dnc  or a senatorial  gubernatorial or representative position  it s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country baldwin hasn t reported any harassment  but other superdelegates have  one s  year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone  here s baldwin s appearance on msnbc   featured image via astrid riecken getty images
