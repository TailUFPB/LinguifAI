today  donald trump tried to walk back his recent comments regarding judge gonzalo curiel at an evangelical summit by proclaiming no one in the united states should be treated differently based on race as republican  and hispanic  commentator ana navarro said   too little  too late  it doesn t take a genius to see trump is of course lying  he  out of anyone  believes someone should be treated differently based on their race or skin color  and his comments regarding muslims  mexicans and  his  african american  supporter  shows that it remains to be seen how long it will take for the mainstream media to buy into his lies and the front he s now starting to put up  but hillary clinton and her allies are certainly doing their part to remind the american public not to buy into the hype  he s still a lying racist  and they can prove it compiling lists of trump s biggest lies from the washington post s  pinocchio  ratings and politifact s  truth o meter   pro clinton super pac correct the record has launched a new website  trumplies com  highlighting all of the republican nominee s lies  rants  conspiracy theories  and his deranged  inflated ego  talking to reporters  correct the record president brad woodhouse said  people think all politicians lie  well  donald trump is of a completely different order and it helps draw the entire picture of him being a fraud and a con man  a look at politifact s file on donald trump shows a staggering number  of the  statements that have been fact checked     percent  have been false  on average  more than three fourths of things that come out of his vile mouth are outright lies  often packed with hyperbole  stretched statistics  and no forethought whatsoever  he thinks he can say whatever he wants with no consequences the website not only calls out trump for his blatant lies  but offers strategic factual analysis to show how his promises cannot be met nor kept  example  it is impossible for trump to eliminate   trillion of debt in eight years  somehow his supporters think he can do it  but every possible avenue shows that it just can t happen  and his  big  beautiful wall  would actually cost way more than   billion so not only does trump lies point out his fibbing mouth  it blows up his stupid  pie in the sky  policy  ideas  too featured image via justin sullivan getty images
