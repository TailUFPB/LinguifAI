whenever donald trump has the opportunity to sell something  he s going to say whatever he needs to so it gets sold  this time around  trump is trying to sell himself to the american voting public so that he can pretend to be president  because the man doesn t have one bit of the necessary experience to actually do the job knowing republicans love their guns dearly  and clearly don t understand the constitution  he ll use that to his advantage  so  on twitter he tweets out what he said at a recent rally surrounding the second amendment of the constitution  and that s that people have the right to have guns  however  what he fails to do  and it can be pretty much guaranteed that it s on purpose  is talk about the first half of the amendment  nor the context of the necessity of the amendment for the time at hand and how it works with the rest of the constitution trump tweeted out  pandering to his base of voters who love their guns more than anything  the second amendment to our constitution is clear  the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon  the   to our constitution is clear  the right of the people to keep   bear arms shall not be infringed upon  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     the whole amendment reads  a well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed  yes  the state militias that were necessary at the time because the nation didn t have a standing  nationalized army  looking at article  section   it reads  to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union  suppress insurrections and repel invasions to provide for organizing  arming  and disciplining  the militia  and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states  reserving to the states respectively  the appointment of the officers  and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress  the second amendment arms those militias to be at the ready  being necessary to the security of a free state  in all honesty  the second amendment isn t really needed anymore now that we have our armed services  and if you think the amendment can t be removed or changed  well  you must also think alcohol is still illegal  the word amendment  quite literally  means change  oh  and if you think that you can fight back against the government if they restrict your gun use  think again  that would be insurrection  the very thing the second amendment arms against  and you would be tried for treason  see also  whiskey rebellion  all in all  trump is just playing into the naivety of his voting base and their love for their ever so precious guns  after all he s a businessman selling himself  and unfortunately  people are buying it featured photo by marc piscotty getty images
