oregon rep  peter defazio took federal authorities to the woodshed on the house floor over their failure to do their job and arrest the armed terrorists led by ammon bundy as you probably already know  bundy and his band of right wing militants illegally seized the malheur national wildlife refuge two weeks ago  ever since then  they ve destroyed government property  snooped through government files  struck fear into the hearts of the local citizens  and have broken several laws in the process  but law enforcement has done very little to remove the armed occupation  which is a stark contrast to the way law enforcement treats unarmed black men in this country and defazio wants that to change right now  the heat and the lights are on at the malheur wildlife refuge  illegally occupied by ultra rightwing anti government extremists  but you gotta wonder if the lights are on or is anybody home down there at the justice department   defazio said defazio then angrily demanded that federal authorities take down the militants and end the standoff so that people can move on with their lives  hello  i don t think there s anybody there  i believe that this illegal occupation  this destruction of federal property was directly emboldened by the fact that their father of the two leaders  cliven bundy  stood down the government two years ago when he owed a million dollars   other ranchers paid their grazing fees  he refuses to do it  and he was grazing in areas that were prohibited  and he stood down the government at the point of a gun  and he s still grazing and nobody  nobody at the justice department has seen fit to raise a finger against him he celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said  this is how it s done   and now his sons are replicating that in my state of oregon  where we abide by the laws  yeah  we disagree over a lot of federal policies  but we abide by the laws it s time for the justice department to take some action  wake up down there  here s the video via youtube indeed  so far  the only militants who have been arrested were caught driving a federal vehicle to town in search of snacks  meanwhile  the rest of the militants have been allowed to come and go as they please and they ve even been allowed to destroy federal fence lines and access government computers  furthermore  the militants broke the law by carrying firearms on federal property and their seizure of a government building is an act of domestic terrorism that should not be tolerated if this were a group of african americans or muslims  law enforcement would have already shot up the place and killed every one of them by now  but because these gunmen are white rednecks  authorities are treating them with kid gloves  which perfectly demonstrates that law enforcement truly has different rules for different people  these militants are costing taxpayers millions of dollars  and they are interrupting the daily lives of citizens who do not want them there  their actions are illegal and they should be treated like any other terrorist  it s time for law enforcement to do the job they are paid to do or they should resign in disgrace so that we can hire people who will actually do it featured image via screen capture
