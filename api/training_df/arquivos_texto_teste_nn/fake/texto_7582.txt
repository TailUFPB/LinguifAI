president  zero f cks left  obama strikes again after a reporter informed president obama that republicans are blaming him for donald trump taking over the gop primary  he literally had a good laugh and proceeded to lay out exactly how republicans brought the trump circus upon themselves  i have been blamed by republicans for a lot of things but being blamed for their primaries and who they re selecting for their party is novel   obama said as he and others chuckled president obama then stopped joking and took aim at republicans for not taking responsibility for the mess they created he pointed out that right wing media and republican leadership  have been feeding the republican base  for the last seven years  a notion that everything i do is to be opposed  that cooperation and compromise are a betrayal i don t think that i was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate  for example   obama continued  i don t remember saying   hey  why don t you ask me about that  or why don t you question whether i m american or whether i m loyal  or whether i have america s best interests at heart  those weren t prompted by any actions of mine  what you re seeing within the republican party  is to some degree  all of those efforts over a course of time creating an environment where somebody like a donald trump can thrive  he s just doing more of what has been done over the last seven and a half years  then president obama pointed out that trump s policies are no different than policies being pushed by ted cruz and marco rubio  the other two extremists in the gop presidential field  it s not as if there s a massive difference between mr  trump s position on immigration and mr  cruz s position on immigration  mr  trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it  but the actual positions are not that different  for that matter  they re not that different from mr  rubio s positions on immigration  despite the fact that both mr  cruz and mr  rubio  their own families are the result of immigration and the openness of our society  in the end  president obama dropped the hammer on republicans who are trying to wash their hands of any responsibility for what is happening to their own party by blaming him instead of themselves  what i m not going to do is to validate some notion that the republican crackup that s been taking place is a consequence of actions that i ve taken  there are thoughtful conservatives who are troubled by this i think it is very important for them to reflect on what it is about the politics they have engaged in that allows the circus that we ve been seeing to transpire  here s the video via youtube president obama made the remarks during a joint press conference with canadian prime minister justin trudeau on thursday featured image via video screen capture
