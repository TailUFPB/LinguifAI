if there s one conclusion to draw from the horrific shootings that have been happening over the course of this past week  it s that we  as a society  need to have more understanding and compassion for one another  no one deserves to die  especially not for merely existing  or protecting your community two black men were shot and killed by police officers who didn t even try to keep them alive for reasons yet to be determined  and five police officers were shot and killed  with seven more injured while serving and protecting protesters who were out voicing their concern over police brutality many have been offering their opinions on the violence that s been happening  but one voice of reason seems to really get at the heart of what needs to be heard  and that is the voice of senator elizabeth warren  d ma  the simple  yet solid truth of all the killings that have occurred over the past week was summed up in this tweet by warren  black americans shouldn t be killed in routine traffic stops  and police shouldn t be killed while protecting and serving their communities  black americans shouldn t be killed in routine traffic stops    police shouldn t be killed while protecting   serving their communities   elizabeth warren   senwarren  july    s really that simple  we can be on both sides of this issue and not be against the other side  we can have compassion for the rights of black americans to exist without fear of being shot and killed by the police  and we can also have compassion for police officers who are merely trying to protect the community they serve we need to stand up to and against violence wherever it is  period featured image via win mcnamee getty images
