thus far  the oregon militia members who have occupied the federal building of a wildlife reserve are facing absolutely no threat of action being taken against them by government officials  nonetheless  at least one of them has admitted that  he actually went to join these domestic terrorists with the intention of dying in a standoff  and subsequent statements and actions have shown that the others are likely thinking along those same lines  for instance  at least one of the militiamen has actually taken the time to film and upload a goodbye video to his family and other loved ones  while the videos are serious and tearful to the right wing loons  they are nothing short of hilarious to those of us who aren t completely insane  here is the one from known domestic terrorist and muslim hater jon ritzheimer  honestly  if this loon cared about his children that much  he d realize that missing the entire holiday season for this nonsense is doing them a tremendous disservice  all in the name of  what  wanting to be above the law  wanting to die as some kind of  free man   i don t think that means what he thinks it means take your meds and go home  mr  ritzheimer  even if you don t die there  you ll likely spend a lengthy stretch of time in federal prison for these ridiculous antics  either way  your children need you home  not out terrorizing and occupying government facilities  if you knew anything about being a good father  you d know that  then again  those kids would be better off not being raised by such a loon anyway  good luck to them  they ll need it featured image via video screen capture
