with all the talk of trump working on his list of potential vp picks  it s only natural that absolutely everyone under the sun would have an opinion or two about it  however  fox news editor chris stirewalt s opinion should never have been uttered  he wants the king of dunces to choose his own daughter  ivanka  for vp why  well  stirewalt no doubt thinks this is a good enough reason  my favorite pick   my absolutely favorite pick  i think   is his daughter ivanka  i think that is the best choice that he could make   he said   everybody likes her  has anybody ever said that they didn t like her  everybody likes her  i think he would be smart to pick his own daughter  when it s a crazy election year  when weird stuff is happening  you gotta embrace the weird  yeah  that would be weird all right  way too weird  this is a man who is potentially a pedophile  and who has openly discussed screwing ivanka multiple times  recommending that he  embrace the weird  takes on a whole different and creepy vibe when put together with how disgusting his royal womanizer is watch stirewalt turn horribly gross below of course  charles payne agreed that ivanka would be a fantastic choice  she d definitely be one of the only women in his royal incestness  inner circle  making the choice even more sickening  that an editor would actually suggest this shows how low fox news is sinking to tout donald trump featured image via screen capture from embedded video
