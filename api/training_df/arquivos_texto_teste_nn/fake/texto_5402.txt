after two very high profile mass shootings of police  which followed two very high profile shootings of black men by police  lafayette  louisiana sheriff louis ackal is scared and despite being under federal indictment  he wants his guns back ackal is not a good guy  at least if you believe the indictments against him  he and his second in command  lt  col  gerald savoy  are accused of orchestrating the beatings of five pre trial inmates in areas where video cameras couldn t catch them prosecutors allege ackal directed deputies to assault the inmates   three in connection with a lewd comment to a deputy  one for writing letters complaining about jail conditions and a fifth for no stated reason   and was present in the chapel for at least one of the beatings source  the advocateeight inmates have died in the jail  one  the death of victor white iii is under federal investigation  and reverend victor white sr   the father of the victim  says all evidence points to the fact that his son was beaten to death  ackal was asked to step down  and his response was  it ll be a cold day in hell when i resign  here s a video even beyond those accusations  ackal is accused of antisemitic attacks against a federal prosecutor  calling him  jew bastard   and saying he s shoot the prosecutor between his  jewish eyes  according to a transcript of portions of the recording filed into the court record  ackal made reference to  this sorry son of a bitch jew bastard in washington  saying he is going to send me to a federal pen  ackal also talks about how prosecutors discussed a possible deal with the sheriff  you know about these people  you can give them to us   ackal said  recalling what federal prosecutors told him   i said the only thing i m gonna give you   f     g shoot you right between your g       d jewish eyes look like opossum bastard  no one is denying he made the threat source  the advocatein fact  his only defense was that his words were said in a  fit of anger   as if no one has ever done anything violent in a  fit of anger   because of his fit of anger  and the alleged beatings of the inmates  ackal s guns were taken away and now he says he s a  sitting duck  in a court document filed this week  an attorney for the sheriff also claimed there was a threat made recently against a deputy  though the threat against the deputy was not carried out   the atmosphere in this country  especially in south louisiana  makes this a very realistic possibility   attorney john mclindon wrote  in view of what s happening across the country    i think it s wrong that i  as a police officer  am told that i can t carry a gun even though i ve not been convicted of anything   ackal said tuesday it s absurd  but so very american  that this powder keg of a sheriff thinks he s entitled to his guns  despite what he s said and has allegedly done  it s doubtful that civilians  especially those of color  would ever get their guns back under similar circumstances  but this bigoted sheriff expects that his badge will give him special privileges  which is really a metaphor for our militarized police force if ackal is really in danger  which is possible given the accusations against him  a judge should put him in protective custody  either that  or give him back his guns and put the rest of the country in protective custody featured image via klfy video screen capture
