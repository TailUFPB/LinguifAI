espn just made an amazing stand against bigotry on the airwaves  by firing one of it s top name hosts for being anti transgender  curt schilling just got handed his pink slip schilling has worked for the network since  and is one of baseball s best known commentators and analysts  but recently  schilling decided to share a facebook post in support of an antitransgender bill passed in north carolina the post insisted of an image  featuring a man in a wig  his t shirt cut to expose breasts  and a bizarre black outfit of women s clothing  the image was accompanied by text which read  let him in  to the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow minded  judgmental  unloving racist bigot who needs to die  former player schilling then added  a man is a man no matter what they call themselves  i don t care what they are  who they sleep with  men s room was designed for the penis  women s not so much  now you need laws telling us differently  pathetic  espn later issued a statement claiming schilling s  unacceptable conduct  violated their policy of inclusiveness  espn is an inclusive company  curt schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with espn has been terminated  of course  for those in conservative circles  this was another attack of political correctness which prejudices conservatives from exercising their rights of free speech  according to david hookstead at the daily caller  schilling s firing was part of some exodus of conservative media pundits the former red sox pitcher has been very open about his conservative views in the past  he was previously suspended by espn for comparing isis to the nazis espn might have no problem getting rid of conservative pundits  but the network has tolerated extreme liberal positions in the past without firing anybody  espn employee tony kornheiser compared the tea party to isis and insinuated the tea party was attempting to  establish a caliphate  kornheiser is still cashing pay checks from espn what hookstead leaves out is that the tea party is a billionaire backed political movement with the express goal of creating a theocracy in the united states   that is federal and state law based on biblical law  on top of this  the vast majority of domestic terrorism in the us comes from white supremacists and christian zealots  these groups have murdered lgbt people for being gay who have lynched non whites and non christians  it is entirely comparable however  using a caricature of a cross dresser to invoke fear about transgender people using the gender identity appropriate bathroom is plain bigotry  one could just as readily argue the opposite  as transmen did en masse with the hashtag using the hashtag  wejustneedtopee  bearded transmen posted pictures of themselves in the women s bathroom  next to women entering cubicles and doing their makeup michael hughes  from minnesota  posted the picture below  asking   do i look like i belong in a women s bathroom under the north carolina law  michael would be legally compelled to use the women s bathrooms   despite the fact that he would clearly cause some degree of confusion and worry by doing so surely the long term answer is to remove the gender apartheid from toilets altogether  plenty of countries around the world do just fine using mixed bathrooms  why not us  featured image via twitter facebook
