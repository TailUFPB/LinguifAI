if john persinger wins the mayoral race in erie  pa   next month  it just might be the greatest local political upset in america this century  a republican candidate has not been elected mayor here since   when jfk was president tall  witty  energetic and razor sharp  persinger is not the guy you d expect to settle in a town like erie  he is the kind of person who leaves  moves on to blazing success elsewhere and never returns persinger s grandfather  john demarco  was the son of italian immigrants who was supposed to take over the family grocery store but instead went to medical school and ended up delivering more than   erie babies before he was born  persinger s parents moved to the suburbs outside new york city  but young john spent his summers with his grandparents in this port city in northwestern pennsylvania  he got his undergrad degree at harvard  where he was captain of the swim team  he also competed in the  us olympic team trials from there he served as an aide in the george w  bush white house and then chief of staff at the us embassy in australia  where he met his wife  a journalist fluent in arabic  he left government for notre dame law school  but when the couple started to have children  they decided erie held the most promise for their young family in many ways  they are correct  the city is affordable  the housing is charming  it is both a college town  there are three  mercyhurst  gannon and penn state behrend  and a tourist town  miles and miles of beaches along the lake   it boasts some of the top medical facilities in the country  and it is also a company town  erie insurance is one of the top employers  but it is also a struggling city  where schools are hurting financially  the opioid epidemic is rampant and the manufacturing base is collapsing   all factors that led erie county residents to vote for a republican president in   the first since ronald reagan the city of erie  however  is a different story   hillary clinton won all  of its voting districts over donald trump so can  year old persinger convince his townspeople to turn red  it s not impossible  and while he is nothing like the president in terms of temperament and style  the two politicians do share a key quality   tapping into voters  willingness for change  the fourth largest city in the state  erie has a population just under   and a   percent unemployment rate as persinger walked the shop floor of fralo industries  a sheet metal fabricating plant  he talked to each worker  asking what they were making  one young man said he was building a new invention for college dorms that puts laundry in a shoot and allows students to track its progress until it s ready for pickup in a pod  another worker was steering a high tech laser persinger gives each worker his full attention  nodding and taking notes  he seems unbothered by the fact he s a republican in a city with a nearly   democratic registration advantage  here  people are born blue it doesn t seem to ruffle him that his rival  democrat joe schember  is one of the nicest guys in the world and has been active in the community for over  years  plus  they re neighbors  they even live on the same street   everyone asks me about my odds  i am confident if i run a good  honest campaign  i can win   persinger said   i didn t take time away from my family and waste the time of voters       not to win  persinger is forward thinking and energetic  he drives around in a mobile campaign office  a  year old converted rv  with his name and photo shrink wrapped around the entire vehicle  he visits neighborhoods  churches  community centers  mosques  synagogues and knocks on doors where no democratic or republican mayoral candidate has been for decades  especially in the african american and hispanic communities and he listens  it is a trait that has not gone unnoticed in the black communities who for years have had their votes taken for granted by the democrats and ignored by the republicans just ask steve mclallen  who got a visit from persinger earlier this year   hey  i just want to let you know i appreciate your willingness to come and listen to our concerns   mclallen told persinger as he shook hands with the gop candidate   you have made an impression and impact on me  not just by traveling to our neighborhoods or where we work  but actually asking us what we need  a longtime democrat  mclallen said he is voting for persinger jim baer  meanwhile  is looking for new blood in the mayor s office  a welder at fralo  he s a democrat who did not vote for clinton or trump but is tired of the same old politics   look  we tried the old ways  we have had nothing but democrats running this city and managing the decline  it is time to place someone young with different ideas and the willingness to listen in charge   he said while neither candidate has invested in polling  both keep detailed data on their campaigns  voter outreach and they know this race is close  for entire story  nyp
