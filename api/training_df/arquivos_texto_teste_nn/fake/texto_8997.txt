the lieutenant governor of texas  dan patrick  appeared on meet the press with chuck todd on sunday to discuss his state s new open carry law  now  while we must say mr  patrick did a pretty good job at making it seem like he defended the merits of the law  in reality  all he did was provide outdated  heavily debunked statistics here s what dan patrick had to say about the relation of guns to crime data  everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns  crime is less  there s a study showing that where states have open carry  or concealed carry  but particulary open carry  crime is down    murders are down  even   having law abiding citizens having guns is a good thing  in fact  chuck  every one of the mass shootings except two in america since  have been gun free zones  where people have guns  bad guys don t go  lt  governor patrick doesn t cite his source in the interview  but given how he just said open carry causes crime to go down    we re going to assume he s referring to florida state rep  matt gaetz s  r fort walton beach  research  matt gaetz is the guy who came up with all this from when he sponsored a bill in october to allow open carry in his state during a press conference  he claimed to show research that proved violent crime was   percent lower in states that allowed open carry  and the murder rate was  percent lower   there are just a few problems with this  politifact decided to fact check this and determined that it was very misleading  for one  gaetz only used data for one full year  not very historical by any means  and compiled it in such a manner that would make it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion from  it noted that no policy makers should rely on it  yes  anyone can come up with stats  but that doesn t make them applicable  if a policy maker were to try then and use these stats to make the claim that this proves open carry laws make people safer  then that deserves the title of fake florida state university criminology professor gary kleck doesn t think you can use just one statistic to back up a claim when several other studies are proving otherwise  plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding having no net effect on crime rates  including violent crime rates  one way or the other  and  not only that but the opposite appears to be true  the washington post published an article entitled  more gun  more crime  new research debunks central thesis of the gun rights movement  in it  it points out how stanford law professor john donohue has advanced decades of analysis showing that guns do in fact equal more crime  so much for the texas lt  governor s argument that we need more guns to be safe  i guess this is what you get when you pick and choose your facts  heavily debunked ones at that featured image via screen capture
