very outspoken bernie sanders supporter seth macfarlane recently told the jason rantz show a few things he d like to see out of he fellow bernie supporters  the family guy creator knows that you can be fervent in your support for a candidate without losing sight of the bigger picture he said  i actually am one of the people who has been a little disappointed at the way that  not necessarily the campaign  the supporters of the campaign have treated hillary  i think she s been treated a little harshly by the left  then making a comparison with those on the right side of the aisle  a party who s lost their damn mind in regards to trump  a man who they are actually putting forward with all seriousness for president  macfarlane said  that party has lost some control  this is a guy who is the result of a lot of bigotry gone wild  on the other hand  my side  the left  has gotten a little unreasonable when it comes to separating the trivial from the profound  he added later  the problem is if we don t pick our battles  then we look unreasonable  and i think that s part of where trump has come from because we have not been able to separate things that are injustices from things that we re just offended by  and it s troubling  macfarlane seems to know that every ounce of hate thrown at hillary clinton is an ounce of ammunition that may be used later  he also knows that when there s no clear distinction between arguments that are serious versus those that are petty and ridiculous  it only serves to hurt the candidate you re trying to support  in essence  many bernie supporters are actually helping trump  because they re validating that same sort of rhetoric that is being seen from his supporters as well at the end of the day  we need to remember that a democrat needs to win the white house in november  whether that candidate is bernie sanders or hillary clinton  we need to vote blue no matter who  it s our best shot at retaining sanity within the oval office featured photo by kevork djansezian getty images
