ever the self absorbed  narcissistic candidate  donald trump has nevertheless been reduced to doing what every other candidate in any race does   sending out fundraising emails asking for donations  his first email  though  doesn t feel like a sincere attempt at raising money  instead  it s full of the same language he uses to talk about how great he is  with a little twist thrown in to remind everyone of how rich he is  too our three ring political circus began his very first fundraising email with this  i m going to help make it the most successful introductory fundraising email in modern political history by personally matching every dollar that comes in within the next  hours at most  that will raise   million  and only if everything goes exactly as planned  including the number of people he believes will donate the needed dollars  considering that ben carson s failure of a campaign has more cash on hand than he does  this fundraising effort already isn t off to the best of starts  it doesn t seem to matter to him  though  as long as he comes off sounding like the winner we all know he s not  even without this match  this initial effort would have been the most successful first fundraising email in history  i am certain of this  oh  please  what a prognosticator he is  he then gets into his typical insulting rant  attacking hillary clinton and alluding to this delusion he s got that  once he s president  america will win so much that we ll all be sick of it  the bottom line   crooked hillary has been a disaster for our country  and we must win against her this fall let s make history again  and keep winning  by making this the most successful first fundraising email ever  and if it s not  he ll get up on a stage somewhere  stand behind a podium  and claim he raised ten times the amount of money he actually raised just so he can look successful  for may  his campaign only raised   million  compared to the   million that hillary raised  hillary also has   million more in cash than trump does  yet he told nbc news   i understand money better than anybody  sure he does  so he ll raise   million if he s very lucky and claim he raised   million  or at least  that he outraised hillary even if it s not true  as slate writer elliot hannon said   it will be interesting to see if the email moves the needle   at all featured image by branden camp getty images
