if there s any one conservative that we wish would just stop thrusting themselves into the spotlight  it s probably sarah palin   especially after her latest disgusting rant after the attacks on police officers in dallas  it seems that conservatives have forgotten that just before that attack  two unarmed black men had lost their lives to police brutality   something that has happened far too frequently over the last few years  many conservatives have responded to the dallas attacks by denouncing the black lives matter movement  and the former vice presidential candidate just couldn t be left out in a vile  racist facebook post  palin put in her two cents and told everyone just how furious she is while stating that  black lives matter is a farce   she wrote    blacklivesmatter  is a farce and hyphenating america destroys us  shame on our culture s influencers who would stir contention and division that could lead to evil such as that in dallas shame on politicians and pundits giving credence to thugs rioting against police officers and the rule of law in the name of  peaceful protests   it is a farce   blacklivesmatter is a farce  yes   palin has just accused minorities of being racist when she said that those who hyphenate racial backgrounds  such as african americans or mexican americans  are actually the ones who  further divide our nation   and she referred to peaceful protesters as  thugs  palin also accused the media of having blood on its hands for  accurately  depicting black lives matter as a peaceful movement  media  quit claiming the rioters are  peaceful  as they stomp on our flag  shout  death to cops   and celebrate violence  it is sick  you perpetuate a perverted message evil men thrive on to intimidate and warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another  blood is on your complicit hands when you naively or purposefully refuse to tell of this movement s truth  spoken like a true republican and someone who does not understand systemic oppression and white privilege  palin urged her followers to  stand up if you re sick of being called racist when proclaiming every life matters  black as much as white and every skin tone in between  you can read the entire post below something like this is really to be expected from palin  though  her response to the issue of police brutality and race relations in america is just as disappointing as the response from her favorite presidential candidate  donald trump  trump  just like palin  acknowledged the lives of the police officers far more than the lives of police brutality victims philando castile and alton sterling  these two are made for each other featured image is a screenshot
