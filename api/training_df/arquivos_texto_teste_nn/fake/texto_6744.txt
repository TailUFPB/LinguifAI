when it comes to political campaign strategies  donald trump clearly believes he can hate and insult his way into the oval office  so far  it s working in the republican primary  because let s face it  the gop has become a party of hateful rhetoric and building up fear of anyone other than those who look and act exactly as they do  predominantly white  heterosexual   christian   etc    however  that strategy  most likely  will not work in the general election  because the rest of america sees trump as the ridiculous mudslinger that he actually is pointing this out in a pretty hilarious way was none other than democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton  she  or her campaign staff with her approval  took to twitter to put trump on blast about his hateful tone and rhetoric  after all  trump is already pivoting to the general and referring to clinton as  crooked hillary   it s a technique he s been using in the primaries against his republican opposition  so he figures he should try it out for the general as well what did hillary tweet out  a washington post article highlighting pretty much every hateful and disparaging thing trump has said throughout his campaign  with every paragraph beginning   remember when  yet  she introduced the article on twitter by hilariously mocking the way trump tweets  all too often you ll see trump tweet something out  and it will be followed with a one word sentence    sad  well  hillary did just that right back at him does trump think he can fool us into forgetting his hateful rhetoric  sad  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  april    trump wants to pretend he s a politician and enter into the biggest political race in the entire world with no experience whatsoever  he s in for a boat load of  f ck you  from the clinton campaign if they face off in the general election  trump may be able to get away with going after his republican opponents  because let s face it  they re weak and inexperienced themselves  but the clintons   haaaa  good luck with that  if you dish it  hillary will take it  puree it  and serve it back to you with a cherry on top we re in for a bumpy and very amusing ride throughout the coming months featured photos by justin sullivan scott olson getty images   twitter
