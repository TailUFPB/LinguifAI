put this one under  shit you just can t make up  a u s  air force base in georgia was forced to pull a flyer advertising a martin luther king jr  day  fun shoot  after public outcry  reports wmaz the flyer   featuring the face of the civil rights icon   promoted a noon gathering on jan   for the robins air force base trap and skeet club  where participants would get two rounds of shooting and lunch for    air force officials pulled this provocative mlk day  fun shoot  flyer  https   t co   gapol pic twitter com   greg bluestein   bluestein  january    officials at the base insist that the whole thing was just an honest mistake and  aw shucks  they didn t mean nothin  by it  they were just some good ol  boys never meanin  no harm  the official apology cleared the whole thing up  we realized the inappropriateness of the advertisement several days ago and immediately began removing the flyer  there was no malice of forethought in the flyer s creation and it was never the base s intention to portray dr  martin luther king jr   in a negative light    it continued   it was an honest mistake  to which we ve personally counseled the parties involved and will provide them with remedial training and appropriate oversight to prevent this sort of inattention from occurring in the future  if it was a state less prone to overwhelming racism  the apology might be believable  but this was georgia  and it was the air force  the branch of the military most heavily infested with christian extremism  if you weren t aware of it  the christian right has been trying to turn the united states military into a religious institution for decades  they ve had the most success in the air force so far unsurprisingly  where there is christian extremism  there s systemic racism as well  so  keeping these facts in mind  the mlk jr   fun shoot  starts to take on a much more ominous tone  context is everything featured image via screencap
