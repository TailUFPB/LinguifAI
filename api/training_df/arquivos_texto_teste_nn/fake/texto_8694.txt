on january   dallas news published a copy of ted cruz s birth certificate  the fact that the republican presidential hopeful was born in canada is really no big surprise to anyone who has been following the trump cruz birther frenzy while cruz s canadian birth is not a surprise  the fact that his mother is identified as eleanor wilson on the candidate s birth certificate  rather than eleanor cruz  is according to dallas news  wilson was the name of cruz s mother s first husband  the couple had been divorced for about seven years at the time cruz was born it gets even more interesting when you learn that the former ms  wilson gave birth to another child  michael  approximately three years after her divorce and three before she supposedly married ted s father  right wing pastor rafael cruz the baby s name was michael wilson  he later died from crib death in his book  a time for truth  reigniting the promise of america  cruz claimed his mother s divorce from wilson took place in   two years later than the actual date  he also claimed that michael was born the same year  in   and that the child s death was what ultimately led to the divorce unfortunately for ted  dallas news verified that the divorce took place in  and that michael wilson was born and died in  dallas news contacted eleanor cruz s former husband  alan wilson  who was born in forth worth texas   but has lived in london  england since the  s during the interview  wilson said he was not michael cruz s father  and he only learned that his ex wife had given birth by chance  we were divorced and she was living on her own   said wilson  he said that eleanor asked him if she could use his last name on the birth certificate  when michael wilson later died  he said   i hadn t even met the baby  alan wilson said by chance he and eleanor wilson were being treated in the same hospital when she was pregnant when a nurse told his  his wife  was there   startling the fort worthian   i didn t know she was pregnant  we were definitely divorced  it s interesting that while rafael and eleanor cruz are reported to have married in texas in   the year before cruz was born  the state s online public records site does not show a record of the couple s marriage  the exact date of cruz s parents marriage remain a mystery the couple divorced in  as the drama over whether ted cruz is eligible to run for president began to unfold this month  numerous documents have been published  including eleanor cruz s  maiden name darragh  birth certificate  showing that she was born in the u s  state of delaware in addition to his mother s birth certificate  talking points memo and breitbart  among other media outlets  also published ms  cruz s canadian voting records  those records tell us two things  first they tell us that ms  cruz was registered to vote in canada in   a right the country reserves only for legal citizens  second  the record tell us that the candidate s mother used the name of her second husband  rafael cruz on her canadian voting record so leaves us to wonder why she used the name of her first husband on ted cruz s birth certificate  if indeed she was married to rafael cruz at the time ted was born none of this would be considered fair game if the candidate wasn t running for the position of god s appointed king of america  it wouldn t be fair game if ted and rafael cruz had not made ridiculous and insulting statements about single mothers and unwed mothers  it would not be fair game if ted cruz had not appointed himself as a spiritual dictator to the masses most importantly  though  the birther movement that viciously attacked president obama throughout his first term as president used the word  illegitimate   as a matter of routine  when referring to the leader of our country ted cruz spent a lot of time catering to the right wing extremists who viciously attacked the leader our country apparently he never expected any of that to catch up to him but now a lot of people are not only asking if cruz is able to be a legitimate president  they re asking if cruz is even the legitimate son of the religiously insane rafael cruz maybe ted should have read that bible he likes to wave around in front of the crowd  after all  it does warn that eventually  you will reap what you sow  featured image credit  gage skidmore  via flckr cc
