ivy league economist guido menzio has reportedly been removed from an american airlines flight and interrogated after being found in possession of algebra menzio had been seated next to a female passenger on the plane who became suspicious that her dark skinned fellow traveler was writing in a script with which she was unfamiliar  the female passenger then reported menzio immediately and secretly to cabin crew as a suspected terrorist  she left the plane  citing illness as her excuse  meanwhile  other passengers began to grumble at the delay  a short while later  menzio was also escorted from the plane on grounds he would only be made aware of later when security began to interrogate him about the woman who had left   so far as menzio knew   due to illness  he believed he was playing a role in supporting their inquiries as to her condition  but they then revealed it was menzio who was under suspicion and being interrogated as a suspect terrorist as the washington post reports had the crew or security members perhaps quickly googled this good natured  bespectacled passenger before waylaying everyone for several hours  they might have learned that he  guido menzio is a young but decorated ivy league economist  and that he s best known for his relatively technical work on search theory  which helped earn him a professorship at the university of pennsylvania and stints at princeton and stanford s hoover institution they might even have discovered that last year he was awarded the carlo alberto medal  given to the best italian economist under   that s right  he s italian  not middle eastern  or whatever heritage usually gets racially profiled on flights these days the suspicious scrawl which so perturbed the female passenger and flight crew was nothing more than math  algebra to be precise the renowned economist said of his experience in a facebook post it s a bit funny  it s a bit worrisome  the lady just looked at me  looked at my writing of mysterious formulae  and concluded i was up to no good  because of that an entire flight was delayed by   hours trump s america is already here  it s not yet in power though  personally  i will fight back manzi becomes the latest among a litany of muslim and non muslim people to have their lives interrupted and they character made suspect by the sort of casual racism and fear promoted by not only donald trump  but much of the mainstream media and conservative political class  after the horrors of mccarthy era america  we would hope the nation would have learned a valuable lesson on restraint  it appears not featured image via flickr creative commons penn arts and sciences
