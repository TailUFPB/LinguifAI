when you re running for re election in your toughest campaign yet  in a state with a heavy hispanic voting population  what s the one thing you shouldn t do  well  for starters  you shouldn t underestimate the voting bloc that could make or break you but john mccain doesn t care  even though he runs neck in neck with democratic congresswoman ann kirkpatrick in a general election matchup  he is adamant he and the gop don t need the hispanic vote to win an interesting phenomenon right now is the huge turnouts for the republican primaries  low turnout for the democrat primaries  now if all those people would get behind the republican candidate  i think we could win this election despite the alienation  frankly  of a lot of the hispanic voters two things  one  there s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last  elections  a statement that was rated true by politifact   and two  do not underestimate hispanic voters  as the huffington post notes  the hispanic and latino voting bloc could  tip the scales  for democrats in arizona  and  as of right now  the majority of them support ann kirkpatrick the angry white vote can only carry mccain so far  and with a mounting challenge by tea partier kelli ward  mccain can t afford a split arizona republican party like donald trump  republicans are cashing in on their last ditch effort to convince enough angry  latently racist white voters to save them  and screw the rest kirkpatrick jumped all over mccain s idiotic comments  saying i wonder what thousands of latino families across arizona will think when they hear that john mccain is willing to alienate them as long as he and republicans win in november  mccain  who already revealed that his latino outreach efforts are a  pure  political move  has changed his positions on important issues such as immigration reform and the dream act  depending on who he talks to or whether it s an election year  and mccain has repeatedly promised to support donald trump if he becomes the gop nominee  in spite of trump s racist  anti latino rhetoric donald trump  alienation  flip flopping  it s as if mccain is dying to retire  let s make sure in november he gets what he deserves a swift kick in the behind featured image via wikipedia
