before abc cancelled tim allen s number one show  last man standing   allen spoke with the hollywood reporter  they asked him why he has such strong political views  they wanted to know if he was a fan of donald trump s  what he thought of hillary and bill clinton  and if it s really true that he wanted to run an episode that included raising a communist flag over the white house when barack obama was president  whose idea was it for mike baxter to have loud  conservative political views i brought that to the table  i wanted to be provocative  mike baxter is an educated archie bunker definitely  but you know what  i ve earned it  i don t say that lightly  i ve been on a successful show and learned from the best  but i find last man standing actually rougher than home improvement  we re getting away with a lot of stuff  i m really shocked  this is a meaner  sharper comedy than i m used to  there s a lot of times our very liberal writing staff will come up with stuff that even my character would say   i don t know if i can say that  how much is playing this right leaning character an outlet for you to express your own political views it s getting more and more comfortable  these guys know me so well that they re writing stuff that is exactly what i would ve said  it s a marvelous thing when you have lib eral people writing for   i believe stephen colbert was like that  he was pretending to be a conservative  i think  someone said that  i never got that  but maybe i didn t watch it enough has the line between you and your character blurred over the years for most of my life  i ve been taxed above  percent  when you re a young guy working the road and literally close to half of what you make goes to people who don t help you at all but just bitch about it the whole time  that s where i come from  i come from  no taxation without representation   and it manifests itself in very peculiar points of view how are you different from mike he s milder than i am  you wouldn t want to hear what i have to say  escalate mike baxter with profanity and that s basically me  he s much more tepid because he s a business owner  mike baxter is calmed way down  and i m definitely not that guy what riles you up the most unearned responses  unearned praise  unearned income  i have opinions about it  when you watch the debates  on both sides you see clowns who say shit that ain t ever going to happen  but lately  one party is the free shit party  they are just telling people they re going to get all sorts of free shit  when you say you re going to get free education  free healthcare   f   free brown loafers   of course  everybody s going to say yes to that but you don t mean it  that s how you rack up debt  and debt is killing us  whatever party is going to get us out of debt is my party who scares you well  we asked the female writing staff if they d vote for hillary just because she s a woman  and they all said yes  so then the question was   so if sarah palin was the female   they all choked and they had to say   oh god  yes  we d vote for her   i didn t quite buy it  i don t think you should vote for somebody just because they re tall  thin  yellow  green  whatever  bernie sanders  as nice a guy as he is  none of that shit s going to happen  and trump can t send everybody to mexico or whatever the f  he said  but give that guy the roads  bridges  infrastructure  power grid   just have him fix that shit for four years  he s good at that  and he s a businessman so he understands how debt load works  forget the stupid shit he says about immigrants  that s just ignorant  but he might be able to do the stuff that really needs fixing so you re not opposed to trump i m not opposed to anybody if their workload matches their bullshit load why has the show gone after hillary but not trump it s a little surprising to me  we have a very liberal writing staff  so i m surprised they haven t taken a shot at him  but we re not sure he s going to last  whereas the clintons are like herpes  just when you think they re gone  they show up again didn t you try a bit about obama raising the communist flag at the white house that never made it to air we got network notes saying you can t call the president a communist  so  of course  i really wanted to  i do it in rehearsal all day long
