while on his radio show the other day  former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke doubled down on his support of republican presidential front runner donald trump  even appearing excited at the comparisons being made to adolf hitler while he tried to preface his diatribe against the media by stating that everyone is just trying to demonize trump by associating him with hitler  he then goes on to say  the truth is  by the way  they might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in germany  because i saw a commercial against donald trump  a really vicious commercial  comparing what donald trump said about preserving america and making america great again to hitler in germany preserving germany and making germany great again and free again and not beholden to these communists on one side  politically who were trying to destroy their land and their freedom  and the jewish capitalists on the other  who were ripping off the nation through the banking system  we have the same thing going on here with goldman sachs  it was a commercial  i saw that this morning and i was amazed by that commercial  it was a commercial against trump but i don t think it s having the effect that they want it to have this war that s going on against donald trump is really a war going on against america  it s a war going on against the european american majority  the media has incited hatred and violence and repression of donald trump and the hundreds of thousands  the millions of people who support him  and that s what happened in chicago  and if that wasn t horrifying enough to listen to  he follows it up with this  if you re a european person  the government is purposefully wiping you out and your families and your children and your future  they are purposefully transforming this country into a third world nation  okay  first of all  if  you re a european person   that means you live in europe  however  clearly this is code for white people who think being white is something to be proud of  if you re an american  you embrace the beautiful melting pot that we are and have always been recent trump rallies mirror the sentiments said by duke  and that is outright horrifying  it s one thing to have an extremist support you  it s another to embrace that support of those just like him on a daily basis making the bold claim that some how you re going to  make america great again  by utilizing their adoration and votes america is great  love it or leave it listen to the audio via right wing watch featured image via flickr photoshop
