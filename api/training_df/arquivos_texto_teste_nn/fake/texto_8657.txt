dr  martin luther king  jr  will always be remembered as one of the most revolutionary civil rights leaders and someone who made a tremendous impact on america and the movement to end legislated racism  on monday  we honored king s life  which was taken far too soon despite king s fame and place in history  not everyone knows as much about him as they should   as late night host jimmy kimmel discovered when he interviewed people on hollywood s walk of fame  for his show jimmy kimmel live on hollywood boulevard  kimmel had a camera crew interview pedestrians and see what they thought of king  falsely  endorsing republican front runner donald trump  the results are seriously too depressing to actually be funny out of the several people interviewed  many were completely unaware that king had been assassinated in    therefore preventing him from making any type of endorsement to the gop candidate  unsurprisingly  those very same people were oblivious to what king actually stood for  and were also unaware that trump had made tons of racist comments that king would have never stood behind  these people had seemingly been living under a rock for the past several months  and probably didn t even know that trump has been endorsed by king s opposites   modern day white supremacists one woman seriously said  i figure if he s going to endorse donald trump for president  then maybe he thinks he will be a good president   and that wasn t even the worst response  you can watch the frightening interviews below it is mind boggling how ignorant many people in america still are   and it isn t much of a stretch to say that anyone who believes someone like martin luther king  jr  would endorse such an imbecile is probably going to end up voting for him if king were alive to hear these responses  it would certainly be a nightmare for him  especially since this has basically been trump s response to people who aren t white like him featured image via gage skidmore
