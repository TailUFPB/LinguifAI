years of lugging guns around in public places   such as supermarkets   have resulted in zero terrorist plots thwarted  as such  ammosexuals have had to find a fresh new reason to make sure they are armed to the teeth every time they go outside of their homes  this time  the threat is only  isis  if that s the name of a transgender woman who happens to be in a public restroom christian extremist and president of a theocratic law group named the liberty council anita staver has declared to the internet that she will be carrying a firearm with her every time she uses the bathroom in public from now on staver took to twitter to make her formal declaration of pseudo vigilantism i m taking a glock   to the ladies room  it identifies as my bodyguard   boycotttarget  target  liberty lawyer   anitastaver  april    are reasons to be concerned with this statement  one being that she thinks her gun identified itself as something  this sounds like she thinks her gun is both self aware and talks to her  the other more obvious one is not only her threat against transgender women but the tacit approval and advocacy for this behavior in other individuals anita has been sharing bathrooms  whether she wants to admit it or not  with transgender people for decades now   just like every other self appointed member of the new american bathroom police  only since republicans made it fresh and new again has bathroom usage in america become the greatest domestic security threat of our generation to give you a little context  anita is married to mat staver  who is the head of kim davis s legal team  that would be the same kim davis that the right wing glorified for violating her duties and refusing to issue licenses for same sex marriages  these people are nothing short of walking hate machines towards lgbt individuals  which explains the irrational bathroom paranoia staver s comments come on the heels of a conservative group hissyfit over commercial interests  such as target department stores  openly accepting the lgbt community and allowing them to use whatever bathroom suits them best  as more companies and franchises join the ranks of target here with the rest of civilized society in the year   it s logical to assume more right wing theocrats will be taking weapons into those bathrooms after all  having paranoid people carrying guns in a confined and densely populated room with only a single exit is far less dangerous than a transgender woman who just wants to pee  right featured image via twitter
