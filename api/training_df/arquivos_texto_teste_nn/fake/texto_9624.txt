you seriously can t make this stuff up wouldn t it be great if we had a real and honest media  and this was the top story of the day today zero hedge   former secretary of state hillary clinton facilitated the transfer a highly enriched uranium  heu  previously confiscated by the u s  department of energy  doe  during a   nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one russian national and several georgian accomplices   a newly leaked classified cable shows so called  background  information was provided in the cable which gave vague details on a  nuclear smuggling sting operation in which the u s  government took possession of some heu previously owned by the russians  over two years ago russia requested a ten gram sample of highly enriched uranium  heu  seized in early  in georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one russian national and several georgian accomplices  the seized heu was transferred to u s  custody and is being held at a secure doe facility  the secret  action request   dated aug      was sent out by secretary of state clinton and was addressed to the united states ambassador to georgia embassy tbilisi  the russian embassy  and ambassador john beyrle it proposed that fbi director robert mueller be the one that personally conducts the transfer a  gram sample of heu to russian law enforcement sources during a secret  plane side  meeting on a  tarmac  in the early fall of   we require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport  on the tarmac near by the plane  upon arrival of the director s aircraft  gateway pundit    the cable also states that  given russia s reluctance to act so far  fbi mueller s delivery of this sample will underscore to russia our commitment to follow through on this case   it continues in stating   embassy moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the russian federation that fbi director mueller plans to deliver the heu sample once he arrives to moscow on september   the cable summarizes that   we regret that the april visit by director mueller could not take place due to a scheduling conflict   and makes a final request that   we require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport  on the tarmac near by the plane  upon arrival of the director s aircraft  now knowing that the obama administration and hillary clinton hid the fbi investigation into the uranium one deal  this cable brings on new meaning and leads to numerous questions why did obama and clinton agree to provide this uranium delivered by mueller to russia in the first place an article by the atlantic from april  tells the fascinating story of the smuggler in the country of georgia who was arrested trying to sell uranium to potential buyers  the smuggler  oleg vladimirovich khintsagov  on january     was apprehended by authorities carrying  grams of highly enriched uranium tucked into a plastic bag in his tattered leather coat a sample of the uranium captured during this sting operation was provided to the russians who analyzed it and determined that it was indeed highly enriched uranium  heu   in the atlantic article  it states that the russians at first didn t respond to requests from georgia on the uranium and at no time asked for the uranium back  as a matter of fact  the russians worked hard to deny that the uranium came from russia in the first place  so why did the obama administration hand deliver  grams of heu to russia in  and when did russia begin asking for another sample of the uranium and why did the memo not mention that the russians had already obtained a sample of this uranium and determined that it was heu another question is why did clinton s secretary of state request that fbi director mueller deliver the sample of heu to russia and why was the transfer in april canceled and postponed to september of all people  why would the head of the fbi be selected to transfer uranium to russia  it would seem that the us has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that fbi director mueller would have enough on his plate in the us  when mueller couldn t make the transfer in april the transfer was postponed to september so mueller could be there the fact that mueller needed to perform the transfer should raise numerous red flags  it s been widely reported about mueller s conflicts of interest with his recent appointment as special counsel in the russia investigation according to the hill  before the obama administration approved a controversial deal in  giving moscow control of a large swath of american uranium  the fbi had gathered substantial evidence that russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery  kickbacks  extortion and money laundering designed to grow vladimir putin s atomic energy business inside the united states  according to government documents and interviews federal agents used a confidential u s  witness working inside the russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records  make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as  that showed moscow had compromised an american uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act  fbi and court documents show they also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the u s  designed to benefit former president bill clinton s charitable foundation during the time secretary of state hillary clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to moscow  sources told the hill the racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks  one agent declared in an affidavit years later rather than bring immediate charges in   however  the department of justice  doj  continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years  essentially leaving the american public and congress in the dark about russian nuclear corruption on u s  soil during a period when the obama administration made two major decisions benefitting putin s commercial nuclear ambitions then attorney general eric holder was among the obama administration officials joining hillary clinton on the committee on foreign investment in the united states at the time the uranium one deal was approved  multiple current and former government officials told the hill they did not know whether the fbi or doj ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered spokesmen for holder and clinton did not return calls seeking comment  the justice department also didn t comment mikerin was a director of rosatom s tenex in moscow since the early   where he oversaw rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the united states under the megatons to megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries  in   mikerin was dispatched to the u s  on a work visa approved by the obama administration to open rosatom s new american arm called tenam between  and january   mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine  conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct  delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity  enriched uranium  in commerce by extortion   a november  indictment stated his illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness  an american businessman  who began making kickback payments at mikerin s direction and with the permission of the fbi  the first kickback payment recorded by the fbi through its informant was dated nov      the records show  for entire story  the hillthe investigation was ultimately supervised by then u s  attorney rod rosenstein  an obama appointee who now serves as president trump s deputy attorney general  and then assistant fbi director andrew mccabe  now the deputy fbi director under trump  justice department documents show on august     the washington times questioned deputy attorney general rod rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on president trump in his investigation in the trump russia investigation  the special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the department of justice  and we don t engage in fishing expeditions   mr  rosenstein said on  fox news sunday  in his first sunday show interview  mr  rosenstein added that special counsel robert mueller  understands and i understand the specific scope of the investigation and so  it s not a fishing expedition  mr  rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into mr  trump s finances unrelated to possible russian interference in last year s election mr  rosenstein played down the reports   that s not anything that i ve said  that s not anything director mueller has said  we don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are   both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible  but still unproven collusion between russia and donald trump s campaign during the  election
