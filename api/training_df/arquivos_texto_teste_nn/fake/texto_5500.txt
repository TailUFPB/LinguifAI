the plot is definitely thickening when it comes to the horrific death of an african american man at the hands of two white police officers in baton rouge  louisiana  abdullah muflahi owns the triple s food mart  where the events of that fateful night took place  now  he has filed a lawsuit against the police  the suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of alton sterling  whom muflahi allowed to sell his cd s out front of the store  muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal  where the cops took his cell phone  along with surveillance video of the shooting  all of this was done without a warrant  which is definitely illegal  and reeks of a cover up  the suit says of what happened  at all times defendants knew that plaintiff muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment  of course  the cops are not talking about these new developments  muflahi is suing the cops who shot sterling  as well as the city of baton rouge itself  also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the baton rouge police chief  there was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered alton sterling  so they had no right to immediately take that footage  and at no point should abdullah muflahi been taken into custody for any reason  he was a witness to a crime committed by the baton rouge police  he is not the criminal here the document that requested the warrant claimed that sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so  and therefore tasers were used  they saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of sterling s pocket  and therefore they tased him  now  anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well  there was no need to shoot and kill him  but of course the cops claim otherwise  when the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket  the officers fired their police issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat  i d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could  along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from abdullah muflahi  it will be just as doctored as the stories they are telling regarding the shooting itself  this is nothing more than the police doing their damndest to keep their murderous brothers in blue out of an indictment and possible prison time featured image via mark wallheiser getty images
