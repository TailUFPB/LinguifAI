an idaho mother who called police after her missing  year old son returned home soon regretted making the call  after cops arrived and smashed the boy s face in on march   amy olzak called idaho falls police to report her son missing  after a day long search  a friend found the boy  and like any good citizen  olzak called the station back to let officers know that the boy had been located and any search attempts should be called off however  the officers came to the family home anyway  by the time they were finished  they had left her  year old son with broken teeth  a possible concussion  and bruising and trauma to the neck and facial area  as olzak explained to reporters at kikd  i just wanted them to be aware  they came over  i talked to an officer for a minute and he walked over to my son  then he put my son s hand behind his back and like lifted him up in the air and slammed his face into the trunk of a car  two witnesses  the car s owner courtney beck  and jessica bowles reported seeing the whole event unfold and were both unable to give a single reason for the officer s extreme actions  bowles said  i walked up closer and saw a chipped tooth  blood  and two fats lips  olzak called for more officers  and they agreed that the boy needed medical attention  however  the original officer refused to release the boy from handcuffs throughout the entire visit to the hospital  he was kept in handcuffs until i took him home   olzak said the family sent a tort to the idaho falls police last week  in order to initiate legal proceedings against the officer for using unnecessary and excessive force against a minor  the case reminds us of the growing issue of police being called to help  only to end up killing or injuring the people they should be supporting  one of the most notable cases being the killing of  year old marine veteran kenneth chamberlain  white plains police officers in new york broke into his home and shot him dead after a simple call to go to his aid in a potential medical emergency   and the list is growing  it doesn t help the majority of good police  or the communities that they are meant to protect and serve  to continue making these mistakes with seeming impunity  featured image via kidk
