in case anyone was confused about how the whole  kneeling for the national anthem  thing came about  it was the former  s quarterback colin kaepernick  who had the bright idea to kneel  as a way to bring attention to how unfairly blacks are treated by law enforcement a few days ago  the entitled nfl athlete  seattle seahawks rookie  defensive lineman  malik mcdowell  found himself in a little hot water with the law  unfortunately for mcdowell  his disrespectful interaction with the female law enforcement officer who was attempting to arrest him for disorderly conduct was all caught on camera and shared with tmz from deadspin  the video features a male officer who appears to be tasked with transporting mcdowell  but not the one who originally arrested him putting handcuffs on mcdowell  at the same time  mcdowell is taunting a female cop standing nearby  are you scared of me   he asks her repeatedly   why is you a cop then  mcdowell and the officer go back and forth about why he was arrested for disorderly conduct  and he calls her a bitch multiple times  bitch  i got money  that s why i can talk shit   mcdowell says  adding that the officers will never make as much money as he s made in the past few months mcdowell then apparently shouts at some passersby   hey  they re trying to plant some shit on me   which causes the officers to laugh  i got a lot of fucking money you broke ass niggas   mcdowell says as they search him   put me in fucking jail  please  so i can bond out   nfl fans reacted to the kneeling players disrespect for our flag  our active and retired military and law enforcement officers by turning off their tv s and skipping the games  leaving empty seats in nfl stadiums across the nation for  weeks in a row
