cruz has recently gone on the attack against donald trump  but as recently as december  he kept the republican frontrunner close to him  despite the fact trump had already made many crazy statements  cooper called out cruz during a cnn town hall event  cooper said  back in december  you tweeted   the establishment s only hope  trump and me in a cage match  sorry to disappoint  donald trump is terrific   that was after he had already made fun of carly fiorina s face  that was after he had gone after megyn kelly  at that point  in december  did you really believe donald trump was terrific  cruz tried to divert the conversation  saying   what i knew was that the media was engaged in a lovefest  giving donald trump   billion in free media   however  cooper wasn t having it  responding   sounds like you were engaged in a lovefest  there are many reasons why the slippery cruz wanted to keep all of his options open regarding a potential trump win  cruz  never a man with a moral compass  not only didn t go on the attack against trump  he also embraced some of trump s racist and nasty policies  including those on muslims and immigrants if you look closely  there isn t much of a difference between the two except trump has a bigger mouth  but since cruz is an ideologue and actually believes the stupid things that come out of his mouth  it makes him more dangerous watch video here featured image via video screenshot
