the trump campaign is busy attempting to clean up the mess after politifact exposed an incident of gross misrepresentation in its first tv ad during the  second ad which was released monday  a scene shows supposed migrants rushing through a national border while the voiceover states  he ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that mexico will pay for  the clear implication is that the viewer is watching mexican migrants running across the u s  border with zero controls or checks   but  as politifact discovered   it s not   it s   miles away  in a small spanish enclave on the mainland of morocco  the fact checkers uncovered that the footage was first shown on italian station repubblikatv on may    and rather than showing mexican migrants entering the u s   actually shows  migrants crossing the border into melilla  one of two enclaves on the moroccan coast that are held by spain  migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a european union nation  even though they are still on the african continent  the footage has been shared multiple times across various social media since that time  for example  one youtube user posted the video in july this year  again  no mention is made of the u s  border  trump scored himself a  pants on fire  rating for putting this nonsense on the air and attempting to mislead the american people as to the state of border security however  trump appeared unrepentant when he was called on to bill o reilly s show to explain his actions  he told the fox host on monday night  i think it s irrelevant  it s really merely a display of what a dumping ground is going to look like  and that s what our country is becoming very rapidly  proving once again that he has all the personal integrity of a toddler with a cookie jar  the gop front runner simply steps over his lie and moves on featured image via wikimedia commons
