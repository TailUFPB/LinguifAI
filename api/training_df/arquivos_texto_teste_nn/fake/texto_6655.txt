yesterday  an eight year old girl from flint  michigan got a response from president barack obama that she ll never forget mari copeny  also known around her town as  little miss flint   had written to obama about flint s water crisis  which had been poisoned and contaminated with lead thanks to corruption and negligence by the state s republican administration  in her message to the president  copeny spoke up for many children growing up in flint when she wrote  i am one of the children that is affected by this water  and i ve been doing my best to march in protest and to speak out for all the kids that live here in flint  copeny also mentioned that she would be in washington  dc this week  to watch the congressional hearings of our governor rick snyder and wanted to meet the president and first lady michelle obama despite the fact that my mom said chances are you will be too busy with more important things  copeny was hopeful  but she didn t expect a prompt response from the busy commander in chief  little did she know  her request was about to be fulfilled in a major way  obama wrote back  and his response was nothing short of the amazing warm heartedness that we ve come to expect from our president  thank you for writing to me  you re right that presidents are often busy  but the truth is  in america  there is no more important title than citizen  and i am so proud of you for using your voice to speak out on behalf of the children of flint that s why i want you to be the first to know that i m coming to visit flint on may   i want to make sure people like you and your family are receiving the help you need and deserve letters from kids like you are what make me so optimistic for the future  i hope to meet you next week   little miss flint  the white house confirmed those plans in a statement that read  on wednesday  may   the president will travel to flint  michigan where he will hear first hand from flint residents like mari about the public health crisis  receive an in person briefing on the federal efforts in place to help respond to the needs of the people of flint  and speak directly with members of the flint community  despite her young age  copeny is a big activist in her community and frequently uses youtube to raise awareness for the important issues the area is facing  to make sure that no one forgets that people in flint are still depending on bottled water for their drinking  cooking and bathing needs  copeny has created a video where she speaks about the hardships the community must endure  you can watch it below unfortunately  the polluted water in flint will be life altering and affect future generations to come  not only will children have learning disabilities and behavioral issues  but the lead will be passed onto younger generations by women who are pregnant  until every last lead pipe in flint is replaced  this situation will not be resolved  we can only hope that the president s visit to flint will push congress to find a solution to this injustice featured image via alex wong getty images and screenshot
