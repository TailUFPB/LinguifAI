in big news coming out of the supreme court  it was the opinion of the court that a decision made by an alabama court refusing to recognize a same sex adoption will be overturned when one half of an alabama couple sought to have the adoption of her children be recognized in her state of alabama  she was denied  even though the couple together had previously been granted approval by the state of georgia  the couple has since split up  but both individuals are still parents to their children  as it would be with any heterosexual couple  however  the entire thing does start to get very confusing here s the run down via npr  the two women in the case were together for  years  and they had three children conceived by assisted reproductive technology   an older daughter  now   and boy and girl twins  now   the actual names of the parents have not been revealed  they are identified in court documents by the initials v l  and e l e l  was the biological mother and v l  subsequently adopted the children with her partner s explicit consent  the adoption was in georgia  where both women appeared at a court hearing  and the final adoption decree recognized both as the children s legal parents when the parents  now living in alabama  split five years ago  however  the biological mother denied her former partner access to the children  the alabama courts initially ordered a decree of shared custody  based on the georgia adoption  but the alabama supreme court overturned the lower court orders  the state supreme court said the georgia courts had wrongly agreed to the adoption the adoptive mother appealed to the u s  supreme court  and on monday the justices unanimously overruled the alabama supreme court in a short  unsigned opinion  now  all of that aside  let s just get it out there that this was a frickin terrible thing to do  and as a lesbian myself  to see a woman use anti gay laws against her former partner as a means to try to keep her away from her own children is pretty much the lowest of the low  but i digress thankfully  the court sided with the mother who had adoptive rights in georgia with the argument was brought up where according to the constitution in article iv  section   where the full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts  records  and judicial proceedings of every other state   basically  what s good for the goose  better damn well be good for the gander  and all states need to respect legal acts and proceedings from other states   according to cathy sakimura of the national center for lesbian rights  the supreme court s reversal of alabama s unprecedented decision to void an adoption from another state is a victory not only for our client but for thousands of adopted families  no adoptive parent or child should have to face the uncertainty and loss of being separated years after their adoption just because another state s court disagrees with the law that was applied in their adoption  this decision could affect up to  different states  according to a brief that was  submitted by adoption and child welfare agencies  if we re going to have marriage equality  then that equality needs to reach across all levels of the law  this should include  but not be limited to  adoption  and worker s rights as well  no one should be fired for being gay  which currently is still allowed in  states  it s   people  gay rights are human rights  there should be no difference whatsoever featured image via wikimedia commons
