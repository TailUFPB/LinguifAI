now that it s been established that mike pence will be donald trump s running mate  and not errand boy chris christie   the clinton campaign has already begun pouncing on the anti woman  anti lgbt candidate that was brave enough to step on stage with trump but reports appear to show trump had his reservations about the indiana governor  apparently  trump was so regretful of picking the former congressman that he asked his campaign aides   the night before the announcement   if he could back out of picking pence after the news leaked that pence was indeed the choice  trump s uncertainty was heightened after being incensed  he blamed the pence camp   on thursday  after telling fox news he had not made a  final  decision  sources told nbc news onald trump was stressed over the circumstances surrounding his choice for running mate even after news of the pick leaked  while in california  separated from family and most aides  trump worked the phones late into the evening thursday soliciting advice and sharing his concerns  sources familiar with the calls said trump conveyed that he felt  backed into a corner   another description suggested that trump was talking it out  but knew that he could not and would not choose a different running mate it hasn t even been two days and trump already regrets his decision  like everything else in his campaign  trump seems to have been winging it the whole time  settling on a guy he wasn t even so sure about the news that pence was the choice shouldn t have been a surprise  for months the trump campaign told reporters it was seeking an experienced republican who had personal relationships on capitol hill  that left pence and former house speaker new gingrich as the formidable options  but in the last several weeks the trump campaign noted that it did not want an  attack dog   which eliminated gingrich   christie was never a true option  he was just the mcdonald s boy of course the trump campaign denied that he had regrets  but considering their main attraction lies  percent of the time  who can be so sure with the rnc just around the corner  trump enters the general race universally hated  with no money  no field organization  and a running mate he doesn t really like yet his supporters will still view him as a god featured image via bryan thomas getty images
