on april  vice president joe biden cast his vote in the democratic presidential primary  in his home state of delaware  but declined to say which candidate he voted for neither the president or vice president has publicly endorsed a candidate in the  race  but during an interview with the new york times  published on wednesday  might provide some insight into which way the vice president was leaning on friday the new york times reported he remains neutral in the battle between bernie sanders and hillary clinton  but not between their campaign styles  he ll take mr  sanders s aspirational approach over mrs  clinton s caution any day during the interview vice president biden told the new york times reporter john harwood  i like the idea of saying   we can do much more   because we can  he went on to compare the candidate s very different approaches to their campaigns  saying  i don t think any democrats ever won saying   we can t think that big   we ought to really downsize here because it s not realistic  c mon man  this is the democratic party  i m not part of the party that says   well  we can t do it    the new york times also reported that the vice president likes the idea that mr  sanders is aiming high  regardless of whether the large steps he envisions to narrow income inequality and broaden economic opportunity become realized in the next presidential term  according to the interview the philosophy mr  biden has advocated within the obama white house  push for a lot  and persevere over the long run vice president biden stressed the point  saying  presidents have always been told by really smart people   don t push something that you can t succeed in   it diminishes your power  i completely disagree with that proposition  indeed  the race between former secretary of state hillary clinton and vt senator bernie sanders is strikingly similar to the clinton obama race of  then senator obama ran on a platform of  hope and change   telling his energetic followers  yes we can  on the other hand  hillary clinton sought to portray herself as level headed and realistic  warning that there is no magic wand to fix the problems in washington after eight years of george w  bush   voters preferred obama s message of bold change to clinton s ideas for incremental change this time around though  the  electorate is leaning more toward clinton s pragmatic approach  likely as a response to eight years of republican obstructionism and even outright sabotage in washington while voters are certainly tired of budget showdowns and government shutdowns  the fact remains that as long as republicans control congress  both candidates will face the same right wing extremism that president obama has faced once they reach the white house no democratic president is going to make republicans in the house and senate reasonable or even sane regardless of whether voters choose hillary clinton or bernie sanders  there s no question that both democratic candidates would be hated and vilified by the gop while all eyes are on the race for the presidential nomination  changing the dynamics of congress should also be a top priority to anyone who wants to see the country continue to move forward  not back image credit  wikipedia public domain
