cnn s chris cuomo tried to have a discussion about police brutality and race on monday morning  and it didn t go over too well  the conversation barely got five minutes in before a racist statement set off the rest of the panel  resulting in a shouting match that cuomo could barely control the panel was comprised of retired nypd detective harry houck  former nypd chief philip banks and cnn s marc lamont hill  hill  who is a morehouse college professor  spoke about the systemic racism that black communities have been facing  while houck was more interested in defending law enforcement and came out with statistics about black crime in new york city to prove his point  huock said  facts have gotta matter  the police have already recognized the fact that we ve got issues that we need to deal with  now the black community has to also know that they have issues they need to deal with  this isn t a one way street here  this is where it all went downhill  huock rattled off the following stats  in new york city alone  blacks are     they make up   of all shootings    of all robberies    of all violent crimes  white only    that is why there are more blacks in jail than there are whites  hill fired back  denouncing that those numbers were the result of  a system that s dysfunctional   as hill tried to convince houck that the power should be given to citizens rather than law enforcement  tensions erupted when houck made the inference of black criminality  hill called houck out for his racist comment and shouted  you think black people are prone to criminality   you didn t mean to say that  i m gonna give you a chance to correct yourself  when houck referred back to his statistics  hill shot him down again and said  harry  googling some numbers is different than talking to me  the shouting match between the two continued  and banks waited until the shouting had died down a bit to suggest more of a middle ground in working toward solutions  banks said  it doesn t mean there aren t a lot of good cops  it doesn t mean that law enforcement doesn t serve communities through  it means that changes have to be made  talks need to be stopped  and action needs to take place  you can watch houck derail the segment below featured image is a screenshot
