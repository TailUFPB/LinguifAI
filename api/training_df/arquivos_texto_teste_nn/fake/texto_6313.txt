after eight years of belly aching from every single republican about how we have virtually no economic recovery under president obama  fox decided that the time has come for obama to credit   wait for it   george w  bush for the eight years of recovery we ve had under president obama i swear to god  i m not making this up  just watch the video clip below  brit hume gets into it after about one minute  he spends the first minute listing off a litany of republican talking points they ve used for the past  years to prove that no economic recovery existed under president obama  after this brief tirade  brit spontaneously shifted personalities and started demanding that president obama give credit for the economic recovery of the past eight years to dubya brit made the wildly incorrect assertion that because there were signs of recovery before president obama s economic recovery plan became active  that meant none of his efforts had any effect on the recovery  however  because george w  bush s smaller bailout packages had already taken effect  they get full credit for fixing the economy  but   and this is the best part   brit then went on to say that the economy recovered on its own   because that s what markets do   and implied that no government assistance was needed at all for it to happen i know that sounds a bit confusing  it s because it s one of the most reality free statements made by a republican in the past eight years then there s the unspoken point of republicans whining for eight years straight about how unfair it is for obama to tie anything george w  bush did to the economic conditions during his presidency  they now have decided that there is  in fact  a recovery that exists so now they are rewriting history to say george w  bush caused it when he wasn t even in office any longer  and that whole part about dubya not having any effect on obama s woes  yeah let s just forget they ever said that watch the fox go completely stupid in two minutes flat below featured image via scrapetv
