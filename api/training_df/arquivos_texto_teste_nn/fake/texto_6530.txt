it s becoming increasingly clear that when tlc decided to promote a story of the fundamentalist christian duggar family  they weren t just idolizing right wing anti gay bigots  they were legitimizing a toxic cult that for years had lived in the shadows and now   thanks to increasing exposure   has begun to fester and grow  quiverfull   the fundamentalist movement run by a man named vaughn ohlman  works to silence and control women in ways that wouldn t seem entirely out of place in regions controlled by the taliban  its  pitch  is that women should be subservient to their husbands  and relied on primarily for household chores and churning out babies   the  full  quiver in the name is a nod to the number of children each family is encouraged to have   as many as possible  but if mature women are reduced to home  and baby makers  then girls are seen as less than that enter ohlman s brand new  retreat  designed specifically for christian dads to meet up and plan who they will give their daughters to  particularly troublesome ones who may be nearly out of high school and haven t found a husband yet called the  get them married   retreat  the group s announcement is deeply disturbing we at let them marry ministries are excited to finally be able to announce our plans for the get them married retreat  we ve set our plans and are accepting applications  pending sufficient signups and barring unforeseen contingencies  we will be hosting the first get them married retreat this fall  unforeseen contingencies  might include the fact that nowhere in let them marry ministries  lengthy post is the consent of the children ever acknowledged   let them marry  really means  let us marry them off  this is made explicit in the  rules  for the purposes of this conference we ask that a young man who is interested in a young woman approach her father  mother  brother  etc   before approaching her  in the case where he is interested in a young woman who is not accompanied  we ask that the young man speak privately to one of the retreat staff members as raw story points out  ohlman is very big on the idea that children should be married as soon as possible  his criteria for when a girl is  ready  is between the ages of  and   they claim they take a hard stand against  year olds getting married  that is their red line   the specifics are even more disturbing how much will this retreat set you back  depends  if you want a family sized cottage  be prepared to spend around    if you just want to send your  older  marriageable kids  to a gender specific bunkhouse with other older  marriageable kids  they can stay for as low as   that gets you a bed  meals  and a schedule full of lectures  activities and what they call  intentionally blank spots for networking  so the next time you come across a duggar  and yes  they re back on tlc  despite everything   remember that the  family values  and longing to return to the good old days means this sort of theocratic nightmare  they have a very specific vision  and it s not pretty update  the salvation army  which had originally agreed to host the retreat on their property in wichita  kansas  has reportedly backed   and quite possibly ran   away from this incoming disaster  the group will now have to find a new place to hold their child marriage swap featured image via youtube screengrab
