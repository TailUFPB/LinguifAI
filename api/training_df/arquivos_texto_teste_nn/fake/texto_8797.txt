there s something wildly entertaining about conservative infighting  especially when the person on the receiving end is ann coulter  she s not only racist  she s unapologetically racist  so clearly her choice for president is republican frontrunner donald trump as some say  the republican party may not be racist  but most racists are republican  this was proved more so now than ever  and calling coulter out on her anti immigration pro trump stance is gop strategist liz mair it all happened on msnbc s hardball where host chris matthews invited the two women on to discuss their viewpoints  after several minutes of meaningless banter  coulter eventually settled on saying  it s all about immigration  it doesn t really matter what a republican s position is on saving social security or how they re going to reform medicare  americans are being outvoted by foreigners  and americans have been begging their own party to shut it down  to stop this endless immigration for decades now  as well as insisting that  donald trump is the first one to actually take america s side on immigration  that s why he is sweeping the polls  mair jumped in and shut her down  saying  i think that that s a patently ludicrous notion  most of the time  when we ve been looking at  amnesty fights   they ve actually been shut down by a set of groups that are funded by population control enthusiast liberal who is actually involved with zero population growth and the sierra club  that s who s actually shut it down  it s not actually in any way advancing the economic interests of the american people  free market economists actually agree with that  mair even goes so far as to call trump a liberal  however  trump is more of a  i m gonna say what makes me popular  kind of guy  and since his racism is working  he s run with it  or rather  on it  when mair brought up that coulter used to support romney  coulter bit back  my ideal ticket is trump romney  that s what i m really hoping for  that s a dynamite combination  she s not wrong  that ticket certainly would be explosive for the united states  but not in a good way  mair  however decided to continue tearing coulter apart  saying  that is the proof right there that you are in no way conservative and no way interested in conservative policy  it s true  coulter seems to only be concerned with being as racist as possible  and trump fits the bill for that  her love of romney likely stems from the   remarks that were blatantly racist in his attack against president obama and his supporters  and while conservative politics aren t always that blatantly racist  they aren t exactly inconspicuous either  mair seems to believe that trump supporters are just  liberals who just happen to hate mexicans  here s the thing   both women are wrong about pretty much everything so  while it was a pleasure to see coulter get torn apart by a fellow conservative  mair needs to realize that coulter is pretty much the exact epitome of modern day conservatism and conservative policy in the new gop  video featured image  youtube
