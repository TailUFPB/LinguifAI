walmart has become the perfect symbol of the corporate greed strangling much of the planet  from putting tens of thousands of mom and pop stores out of business  union busting  gender wage discrimination and utilizing slave labor in developing nations  walmart has used its power to make the lives of millions of people miserable  and that s before you include leeching billions in taxpayer money by forcing their workers to live off of government assistance  all so a handful of billionaires can get even richer but it looks like unrestrained greed can only get you so far for the first time ever   or at least since the company went public some  years ago   walmart s revenues shrank from the year before  according to its annual financial filing released wednesday walmart is clearly having trouble adapting its gigantic stores to the internet age  to be sure  it is a retail juggernaut that brings in half a trillion dollars  that s right  trillion  in sales every year  and with more than   stores in  countries there s no way it will disappear anytime soon  though walmart shares were a safe haven in the rocky start of   investors are pricing in more weakness  the stock has fallen behind retail competitors and the broader market in february  walmart lowered its annual net sales growth forecast to  relatively flat   from earlier guidance that called for an increase of as much as  percent  the company has pointed out that previous guidance didn t account for currency changes  which have stung the global retailer  ironically  part of this drop in revenue is due to walmart focusing less on cutting operating expenses  like those pesky  salaries  that workers are always complaining about  and actual increased the pay for   million workers earlier this year while a republican might point to this and scream   aha  proof that paying the peons  i mean  valuable employees   more is bad for business    less insane people would point out that a workforce of   million people that have more money will almost certainly spend some of that money at a store that carries most of the stuff they need  like  for instance  walmart these hypothetical less crazy people might also point out that paying   million people more money would boost the economy and that a healthier economy means more people have more money to spend at places like  for instance again  walmart  because let s be honest  walmart is not paying more out of the goodness of its cold  calculating corporate heart it s too much to hope that the embodiment of everything wrong with unrestrained capitalism will go out of business and  frankly  that would be an unemployment disaster  but we can hope for a steady decline and then a collapse  i would also be happy if walmart s board simply had an epiphany that crushing the middle class is not a viable long term strategy  sure  paying a living wage would mean the shareholders would make less money but if the alternative is eventually going out of business because there s not enough demand  it would be more than worth the short term sting either way  let s hope this dip in revenue is the start of something good for america and the world featured image via ai archives
