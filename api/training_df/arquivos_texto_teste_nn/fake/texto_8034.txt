president barack obama has addressed the ridiculous demands that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and republicans like presidential candidate ted cruz have placed on him  insisting that he forego nominating a new supreme court justice after the sudden passing of justice antonin scalia this takedown moment came at the association of southeast asian nations leaders summit in california  where obama sent his  heartfelt condolences  to scalia s loved ones  when he was asked what he would do if mcconnell actually went through with threats to block his scotus nominee  obama ripped the republicans a new one by reminding them that it was his constitutional duty to find a replacement  and that it was their constitutional duty to  do their job  and vote on his nominee  he said  the constitution is pretty clear about what s supposed to happen now  when there s a vacancy on the supreme court  the president of the united states is to nominate someone  the senate is to consider that nomination and either they disapprove of that nominee or that nominee is elevated to the supreme court historically  this has not been viewed as a question  obama  who is actually a former constitutional law professor  then hilariously mocked the republican lawmakers who tried to deny his presidential duties with ridiculous interpretations of the u s  constitution  i m amused when i hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there  we ve almost gotten accustomed to how obstructionist the senate has become when it comes to nominations  in some ways  this argument is just an extension of what we ve seen in the senate  generally  obama voiced his disappointment in the republicans  resolve to stop him  noting that the supreme court is  the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day to day politics   going forward  obama suggested that it would be  a good moment for us to rise above  the resistance and obstructionism in congress then  obama said another thing the gop wouldn t like   that they were far from discouraging him from fulfilling his responsibility to nominate  in due time  a very well qualified candidate   obama said  if we are following basic precedent  then that nominee will be presented before the committees  the vote will be taken and  ultimately  they will be confirmed  although obama didn t reveal who he would choose  the president did assure everyone that we re going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind  somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law  i m going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat  and any fair minded person  even somebody who disagrees with my politics  would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court  you can watch obama take down republicans at the conference below  featured image via pete souza
