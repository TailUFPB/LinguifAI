beyonce knowles took the field at super bowl  and the crowd went wild  the mega star and her corps of dancers were perfectly choreographed and brilliantly outfitted  it was lively and entertaining  it was also  unfortunately  far too  black  for those wonderful american racists who just can t help but ruin everything in case you weren t paying attention  beyonce s dancers wore berets  which automatically means they support herman bell  the famous black panther who was tried and convicted of murder in the  without ever being positively identified by an all white jury  even if bell were indisputably guilty   which is beyond questionable   by that logic any white person wearing a cross around their neck supports the westboro baptist church  but i digress at one point  the dancers formed an  x  on the field  an obvious and admitted tribute to malcolm x  they also formed an arrow that pointed at beyonce  which was obviously meant to call attention to the black woman on the field  and we can t have that  only black men in uniform are allowed on football fields  and only if they never have an opinion about anything or show any emotion whatsoever  it upsets racists beyonce and her team also put their fists up in a  black power  salute  which is also a common sign used by the black panthers and millions of other people since the   the coup de gras came after the performance  however  when several of the dancers were photographed around a sign that read  justice for mario wood   a young black man murdered by police  which of curse also ties beyonce to the black lives matter movement the song beyonce chose is also about her pride for her heritage  the lyrics included  my daddy alabama   momma louisiana  you mix that negro with that creole   make a texas bamma i like my baby hair    with baby hair and afros i like my negro nose   with jackson five nostrils  the racist douchebags of america have declared that they won t stand for this sort of thing  these shenanigans are unbefitting a halftime show and they won t sit idly by and allow it to happen  a black woman and her black dancers performed a number that wasn t acceptable to them  so they demand a return to the glory days when only paul mccartney  elton john and other white people were allowed to entertain at halftime fifteen minutes of the left shark bouncing around to the chicken dance would be more acceptable than having to endure black culture mixed in with their coldplay  and just why the hell would chris martin join two black artists at the end for a chorus promoting unity for all people  disgusting sadly  that isn t an exaggeration  the racist bags of sh t of america can t understand how black artists do anything other than smile and sing innocuous lyrics while impersonating the four tops  rejecting their desire to be individuals or to protest for the good of the white race  they are so upset about it  there s now an eventbrite announcement for an anti beyonce rally outside the nfl headquarters scheduled for february   the front page of the event reads as though beyonce held up pictures of michael brown and screamed  black power  into the mic  sorry to burst your bubble  racists  but even that would have been acceptable as if that weren t bad enough  the images used to promote the protest are actually of herman bell herman bell was an activist during turbulent times who managed to turn his life around and earn a dual bachelor s and a master s degree and become a positive role model and mentor  all while incarcerated for  years for a crime he swears he didn t commit  in true racist a holes of america fashion  all they see is an angry young man from another era who was convicted  style by a jury of someone else s peers organizers have also taken to twitter  where the memes about how evil black people are and how all they can be are criminals are also making the rounds in connection with the  boycottbeyonce  movement  fun fact bernieblacks are incarcerated at higher rate because they commit higher rate of crime   nhprimary pic twitter com   jared wyand   jaredwyand  february    are so many ways a guy like that needs to be educated  the first way would be  how to remove your own hgead from your ass and read a book   they tend to hide lots of useful information in those things here s the tweet that perfectly sums up the situation  boycottbeyonce   i wish black people would just entertain me instead of standing up for  blacklivesmatter   being proud of their culture   jen miller   jenerallyspeaks  february    rally will happen  racists will gather and demand to be heard  because they are white  black people will be painted as even more evil than those darned hispanics  at the end of the day they ll go home and nobody will care  the super bowl will continue to offer entertaining halftime shows by artists of all backgrounds  because they love ratings and money sorry  you meatheads  but the nfl won t be putting david allen coe on stage anytime soon  featured image from screen capture
