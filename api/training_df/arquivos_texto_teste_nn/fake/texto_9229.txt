last week  president trump totally humiliated abc news on twitter  as he pointed out their embarrassing attempt at  gotcha journalism  when brian ross erroneously reported in a  breaking news  story  that michael flynn was told by donald trump to talk to the russian ambassador during his campaign  brian ross was suspended for a month  president trump suggested should be fired for his  fakenews reporting congratulations to  abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia  russia  russia witch hunt  more networks and  papers  should do the same with their fake news   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    week  it was nbc s  never trump  megyn kelly s chance to exact revenge on president trump  who after attacking him during his first debate  lost her conservative fox news fanbase and basically saw her promising career come to a screeching halt  nbc picked up kelly in a   million per year contract in a gamble that liberals would warm up to the formerly conservative host  nbc has since found out that conservatives no longer want anything to do with kelly  and liberals despise her for her past performances as a top rated host on conservative leaning fox news twitter users were on fire after megyn kelly did her part to help tear down president trump  again  megyn kelly you and your employer need to smear trump but there s nothing left to accuse him of so you re going to re interview trump accusers who ve already been proven pos liars how desperate you must be   philip schuyler   fiverights  december     megyn kelly traipsed out  a trio of donald trump accusers on her failing show  rest assured  there will be many more liberal accusers who come out against donald trump  as racism appears to have lost its glow  as a means to draw voters into the democrat party  as americans have become tired of watching democrats constantly drawing from the bottom of the deck  as a way to cloud trump s  make america great again  agenda of a pro growth economy  jobs  education  lower taxes  and america first megyn kelly  who is desperate for ratings  must have been incredibly disappointed when breaking news of a botched suicide bomber attack in new york city was reported at the same time her democrat donald trump accuser was telling her story on her show daily mail a trio of the president s accusers reemerged on monday to hound him for sexually harassing them samantha holvey  jessica leeds and rachel crooks had previously made allegations against trump and appeared on megyn kelly  today  to demand justice as the white house resumed its claim that the issue had been litigated in last year s election  all of a sudden  he s all over  me  kissing and groping and groping and kissing   said leeds  a self proclaimed democrat  who says she revealed her story because  i wanted people to know what kind of a person that trump really is what a pervert he is  this is the same jessica leeds that accused trump of sexual harassment think megyn kelly will bring this picture up think she ll bring up the time that jessica leeds was in a two year property law suit with trump  pic twitter com   whitenitemare     december    claims that trump assaulted on a plane in the   and called her a  c     when he ran into her some time later at a party in new york while he was still married to his first wife ivana megyn kelly asked former trump accuser jessica leeds what she wants other women to know about sexual harassment  leeds replied   we have a problem in that we have been enculturated all of this time for all of this time  for years and years and years  to be compliant   leeds went on to say   for the woman who voted for trump  they just didn t want to vote for a woman   it became reasonably difficult to believe a single work leeds had to say when she used the word enculturated  when referring to her alleged meeting with donald trump  it became impossible to believe a word she said when leeds followed up her comment by exposing her bitter feelings towards women for not voting for hillary   the only thing missing from leeds during her appearance on the megyn kelly show was her pussy hat and an  i m a committed democrat feminist  tattoo on her forehead  watch watch   if there are other women out there  what do you want them to know     megyn asks trump accusers jessica leeds  samantha holvey   rachel cooks on  megyntoday pic twitter com   megyn kelly today   megyntoday  december    crooks tell megyn her alleged story here  is it true he  asked for your phone number     megynkelly  yeah i remember saying   what do you need that for    trump accuser rachel crooks on  megyntoday pic twitter com   today   todayshow  december    the obvious excitment of megyn kelly to be able to pretend as though she s relevant with a breaking news announcemnt with the official white house response to the allegations watch  statement the  whitehouse just provided to  megyntoday pic twitter com   megyn kelly today   megyntoday  december    mail  the two other women said that trump s conduct while he was a businessman left them  shocked  and  devastated  and feeling  very gross  and  very dirty  i was so uncomfortable  and a little  yeah  threatened  like i didn t have a choice   crooks on monday said kelly s program was preempted in new york as an explosion went off in manhattan  her show aired in other parts of the country  however  including washington holvey  a former miss usa contestant  said that trump came backstage in  and reviewed the women while they were indecent she recalled thinking at the time that it would be a meet and great with trump  but it wasn t the former miss north carolina says trump was  just looking me over like i was just a piece of meat  i was not a human being  i did not have a brain i did not have a personality  i was just simply there for his pleasure  it left me feeling very gross  very dirty  like this is not what i signed up for  here s how twitter responded to megyn s show  you know the russia narrative is over when megyn kelly is having trump accusers on her show it will be never ending the next   years the media is becoming the little boy that cried wolf if they ever did find real dirt on trump  no one will believe them   josh   joshnoneyabiz  december    kelly is interviewing the lying  blind mice trump accusers to save her failing show  hope it s the final blow revealing to all that it s all about megyn  for megyn   nothing but megyn s self serving ass who owes trump gratitude for her relevancy   tiff      december
