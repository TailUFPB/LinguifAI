you have to love the republican party  they call themselves the party of  family values   they hold themselves to a  higher moral standard   they think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than democrats  all of those things  however  are underscored by the one thing that defines republicans more than anything else  hypocrisy the gop controlled missouri state legislature is considering a bill from rep bart korman that would require the  gift  of sex with a lobbyist to be disclosed  but not with a monetary value  take your time and read it again  your eyes aren t deceiving you  the actual wording of the bill states  the term  gift  shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of the general assembly or his or her staff  relations between married persons or between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the lobbyist  the election of the member to the general assembly  or the employment of the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision  the reporting of sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation  so  yeah  if you re married to a lobbyist or are in an actual relationship with a lobbyist you re good  but if you re boinking one for political gain you have to report it without attaching a dollar value  that little stipulation would presumably keep parties involved from being charged with solicitation there is some speculation that the bill has its origins in a political quagmire of corruption that korman himself is at the center of  according to our friends at freak out nation what we have here is a classic kindergarten game of  if i can t have it  neither can you  that dates back to a kerfuffle related to a fancypants dinner  meeting  held in january    the house telecommunications committee  which is led by none other than rep  korman  held a  meeting  at the jefferson city country club  where the men dined on fancy steaks and other high priced entrees   oh  and this dinner was fully paid for by a lobbying group that the committee oversees the press got wind of it and the public was so incensed that speaker john diehl ordered all future meetings be held at the capital  rep  korman tried to justify the committee s actions by saying that meeting at the club for dinner was the only time the group could congregate so here we are  one year later  and rep  korman proposes this quite bizarre bill that requires sex be listed as a  gift   what does that mean  though  is he insinuating that lobbyists are engaging in sexual activity with lawmakers on a regular basis  is this directed specifically at speaker diehl or another member of the house  so many questions and no answers yet political shenanigans need to be called out on this one for sure  but alas missouri is missouri  republicans in red states seldom feel the need to explain themselves  should the public become concerned with issues they don t want to deal with they can simply introduce a bill limiting abortion  taking food stamps from children or removing any and all gun restrictions on the books shiny object politics at its finest featured image via wikipedia
