talk about throwing your own party under a bus  this trump supporter literally said the gop has rigged elections and that is supposed to prove that hillary clinton has rigged the  election roger stone is one of trump s biggest supporters and in defense of the republican nominee s assertion that the  election is  rigged  in favor of hillary he wrote a column for the hill in an attempt to demonstrate that trump is right to be concerned  not only did it go badly  but the republican party must be totally pissed off about it that s because stone claimed that wisconsin republicans  under reince priebus s leadership  were successful at rigging five elections in the state to make sure things went their way  as someone with great sentimental attachment to the republican party  as i joined as the party of goldwater  both parties have engaged in voting machine manipulation   stone claimed before naming names   nowhere in the country has this been more true than wisconsin  where there are strong indications that scott walker and the reince priebus machine rigged as many as five elections including the defeat of a walker recall election  stone even accused priebus of orchestrating ted cruz s victory over trump in wisconsin earlier this year when the trump vs  cruz primary took place  the same pattern emerged again of a marquette university poll showing a  point shift from trump ahead by   to trump behind by    which was simply absurd  shifts like that don t happen over brief intervals of time  absent a nuclear explosion  it didn t make any sense   unless you knew what was going on was an  instant replay  of walker s victories  the machine priebus built was delivering for cruz big time in short  trump s longtime ally just tried to prove that hillary could rig the election by accusing republicans of rigging five elections and a primary in wisconsin of course  this doesn t prove trump s accusation against hillary  what it does do  however  is call into question the trustworthiness of republicans  if reince priebus is capable of rigging elections in wisconsin to the point where republicans can win five of them he is definitely capable of rigging a national election to make sure republicans gain absolute power even though all of the polls indicate that trump is losing this election badly trump own man just kneecapped the gop nominee s own claims by shifting the election rigging accusation to republicans featured image via justin sullivan getty images
