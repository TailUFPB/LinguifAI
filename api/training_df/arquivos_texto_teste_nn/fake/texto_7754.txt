republican donors are in a panic over the growing surge of conservative votes for donald trump in the republican primary process  in reaction to his delegate lead and expected success on super tuesday  a cabal of high dollar republican donors had a conference call with one goal in mind  stop trump meg whitman  todd ricketts and paul singer  among others  all took part in the call with about  people  urging them to fund our principles pac  which was funded largely by a member of the ricketts family  and which started airing ads in iowa before the caucuses to try to stop mr  trump  the state is the only one that mr  trump has not won of the first four nominating contests  there are other entities looking to thwart mr  trump  but the call was primarily about our principles pac  according to two participants  who asked not to be identified in order to talk about a private discussion the call participants are largely previous bankrollers of republican campaigns that were knocked out by trump and his nativist pro white campaign but the new york times reports that the effort to funnel campaign cash into an anti trump pac still hasn t decided on a consensus anti trump candidate  the failure to decide on marco rubio  ted cruz  or even john kasich as the straight up alternative to the reality tv star has split the  anti  vote and allowed trump to continue to romp through the process putting money in a largely unregulated super pac is no silver bullet either  trump has already survived the well funded right to rise super pac  who backed jeb bush  which oddly spent much of its campaign war chest on anti rubio efforts  rather than targeting trump the panic call comes as a new cnn poll shows trump losing badly to both democratic candidates  he is   below hillary clinton and   behind bernie sanders featured image via flickr
