donald trump may soon be facing the november election completely alone  a new report from time is detailing an ultimatum between rnc chairman reince priebus and the republican presidential candidate  either he cleans up his act  or the republican party will stop funding him citing polls that show trump s campaign in the gutter  priebus  in a phone call with trump  told the nominee that if he didn t change the trajectory of his message  the party would instead focus on funding and supporting down ballot races in the house and senate  priebus also allegedly told trump he would have been better off staying at his florida estate  mar a lago  after the convention considering democrats are poised to take back the senate and make significant gains in the house  the republicans should utterly and completely dump trump the alleged phone call stemmed after trump s confrontation with the gold star khan family  and his refusal to endorse paul ryan and john mccain trump  of course  denied this  saying he never said that  we never had a conversation about that  we do very well together  we never had that conversation  doesn t exist  and by the way  reince priebus is a terrific guy  he never said that  it was never stated  why would they state that when i m raising millions of dollars for them something tells me his latest  second amendment  comment isn t what priebus had in mind  priebus also told trump that his loyalty is not to the trump campaign  but to the republican party  saying he is  not the chairman to the trump campaign  and that he would do what s best for the gop priebus and trump talk frequently  with the party chair urging trump for months to professionalize his operations and campaign  but the tenor of the calls turned more frank and frustrated last week as trump s campaign slide continued  the officials said priebus reminded trump that his title is rnc chairman  not chairman of the trump campaign  adding that he would act in the best interests of the republican partytrump is the nominee for president of the united states   it s safe to say priebus failed to do what is best for the gop  his own economic agenda was drowned out by his calls for a  second amendment  remedy for hillary clinton  and a slew of prominent republicans have been abandoning ship and announcing their support for clinton the gop is in full tail spin mode  and it s all thanks to donald trump featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
