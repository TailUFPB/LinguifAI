while most of us probably wish former congresswoman michele bachmann  r mn  would just go away  she reared her head again on wednesday to do what conservatives do best  blame and insult president barack obama in a column for worldnetdaily  bachmann has written something so absolutely ridiculous and senseless that one has to wonder if she was intoxicated when she thought of it  in a blog post  bachmann absolutely loses it and goes on an enormous rant on all of obama s supposed failures  noting that  this week  a united states president was humiliated on the world s stage by an aging  insulting communist dictator   while the entire post is preposterous  the real kicker is when she reveals her belief that god sent terrorists to carry out the tragic brussels attacks to humiliate obama and punish him because he made a historical visit to cuba instead of attending the american israel public affairs committee  aipac  conference  seriously  she even titled the post  obama visits cuba while civilization burns   she wrote  maybe our president s humiliation comes in a manner so devastating it makes one wonder whether the creator of humankind isn t reminding this world of the inferiority of foolishness in the face of wisdom the president once again mocked his nemesis  the jewish people and the nation of israel  by cleverly turning the international press corps toward his brilliant work in cuba  instead of covering ongoing islamic attacks against the jewish state as outlined that very same day at the annual pro israel aipac meeting in washington  d c history changed less than  hours later in the blink of an eye  and the rug was pulled out from under his well laid plans obama s slavish press corps was forced to turn their uncritical gaze from adoring him to revealing the newest carnage in brussels our eyes were spellbound  you can read the entire belligerent post here  to be perfectly honest  if bachmann is trying to make christianity look bad  she s doing an amazing job  claiming that god would send terrorists to kill  and wound approximately  people just to soil obama s reputation is not really a great approach for the religious right we re sure numerous conservatives will stand behind bachmann  confidently believing that if only the president had been at the aipac conference instead of cuba  god would have been happy and the brussels attack wouldn t have happened  bachmann ended the post by accusing obama for peddling the dangerous fantasy of multicultural diversity  globalization and one world nonsense   and by saying  the choice is ours  which leaders will we choose  not little big man  not today  featured image via getty images
