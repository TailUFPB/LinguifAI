and republicans wonder why they are not doing well among hispanics on friday  hillary clinton announced us senator from virginia tim kaine as her vice presidential running mate  kaine  who speaks fluent spanish  used his language skills during a rally with clinton on saturday and donald trump supporter scottie nell hughes had a problem with it  i appreciate him having multi cultural and speaking spanish  i think that s a great idea   she claimed before demonstrating trump s nativism   and we can all bring out our languages  melania can come out and speak her five different languages as well  but what mr  trump did  he spoke in a language that all americans can understand  that is english  of course  she couldn t resist insulting hispanics and the spanish language either  and that is one good thing that was great i thought  i didn t have to get a translator for anything that was going on at the rnc this week  and i m hoping i m not gonna have to start brushing up back on my  dora the explorer  to understand some of the speeches given this week  here s the video via youtube trump and republicans already face serious backlash from hispanic voters in november since the republican nominee has been insulting them since the first day of his campaign  according to gallup  trump is viewed unfavorably by  percent of hispanics as gallup noted the major factor most likely contributing to trump s image deficit among hispanics is one of the first highly publicized controversies of his presidential campaign in june  when he called for building a giant wall along the mexican border  he also characterized mexicans coming into the u s  as drug traffickers and rapists  since then  trump s strong and controversial stances against other immigrant groups may have reinforced the ill will among hispanics  the majority of whom immigrated to this country within the last several generations just like the women vote  trump could end up losing a larger percentage of the hispanic vote tha mitt romney did in  and hillary clinton could win both groups by larger margins than president obama did and conservative hatred of dora the explorer is well documented according to alternet dora the explorer is an adorable  year old brown girl who travels the world on missions and teaches kids spanish in each episode  the cartoon is almost universally loved  and when it emerged it felt revolutionary young girls of color could see themselves being strong and adventurious just as they were forming their perceptions of self  but when the state of arizona began its racist crusade against latinos under the guise of curbing immigration  some extreme right wingers saw dora as a good high profile way to perpetuate their racism without actually targeting anyone real  in   a fake mug shot of dora looking beat up and holding the sign  illegal border crossing resisting arrest  appeared on right wing sites  keep in mind  dora is supposed to be eight  if there s any question about the vitriol the right harbors toward undocumented immigrants  look no further in short  this is why hispanics hate republicans right now  clearly  that hispanic outreach the gop promised after their crushing defeat in  never happened featured image via screen capture
