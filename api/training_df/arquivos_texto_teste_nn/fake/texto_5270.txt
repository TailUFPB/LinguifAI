mike pence  the right wing nut who is running alongside donald trump for the vice presidential position  had a few words for president obama after his speech at the democratic national convention when he called trump a  homegrown demogauge  among other things  i don t think name calling has any place in public life  and i thought that was unfortunate that the president of the united states would use a term like that  let alone laced into a sentence like that  you read that right  mike pence  who s running alongside donald trump  is offended that president obama would resort to  name calling  in public the irony is just too rich with this one  coupled with trump having his feelings hurt by speakers at the dnc  the hypocrisy from the trump camp could not be more rank thanks to the new york times  we know that donald trump has insulted  personally  over  people  places and things   just on twitter alone while pence is offended by the  homegrown demogauge  line  he seems perfectly fine with words and lines like  corrupt  crooked  dopey clown  goofy  pocahontas  perv  sleazebag  disgrace  dummy  irrelevant clown  moron  loser  wacko  crazy  waste of time and energy  low life  phony  hokey garbage  sloppy  grubby  buffoon  bimbo  dog  bitch  truly weird the list  as documented by the nyt  goes on and on so  to mike pence  please do us all a favor and shut up  if you really don t want name calling in politics  maybe you should talk to your running mate first  considering that right after bloomberg s speech  trump revived his  little  insult once given to marco rubio trump and pence are buckling under the pressure of public opinion  and their inability to see past their own hypocrisy is turning republicans against them  as well as independents  featured image via sarah d  davis getty images
