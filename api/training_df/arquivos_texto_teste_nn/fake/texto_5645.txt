the religious right s attempt to stop women from exercising their legal right to an abortion is facing its biggest setback in years  after realizing that national abortion laws are a no go  especially with a democratic president  conservatives have attempted to use their control of state governments in order to roll back women s rights but the recent   supreme court decision in the case of whole woman s health v  hellerstedt found that many of the roadblocks erected by the religious right through the republican party have put an  undue burden  on women seeking abortion services  and have to be struck down as a result  there is a wave of anti choice legislation being undone since monday  laws restricting abortion and non abortion planned parenthood funding have already been temporarily or permanently wiped out in six states  the center for reproductive rights filed a new case friday challenging a whopping seven of louisiana s new abortion restrictions  and on the heels of whole woman s health  planned parenthood federation of america announced an effort to pursue repealing laws in eight states through legislatures   even lawmakers hostile to abortion may prefer the less expensive option of repealing a law  rather than having to defend one that is unlikely to stand after the supreme court s decision  now  republican lawmakers who had planned more abortion restrictions are being forced to put their plans on ice or give up on them completely  they no longer have a blank check for their attacks on women s rights and the right has a problem nationally  while polls show voters believe in some restrictions on choice  most americans believe that a woman has a right to abortion services  the support is even higher among women  and republicans have ceased to be a majority in presidential elections largely thanks to votes from women  it is a losing case for them to be so opposed to abortion rights in this year s election  hillary clinton has already been hammering donald trump on choice  clinton of course supports abortion rights  while since the campaign began trump has argued in favor of  punishment  for women who get abortions once they are outlawed  as the republican party platform calls for  the current supreme court vacancy will be key to future battles over abortion  as will vacancies that are likely to open up over the next four years  in large part due to the advanced age of several of the justices  including liberal stalwart ruth bader ginsburg featured image via flickr
