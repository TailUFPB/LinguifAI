a day after he schooled republicans during his historic state of the union address  president obama smacked them down again in their own backyard on wednesday  president obama traveled to america s heartland to speak to a crowd in omaha  nebraska and just like he did on multiple occasions on tuesday night  called out republicans for their bullshit claims about the state of our country  that s how crazy our politics has gotten  where we now feel obliged to not root for america doing good  so when you hear people peddling this fiction about our enemies getting stronger  america getting weaker  when you hear folks say we can solve challenges by looking meaner or talking tougher  or carpet bombing wherever we want  that s just hot air  it s bluster  it s not serious  there s another word for it that starts with a b  it s baloney  here  the video via youtube during the state of the union address  president obama chided republicans for refusing to accept the science of climate change  and slammed them for not voting for military action against isis even as they claim that he isn t doing enough to stop them despite what republicans like ted cruz and donald trump say  america is already great and has been getting stronger every day as president obama s policies continue to make republicans desperate to destroy him  america has witnessed an unprecedented job growth streak that has reduced unemployment to  percent  meanwhile  more americans than ever before are gaining health insurance for themselves and their families  president obama has also taken actions to fight climate change and has struck back against terrorist organizations time and time again over the course of his presidency  dealing heavy blows to their leadership structure in particular yet  to hear republicans talk  you would think that america has been rendered into a wasteland that somehow only they can save  the only problem is that they have to lie repeatedly to make anyone think that  the facts  however  tell us that america is progressing and flourishing despite every republican attempt to sabotage it over the years  and that s because president obama has been a great leader  which is why republicans are so desperate to have us believe that america is falling apart or faces destruction  because the only way they will ever win the presidency again is if enough americans actually believe them featured image  pete souza
