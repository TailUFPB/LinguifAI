having been quiet since his presidential campaign went down in flames in   mitt romney is suddenly back in the spotlight after forcefully condemning current republican front runner donald trump  but while it s great that romney sees the inherent bigotry in trump s message and wants to condemn it  there s just one problem  romney loved trump back when he was running for president or as trump himself recently crudely put it  he was begging for my endorsement  i could have said   mitt  drop to your knees   and he would have dropped to his knees  he was begging  true  he was begging me  in an interview with cnn s gloria borger  romney was forced to defend his earlier opportunistic praise for trump   and things quickly went off the rails when borger mentioned trump s endorsement  romney said at the time trump didn t seem that bad  like a good journalist  borger didn t let him off the hook  instead  she noted that there were already signs that donald trump was a world class scumbag  after all  he was the  godfather of the obama birther movement  romney  in the sort of hypocrisy he became known for during his election campaign  managed to remind us why we didn t vote for him in the first place  trump s birtherism wasn t a big deal  but attacking megyn kelly is well  no  i think that s a very different thing than calling mexicans rapists  than saying that muslims are not going to be allowed into the country as immigrants  than mocking a disabled reporter  going after women and saying oh  she asks tough questions because she was in her menstrual cycle is highly offensive  i said i disagreed with him  there are political views about one another where we re going to disagree  but what he has said during this campaign  that george w  bush is a liar  that john mccain isn t a hero  i mean  he said some things that are completely  totally outrageous so when he makes racist attacks against obama during romney s presidential campaign  romney has no problem  but now that he is undermining the gop s effort to appeal to minorities or calling george w  bush a liar  suddenly romney is feeling very sanctimonious it was no secret that mitt romney spent much of his campaign publicly finger wagging at his voters for obsessing over obama s birth certificate  while at the same time playing up the controversy at every opportunity  in august of   romney even took it a step further and stoked the flames himself with this appalling  joke  i love being home  in this place where ann and i were raised  where both of us were born no one s ever asked to see my birth certificate  they know that this is the place that we were born and raised  so when romney says he disagrees with trump  now  on the issues  it s only because four years ago  trump s disgusting racism could be used as a means to an end   whip up the racists and get them to the polls  it s hard to imagine a person having less credibility on the issue of integrity than mitt romney watch the interview below via cnn  birther comments begin around the   mark featured image via cnn
