a school board member in illinois is getting heat for expressing her own personal way of kicking off black history month  with blatant  inexcusable racism jeanette ward  part of elgin area school district u   didn t waste a moment telling her peers how she really felt about african americans during a month dedicated to the accomplishments and milestones of historical black figures  on february   ward created a post on the board s facebook page that began with this  blacks have become their own worst enemy  and liberal leaders do not help matters by blaming self inflicted wounds on whites or  society  the notion that racism is holding back blacks as a group  or that better black outcomes cannot be expected until racism has been vanquished  is a dodge  and encouraging blacks to look to politicians to solve their problems does them a disservice  as the next chapter explains  one lesson maybe the most important one for blacks is that having a black man in the oval office is less important than having one in the home  ward immediately received heat for this  and was torn apart at a monday night board meeting for her  irresponsible  and  racist speech    which was so coincidentally timed on the very first day of black history month one of the speakers  myrna becker  expressed that she was appalled by ward s words  she said   when we honor black history month  we ought to know what black history is all about  danise habun of the elgin human relations commission also agreed that ward was out of line  there was nothing respectful toward or celebratory of black history month contained in the passage posted by ms  ward  if her words and the quoted passage from the book is indeed to offer a fresh perspective  it appears as if there has been a failure to communicate  it continues to blame the victim  and ignores institutionalized racism  as an official elected to represent all members of the u  school district  ms  ward is to be held to a high standard of behavior and conduct  despite the widespread backlash she received  ward didn t think there was anything wrong with her post  and said she was merely giving a different perspective to black history month  she also pointed out that the author she quoted  jason riley  was african american  so her post couldn t possibly be racist or disrespectful ward has continued to stand behind her remarks and refuses to back down  which isn t surprising  considering that ward has a history of being offensive and socially ignorant  last year  ward objected to an anti bullying program that would address homophobic slurs in schools  according to ward  using  gay  as an insult wasn t as bad as calling someone  retarded  or  girly  because homosexuality is a choice  while being mentally retarded or a female is not  ward just doesn t have a clue  and has no interest in getting one  featured image via elgin school board facebook
