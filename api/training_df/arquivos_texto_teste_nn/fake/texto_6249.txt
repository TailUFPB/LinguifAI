national rifle association president wayne lapierre had an absolute meltdown at the organization s annual conference on friday about voting rights  lapierre is extremely pissed off that democrats want to restore voting rights to ex felons  apparently  he doesn t think these people deserve the right to vote  but he s totally cool with violent felons owning guns during his speech in louisville  kentucky  lapierre said  there is no limit to how far the elites will go to put hillary in the white house  they re even allowing convicted felons the right to vote  including violent rapists and murderers  it sounds outrageous  but it s true  the democratic led maryland general assembly did it for   ex cons  in virginia  democratic gov  terry mcauliffe   hillary s longtime bagman   did it for   convicted felons tentacles of the clinton machine are out registering those felons right now  they re releasing them and then they re registering them  heck  when they sign their release papers  they might as well just give them a hillary bumper sticker at the prison door  the nra president isn t wrong  maryland and virginia did restore voting rights for that number of people and rightfully so   unlike republicans  we believe that everyone deserves the right to vote  voting is in an inalienable right and it should not be taken away because someone was convicted of a felony  i personally believe that even my father s murderer should be allowed to vote  i loathe him  but my personal feelings should not have any influence over whether or not he performs his civic duty  he was convicted of killing my dad  went to prison  served his time and released  he was held accountable for his actions  paid the price and now is free to live his life republicans  on the other hand  are against restoring voting rights because felons are disproportionately likely to be minorities  my dad s murderer was white  and minorities tend to be democratic voters  the gop are notorious for voter suppression shenanigans targeting poor  minority and young voters because they know that the fewer people at the polls  the more likely they are to win  so  of course  lapierre doesn t want felons to have their voting rights restored  but he does want them to own guns according to the huffington post the nra and the republicans they have in their pockets have been fighting for decades to restore gun ownership rights to felons  in many cases  those felons were convicted of violent crimes and when they were allowed to own firearms again  they committed more offenses  that is of no consequence to the right or the nra  because they believe in second chances  for gun owners  anyway in   rep  ken buck  r colo   sponsored an amendment that would have funded a program to restore second amendment rights to ex offenders  during a floor speech  buck said  america is a land of second chances  one mistake should not define your future   the nra boasted about the amendment on their facebook page https   www facebook com nationalrifleassociation posts  the land of second chances  unless you would like to vote  the hypocrisy is breathtaking  isn t it  now  the right could argue that we  too  are being hypocrites because we do not believe that ex felons should be allowed to own guns again  i disagree  i m fine with ex felons having their gun ownership rights restored if they did not commit a violent felony  i m sorry  but if you hurt somebody and went to prison for it  you cannot be trusted with a gun  period  owning a firearm and voting is not the same thing wayne lapierre and his followers only care about one thing  arming as many people as they possibly can so that gun manufacturers get richer and richer  they don t actually care about ex felons  because is they did they d make sure the same people they wanted to give guns to  also had their rights to participate in their democracy restored featured image via scott olson getty images
