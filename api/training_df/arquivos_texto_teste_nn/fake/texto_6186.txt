republicans  priorities are out of whack  in texas  the gop is currently waging a war on women   specifically on their ability to have a safe and sanitary abortion instead of taking a wire hanger to the bathroom  top gop legislators in the state have waged an extended war on planned parenthood based on fraudulent  heavily edited videos depicting the health organization as an evil cabal that murders babies and sells their body parts to the highest bidder top gop legislators in the state have waged an extended war on planned parenthood based on fraudulent  heavily edited videos depicting the health organization as an evil cabal that murders babies and sells their body parts to the highest bidder  though the creators of the  baby parts  videos were ultimately indicted by a grand jury and face decades in prison  the war on planned parenthood rages on in the lone star state texas  latest assault on women s rights comes in the form of an attempt to legislate bathrooms so that transgender women   even those some would call  passable  in a callous and offhanded sense   would be forced to use the men s restroom  a bill filed sunday would institute harsh penalties for anyone who was born with a penis if they entered a women s shower or toilet facility regardless of whether or not they identify as a woman  in fact  lt  gov  dan patrick recently called this blatant act of discrimination a priority of the  highest order  that s not a euphemism  while republicans are focused on legislating vaginas in one way or another  it is not a crime for someone to unzip his pants and violate a feline with his penis  this may seem shocking  but it s true on tuesday  bloomberg published a report that revealed some horrific facts about the latest state to embarrass our nation with ridiculous attempts to legalize human rights violations when katie jarl started her job as the texas state director for the humane society of the u s   she received calls on a monthly basis from law enforcement and animal cruelty officers about bestiality cases  they asked whether they could arrest individuals for animal cruelty and how they could remove the animals from the home  she said jarl was forced to tell them they couldn t do anything because bestiality is still legal in the state of texas  the problem is we simply don t have a law   she told bloomberg bna   when something s not illegal  it s a problem for law enforcement  texas is one of nine states and the district of columbia whose criminal codes do not include an enforceable bestiality statute jarl says that unless someone has sex with an animal in public so they can be charged with another crime  there are no limits to what a motivated and sick individual could do to the neighborhood cat  horse  or iguana population  there is absolutely no way to stop someone from exercising their apparent right to violate an animal  jarl says  this  of course  is a problem because crimes against animals often escalate into crimes against humans  including the children whom republicans claim their bathroom bill would protect  animals are often the gateway to abusing children  women  and other human beings   she said prosecutor jessica milligan agreed  milligan heads the animal cruelty division for the district attorney s office of harris county  texas violence against animals and humans typically arise in a domestic violence context  but milligan told bloomberg bna that she has seen more sinister cases  right now they aren t considered criminals   jarl says   they re allowed to do this legally   under current laws  animal rescuers are forced to return runaway pets to their owners when there are clear signs of sexual abuse   something that is certainly not ok unfortunately  one major problem is that texas legislators don t know what the f ck is going on in a general sense  but moreso when it comes to bestiality  jarl says she is working with lawmakers to get a law on the books that would officially ban bestiality  she says that many are surprised it is not already against the law  i never thought i would have to convince anyone that bestiality should be illegal   she says  but in red states  anything is possible  unfortunately  even if she manages to make a law banning bestiality happen  bloomberg notes that rural areas   where animals are seen as tools   will present a problem because unless the media gets involved  it will be difficult to bring attention to the problem milligan says that bestiality is becoming more common in texas  noting an upswing in such horrific would be crimes since about the time president obama was re elected  within the last four years    though she concedes that she is unsure if bestiality is on the rise or if people are just more open about posting their exploits on social media interestingly  texas legislators remain silent on this issue  preferring to expend energy and taxpayer money on a nonsensical  multi pronged war on women featured image via my san antonio visualizeus
