it s become abundantly clear that donald trump doesn t think through what he s saying  basically at any given moment  his mouth has no filter  and he says whatever is on his mind at any time without thinking about the consequences of his speech  and then when people call him on his obnoxious rhetoric  instead of backing down or clarifying  he owns the rhetoric and doubles down on it now  it yet another moment of being incapable of using critical thinking skills  donald trump compares the rolling thunder rally  which is pretty much all motorcycles  to martin luther king jr  s march on washington  and then he also wants the motorcycles to be able to drive all over the national mall  he doesn t like that they re only able to drive on the streets  however  anyone with a thinking brain could tell you that we shouldn t destroy the national mall and have it torn up with hundreds  if not thousands  of motorcycles if trump sincerely means all the things that he says then we ve got a pretty big problem on our hands if he actually becomes president  so  for the sake of all that is good and decent in humanity  no matter who  vote blue watch here watch   realdonaldtrump says he thought rolling thunder rally in d c  would be like mlk s march on washington https   t co   abc news politics   abcpolitics  may    image via video screen capture
