meet abby johnson  abby johnson is a pro life feminist and she has the most thankless job in the world  she s trying to move the anti abortion movement away from rabid  regressive christianity and closer to thoughtful  life affirming feminism  and she s failing  miserably johnson is one of those rare creatures  a pro lifer that actually cares more about life than control  in other words  where most pro lifers couldn t care less about the baby they re supposedly  saving  after it s born  johnson is fighting to make abortion unnecessary in the first place  as her fellow spitter in the wind  serrin foster  the leader of feminists for life  says   there are three key reasons for the feminization of poverty  lack of education  lack of workplace accommodation and paternal support  do that  three fourths of the reasons that women have an abortion are over  and she s not wrong  but that s why the effort to emphasize the  life  in  pro life  is doomed to failure  talk to most any conservative anti abortion person and ask them if they support comprehensive sex education  free contraceptives  pre natal care  post natal care  food  clothes and housing for the women and babies they re so  worried  about  the overwhelming majority of them will absolutely refuse  for them  pregnancy is simple a means to an end  punishing women for having sex they spend a lot of time crying crocodile tears for the  innocent lives  being lost but have zero interest in preventing unwanted pregnancies or getting women the support they need to care for a baby they can t afford  it s about control and punishment  and is always has been  a fact that johnson and her fellow feminists are finding out the hard way while issues such as expanding family leave requirements and access to child care could be an area of consensus for self identified pro life and pro choice feminists   whatever their reasons for supporting them   there seemed to be little enthusiasm at the conference for working with pro choicers on these causes when johnson asked who  the abortion movement  was united behind  an audience member yelled out   the devil    the answer was planned parenthood   the devil   clearly  these are rational people who can think clearly about the best way to prevent abortions  and when johnson discussed hillary clinton  a woman that has spent decades fighting for women s rights  that didn t go so well with the crowd of  concerned  women johnson was speaking to while clinton has the clearly better record on policies supporting mothers   policies that speakers like foster and jacobson said help dissuade women from choosing abortion   the only positive references to presidential candidates at the event were allusions to donald trump s promises to pick supreme court justices who would roll back roe v  wade  anti choice leaders as a whole have rallied behind trump  who besides vowing to  cherish  women and appoint anti choice judges  has not offered any serious plans for improving the lot of women in the workforce or helping women out of poverty as long as the anti abortion movement overwhelmingly views an unwanted pregnancy as a punishment for women  they will never stop trying to make abortion illegal in the united states  in a perfect world  johnson would be leading an army of women to washington to pass laws giving women everything they need to raise a unplanned child in safety and good health  thus ending almost all need for an abortion  instead  she s going to waste her time trying to convince women who clearly hate other women that they should really be pro life instead of pro control good luck with that photo by pete marovich getty images
