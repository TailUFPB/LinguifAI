the announcement that harriet tubman would replace andrew jackson on the   bill came as little surprise to most  who celebrated progress with a show of support for a truly amazing woman  if you live in the insane  historically inaccurate world of the modern right  you heard a different story altogether  one of the evils of the  democrat party  and how their founder tried to stop the gun toting  republican abolitionist  harriet tubman yes  that really is the lie they re spinning  it seems that in most cases of republicans losing someone they fiercely admired they tend to go back to the time of lincoln when the men were men and northerners were republicans  it really is that easy to understand  yet conservatives just don t get it  in the time leading up to the civil war  northern progressives like abraham lincoln were in the process of forming a very different republican party than the one we know today  the southerners fought  seceded  lost  spent a good deal of time living with their humiliation and moved on  content to stick together as democrats and that doesn t seem strange to these people  it doesn t seem odd that the republicans who abolished slavery  wrote the  and  amendments and stood side by side with women until they could vote were predominately northern progressive liberals  andrew jackson was the president who saw the beginning of the democratic party and he was a slave owner from the south  that doesn t seem a little odd we re talking about harriet tubman here  the woman was armed because she lived in fear for her life and for the lives of those she helped  she didn t belong to a political party  since as a black woman during slavery she wouldn t have been able to vote for several reasons  to call her a champion of the republican party would be like trying to claim that lincoln himself would be a proud card carrying member today  yeah  i know they claim that all the time you can read the ridiculous claim  which is basically a  paragraph propaganda piece circulating among such reputable publications as alan b west s site  fox news hasn t picked it up yet  but the comments on one of their local affiliates who reported the story say it all that s just the tip of the iceberg  people sure do love to make things up online how about some conspiracy  the president naturally spends much of his day thinking of ways to screw over americans  that s how much he hates us and good golly the cost  new  that were going to be printed need to be printed  maybe we should add that to a conversation about how little the average republican knows about the budget numerous people have also been to the thread to let them know that the republican party officially became the party of southern regressive morons the day strom thurmond jumped ship and joined  your first political move  defraud and disenfranchise as many voters as possible across the south running on what we now know as the  southern dixiecrat strategy  then  as republicans  you shot down the era  tried in vain to kill the civil rights movement  created the moral majority  the tea party and the freedom caucus and stocked them with religious zealots just to brighten our day  you re also responsible for the rise of donald trump the bottom line  you don t get to claim harriet tubman as one of yours and you certainly don t get to stick us with andrew jackson  as a northern progressive  my great  great  great grandfather lived on the happy end of the underground railroad  no matter who he voted for in   stop trying to rewrite history and move along featured image via  com facebook
