maine is one of those beautiful places where bustling metropolises lay hidden in the trees  as  you make your way up    a short hop across i  brings you into portland  where sprawling hills are covered with multi family dwellings   historical landmarks  cemeteries with stones dating back to the american revolution and old  massive churches intermingle with the modern amenities of city life  a minor league baseball complex and a bustling downtown full of hipster bars and food trucks it s a pleasant mix of new england quaint meets the rise of the millennials  maine is one of those misunderstood states because of the rural nature and low population  people think of the rural redneck  pick  em up truck driving  hick wearing flannel and hunting moose all day for fun  sure  they exist  by the gross ton  there also exists an urban culture of liberalism that can sometimes take a wrong turn san francisco is a great example  a city that prides itself on being liberal just spent more than a million dollars to hide their homeless problem from super bowl fans  rents in the city have increased so much that the middle class can barely survive  portland  maine may never be san fransisco  but it does have some similarly disturbing issues on the front page of the portland press herald today is a story of a couple dozen residents of an apartment complex in the city  many of the residents are elderly or disabled and on public assistance  the complex was purchased by a private investment firm  most likely for its aged appearance and high ceilings  something very trendy in urban centers of the northeast  with no current leases left to contend with  the owners of the building just said   sorry  get out  the units  which were renting at   per month and affordable to low income and disabled people  will probably become buildings full of   one and two bedroom condos with re finished wood floors  cheap granite countertops and stainless steel appliances with great access to the city  public transportation and the food truck district known as the old port  the next logical step for most of these people would be to seek housing in biddeford or lewiston  the next most likely places to find low income housing  as portland is going the way of the latte  and   mac and cheese and yet again the wealthy will succeed in winning yet another battle against the poor  with no real protections in place for this kind of thing  people who are less fortunate take the fall as the ones who need to  move on  and  take personal responsibility   imagine for a moment you work a job  the only one you can find  that is in the city you barely squeak by living in  within a few blocks of a public bus route  the next thing you know you have nowhere to stay  you can t shower or wash clothes to go to your job  you have no car and the closest affordable place to live is  miles away what do you do  these are real life situations that are happening to people who in many cases can t take proper care of themselves  and yes  as a society it is our responsibility to take care of those who can t take care of themselves  deal with it  you can t let people starve and you can t let them die of exposure because they didn t have a warm place to spend the night portland  maine is a great little city  all hope isn t lost  but when this kind of thing happens and goes unchecked to the point that it s front page news  things are spiraling out of control  featured image from shneiderpropertymanagement com
