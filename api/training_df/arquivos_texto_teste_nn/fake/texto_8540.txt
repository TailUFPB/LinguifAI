during a campaign event in iowa falls  iowa on monday  bernie sanders asked the people in the crowd to hear their experiences on what it is like to live on a    dollar a year income  the response from one woman is both chilling and powerful here is part of one woman s response  it s so hard to do anything to pay your bills  you re ashamed all the time when you can t buy presents for your children it s really  really  really hard   and i work      jobs sometimes  always minimum wage  i have a degree  divorced and it s just i m waiting for disability to come through so my parents have to support me   it s just hard  bernie sanders responds  saying  it is not easy for people to stand up and say that but the truth is that until millions of people who are experiencing what you re experiencing do say that we don t make change  you can watch the entire exchange below the right wing has done everything in their power to make poverty shaming as acceptable as racism has historically been  currently  the default attack on the poor is to claim that they only want free stuff  it s a slightly more de racialized way of calling people welfare queens that s why it can be extremely hard for poor people to come forward with stories of their personal struggles  they have been subjected to the dogma of homo economicus their entire lives  they have a tendency to see themselves as failures  rather than the people living in an economic system that was built for them to survive  not for them to prosper in the same way that the movement during the queer liberation movement was largely successful because it encouraged people to come out of the closest and make some noise  so to the poor must tell their stories of struggle  they must demand that their existence and struggle be heard  and to refuse to allow themselves to be dehumanized by the forces that wish to exploit them featured image credit  gage skidmore via flickr
