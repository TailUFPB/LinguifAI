fox news and republican front runner donald trump have been in a strange power struggle ever since trump decided to boycott the network s thursday night gop debate because the business mogul can t stand to be in the same room as fox host and debate moderator megyn kelly clearly shaken up since kelly got the best of him the first time she moderated the republican debate  trump has decided to make the gop lineup look like even more of a circus by skipping the debate  so far the network is standing by kelly  stating that it wouldn t give into  terrorizations toward any of our employees   but it appears that fox might not be genuine  as it is still secretly trying to get trump back in by using two secret weapons   trump s wife and daughter on wednesday morning  morning joe host joe scarborough exposed fox news ceo roger ailes for trying to get ivanka and melania trump to change the donald s mind about skipping the debate  but trump refused to speak with him and insisted that he d only speak with network owner rupert murdoch  scarborough stated  per our sources  roger ailes was calling ivanka  he was trying to get in touch with trump  he was calling melania  people that he s got a good relationship with  they love roger  they have a great respect for him  but at this point  trump s only gonna talk to rupert  and they re going to figure it out  in response to trump s childish boycott  there s been an outpouring of controversy in the media  even from kelly s side  earlier this week  kelly welcomed liberal filmmaker michael moore onto her show  where the documentarian mocked trump and congratulated the fox host for scaring trump out of the debate   a task that not even his republican rivals could pull off  moore said   in all seriousness  let me say this  you ve done something that jeb bush  chris christie  rubio  cruz   none of them have been able to do  which is to  essentially  frighten him  meanwhile  trump has continued to bash kelly on social media  signaling that his immature  mostly one sided feud with her is far from over  solidifying kelly s point during the first gop debate that trump had zero respect for women  trump tweeted twitterfeatured image via donald trump facebook
