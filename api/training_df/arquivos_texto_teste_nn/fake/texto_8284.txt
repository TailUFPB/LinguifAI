marco rubio might have been flying high after the results from iowa  but he well and truly crashed hard at saturday night s abc gop debate in new hampshire  like carly fiorina and ben carson before him  rubio watched his presidential hopes die there s no way to sugar coat this one   rubio choked  he likely over rehearsed  came prepared with his lines all ready  but was then totally unable to respond to spontaneous questions during the debate  the result  he churned out the exact same line four times in a row  word for word  within minutes  unable to expand on his soundbite someone had clearly told rubio to hit obama hard  and so he had to keep saying that  republicans need to dispense with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing   it landed the first time he said it  but then he just couldn t stop saying it  it was truly awkward to watch  and you could see the panic in his eyes  think about a child in the school play who forgets their next line  so just keeps repeating the last one over and over to a silent audience  that further down the panel  chris christie smelled blood and went in for the kill  he has maintained an attack on rubio for being too polished and inauthentic  and this played right into that  but instead of rubio taking the opportunity to come back at christie with a counter attack  he literally went back and repeated his obama line again  we re not kidding  watch as al com s post debate roundup puts it instead of responding  rubio repeated the same statements and made christie looked like his criticism was spot on  it was a strange exchange and one that seemed to taint the rest of rubio s debate   he ended up repeating himself over and over and looked lost  he did better later in the debate but it could very well be rubio s howard dean moment the morning after the debate  with all eyes on rubio to rally back  the candidate may well have killed his campaign  appearing on abc with george stephanopoulous  rubio was asked to respond to critics of his  robotic  performance  his answer looked great first time  i would pay them to keep running that clip  because that s what i believe passionately  it s one of the reasons that i m not running for re election in the senate  i m running for president  but then stephanopoulos followed up with a rebuttal  but you re getting pounded for repeating that speech  and then it all fell apart  because rubio had scripted one line  and one line only  to respond to critics that he scripts his lines  so  he went on repeat again  i hope they keep running it   he replied   and i m going to keep saying it because it s true  and then he said it again  it s what i believe and it s what i m going to continue to say  because it s one of the main reasons why i am running  if you watch the video closely  you might just be able to spot the exact moment where rubio realizes his presidential hopes just died  featured image via screengrab
