the lack of respect for the office of the president of the united states from republicans is utterly appalling  no matter who the president is  or how much you disagree with their policy proposals or how they conduct business  you respect the office  you don t have the respect the person  but you respect the role they play as the leader of the nation  however  republicans seem to have forgotten this unwritten rule  especially under the presidency of barack obama  their utter disrespect borders on utter impudence for the last seven years we ve even had members of the right wing say that president obama wasn t born in the united states  it s as if they don t consider him valid as a president  so they don t need to offer him the respect and dignity the office of the presidency so rightly deserves yet another example of this insolence can be found in a recent tweet by the republican governor of texas  greg abbott abbott  upset that president obama wants to curb the epidemic of gun violence after mass shootings have become all too common in occurrence  decided that he would directly threaten the president what did the president say that got abbott s underoos in a bunch  a few months ago  i directed my team at the white house to look into any new actions i can take to help reduce gun violence  and on monday  i ll meet with our attorney general  loretta lynch  to discuss our options because i get too many letters from parents  and teachers  and kids to sit around and do nothing  i get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen  who share my belief that the second amendment guarantees a right to bear arms  and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible  dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale  you know  because god forbid we  as a nation  care enough to curb the epidemic of gun violence however  abbott takes it personally  and pandering to his base of voters and the right wing lunatics who feel they should be able to own their personal arsenal to cater to their paranoia  he tweets this at president obama obama wants to impose more gun control  my response    come   take it  nra  tcot  pjnet https   t co  pic twitter com   greg abbott   gregabbotttx  january     of course  this tween is also directed at the nra  because abbott feels the need to whine like the immature child that he presents himself to be  and needs them to help him fight his selfish battles what abbott  and all the other right wing loons need to realize is  when you say   come and take it  to the president of the united states with a picture of a gun or cannon  as the case may be  you are threatening the president of the united states   come and take it  implies you are willing to kill to have your way  you take your argument of clear dissent to that of a direct threat of violence against the president for wanting to impose policy you disagree with abbott also needs to realize that texas is only a state  not its own nation  and they are to abide by the laws of the united states  and any action taken by president obama  otherwise  they are in clear violation of the u s  constitution these words from abbott need to be called what they are   a threat  and abbott needs to held accountable  as the governor of one of the largest states in the u s  he should have a little more maturity than this  act like an adult  and apologize  you don t have to agree with the president  but you need to respect the office featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
