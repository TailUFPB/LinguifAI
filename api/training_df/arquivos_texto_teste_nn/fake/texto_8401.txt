when on the campaign trail  those running for office like to use music to bolster enthusiasm from the crowds  help spread their message  and look as though they re hip to modern day pop culture  often times  what these politicians don t think about is the fact that the artists that make the music might not want their music to be used  especially by specific people  such is the case with donald trump and his use of music by the singing sensation  and goddess  adele trump has continuously used adele s song from her    album  rolling in the deep   of course  the key lyric from that being  we could ve had it all   basically  implying that a vote for trump is a vote for everything you could ever want however  as it turns out  adele does not want trump using her music  and a spokesman for the singer told the independent  adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning  it can also be implied that every time huckabee tries to use adele s song  hello  in the bizarre way that he does  that this too is frowned upon adele has actually chosen to stay out of the political scene altogether  especially after a comment she made in  where she stated that she was a  labour girl   and if you re unaware  the labour party is a center left party in the united kingdom she s not the only one to take issue with politicians using their music  rem even went so far as to take to twitter in a very verbose rant  with frontman michael stipe saying to trump and co   go fuck yourselves  the lot of you you sad  attention grabbing  power hungry little men  do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign  aerosmith also told trump to f ck off in so many words lesson from all of this   ask permission however  it must be frustrating when all the good music out there comes from the left side of the aisle  featured image  instagram flickr
