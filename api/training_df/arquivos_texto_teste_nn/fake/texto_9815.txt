local artist rico lavelle was given the distinct honor and privilege of singing the national anthem on the ford field at the start of the lions football game on sunday  singing the national anthem has always been about honoring our flag and the brave women and men it represents who have given their lives for our nation  the seriousness of what happened near the end of lavelle s performance cannot be understated  rico lavelle used his privilege to honor our flag and our military to instead  take a stand against our current president  to support a divisive  black lives matter  anti cop movement  and to salute the violent black panthers on a national stage the video in and of itself is very disturbing as it shows a total and utter lack of respect for the honor bestowed upon lavelle  but if you watch closely  you ll see  or  young black boys who also had the privilege of taking part of the national anthem on the field  sadly  the young boys appear to be confused about what the local artist rico lavelle  aka midwest rico  is doing when he kneels and raises his fist  perpetuating the lie that america is more racially divided now than ever before  or that all police officers are bad people is  hopefully  not why the lions asked lavelle to honor our flag with his rendition of the  star spangled banner  watch rico lavelle sang the anthem and took a knee pic twitter com   jasmine   jasminelwatkins  september    s performance didn t end on the field  he immediately took to twitter to criticize president trump for being  un american  how can the  leader  of the free world be so un american   rico lavelle     midwestrico  september    on twitter  lavelle retweeted a message of encouragement from the boston globe deputy washington bureau chief and cnn contributor  matt visor here is the tweet of encouragement from the  not very objective washington bureau chief of the boston globe and  veryfakenewscnn political analyst matt viser while hitting the last note of the national anthem in detroit  singer rico lavelle took a knee as young black boys looked on pic twitter com   matt viser   mviser  september    which lavelle responded by calling himself an  example  be the example https   t co   rico lavelle     midwestrico  september    a side note  fbi released data yesterday showing detroit as the winner  again  as the nation s most violent big city at     detroit has the highest percentage of black residents perhaps the players and owners of nfl teams would be better served to try and find ways to save black youths from killing each other  rather than manufacturing racial issues or putting targets on the backs of our brave law enforcement officers  the stunning chart below from the brookings institute provides a pretty strong argument that racism and law enforcement is not what s harming the black community
