new york is critical for both donald trump and bernie sanders but only one of them seems poised for a big win  the other is predicted to suffer a serious setback in one of the few remaining states with a large delegate count as of sunday  the polling shows donald trump crushing ted cruz and john kasich with  percent of the vote while hillary clinton leads bernie sanders with   percent of the vote  if these numbers hold up  that will give clinton an additional  delegates over sanders  expanding her lead from  to  it s important to make note of this in advance because the last several races that clinton has won have been met with howls of  election fraud   aside from the sour grapes aspect  this constant drumbeat of alleged  cheating  is a shallow attempt to delegitimize clinton as a candidate  republicans have been doing it to president obama for years and it should be condemned as the shameful tactic it is regardless  there are a few obvious reasons that hillary is poised for an easy win  first  new york is a primary state  not a caucus state  while hillary has under preformed in caucuses  on average  she s seriously over preformed in primaries  in essence  the more people that vote  the better hillary does  a hard fact to swallow but a fact nonetheless second  new york is a closed primary  meaning only registered democrats can vote  this has been a source of outrage among independents who have demanded the  right  to vote for the democratic nominee  this  of course  begs the question of why people who chose not to join the party should have the  right  to dictate who that party selects as the nominee  if you think the answer is  democracy   allow me to point out that caucuses exclude people that cannot spend   hours on a weeknight voting for a candidate  in terms of participation  millions vote in primaries while only thousands vote in caucuses glass houses and all that third  and most importantly  new york is a demographically diverse state that closely resembles the racial makeup of the democratic party as a whole  in states where democratic voters are overwhelmingly white  sanders has a strong  advantage  everywhere else  not so much  here s an interesting data set for you to digest  in november  it s expected that about  percent of democratic voters will be white   percent will be black   percent will be latino and  percent will be asian everything else in the southern states where the majority of democratic voters are black  clinton crushed sanders  conversely  in states where the overwhelming majority of democratic voters are white  sanders crushed clinton  neither of these group of states is particularly representative of the democratic party so neither is a good predictor for more evenly mixed states but  when you look at the  states most closely aligned with the demographic makeup of the party  you find an abundance of good news for clinton  of the  states that have voted  hillary lost one by a hair  won two by a tiny margin  tied in another and utterly dominated the rest    of them by  points or more take a look even better for clinton  all of the remaining states with large delegate counts are part of those   new york  maryland  pennsylvania  new jersey and california represent   of the reaming   delegates  in order to close the significantly large delegate gap  bernie can t just win those states  he has to win them big  but they re all closed primaries except for california  and even then  of the  open primaries caucuses held so far  hillary s won  of them so california dreaming is not much comfort to the sanders campaign and just to top it all off  hillary is dominating the polls in all five states  anyway it s possible that one or two of those states will have a michigan style upset but considering how historically wrong the polling was going into that election  it seems more than a little more unlikely that we ll be seeing more of that  does this mean clinton voters should be complacent  hellllll no  the more she wins by  the stronger her position and the longer her coattails will be going into the general election  eyes on the prize everything else is just noise featured image via eric thayer getty images
