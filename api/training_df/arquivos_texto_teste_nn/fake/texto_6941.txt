in the last several months  joe scarborough   a one time republican politician and now host of msnbc s morning joe   has gone so deep into trumpmania and anti obama hysteria that it s hard to imagine his reputation ever recovering  on a recent morning joe broadcast  viewers got to watch as he torched the last bit of his integrity to take yet another cheap shot at president obama at the expense of both common sense and objective reality in the episode  scarborough poured over obama s recent interview with fox news and concluded that the president was giving investigators probing hillary clinton s email servers coded  hidden messages through the airwaves  tin foil hat firmly in place  scarborough accused obama of tampering with the investigation obama  said he wasn t going to talk to the attorney general about the pending investigation  but he just did   he lamented  talk about a rigged process  scarborough s frequent guest and occasional yes man bloomberg editor mark halperin agreed  it seemed ill advised to say   ok  i ve got no connection to this  but here s what i know about it and here s my conclusion     halperin said on msnbc  he should just say   i shouldn t talk about it     halperin added     there s a pending investigation and i should keep myself away from it in every way and leave this to the independence of the justice department   i don t know why he went on at such length defending her  because  in theory  he shouldn t really know the facts of the case  both men seem to have very little understanding of the investigation or the context in which obama stated his opinions  scarborough in particular seems to have gotten his information from right wing memes he read online  at one point  he claimed  over   agents were working on investigating clinton s wrongdoing   a figure based on a long debunked right wing lie started by a republican politician  for obvious reasons  equally bogus is the idea that obama could influence the investigation by stating his personal opinion in a fox news interview  given the fact that the president has repeatedly stood by his former secretary of state  the premise that fbi agents would be oblivious to which way obama leaned is laughable  he  like most of the country  finds the email  scandal  a waste of time  resources  and money  a lot of money   it s not exactly exposing nuclear launch codes if he tells reporters that clinton s emails were mostly harmless   that s public record not that scarborough would ever admit it  but even republican presidents tend to side with their political allies and employees  george w  bush  he might recall  was a fierce defender of vice president cheney s chief of staff  scooter  libby even after he was found guilty of lying about his boss s leak of an undercover cia operative  bush would later go as far as to commute libby s sentence just before he left office unlike the tangible damage  cheney s office did to national security  clinton s email controversy is vague to the point of meaninglessness  the public has had a hard time getting itself worked up over the scandal because as far as anybody can tell  nothing truly damaging happened  as both obama and clinton have acknowledged  using a private email was  careless  but it wasn t exactly harmful and thus scarborough once again has embarrassed himself with a wild haymaker that failed to land featured image via msnbc
