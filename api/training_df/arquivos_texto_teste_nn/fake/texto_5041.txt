it s beginning to get to the point where one can wonder if donald trump is deliberately self destructing on purpose  because maybe he really doesn t actually want to be president  just beloved by millions in a quest to prove his own self worth and popularity besides the fact that trump is saying horrific things daily  things so bad that his own party is turning on him  the people whom he sends out to represent him on varying media outlets are clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic take  for instance  katrina pierson  a woman who thinks president obama started the war in afghanistan  because clearly he has a time machine and could go back to  to get the ball rolling  not to mention the fact that there has been ongoing tension within afghanistan that we ve been dealing with for decades now  pierson has literally used the word  literally  to make a point about something that literally never happened while being interviewed on fox business  pierson said reporters  literally beat trump supporters   really  they literally did that  really  hmm   methinks she s a tad hyperbolic to try to make a point  and if anyone is inciting violence  it s trump and his supporters  literally watch her literal idiocy here trump campaign spokeswoman katrina pierson says reporters  literally beat trump supporters  pic twitter com   joe perticone   joeperticone  august    image via video screen capture
