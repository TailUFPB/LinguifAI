it s no secret republican women hate donald trump  the gop frontrunner has a net negative rating of  percent amongst republican women  and a net negative of  amongst all women   bottom line  women hate donald trump  and if republican women revolt against the sack of hot air  he loses in a landslide to hillary clinton well clinton may have gotten a boost from an unlikely source  former first lady laura bush speaking to the women in the world summit in new york  bush  who recently published a book on afghan women  told the crowd  i want our next president  whoever he or she might be  to be somebody who is interested in women in afghanistan and who will continue u s  policies and that we continue to do what we re committed to do as a country  that s who i want   or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history  and know what s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world  considering ted cruz wants to  carpet bomb  the middle east to see if sand can glow and donald trump wants to ban muslims fleeing oppression from entering the united states  it doesn t take a genius to see what kind of candidate bush is looking for and when it comes to the issue of refugees  more than half of which are women  she stated she wanted the next president to protect the rights of women in afghanistan  this eliminates both trump and cruz  so who s left the summit  focused on empowering women in a time of war  is a staple in clinton s campaign message   empowering all women  all across the world jenna bush  laura and george s daughter  was more candid  holding her  month old baby  she bluntly said i m worried about her future laura bush  who objected to her husband s  family values  oriented  campaign  has taken a more moderate approach to politics than her husband and his inner circle  featured image via jemal countess getty
