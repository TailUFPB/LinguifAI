you know the age old political trope that politicians spend a lot of time kissing babies  well  trump just turned that on his head when he dedicated a few minutes of a rally in virginia on tuesday to attacking a screaming infant in the audience   an actual screaming infant  not one of his followers  don t worry about that baby  i love babies   trump told the child s mother   i love babies  i hear that baby crying  i like it  i like it  what a beautiful baby  the mom s running around like  don t worry about it   it s young and beautiful and healthy and that s what we want  after prattling on about china  iraq  and afghanistan devaluing currency  trump couldn t resist going back to the baby situation  actually i was only kidding  you can get the baby out of here  that s all right  don t worry  i think she really believed me that i love having a baby crying while i m speaking  that s ok  people don t understand  that s ok  and the crowd cheered  though perhaps not as loudly when trump is siccing them on a black man who had the nerve to speak out in support of his rights or anyone else who has been beaten by his followers after trump issued his orders this wasn t the only child who gave trump problems at that rally  cbs  sopan deb noticed a boy no older than  screaming  take that bitch down   when the donald mentioned hillary clinton this phrase  along with a number of other profanity laden attacks on clinton  is regularly heard at trump rallies  but the child s mother had an interesting scapegoat for her terrible parenting  nbc s katy tur followed up on the  bitch  kid and spoke to the mother  who simply explained that  children are children  while it is true that kids will be kids  most don t scream  take that bitch down  at a gathering of white supremacists and other assorted creeps  cretins  and idiots  the woman told the guardian s ben jacobs that  democratic schools  are to blame for her child s behavior  adding that  he has a right to speak what he wants to   which is it  mom  are the democrats to blame for your brat s shitty behavior  or are you for giving him the freedom to speak as he wishes  would your reaction be the same if he yelled that about you it s worth noting that trump said nothing about this screaming child   but cnn s jason carroll pointed out perhaps the most horrible aspect of this mess  after mentioning that trump accepted a wounded veteran s purple heart  noting that he has  always wanted one  and that it was  much easier  than actually earning it by making sacrifices for his country  carroll told the story of the baby  the crowd laughed  they enjoyed it  was it a bit off color  yes  but this is what people like about this man  watch the cnn clip below  featured image via ny daily news
