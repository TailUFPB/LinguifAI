to the modern conservative  revolutionary   the men dubbing themselves the citizens for constitutional freedom   aka the morons who have laid siege to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere   may appear to be a well organized militia worthy of the name  to normal people  they are a group of radicalized right wing extremists who have taken up arms against their government in the commission of a felony on taxpayer owned land nothing could possibly prove this point more effectively than the statement made by ammon bundy himself that his movement would be there for years if necessary coupled with the desperate plea for snacks we heard monday after only  days in the woods that s not even close to the best part  the bundy militia allowed the guardian to photograph their  storeroom   which looks more like a pile of stuff ready to be tossed in the trunk for a weekend camping trip courtesy of the guardianremember that this stash is not just supposed to keep the   people there fed during the revolt  but also provided sustenance for anyone who shows up armed and ready to die for no good reason  the guardian did an actual inventory of the items in the room it included a cardboard box of apples and oranges  a few dozen pots of instant ramen   cans of chicken noodle soup  a similar number of cans of sweetcorn  peas  beans and chili  and  boxes of macaroni and cheese there were also three sacks of potatoes  one bag of flour  another of rolled oats  boxes of raisins  a single bag of pretzels and one granola bar not very impressive  fish and wildlife services  the agency that runs the wild bird reserve the militia is intent on giving to ranchers  miners and loggers  is planning on shutting down the power to the building  which will leave the criminal trespassers in the cold of the oregon forest they say they re prepared  but shutting the power down is just the first step  the fbi is reportedly working on its own plan to shut off any and all access to the outside world to flush out the armed insurrectionists hopefully  when the federal government does show up  the imbeciles will throw down their weapons and surrender  it s not like they have a lot of food to survive on featured image via the guardian
