trevor noah compared the excitement of the people of texas over the new open carry law to men celebrating their homosexuality at a gay pride parade  texans already could carry hand guns but had to conceal their weapons  now they could simply be open about it he said  you see  gun lovers in texas they just want to stop hiding who they really are  although it is a little odd how as soon as people got this right they immediately went out into the streets  they were just running like yah  ooh now i m gonna bring my gun everywhere  we re in the streets  let s go shopping and at the laundry mat and hey i m late at my shift at the coffee shop  he then went on to compare the excitement of gun owners over the new law to a gay pride parade  you know what  a little exuberance is fine but what made this weird for me is this is almost a little bit like when gay people first realized that society was starting to accept them for being openly gay and they immediately went out and started dancing on trucks dressed as giant penises  which on the one hand  is great  but after a certain point  we get it  you love giant penises  texas expanded its open carry laws to include handguns  military rifles and other long guns have been legally openly carried for years featured image via video screen capture
