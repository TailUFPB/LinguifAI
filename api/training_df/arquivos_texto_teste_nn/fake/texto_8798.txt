conservative christian lawmakers in virginia have gotten extremely pervy and filed a transphobic bill this week that would force schools to verify a child s genitals to ensure that they re using the restroom that agrees with their  correct anatomical sex  sponsored by republican del  mark cole  house bill   otherwise known as  use of restroom facilities  penalty   would prevent transgender students from using the bathroom that matches their gender  defining  anatomical sex  as the physical condition of being male or female  which is determined by a person s anatomy   the bill states  local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom  locker room  or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation  under the legislation  schools would be given the discretion and flexibility of letting students use a  single stall restroom  or  controlled  access to an empty restroom  the penalty for students who use the wrong restroom could be a fine of   since the bill s filing  many have raised questions about how exactly the republicans intend to verify a child s anatomically corresponding restroom  after the bill was proposed  civil rights advocate tim peacock criticized the bill  stating that  adults would be required to inspect children s genitals before they use the bathroom  for the law to be enforced  peacock warned that the bill violated children s privacy  and was completely inappropriate and unnecessary  this is what the conservative movement has devolved into  forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never before seen act of violence or sexual aggression  that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections   this is just the latest   and certainly not the last   assault on transgender people by the religious right  in the past  republican colorado lawmaker gordon klingenschmitt tried  many times  to prevent transgender people from having access to public restrooms  even republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee has disrespected the trans community and made a disgustingly insensitive joke by saying he wished he d been able to say he was transgender in high school so he would have been able to shower  with the girls  transgender people are becoming a target for the god fearing republican party more and more often  and protections must be put in place to control these outbursts of bigotry featured image via mark cole facebook page
