seldom in life do you come across someone so dumb that they literally make you cringe  but alas  sarah palin is one of those people  and if her general presence doesn t make you cringe then hearing her speak will  but if that still doesn t do it to you  just wait until you hear what she has to say in her latest bout of idiocy  she took to her favorite pastime of posting on facebook for her imbecilic following  what is it that she posted this time  well  palin posted an image of her new bff donald trump with a quote by none other than mahatma gandhi  yes  really  that gandhi this is the quote she used  first they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win           if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  amp version       span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    fjs  span  parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script     span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    facebook jssdk  span            gt posted by sarah palin on wednesday  february    quote has long been used by civil rights pioneers in their quest for justice and equality  for palin to equate the bombastic and racist trump to that of not only gandhi  but those who have long been fighting for justice  is not only inaccurate  but outright disgusting  trump is exactly opposite of everything gandhi stood for she s trying to say that no one took trump seriously and now that he s the likely gop nominee he may go on to win  however  what she doesn t get  is the fact that trump  as well as herself  are still jokes not to be taken seriously  their brand of politics is toxic not only to the gop  but to the nation and the world  her idiocy really knows no bounds  and by equating trump to gandhi she proves  yet again  how truly stupid she is featured image  flickr
