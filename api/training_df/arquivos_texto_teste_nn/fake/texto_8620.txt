ammon bundy and his band of gun toting domestic terrorists are living up to their vanilla isis nickname as you ll recall  the international community has condemned isis for destroying archaeological sites and artifacts during the organization s rampage through the middle east  they are literally destroying history and heritage well  that s kinda what bundy and his pals are doing now at the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon in addition to being a wildlife refuge  malheur is also a storage place for thousands of native american artifacts  many of which are associated with the local paiute tribe and instead of leaving the artifacts alone and undisturbed  the tantrum throwing white rednecks decided to search through the artifacts  thus putting them at risk of being damaged or stolen or destroyed entirely the militants even posted a video of themselves doing this  and they accused the bureau of land management of not storing the artifacts properly here s the video via facebook         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt share  breaking update burns oregon blm left native artifacts to rot in mice droppings posted by bundy ranch on wednesday  january    y all qaeda militants claim that the artifacts were left to rot in mouse droppings  but the video really doesn t offer much evidence of this  instead it appears to show artifacts wrapped in plastic and placed in boxes that are organized neatly on shelves in fact  the paiute tribe isn t as worried about the federal government handling the artifacts as they are about the militants handling them  we are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there   said burns paiute tribal chairperson charlotte roderique  the tribe has also demanded that any barbarian militant who even so much as disturbs an artifacts be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law  and they have the legal statutes on their side according to indian country today  the tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the u s  attorney and the u s  fish and wildlife service demanding prosecution of ammon bundy and other armed militants occupying the malheur wildlife refuge   if the occupiers disturb  damage  remove  alter  or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property there are approximately   artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding  the occupation is entering its third week the tribe is demanding federal action under both the archaeological resources protection act of  and a  protection against bad men  provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the united states in  under arpa  a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land  removing artifacts is a felony offense  first time offenders can be fined up to    and imprisoned for up to one year  second time offenders can be fined up to    and imprisoned for up to  years  it s not like the militants actually respect native american culture either  not too long ago  ryan bundy said that native americans have no claim to the land and that current culture  a k a  white culture  is more important  we also recognize that the native americans had the claim to the land  but they lost that claim  there are things to learn from cultures of the past  but the current culture is the most important  in short  bundy and his boys are acting like isis  they have no respect for native americans or the artifacts of their culture  by all rights  they should prepare to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt  which they would have to pay from behind bars if the justice department actually did their damn job by arresting and charging these assholes as the criminals they are featured image  facebook
