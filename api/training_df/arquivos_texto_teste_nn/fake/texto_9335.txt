al franken returned to dc this week after a series of bombshell allegations of sexual harassment by several women  he claims to be  tremendously  sorry for his serial groping incidents but can t seem to recall them yes  you ll love this clintonesque tactic where you just claim you have no idea how this happened daily caller reported the minnesota democrat has faced more and more outcry  even from within his own party  as the allegations continue to stack   in total  four women have now accused franken of inappropriately touching or groping them without consent   many in progressive circles are now calling for franken s resignation  to date  franken s office has said he will not resign and instead has issued controversial apologies to the women  the apologies issued by franken range in length and content  however there is one very disturbing trend that each of them has in common when you read the four apologies below  what is the common thread   franken is unaware that he is sexually assaulting women  franken regularly states in his apologies that he is unaware that his groping was offensive and often does not remember if it even happened    i take thousands of photos at the state fair surrounded by hundreds of people  and i certainly don t remember taking this picture  i feel badly that ms  menz came away from our interaction feeling disrespected     it s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers  and i don t remember those campaign events     i take a lot of pictures in minnesota  thousands of pictures  tens of thousands of people  those are instances that i do not remember  it has   from the stories it has been clear that there are some women and one is too many who feel that i have done something disrespectful at that assert them and for that i am tremendously sorry
