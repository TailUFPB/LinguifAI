donald trump will be seriously seething after he sees what gop strategist liz mair called him on cnn as we all know  the republican nominee is incapable of keeping his big mouth shut  he always has to whine about something or someone and it hasn t been helping him gain a whole lot of support for awhile now  republicans and the media were being pushed around by trump  but that has now changed as he has had a complete meltdown in recent days in addition to all the things he has said and done since last june when he began campaigning for the nomination republican strategist liz mair is definitely not a fan of trump and she is sickened by the fact that republican leadership didn t have the balls to intervene and stop trump s rise when they had a chance to say something that could have made a difference  now the entire party is in jeopardy of imploding indeed  trump s message is the poison that is delivering the final death blow to a once proud party and mair was only too happy to admit it during an interview with anderson cooper on cnn on wednesday night  his message is being a loudmouthed d ck  basically  and going out there and offending people and then engaging in an airing of grievances  that s what he does  he doesn t have another message  he doesn t have anything else that he wants to convey  the republican party has a message but it s not his message and he has no interest in carrying it  and quite frankly  what i think we re gonna continue to see throughout this campaign is  we re gonna continue to see the republican nominee basically acting as if he s on a suicide mission and aiming to take the whole rest of the party down with him  here s the video via youtube mair is absolutely spot on  the only critique here is that the republican party s message has been moving in trump s extremist  bigoted direction for a long time now  trump is merely taking it to it s final form and all of a sudden republicans are acting horrified about it  but not so horrified that they aren t still willing to support him  and that s really the key here  republicans can condemn his comments all they want  it doesn t mean a damn thing if they still support him as their nominee  republicans created the hateful atmosphere that allowed trump to rise in the first place  their only redemption is to make sure he loses in november and just admit they were wrong and that they are going to seriously change their party this time around  and that means they have to stop pandering to the conservative base that desperately wants trump to win and start transforming into a more inclusive party featured image  gustavo caballero getty
