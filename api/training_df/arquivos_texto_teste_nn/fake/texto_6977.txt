given the fact that donald trump has often bragged that he intentionally used his numerous bankruptcies as a way to exploit the government  and taxpayers  into paying his debts  it s not exactly surprising to learn that the billionaire business mogul has a spotty track record with philanthropy  but the scope of his greed  revealed in a new deep dive analysis by the washington post  is shocking trump loves to brag that he has given over   million to charity in the past five years  but like nearly everything the republican frontrunner says  the truth is much different  trump published a list of    contributions  he s made  which seems impressive until you actually start to look at what the donations are as the washington post discovered  many of the gifts that trump cited to prove his generosity were free rounds of golf  given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles trump s campaign also counted a parcel of land that he d given to new york state   although that was in   not within the past five years the donald j  trump foundation  trump s biggest charity  was especially notable for its lack of well trump  between  and   trump didn t donate a single penny of his own money to the foundation  instead he leaned on rich friends to give their money and he then sent out the checks to the charities under his name  what a guy and while some of that money undeniable went to good causes  trump also used a lot of his  donations  to shore up his political and business interests  the washington post again his foundation  for example  frequently gave money to groups that paid to use trump s facilities  and it donated to conservatives who could help promote trump s rise in the republican party  the foundation s second biggest donation described on the campaign s list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of trump s golf courses after being denied a hole in one prize trump s campaign had a truly stunning response when asked to explain why trump s charitable giving was so weak  they didn t want to make trump an easy mark for other charities  we want to keep them quiet   said weisselberg  who is also treasurer of the trump foundation   he doesn t want other charities to see it  then it becomes like a feeding frenzy  amazing  absolutely amazing and while trump certainly isn t the only rich person to horde his money for himself  his friends  and his business interests  it s worth noting that other billionaires have rejected this egregious level of greed and actually given vast amounts of their wealth to real  world changing causes  bill gates  for example  has given   billion already and he says he s not done  it wasn t given to give friends free tickets to a game of golf  either  gates and his wife have spent years fighting to eradicate the scourge of polio off the face of the earth  something he calls  a gift for the rest of time  likewise  warren buffett set a charity record in june    around the time trump was teasing his presidential run   by donating    billion in one lump sum donald trump has gotten pretty far in the election by impressing his supporters with his wealth  many cite his business skills  debatable as they are  as the primary reason they will vote for him  however  is it not just as important to see what he does with the money once he has it  unlike other people fortunate enough to have billions  it s clear he believes giving away his money to fight disease  poverty  or other social causes is a waste  he s repeatedly taken advantage of his wealth to influence people and get ahead somebody might want to pull him aside and let him know that money isn t something you can take with you when you die  he may even thank you for the advice with a free golf pass featured image via mike ehrmann getty images
