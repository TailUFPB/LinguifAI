the north carolina  bathroom law  is heading to federal court because the state s governor is suing the government for the right to discriminate against the transgender community on monday  governor pat  bigot  mccrory filed a lawsuit against the department of justice  doj  and has asked the court to rule that  is not discriminatory  the governors complaint cites letters sent from the department of justice last week threatening to sue the state for violating the civil rights act  mccrory s complaint is seeking  declaratory and injunctive relief against the united states of america  the doj and attorney general loretta lynch because of  their radical reinterpretation of title vii of the civil rights of  which would prevent plaintiffs from protecting the bodily privacy rights of state employees while accommodating the needs of transgendered state employees  apparently   protecting the bodily privacy rights  of their employees can only be done if they deny those same rights from the transgender community  i m not sure if mccrory has any idea what a woman s restroom looks like  but it s not a bunch of open stalls where we are all holding hands and peeing  each person has an individual and private stall to do their business   our  bodily privacy  is already protected the complaint goes on to claim that the by protecting all of its citizens from discriminatory laws like the one in north carolina is  baseless and blatant overreach   this is an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of congress and disregards of statutory interpretation by the courts  mccrory is claiming that the civil rights act doesn t protect the transgender community  but it absolutely does  it says that he is not allowed to discriminate  against employees on the basis of sex  race  color  national origin  and religion   sexual identity falls into the category of  sex  therefore  mccory is not legally allowed to pass a law that discriminates against his employees based on their sex  it s not a  radical interpretation  unless he considers using common sense  radical   but then again we are talking about a republican so  what this all boils down to is bigotry and hate  republicans fight tooth and nail against protecting any class of people who are not white  straight  christian males  the transgender community is just their latest target  unfortunately for them  it is  and president obama s doj doesn t not put up with that kind of bullshit featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
