a few weeks ago  rachel maddow did a comparison of donald trump and notorious racist george wallace on her show  one of the points she made about the  candidate and the  candidate is how violent they both are  like george wallace  trump is able to get his crowds riled up into such a frenzy that they start attacking protesters  at the beginning of his campaign  the donald would do it by screeching  get him outta here   but during a recent event  he actually said he d like to punch a protester in the face during a campaign event in nevada on monday night  trump flipped out after he was interrupted by some hecklers and said  you know what i hate  there s a guy  totally disruptive  throwing punches   we re not allowed to punch back anymore  in the old days  you know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this  they d be carried out on a stretcher  folks  yeah  that imbecile thinks that protesting at one of his events warrants being  carried out on a stretcher   but he wasn t finished  when one of the protesters was removed by security  the man was smiling and this really pissed trump off  he said  i d like to punch him in the face  i ll tell you that  there s a guy throwing punches  nasty as hell  screaming and everything else when we re talking  and we re talking out   we re not allowed  the guards are very gentle with him  he s walking  like  big high fives  smiling  laughing   i d like to punch him in the face  according to politico security admitted that nobody was  throwing punches   instead  it looks like trump made that up to justify his violent words  this is  of course  not surprising coming from a man who once applauded his supporters for kicking and punching a black lives matter protester  it is  however  frightening that this man is in first place in the gop polls  a man who stands on a stage and incites violence  a man who that is how a president should behave  this is what the republican party is offering up to the country  a schoolyard bully  seriously  and they wonder why their party is slowly dying watch featured image via video screenshot
