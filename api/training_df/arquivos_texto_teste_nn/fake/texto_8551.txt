in an amazing open letter  a former us marine slammed america s village idiot for having the gall to blame president obama and ptsd for her son s domestic violence arrest on the same day she incoherently endorsed donald trump as the republican nominee  it was reported that track palin had been arrested on weapons and domestic violence charges rather than acknowledge that her son broke the law and is responsible for his own actions  palin chose to blame president obama and ptsd instead  even though track palin never saw combat during his one year in iraq  it s a shame that our military personnel even have to question  have to wonder if they re respected anymore   palin said  it starts from the top  the question  though  it comes from the top  the question  though  that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder   do you know what we go through  do you know what we re trying to do to secure america and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us  my son  like so many others  they come back a bit different  they come back hardened  they come back wondering if there s that respect for what it is their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have so sacrificially given to this country so when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back  i can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of ptsd and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with  and it makes me realize more than ever  it is now or never for the sake of america s finest that we ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them  needless to say  palin instantly pissed off veterans across the country  including former us marine chris mark  who also happens to be a republican in an open letter posted on his blog  mark ripped palin to shreds for using ptsd as a political attack and for using it to excuse her son s behavior  i am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and  once again  attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent  violent behavior   mark said after reminding palin that her entire family was involved in a drunken brawl that should have served as sign that track has a problem  he went after palin for stigmatizing ptsd even more than it already is by th media calling her statements  foolish and ignorant   mark wrote that he would prefer palin  avoid public life and simply fade away   but since she refuses to go away  mark suggested she educate herself and then use her status as a public figure to help veterans here s the full letter via global security  privacy    risk management blog dear mrs  palin i am a former us marine and us navy officer with a combat action ribbon as well as service connected disabilities  i am also a republican  i have also served with  and am friends with  dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include ptsd  i recently read your comments related to ptsd in which you attempted to excuse your son s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed ptsd  based upon your previous comments i am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and  once again  attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent  violent behavior in  your entire family was involved in a late night  drunken brawl  at a party in which track palin  the accused domestic abuser  was involved in a bloody fight  while you publicly stated how proud you were at your children s violent actions  maybe this should have been a sign that track has a problem  it is certainly curious that you did not feel the need to reference his supposed ptsd in this situation and instead stated   my kids  defense of family makes my heart soar   maybe  instead of encouraging track s violence  you should have taken the opportunity to get him help  maybe  instead of being the result of ptsd  your son was simply trying to uphold the stated palin family values and  make your heart soar  by abusing a woman ptsd is stigmatized in the media and not well understood by the general public  an estimated  veterans commit suicide every day in the united states  this is nearly   veterans who take their lives every year  senator richard blumenthal  d ct  stated   every day in the united states   veterans succumb to suicide   losing their personal battle to invisible wounds of war   veterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements while i do not propose to speak for all veterans  i am clearly not alone in my views regarding your unfortunate statements  they were unfortunate for the many veterans who face further disdain and discrimination based upon your inaccurate and ignorant portrayal of those who suffer with ptsd as well as the causes of the condition while i would personally prefer that you simply avoid public life and simply fade away  if you insist on trying to use your  celebrity status  for a cause  please educate yourself on the facts of ptsd and try to help veterans by using your significant influence in a more productive  and less political manner  there are a number of veteran s organizations to which you can donate time  money and energy to make a difference regards chris markand there you have it  sarah palin made an ass of herself in public again and this marine called out her stupidity  much like another veteran did during a rally in  after ted cruz managed to persuade his fellow conservatives to shut the government down  palin attempted to use veterans to criticize president obama for not bowing down to republican demands when one veteran reminded everyone that she s an idiot but palin really stepped in it this time around and now she has to answer to veterans across the country who actually deal with ptsd every day  she owes all of them a huge apology featured image  fox news
