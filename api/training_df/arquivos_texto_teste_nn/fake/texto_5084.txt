donald trump told the crowd at a florida rally just how bad hillary clinton s mental stamina is  but at the same time  he couldn t even manage to figure out what day of the week it was  now  hillary clinton  commonly referred to as  crooked hillary   hillary clinton gave a speech today having to do with economic development  having to do with a lot of different things  short speech  always very short  you know  she makes the speech  she turns off the teleprompter  look  what happens  she gives a short speech then she goes home  goes to sleep  she shows up two days later  remember  short circuit  remember that  right  short circuit last week  clinton said that she  may have short circuited her answer to a question about the investigation into her private email server during a television interview  trump latched onto the comment vehemently as proof that she isn t mentally fit to be president while attacking her physical health as well trump also told the crowd  i watched hillary today  which was really boring  it s hard to watch  i have an obligation to watch  fortunately  she never goes on very long because she wants to go home  trump was insistent that clinton isn t mentally competent  but twice during the rally he totally screwed up what day of the week it was  even after he was corrected  as reported by the guardian  by the way  is there any place to be that s better than a friday night in florida at a trump rally  no place  a few supporters shouted   it s thursday  later he said   we joke  it s friday night and we re having fun   more supporters yelled   it s thursday   but he appeared to assume it was more cheering although probably not an accident  trump also had a hard time with his comprehension of just how many people had actually come out to hear him speak  this place is incredible  we ve got   people outside trying to get in   trump said  however  according to the guardian   there were still hundreds of empty places in the   seat arena  featured image via joe raedle getty images
