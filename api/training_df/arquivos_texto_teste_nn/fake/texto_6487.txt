reality tv star and presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump  has convinced thousands of people that he s an expert on business  finance  and commerce  there isn t much evidence of those claims  and as he consolidates his power at the head of the republican party  his words reveal a dangerous lack of knowledge about global economics in an interview with cnbc  on the phone  of course  trump proposed a radical idea  he told the interviewer that he would reduce the national debt by having the united states fail to pay back on the money it owes  i would borrow  knowing that if the economy crashed  you could make a deal   he told cnbc   and if the economy was good  it was good  so  therefore  you can t lose  trump doesn t seem to understand that the united states economy isn t one of his many  many casinos and other ventures that he sent into bankruptcy at the expense of his investors  and rarely himself   to set him straight  gene sperling  who was an economic adviser to presidents clinton and obama  released a statement lacerating trump s insane proposal  for donald trump to casually announce he would consider defaulting on our debt for the first time in our history shows a stunning lack of responsibility and understanding of the global economy   he said sperling also pointed out that trump s plan  would risk a global financial meltdown  drive up interest rates for americans for decades  and seriously harm middle class families  in case anyone might think that this is simply a case of a democrat hitting trump  republicans and business experts also think his idea is bonkers tony fratto  a spokesman for the u s  treasury department under former president george w  bush and a vocal member of the  never trump  movement  called the comments  dumb as a bucket of rocks   fortune editor alan s  murray called them  scary  in trump s first week as the republican standard bearer  he s revealing just how ill prepared he is to govern  more than even your average modern republican featured image via flickr
