if there s one thing donald trump knows how to do really well  even better than most  it s sell things  and in this case  that  thing  isn t real estate or a television show or a book  but rather just himself  with the phrase  make america great again   with no further explanation besides loving guns  hating mexicans  and lowering taxes  he s gotten a rather large following to support him being the salesman that he is  he doesn t care who supports him as long as they do  he uses simplistic phrases on purpose  because he knows that most of his supporters likely don t have above a third grade reading level  he plays to the stupid vote  but calls them smart and the  most intelligent  because  after all  they are voting for him however  at a recent campaign event in claremont  new hampshire  trump seemed to let it slip that he knows his supporters are an army of loyal idiots  after reciting poll after poll after poll  which seems to be all these events are  self congratulatory events for himself  he told the crowd that no one is ever leaving him  no matter what he says  or how awful he behaves  he knows he has the support of this moronic base he said  did you see  one of the things that came out in the one poll  nobody s ever leaving me  i could be the worst person in the world  they re not leaving  continuing  he said  if i was up here and did some really inappropriate things  my people stay  i love you people  i love you  i love you  i love you  i love my people  they re the most loyal  and if that wasn t bad enough  he then comes out and says it  i m winning with the smart people  i m winning with the not so smart people  too  i m winning with everything  with all of this he got cheers and shouts of  i love you   and  we love you   from the crowd of unsuspecting nincompoops trump knows exactly what he s doing  which is actually what makes his run for the oval office so terrifying  he plays to the simplistic and imbecilic minded in the nation  and they lap it up with a spoon  trump doesn t care that his voters are dumb  i mean  hell  george w  bush won in  after   and starting a war based on lies  there is definitely a base of voters in this nation who shouldn t be allowed to operate heavy machinery  including a voting machine  video featured image  youtube
