bill   something that the louisiana state legislature has been working on  deals with strip clubs and will maintain the state s current laws that regulate those clubs  it does  however  add a new regulation  all dancers must be at least  years of age if the club serves alcohol  makes sense one lawmaker  however  saw that and just had to stick his own amendment in there that would also regulate the dancers  weight  according to rep  kenny havard  r   dancers between  and  should also weigh no more than  pounds right  because regulating women s weight is totally okay in a world where women are judged more on their appearance than on anything else  it s also totally okay coming from a guy who claims he s making a point about government overreach  sure havard claims he did this as a joke  much like the proposals in other states that would regulate how men get things like viagra in protest of laws restricting access to birth control for women  after all  regulating any business  even strip clubs  is massive government overreach with the tiny government crowd  dear kenny here made a very bad joke he also failed miserably to make his point   the bill itself passed    meaning it had broad  bipartisan support  and that havard himself voted for it after pulling his own little  protest  amendment out of the bill  if he could vote for it without that amendment that was supposed to make a point  then he must actually not see it as government overreach the whole purpose of havard s amendment is this  havard  who immediately pulled the amendment   he doesn t regret the  joke  and called it satire   not sexism  he said he meant for the amendment to point out that the bill teeters on overregulation  supporters of the bill say that they are trying to protect teens from human trafficking  it has won bipartisan support through the legislative process  okay  so it s sexist satire and a sexist joke  it doesn t matter what havard claims  he clearly doesn t understand sexism at all  there is nothing non sexist about suggesting that we should regulate women s weight  even as a joke  fortunately  or unfortunately for him  he brought the wrath of all his colleagues down onto himself  which is what caused him to pull the amendment  can t have everyone mad at you for being a raving  sexist hypocrite after all exotic dancers actually further the sexual objectification of women  and for a man to say that these dancers  especially if they re young  should be svelte and slender under law sounds more like he wants to enshrine in law that the only women who fit his ideal of sexy and beautiful are the ones who get to be exotic dancers  a joke  a piece of satire  can still be horribly sexist  that s what havard is and has done  he s outed himself as a sexist pig image by jeffrey schwartz  licensed under cc by   via commons
