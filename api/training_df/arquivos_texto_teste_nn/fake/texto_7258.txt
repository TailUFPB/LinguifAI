california democrats are taking a page from oregon s book and appear set to raise the minimum wage to   an hour despite gloom and doom predictions from republicans lawmakers are prepared to vote for a gradual increase of wages that would not only give workers   an hour by   it would also tie future wage raises to inflation  which has been a longtime goal of progressives such as democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders according to the los angeles times  the negotiated deal would boost california s statewide minimum wage from   an hour to    on jan      with a  cent increase in  and then   per year increases through   businesses with fewer than  employees would have an extra year to comply  delaying their workers receiving a   hourly wage until   governor jerry brown and his democratic allies compromised with labor unions on the raise after unions successfully got wage initiatives on the november ballot that would have increase the wage from   an hour to   an hour immediately rather than over a period of time the new deal would give businesses and the government time to prepare for wage increases instead of having to deal with them all at once but the bottom line is that california is about to join oregon as the second blue state to step up to lead the nation on the minimum wage and treating workers well oregon governor kate brown signed her state s minimum wage bill into law earlier this month  drawing praise from labor unions and president obama  who called the effort one that  will boost the paychecks of hardworking americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet  and urged congress to do the same but republicans refuse to do anything that will help american workers at a time when wealthy ceos are raking in profits at record numbers while their hardworking employees struggle to survive on a daily basis  many republican controlled state legislatures have even passed laws banning cities and counties from raising the local minimum wage on their own  which makes it incredibly clear that republicans don t care about the the strife of workers and their families while democrats are consistently proving that they are committed to helping americans do more than just get by  featured image via wikimedia
