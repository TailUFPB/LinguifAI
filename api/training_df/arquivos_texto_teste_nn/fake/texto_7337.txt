it s hard to believe that business mogul donald trump is not only in the presidential race  but actually leading the republican candidates  apparently he never saw the white house in his future  either  but clearly something has changed within the last few decades that inspired him to go for it it just so happens that trump originally had zero desire to run for president of the united states  thanks to footage from an hour long interview with rona barrett in   it s been revealed that trump didn t want to run because he thought it would be  a mean life   ironic  yes   but the real kicker comes after that  when trump says  i also see it that somebody with strong views  and somebody with the kind of views that are maybe a little bit unpopular   which may be right but may be unpopular   wouldn t necessarily have a chance of getting elected against somebody with no great brain but a big smile  this clip was never aired  and it s certainly worth watching now for the ridiculous irony of it all my  how things have changed over the last  years  if only trump had stayed in this frame of mind throughout his life for someone who didn t want to live  a mean life   trump has certainly fulfilled that prophecy   and he hasn t even been elected  trump has continued to spit out the most vile  racist  offensive rhetoric a presidential campaign has ever seen  and single handedly continues to divide america even more  he has attacked immigrants  muslims  women   basically any minority   and encouraged a terrifying brand of hate to wash over america as his supporters become increasingly violent and angry trump has even divided the republican party  and his vulgar tactics continue to threaten its destruction  he s proven that he will go after anyone who threatens his ego  whether it s the president  fellow candidate  a politician  news anchor  etc  he s a bully  a racist  a misogynist and a liar who cannot be trusted with the future of america  he s probably become much of what his younger self didn t want to be  because without a doubt he is the candidate with  no great brain but a big smile  featured image is a screenshot
