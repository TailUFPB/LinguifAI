a republican lawmaker in new hampshire showed up to one of hillary clinton s town hall events in the state on sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle mrs  clinton  bad idea  not only did it not work out as planned  but the former secretary of state called out the state representative in front of everyone  you are very rude  and i m not ever going to call on you  thank you  the comment earned mrs  clinton an enormous round of applause  as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person  it s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well  perhaps there s a better way to get your message across so  what exactly was katherine prudhomme o brien  the gop state representative from rockingham  trying to say  she followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that hillary didn t want to talk about bill clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago  really  that s what was so important  i asked her how in the world she can say that juanita broderick and kathleen wiley are lying when she has no idea who juanita broderick is  she told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is  how can she access that they are lying  which she told someone last month  expect for more below the belt tactics like these now that bill clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on monday  republicans are looking for any and every chance to use bill s past indiscretions against hillary  it s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics  yet somehow they still get the most attention with that said  bernie sanders  unlike republicans  doesn t intend on bringing up bill clinton s sexual past anytime soon  no  i think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than bill clinton s sex life  featured image via screen capture
