a california man who by his own account spent much of  binge watching fox news and getting progressively more angry about muslims says that the only reason he repeatedly threatened to kill muslims was because he had a toxic mix of alcohol abuse and fox abuse problems in   after months of watching fox news air thinly veiled hate speech regarding muslims  and the council on american islamic relations activist group in particular  california resident john david weissinger began leaving voicemail messages for the employees of cair in which he threatened to shoot them  even more disturbing  weissinger had already been known to linger around the front of the cair office apparently  weissinger could have made good on his threats as well  after police went to arrest him for his threats  they found he possessed an illegal assault rifle   in at least one of his voicemails  weissinger insisted that he had enough guns and ammo to come and  kill all of you   he wasn t kidding  in many ways  weissinger s story bears a striking resemblance to that of the right wing terrorist who went on a mass shooting at a colorado springs planned parenthood that same year  like weissinger  the man charged with the crime gave verbatim right wing talking points as justification for his murder spree  also like weissinger  he had plenty of guns and ammo to make his threats turn into a massacre weissinger pled guilty to hate crime allegations  making a criminal threat  and possession of a illegal assault rifle  at his sentencing hearing  his lawyer tried to diminish his culpibility by suggesting fox news had whipped him up into a hate fueled fury and alcohol had lowered his judgment  he barks when he s drunk   malowney told a judge during the tuesday sentencing hearing  as quoted by kfmb   he was reeling from depression and anxiety  between fox news  donald trump  and other conservative politicians  the most fanatical right wing extremists have plenty of material to stoke their paranoid racial and social anxieties  in at least one analysis  fox news was found to lie to its audience on a consistent basis  over  percent of statements made by fox news pundits were found to be blatantly false  and many of those lies center around stereotypes of groups conservatives hate  fox has always been a network built by and for conservatives  but increasingly  it has become a gross manufacturer of smears against minorities meant to confirm pre conceived biases of its old  white audience the results of all this hate mongering is as disturbing as it is clear  instances of hate crimes  particularly against muslims  have skyrocketed  mosques and other muslim owned buildings are being vandalized  many are being burned to the ground in a national outbreak of arson cases and if there is any question as to who is stoking these acts  just listen to the right wing terrorists themselves  they ll tell you  weissinger has told you   fox news made me do it  feature image via fox news screengrab
