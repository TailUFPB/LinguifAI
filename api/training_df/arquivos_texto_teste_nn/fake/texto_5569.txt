donald trump s antics at a campaign rally on wednesday night were completely and totally unhinged  even adjusting for the strange standards of donald trump  despite media claims that trump was making a  pivot  towards more seriousness and substance  and the belief that new communications hires would keep trump more on message  he was a wild man once again seemingly out of nowhere  trump began a riff on how much he hates mosquitoes trump doesn t like mosquitoes  in cincinnati  oh at the sharonville convention center  pic twitter com   marcus dipaola   marcusdipaola  july    a weird voice  trump said   i don t want mosquitoes around me   he then slapped at a mosquito on his podium and screamed   i don t like mosquitoes  i don t like those mosquitoes  i never did  speaking of mosquitoes  oh hello hillary how are you doing   he concluded  before moving on to another topic republicans have noted that instead of squeezing some mileage out of the critical fbi press conference on hillary clinton s emails  trump has stumbled from one controversy to the next  first his campaign tweeted anti semitic imagery about clinton that they deleted  then he praised saddam hussein at a campaign rally  and has now appointed himself the bug hunter in chief trump s problem appears to be that he is relying on the headline grabbing antics of his campaign that worked so well for him against the republican field  but in the general election  against a candidate in hillary clinton who doesn t have to pander to racists  the bombastic trump style is appearing more and more like a dud and trump s antics easily ally him with an existing frame for his campaign that has been exploited by democrats  both clinton and president obama have invoked the need for a steady hand over the launch codes for america s nuclear launch codes  and contrasted that need to trump s public rhetoric the candidate clearly believes he can  wing it  on the way to the white house  but general election audiences are not nearly as enraptured with trump s antics as republicans were featured image via twitter
