florida mom and hardcore gun nut jamie gilt is back in the news again after police recommended that she be charged in the incident that left her with a gunshot wound in her back you probably all remember this idiot but if you don t  she is the pro second amendment nutter who ran a facebook page  jamie gilt for gun sense    it s been deleted  where she bragged about letting her  year old son handle a firearm  all of her  responsible  gun owning ways came to a head earlier this month when she left her freedom extension within reach of her small son and he picked it up  shooting while she was driving on tuesday  putnam county sheriff s capt  gator deloach announced that the department is recommending she be charged for her stupidity  but their recommendation will surely piss you off   according to cbs news police say they are recommending a charge of allowing a child access to a firearm gilt could face up to  days in jail  reports cbs affiliate wjax  the state attorney s office will ultimately make a decision on if charges will be filed that s right  the police think that she should only be charged with a misdemeanor even though her actions put her son in mortal danger  cbs news also reported that the florida department of children and families have opened a case  but it looks as though she still has custody of her son  this is unbelievably outrageous at the very least gilt should have been charged with felony child neglect  according to florida law  felony child neglect is defined as a caregiver s failure or omission to provide a child with the care  supervision  and services necessary to maintain the child s physical and mental health  including  but not limited to  food  nutrition  clothing  shelter  supervision  medicine  and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well being of the child this woman left a deadly weapon within reach of her four year old son  not only was it within reach  but he handled the weapon and shot her  he could have very easily shot himself and died  thankfully  though  her dumb ass was the only person injured  now  if that isn t a  failure to provide supervision  i have no idea what is this woman should never be allowed to own a gun again and she should not be allowed custody of her child until she takes some very intensive parenting classes  her refusal to practice proper gun safety almost killed that little boy  and if she walks away from this with nothing but a misdemeanor charge we will have witnessed another great injustice in the state of florida featured image via cbs
