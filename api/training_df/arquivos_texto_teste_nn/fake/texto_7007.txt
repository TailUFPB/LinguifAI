ever since the  election  republicans have been instituting law after law to keep people from voting  they did this because they knew the right wing of the supreme court would support them and they ve been very successful in keeping millions of people away from the ballot  but without the  conservative on the court to tip the ruling  those days are at an end civil rights groups  like a shark smelling blood in the water  are moving in for the kill on thursday  the american civil liberties union argued before the  circuit court of appeals that people who face significant hardships should be able to vote without an id  as in new hampshire  idaho  texas  and several other states  such voters would be able to sign a legally binding affadavit to prove their identity  sean young  the lead attorney on the case  previously argued that wisconsin s voter id law should be struck down entirely  some federal courts agreed  comparing the law a poll tax  but the u s  supreme court allowed the law to stand  now  the aclu is arguing that individual categories of people should be allowed to challenge the law and demand accommodations that enable them to vote this is a page right out of the gop s playbook  carve out an exception here  undermine a ruling there and the next thing you know  it s time to strike voter id from the law books and  oh look  the democrats will most likely control both the white house and the senate next year leaving republicans with no way to enforce their screamingly obvious voter suppression tactics  truly  a sad day for conservative america it s going to take several years to clean up the deliberate mess republicans have made of our elections but it s inevitable at this point  this won t stop republicans from coming up with new and more creative means to suppress the vote of those people but it does mean that it will be increasingly more difficult to get away with it featured image via gage skidmore
