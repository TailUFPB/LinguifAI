thanks to a conservative group that tried to ruin an organized dance for lgbtq teens  thousands of dollars were raised so those very teens could have the night of their lives the australian same sex gender diverse formal is an annual gala hosted by minus  for lgbtq teenagers  giving them a place to feel safe and at home without the ridicule that might happen at most school dances  minus  wrote on the event page  imagine being told by your school that the clothes you feel comfortable wearing to a formal aren t considered  normal  or don t conform to a dress code  imagine not being allowed to take a partner of the same sex  or being too afraid to attend altogether  it isn t unusual for lgbtq teens to be bullied or banned when they try to bring a same sex date or wear attire that doesn t satisfy strict gender norms  the formal is a place where teens can be themselves and feel comfortable wearing whatever with whomever  without worrying that others will take issue with it  knowing just how important lgbtq events are  minus  was also crowdfunding for any students who couldn t afford their   tickets to the dance unfortunately  some people just can t let others be  the stop safe schools coalition  a conservative group of bigots that go out of their way to ruin schools and groups that foster safe and inclusive environments for same sex attracted  intersex  and gender diverse students  staff and families   decided to try and ruin the gala using their   facebook fans  the right wing group begged people to buy up as many tickets as possible so that lgbtq teens wouldn t be able to  the group posted  the more tickets sold to us the more youth we protect  they are non refundable unfortunately so if you are then unable to attend you can t get your money back or a ticket sold to someone else  little did they know  that while these homophobes thought they were robbing tickets from lgbtq teens  they were actually buying them for the teens  what the stop safe schools coalition had actually done was share minus  s crowdfunding campaign   which allowed conservatives to unknowingly making donations to send needy lgbtq students to the dance  as one person hilariously pointed out on the facebook page  you realize that if the conservatives do buy all the tickets  you can just allow registered people on a waiting list in for free  they re effectively subsidizing tickets for those who can t buy one  this is one time where the stupidity of conservatives actually paid off  thanks to their ignorance  minus  doubled their crowdfunding goal of    for  tickets  now  thanks to the hate group     has been raised and minus  is using the extra money to find a bigger venue so even more teens can come to see how amazing and important the same sex gender diverse formal is for lgbtq teens  you can watch footage from last year s event below featured image from minus
