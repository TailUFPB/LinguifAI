wendy bradshaw became a teacher because she wanted to help children learn and prepare them to succeed in life  sadly  however  bradshaw s master degree  with a focus on childhood behavioral disorders  could not have prepared her for the reality of today s classrooms after being forced to make her students cry every day in class  bradshaw resigned from polk county schools last october her resignation letter goes straight to the heart of the problem with america s schools she writes the children don t only cry  some misbehave so that they will be the  bad kid  not the  stupid kid   or because their little bodies just can t sit quietly anymore  or because they don t know the social rules of school and there is no time to teach them the teacher s background in childhood behavior disorders helped her understand that these weren t  problem children   they were just normal children trapped inside a problematic system  while they may not have arrived at school with behavioral disorders  they were likely to leave with them bradshaw s letter goes on to explain i can say with confidence that it is not the children who are disordered  the disorder is in the system which requires them to attempt curriculum and demonstrate behaviors far beyond what is appropriate for their age this is what happens when lawmakers  not teachers and parents  get together to decide what s best for children whom they will never spend a single day with it s also what happens when the power to educate is taken out of the hands of educators bradshaw writes the disorder is in the system which bars teachers from differentiating instruction meaningfully  which threatens disciplinary action if they decide their students need a five minute break from a difficult concept  or to extend a lesson which is exceptionally engaging she adds that the disorder is in a system which has decided that students and teachers must be regimented to the minute and punished if they deviate  the disorder is in the system which values the scores on wildly inappropriate assessments more than teaching students in a meaningful and research based manner all across the us  teachers and students are being subjected to this kind of strict regimine  which many  like bradshaw  believe is doing more harm than good rather than improving student performance  student test scores are declining as the washington post reported here in november fourth graders and eighth graders across the united states lost ground on national mathematics tests this year  the first declines in scores since the federal government began administering the exams in  reading performance also was sobering  eighth grade scores dropped  according to results released wednesday  while fourth grade performance was stagnant compared with   the last time students took the test testing of students in  also showed a decline from previous years while some might be willing to support high stakes testing if there were evidence that teaching to the tests was improving student performance  the opposite is true under no child left behind  which ties teacher pay and school funding to student test results  kids and teachers are subjected to an enormous amount of pressure  the consequences of this failed experiment stretch beyond the academic  as bradshaw s letter illustrates all across the country  educators report  rising numbers of children struggling to manage their emotions in an academic environment   the problems are most pronounced among the youngest students  teachers say as oregon live reports here  in recent years  more students are coming to school unprepared or unsettled  which can lead to tantrums  running from the classroom  despondent behavior or physical aggression  as bradshaw points out in her resignation letter  it is not the children who are disordered  it s the system photo by bill o leary the washington post via getty images
