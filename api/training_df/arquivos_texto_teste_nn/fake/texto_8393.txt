monday marked the all important iowa caucuses  and every candidate on the right is busily competing for the votes of as many religious bigots as possible  one such candidate was  of course  texas senator ted cruz  he also had his celebrity supporters helping him along  and one such person was duck dynasty star phil robertson  who likely enjoyed his role in cruz s iowa efforts  as it allowed him to do what he loves to do most  hate on gay people in public today s topic for robertson was the evils of allowing two people who love each other but happen to be of the same sex to get married  robertson said of equal marriage  it is evil  it s wicked  it s sinful and they want us to swallow it  he wasn t done there  though  he went on to actually attack any and all people  particularly politicians  who support equal rights for everyone  we have to run this bunch out of washington d c  we have to rid the earth of them  get them out of there  when it was time for cruz himself to appear before the crowd  he actually endorsed the idea of purging the planet of all who disagree with him and his bearded supporter on this particular issue  and called robertson  a joyful  cheerful  unapologetic voice of truth  so  in other words  these people are actually insinuating that a whole population of people and their supporters should actually die  sounds eerily close to what hitler would have done to me watch robertson s remarks below  via right wing watch  featured image from video screen capture from right wing watch
