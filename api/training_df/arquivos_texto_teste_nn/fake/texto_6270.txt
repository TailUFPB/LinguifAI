throughout this presidential race  donald trump has said a number of racist things that have drawn outrage from those who have a soul and merriment from those who are pure evil  some were wondering if trump has just been saying these things to pander to republican voters  but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things for instance  back in  while on howard stern s radio program  trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of the apprentice that would feature black people versus white people  fortunately  nbc knew that idea wasn t going to fly trump told stern and his co host robin quivers  on  the apprentice there was a concept  okay  thrown out by some person  nine blacks against nine whites  and it would be nine blacks against nine whites  all highly educated  very smart  strong  beautiful  do you like it  do you like it  robin  quivers responded  i think you re gonna have a riot  but trump being trump  said  it would be the highest rated show on television  then when stern asked  very dark blacks  or light skinned blacks  trump responded with   assortment  against whites  after trump admitted that nbc didn t like the idea  duh  and stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension  trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension  saying  it would be handled very beautifully by me  because  as you know  i m very diplomatic  also  i think you d have  million people a night watching  adding  there s something wrong with it  but i don t know  maybe we should think about it  it seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for the apprentice  trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit so  if you had any remaining doubt that trump might not actually be racist  this should clear things up for you  featured photo by frazer harrison getty images  ht buzzfeed
