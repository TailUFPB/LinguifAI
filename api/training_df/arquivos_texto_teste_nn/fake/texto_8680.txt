on sunday  publishing company scholastic announced that it would be removing a birthday cake for george washington from shelves over criticism that the book portrayed happy slaves in a press release  scholastic explained that the book needed to include more context on the  evils of slavery  and that all returns would be honored  the statement read  while we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author  illustrator and editor  we believe that  without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide  the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn  we do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children  despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author  editor  and illustrator  the book  which was released on january   happens to be about an enslaved man and his daughter faced with the task of baking president george washington a birthday cake  here s the cover scholastic s description of the story reads  oh  how george washington loves his cake  and  oh  how he depends on hercules  his head chef  to make it for him  hercules  a slave  takes great pride in baking the president s cake  but this year there is one problem   they are out of sugar  scholastic s reaction is a complete turnaround from its previous defense of the book  which claimed the topic of slavery had been approached with the  utmost care   scholastic also previously claimed the book depicted the slaves being happy because they were living in  near freedom  and simply enjoyed cooking  scholastic even allowed the book s author  ramin ganeshram  to explain the intention behind the book on the publisher s blog last week as public outcry increased  graneshram insisted that his story was based on historical research and was meant as a compliment to the slaves  resiliency and resourcefulness  graneshram wrote  how could they smile  how could they be anything but unrelentingly miserable   ganeshram wrote   how could they be proud to bake a cake for george washington  the answers to those questions are complex because human nature is complex  bizarrely and yes  disturbingly  there were some enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and  close  relationships with those who enslaved them  but they were smart enough to use those  advantages  to improve their lives  even before scholastic made its decision to pull it  the book had over  one star reviews on amazon  at the time the announcement was made  only  of those reviews were positive school library journal called the book  highly problematic   advising people not to buy it  kirkus reviews  another trade publication  said the book was  an incomplete  even dishonest treatment of slavery  featured image via twitter
