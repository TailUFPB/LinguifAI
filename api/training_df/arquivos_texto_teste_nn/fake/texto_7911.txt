 ever since the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia  republicans have insisted on turning the constitutionally backed nomination process into a political sideshow to deprive obama of his legal right to name a new justice and to deprive americans of their say in the matter senate republicans  led by their obstructor in chief mitch mcconnell  have repeatedly made the astounding claim that they will refuse to hold nomination hearings for any person obama may choose  sight unseen  instead  they will spend the next  days with an empty seat on the supreme court   a glowing middle finger neon sign built in the way of the democratic process for their part  the american people have made it absolutely clear that this sort of political point scoring is inappropriate  offensive  and unwanted  when fox news  fox news   ran a poll asking if americans supported obama naming a new justice  an overwhelming majority said yes supreme court justice antonin scalia s recent death has sparked a debate over how to fill the vacancy on the nation s highest court  taking into consideration that it s an election year  which of the following is closer to your view it s still the responsibility of current leaders  president obama and the senate  to take action to fill the vacancy now   president shouldn t get to nominate someone for a lifetime appointment to the high court this late in his term   that the number transcends partisan lines  obama s approval rating sits at around  percent  in other words  there are many people that may disagree with the president on issues  but recognize the fact that he is within his rights to name a new supreme court justice republicans just don t care days after the polls began trickling in saying americans wanted obama to be able to fulfill his obligations  mcconnell and other republican leaders held a secret  closed door meeting in his office to decide what to do  their conclusion was to circle the wagons  dig in and stick their heads in the sand  the party of no is alive and well key republican senators on the judiciary committee emerged from a closed door meeting in majority leader mitch mcconnell s office tuesday united in their determination not to consider any nominee to replace anton scalia until the next president takes office  we believe the american people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame duck president   said majority whip john cornryn this is an egregious  screw you  to not only democrats and the president  but also to the american people more broadly  it s disgusting that sen  john cornryn would invoke the  american people  in his disgusting defense of the gop s actions  because the american people already had a voice when it came to the process   they voted for president obama  twice if there is any good news in a story that is essentially about one political party destroying the fabric of the democracy to get their way  it s this  republicans may fold their arms and throw a tantrum  but they are showing everyone   democratic and republican voters alike   that they only care about their own self interest  the voice of the people  they couldn t care less  i wonder how that s going to play on election day featured image via flickr
