one thing in life you never want to do is pretend you know something about another person s life experiences  you ll never know the moments and quality of life someone had unless you actually hear it from that person themselves  however  now  in a last ditch effort to appeal to voters  republican presidential candidate dr  ben carson has decided to tell us all about how president obama grew up  in fact  carson s gone so far as to allude to the fact that actually he would be the real first black president  because obama was  raised white   and that obama doesn t actually understand what it s like to be black he told the politico podcast  he s an  african  american  he was  you know  raised white  putting an emphasis on  african    however  continuing  i mean  like most americans  i was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected  but   he didn t grow up like i grew up   many of his formative years were spent in indonesia  so  for him to  you know  claim that  you know  he identifies with the experience of black americans  i think  is a bit of a stretch  carson also seems to believe that the racism many are experiencing now  such as young unarmed men being gunned down in the street by those paid to protect and serve  as well as every reason black lives matter needs to exist  isn t really racism as compared to what he went through  carson implies that his life experiences are the ones that should really count as racism and other people  well  they just don t know  he said  remember now  i ve been around for  years  you know  i ve had a chance to see what real racism is  carson also claims that he doesn t think the republican party is racist  i don t find any particular problem being an african american in the republican party  the people i know that in the progressive side of things  they like to say that the republicans are racist  i know that  i haven t experienced that  so  because he hasn t experienced it  well  then  it must not exist  right it s as though he believes he s the be all and end all in the discussion of racism  perhaps if he ever took the time to get out of his own egotistical  self serving mind  he d understand that racism now  is real racism  too  every experience is valid  every experience needs to be heard  and to undermine president obama  and to make the bold claim that he s not really black because he was  raised white  is not only presumptuous and disrespectful  but outright wrong listen to the whole podcast here featured image  flickr
