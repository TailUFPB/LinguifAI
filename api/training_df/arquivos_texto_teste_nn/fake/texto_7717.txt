the united states supreme court is currently debating one of the most important bills on abortion in the past two decades the bill from texas  which former democratic texas state senator wendy davis famously filibustered in   would grant doctors admitting privileges at hospitals for abortions  and clinics would be forced to upgrade facilities to hospital standards  which would force abortion clinics outside of highly populated metropolitan areas to close their doors  leaving about  clinics left in the state three female supreme court justices  ruth bader ginsberg  sonia sotomayor  and elena kagan led the questioning against republican texas solicitor general scott keller over the impacts the bill would have  particularly on women from low income backgrounds the debate is the first major decision in the united states supreme court since the death of antonin scalia  as one seat on the supreme court remains unfilled  a   tie over the bill is very likely  if that were to happen  the bill would be allowed to go into effect in texas  but not set a precedent nationally  if a split occurs  the debate could also be brought back to the supreme court when the seat is filled when keller made the argument some abortion clinics would still allow to be opened in the state  justice ruth bader ginsburg rebuked   how many women are located over  miles from the nearest clinic   keller cited new mexico as a location for some women under that category to use  which ginsburg then pointed out new mexico does not have the same provisions as the texas law  if your argument is right  then new mexico is not an available way out   she said justice elena kagan cited the texas bill would disenfranchise over   women who live  miles away or more from an abortion clinic in the state  she also cited   women live more than  miles away  but before the law was passed in texas  that number was   justice sotomayor challenged keller over whether the changes would yield any slight health improvement  and if that was worth burdening the lives of millions of women in texas the justice who could break the   tie is anthony kennedy  whose vote could either strike down the bill    or give the conservative justices the   tie to keep the debate open  which would give the gop even more incentive to stall a supreme court justice nomination from president barack obama the past few years  texas  gop has led a legislative war on abortion clinics  under the guise of improving women s health and safety  the bill is just another measure to make it more difficult for a woman to undergo an abortion by eliminating access  prior to   there were  abortion clinics in the state  after some provisions of the anti abortion law went into effect after it was passed in   the number was cut in half  if the bill is allowed to pass  the number would drop down again to ten  all solely located around texas  biggest cities the supreme court is expected to come to a decision by late june featured image via addicting info
