the obama administration s well guarded osama bin laden documents were released on wednesday by cia director mike pompeo  the documents were seized in a raid after u s  seal rob o neill killed osama bin laden  the obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand picked just a few of the   documents to release  they hid damning evidence that could have hurt obama s chance at reelection in   obama ran the clock out al qaeda was not  on the run  steve hayes of the weekly standard   in a manner of speaking  barack obama wanted what al qaeda already had  a mutually beneficial partnership with tehran  revealing to the american people the truth about osama bin laden s cozy working relationship with the iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest  just as the ongoing vitality of al qaeda  amply testified to in the bin laden documents  would have contradicted obama s proud claims in  that al qaeda was  on the run   so obama  with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community  bottled up the bin laden documents and ran out the clock iran s close ties to al qaeda could hurt the iran deal within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al qaeda   tehran ties  how iran supplied  everything needed   including  money  arms  and  training in hezbollah camps in lebanon   including safe haven for other jihadis  the new york post reported the assessment is raising questions as to how much then president obama knew about iran s ties to al qaeda before making his controversial deal  and it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key the obama white house had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons  bin laden had called iran a  main artery for funds  personnel and communication  for al qaeda  the post reported that wasn t the only suspicious dealing obama had with iran  in august   republicans were furious over a reported deal obama had made to release american hostages in iran the former administration denied paying   million in  ransom  for the hostages  arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long standing case  however  it was only the first of three payments to the iranians totaling    billion that took place after the hostage release  as the wall street journal disclosed  and strikingly  much of the case came by way of plane loads of cash in international currencies but the revelations about bin laden and the former administration don t end there muslim brotherhood connections to bin laden in one of the   videos files contained within the newly released documents  bin laden is asked to name is his influences  the terrorist leader didn t hesitate  the national reported  from a religious aspect  i was committed within the muslim brotherhood  bin laden also suggested the muslim brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi  it was the first time i travelled to a country where i did not know the language   he writes   i carried a pistol and went  the brotherhood  they had poor knowledge about things  if they knew  i would not have had to travel through syria to antakya  hours by bus to reach istanbul  it was easier from jeddah to istanbul by plane  three hours by plane  muslim brotherhood connections to clintons critics of the muslim brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the west  one brotherhood official gehad el haddad was arrested two years ago in cairo for inciting violence  el haddad  pictured below  previously worked as an executive for the clinton foundation  via  bpr
