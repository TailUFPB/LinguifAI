a bunch of rabid gun toting conservatives would like the secret service to know that president obama is a target president obama plans to speak at the south by southwest technology and music convention on friday  so some crazy open carry activists came up with the idea to try to intimidate and taunt him at the event by openly carrying their firearms  with one even urging his fellow gun nuts to make sure they  get a clear shot  and assassinate him if they get a chance cj grisham pointed out that president obama would be at the event this year and announced to his buddies that he would be carrying his rifle and handing out gun nut literature   this may get interesting   he remarked jovan jackson then commented that cj should carry a pistol instead because hippies  scare easy  here s a screenshot of the post via freakoutnation and that s when kriss elliot chimed in in an apparent effort to get on the secret service s radar an azure solutions consultant at insight enterprises  elliot actually encouraged his friends to find president obama and murder him with their guns if they get the opportunity  if you get a clear shot  please fire for effect   he wrote again  this piece of crap texan literally said   if you get a clear shot  please fire for effect   which sounds like a direct threat against the life of the sitting president of the united states not everyone thought that sounded like a good idea  however  harry graybill warned that attempting to kill president obama would mean prison for the open carry activists who carried out the assassination effort and would damage their pro gun crusade  he failed to mention that they d literally be trying to end the life of a human being here s a screenshot of that post as well it s not enough that texas already has the blood of one us president on their hands  now they want a second one  too  these dangerous people are the precise reason why carrying firearms in public should be against the law and they should be put behind bars  featured image via pixabay
