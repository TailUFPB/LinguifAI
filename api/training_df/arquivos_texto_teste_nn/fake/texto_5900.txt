during a telephone interview with cnn s jake tapper  florida governor rick scott carefully avoided any acknowledgement that the gay community had been targeted in the june  mass shooting  which left  people dead and  more injured in orlando during the interview  tapper pointed out that the gay community  appears to have been directly targeted in the attack   he went on to acknowledge the impact the shooting has had on florida s lgbt community  saying  there are a lot of members of that community and supporting friends and family who are very worried  obviously if this was radical islam  which the special agent in charge of the fbi suggested it may have been  that is a community that has been under siege from radical islam  tapper asked scott what steps are being taken to protect florida s gay and lesbian community from further threats scott refused to acknowledge the gay community  instead providing a generic  barely coherent statement in response to the question  saying  we don t want anybody in our state to ever be targeted  we don t want anybody to be discriminated against  and so in every case  when we believe there is somebody doing the wrong thing  we work hard to make sure we take care of them  he went on to explain  and so what we ll   you know  as we go through this process  what we ll learn through this  is we ll learn what we can do to hopefully to never  never  ever to let this happen again  tapper pressed the issue  apparently hoping that florida s right wing governor was capable of giving a response that addressed the needs of the lgbt community in his state  but  i guess my point is   tapper responded   you ve declared a state of emergency in orange county  but there are areas of the state of florida   south beach  for example   where there may be a large and thriving lgbt community that might be very  very afraid this morning  he again asked scott about the precautions his administration is taking to protect members of the gay community  and specifically asked whether there would be additional law enforcement presence to protect against possible copycat attacks or on the off chance that the shooter wasn t acting alone while it seems clear from the interview that tapper was hoping to get scott to reach out to members of the lgbt community in his own state following the deadliest mass shooting in history  scott never did that instead he offered more generic assurances about how the state responds  when something like this happens   scott said   one of the first things you do on top of dealing with the issue you have at hand  is say   who else could this impact and what can we do to make sure that does not happen  when asked what people can do to help  scott responded by saying  they can pray  this is what a truly incompetent leader sounds like watch the interview below  courtesy of raw story on youtube  featured imae via video screen capture via raw story on youtube
