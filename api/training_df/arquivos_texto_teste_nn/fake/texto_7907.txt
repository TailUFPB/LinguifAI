after donald trump declared that he would do far worse things than waterboarding  it has left the questioned to be begged  what should be done to gain intelligence that doesn t involve torture  a very valid question  and one that our intelligence community probably grapples with daily considering  no  you can t torture people to gather intelligence when posed with this question on cnn  ben carson replied that he would promote a much more humane  medical way  of intelligence gathering pressed on what this medical way would be by cnn s poppy harlow  carson responded  i believe there are a number of ways to extract information  including  you know  some medical ways of  you know  putting people into a less than conscious state which allows information to be extracted much more humanely  carson was then asked to explain further  so he said  well  the average person might understand it as truth serum  but  you know  there are ways where you decrease a person s conscious defenses and they might be much more willing to give up information  seemingly perplexed by the concept of a truth serum as though it were coming from a harry potter novel  harlow again asked carson to explain in greater detail what he means  carson explained  sodium amytal  but you know there are a variety of different things we can use now  we ve made some advances in that kind of science  so  instead of torture people  carson is advocating drugging them against their will  it may seem more humane  but it s not necessarily more ethical carson never did actually answer the question regarding if waterboarding should be used  and pivoted away into a non answer of  i don t think we necessarily need to be broadcasting what we do  well  okay then  why answer questions anyway  it s not like he s running for commander in chief or anything watch the interview unfold here featured image  youtube
