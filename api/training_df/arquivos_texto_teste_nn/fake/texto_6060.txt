donald trump has already proven to america that he attracts the energy that he puts out  this has been especially true for his loyal supporters  as his racism and xenophobia have attracted white supremacists  fascists and neo nazis from all over the country  however  his fear mongering tactics don t just appeal to his fans  it turns out  some of the presumptive republican nominee s delegates are just as racist and hateful  and it s creating a movement that is becoming more of a threat to america s safety with every passing day a recent example of just how deadly trump s supporters are can be shown with the recent words of david riden  a top delegate to trump who will be attending the republican national convention  in an interview with mother jones  riden had some terrifying words for how he would like to correct our government  which he claims is  way off away from the constitution right now  his solution would be to slaughter america s current leaders  aka president barack obama  for not satisfying his highly inaccurate interpretation of the u s  constitution  and in case you felt that might have just been an exaggeration  riden was kind enough to clarify what he meant so there s no room for interpretation  he said  the polite word is  eliminated   the harsh word is  killed  riden continued to say that these  certain  leaders should be killed  by american citizens with weapons  and if people have tanks  assault weapons  if they have bombs   they need to have the weaponry necessary to be able to overthrow the federal government  in riden s perfect world  america looks like this   p eople have the right to assemble  bear arms  go to washington  dc  or wherever necessary  and go into military battle against the government and replace those in government with individuals that will uphold the constitution  it s no surprise that riden is supporting trump  riden is a former nuclear engineer and is a member of the  sovereign citizen  movement  which believes that the government is conspiring to take away their guns  human rights and land  he was also an attendee of the continental congress of   which is a huge gathering of white supremacist and right wing hate groups  it s been noted that these groups have grown at a feverish pace during obama s presidency  and trump has expertly tapped into that racism and hate like no candidate before  when it comes to people like riden  trump just keeps adding fuel to the fire featured image via elijah nouvelage   getty images
