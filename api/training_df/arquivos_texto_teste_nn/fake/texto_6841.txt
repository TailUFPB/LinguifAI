there was once a time that john kasich seemed like the only sane  somewhat reasonable republican candidate in the presidential race  but those days are long gone  kasich is starting to sound more and more like trump and cruz as time goes on it was just a few days ago that kasich said that if women wanted to avoid being raped  they should just not go to parties where there is alcohol  he of course experienced tons of backlash for that comment  but instead of apologizing and admitting that it was a victim blaming  insensitive remark  he s doubled down instead in a sunday morning interview on cnn s state of the union  kasich made an attempt to rectify his controversial comments  and ended up making it much worse  in trying to explain his misogynistic reasoning  kasich said that having alcohol at a party makes it more difficult for justice to be rendered for a whole variety of reasons  host dana bash tried to give kasich another chance and pressed him further  but the ohio governor just simply couldn t grasp why his comments would be so controversial or problematic  bash was generous and even explained to the presidential hopeful that his comments would discourage women from reporting their assaults if they re told that the presence of alcohol makes their story less valid or believable  but kasich once again failed to understand and continued to dig himself into a deeper hole  he said  actually  i don t know how anybody would take it that way  bash answered   because it s taken a while to change the stigma of getting people to come out  kasich  apparently forgetting that the infamous  tragic steubenville rape case took place in ohio  shot back  dana  i have led the way in the country to fight this and to get justice served in these conditions  i think even if  in fact  there is alcohol involved  you still have   you still can find the perpetrator  i just don t want justice to be denied because something comes up that a prosecutor looks at it and says  well  i can t figure this thing out  and no matter what bash countered back with  kasich had an equally offensive answer certainly  kasich s speech would be much more effective in preventing sexual assaults if he told potential rapists to avoid alcohol at parties instead of victims  but  you know  that s just not the gop s style  you can watch the baffling interview below  featured image via getty images   andrew burton
