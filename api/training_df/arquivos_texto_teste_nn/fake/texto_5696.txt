 lgbt crowd eyes preschool children   that s the vile headline on a story republished on fox news from capital bigot laura ingraham s site  lifezette  the headline was crafted specifically to make people recoil in horror due to the misbegotten idea that the lgbt community is all about pushing the  homosexual agenda  onto our children  below is a screen capture of the story sitting on fox news  website  for all to see the story itself almost waxes poetic on the dangers of lgbt indoctrination  attacking a series of online videos called  queer kids stuff   that series intended to help parents talk to their children about the lgbt community in a way that s easy for them to understand  bigoted  homophobic conservatives  however  see this as predatory  claiming that the only way the movement wins is by going after ever younger groups of children the videos haven t made their way into preschools yet  but that s exactly what sean ryan  the communications director of mass resistance  an alleged  pro family  group  is afraid of  it is easily conceivable that videos such as these will be sanctioned eventually by local school boards and implemented in preschool and prekindergarten classes activists are trying to force these topics on younger and younger children because that is the only way their movement wins rational adults don t buy into the so called  queer theory  or transgenderism  unfortunately  children are a soft target for homosexual activists as they are malleable and still learning about the world  we have to wonder who these rational adults are  and whether he even knows the definition of  rational   since he clearly isn t  chances are he means narrow minded  extremist fanatics like himself  who think that the lgbt community needs to go back into the closet and stay there  so we can all go back to pretending they don t exist  like we used to  ryan even alluded to that in the story  there was once a time when it was unthinkable to even mention the topic of homosexuality in a school setting  now  there are homosexual  bisexual  transgender lesson plans for kids as young as kindergarten  he believes that the reason today s parents might support something he views as gross is because they  themselves  were indoctrinated and don t even realize it  there s no way of convincing someone this close minded and black hearted that nobody was brainwashed  except  perhaps  them the new civil rights movement said that fox news should change the headline  they should  but they won t  because it says exactly what they want to say   it s all about the children  we swear   the haters scream  it s not  and saying that the lgbt community is after our children is a dangerous lie and a half featured image by scott olson getty images and fox news website
