if there s anyone who can appreciate a good donald trump impersonation it s jimmy fallon of the tonight show  fallon has been impersonating trump throughout the entirety of this presidential election  and doing so pretty damn flawlessly however  there s another trump impersonator who is giving fallon a run for his money  jack aiello  and he just nailed trump perfectly during his  grade commencement ceremony for comparison  here s aiello doing his amazing trump impression aiello did such a good job with his impersonation that it garnered the attention of fallon  who then brought him onto the tonight show to play  little donald   who now will be trump s running mate  fallon  as trump  said on the show  the only person good enough to be my vice president is me  which is probably a very accurate guess as to who the real donald trump would actually like as his running mate although  what the audience wasn t expecting  alongside the aiello s brilliant trump impression  was an equally as impressive  if not better impression  of bernie sanders  finger wave and all  and  of course  hillary clinton was thrown into the sketch for good measure as well with aiello and fallon having the candidates prank calling each other needless to say  this kid has a bright future in impersonating  and snl may be calling him sooner rather than later watch the hilarious sketch here featured image via video screen capture
