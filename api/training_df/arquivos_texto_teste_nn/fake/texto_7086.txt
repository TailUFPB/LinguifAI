milton parker  a former paraprofessional  like a teacher but not quite  from new york  is currently defending punching an  year old autistic student so hard that the child suffered a concussion  his defense  it was a  reflexive action  that might fly if parker was facing an adult but he was facing an  year old sitting in the cafeteria of ps   located in brooklyn here s the disturbing video the parents of the student are suing parker for   million because they say their son is now afraid to go into school buildings and has to be homeschooled  as the parent of an autistic child  i can attest that one horrible incident can leave that kind of impact and as the parent of a non autistic child as well  i can attest that it s much harder for an autistic child to get over a traumatic incident  finally  i can fully attest that if a teacher hit my son like that  they d be lucky if i stopped at a  concussion  after punching the child  parker was charged with felony assault  but plead down to misdemeanor assault  and put in for retirement  perhaps sensing that he had become a danger to children   but maintains he did nothing wrong milton parker  who is being sued along with the city by the parents of anatoly veltman  said the blow he delivered was a  reflex  act in response to the boy hitting him first  who gets hit and doesn t respond   parker told the daily news   the kid punched me in the eye first and as a reflex he got hit back  i knew it was on camera   parker    said   if it was intentional  i would have taken him to another room and beaten the snot out of him  perhaps parker is mistaking  in anger  for  as a reflex   because we ve all seen people lash out as a startled reflex followed by immediate remorse and concern for the person they hit  watching that video  his body language is less  oh crap  i m sorry   and more  yeah  you had that coming  punk   if i were parker  i would not be happy that video exists because he s going to have to convince a jury that he felt bad about throwing a full strength punch at a little kid god luck with that  you prick featured image via wabc screen capture
