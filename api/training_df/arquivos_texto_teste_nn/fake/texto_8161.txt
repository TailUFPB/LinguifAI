indiana governor mike pence is at the center of a political and human rights predicament of his own making it all relates to what he said   or what he didn t say   when confronted with a question about lgbt rights  speaking at a town hall in kokomo  the republican governor was unable to directly answer a simple yes or no question  taking  seconds to respond and then delving into defending religion  here is the question from an unidentified audience member  in a simple yes or no answer  do you believe that gay and transgender people should be able to be fired from their jobs just for that reason  pence immediately had difficulty with the question  taking time to think about it  moreover  the applause for the question itself threw him off   here is pence s pensive response   it s a great privilege for me to be your governor  i don t think anyone should ever be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love  my position as i expressed in my state of the state address  and did again today  is we are a state with a constitution  and as you know  as a pastor  that constitution has very strong safeguards for the freedom of conscience and freedom of religion of hoosiers and my strong conviction is that  should the general assembly put legislation on my desk  which they considered this year  and should i continue to be governor and they ever do in the future  it just must be consistent with the constitution  but i will not support legislation that diminishes religious freedom  i hope you hear my heart a little bit as much as my head on this  because it really is a great privilege to serve you   i thank you for the question  he s clearly throwing red herrings with his talk about religion  never answering the question directly  freedom indiana immediately turned the clip into a political ad the problem with republican conservatives like pence is that they fail to realize why they are in office in the first place  to serve the public  and that includes everyone   including the lgbt community  once there is evidence that they are not serving the entire public  then that s when people like pence should be fired  featured image from video screen capture
