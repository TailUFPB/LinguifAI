as much as likely all of us want elections to be cut and dry  popular vote wins all  it s just not that simple  it s a game  and if you choose to play you have to abide by the rules  you can t change them halfway through  frustrating  sure  illegal  no showing more than ever that he s a newcomer to the whole politicking world  trump took to twitter  yet again  to air his grievances about the political process in yet another temper tantrum  trump said  just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be  i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz lawsuit coming  just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be  i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz lawsuit coming  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     first of all  here are the results of the louisiana republican primary via new york timesand yes  while he did win  as per party rules  the delegates were split  and cruz didn t win more  he won t the same  however  cruz may end up picking up some more  which is probably why trump got his underoos in a bunch  but this doesn t mean anything  at all  was done improperly  per the wall street journal  mr  cruz s supporters also seized five of louisiana s six slots on the three powerful committees that will write the rules and platform at the republican national convention and mediate disputes over delegates  eligibility this summer in cleveland the little noticed inside maneuvering that led to this outcome in louisiana is another dramatic illustration of the inside game that could have an outsize influence on the bitter race for the gop nomination  sketchy  yes  illegal  no  sure  it goes to show how devious politicking can get  but in regards to trump  well  you can t change the rules once you start playing the game  trump chose to enter the race as a republican  and everything that is happening can and likely will be done to make sure trump s not the nominee  much like with what s happening on the democratic side  hell  as much as bernie sanders wants to complain about democratic superdelegates  his senior adviser tad devine helped put together the system  and again  you can t change the rules after you decide to play  both trump and sanders are outsiders who willfully chose to play an insiders game  either could have run as an independent  but both chose a party ticket for a better chance  and to their credit have done rather well the wall street journal also noted  while mr  trump leads in winning primary and caucus elections  and has won more delegates  the cruz campaign is proving superior at the arcane game of picking the people who will be the actual delegates to the convention  where they will help write the rules and ultimately choose the nominee that means that if mr  trump fails to reach the delegate threshold to claim the gop nomination on the convention s first ballot  committees dominated by cruz supporters could work to block him from winning enough delegates to claim the nomination on any subsequent ballots  trump can threaten to sue all he wants  or even actually sue  but at the end of the day it just goes to show how much of a political novice he truly is  he needs to realize that while everyone else is playing chess to skillfully maneuver their way to the nomination  he s still playing candy land featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
