that dreadful night in benghazi  libya in september of  when the lives of four americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget  we shall never forget it for two reasons  because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life  and because republicans and fox news insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by hillary clinton in her reaction to events that took place clarifying one of the longest held myths by fox news and conservatives  former secretary of defense leon panetta spoke to msnbc s andrea mitchell  not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove hillary as uncaring and incompetent  but he also explained how everything that could have been done  was done mitchell first asks panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in benghazi now you re here in washington because you re going to be testifying to the benghazi select committee tomorrow  you have already testified to other committees  but to this committee  and there s a new movie coming out   hours  and it s about to be released  it is accusing the cia operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time  and the suggestion is that  if not for that order to stand down  that chris stevens and the others might have been saved  first of all  you were at the pentagon at the time  i believe  was there any order to stand down that you know of panetta responds absolutely not  you know  i m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented  but from my experience  and from the role that i played as secretary of defense  there was never any order to stand down  on the contrary  the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives delving further into if there were any sort of hillary clinton misstep  mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order there s also a report  several reports  that the pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort  military effort to the state department  and that someone  the suggestion is hillary clinton  said   no thanks  we don t need the help or stand down or stand back   was there any effort by the pentagon to intervene that the state department rejected and would she have even been in the role panetta offers an answer that many right wingers are not going to like whatsoever  the truth i m not aware of any such effort at all  as a matter of fact  after meeting with the president  i immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces  to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved  and we in fact put forces in place  the problem was that  attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there  this is a tragic event  it s tragic in a number of ways  but most importantly  it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately  i think  doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives panetta is exactly right  this tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against hillary clinton  we need to learn from what happened in benghazi and make sure it never happens again  we also need to  once and for all  put the myth to bed that hillary was incompetent  she  of all people  is quite aware of the loss that happened that day  she s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again  video featured image  mmfa
