two years ago   year old monique tillman and her brother  like kids everywhere across the country  were riding their bikes  unlike kids everywhere  tillman was stopped for nothing more than the apparent crime of riding while black tillman and her brother made the mistake of cutting through a mall parking lot and running into tacoma police officer jared williams  who was moonlighting as mall security  williams then stopped the pair  telling them they were trespassing and that they might be banned from the mall the children tried to explain that they ride through that parking lot all the time and they tried to leave  what happened after that might not be suitable for work here s the video if you don t have the stomach to watch the video  the girl is snatched from her bike by the off duty officer and slammed up against a car while he appears to be choking her  he then grabbed her hair and began throwing her around  he even tased her  he was choking me  grabbed me by my hair and tried to slam my face into the concrete  the next thing i know  i m on the ground being tased   tillman said source  free thought projectthen  after it was clearly shown in the video that the girl never even raised a hand toward the officer  she was charged for resisting arrest and assault on an officer for allegedly attempting to kick him  that s right  she was charged for assault  fortunately  those charges were thrown out after there was no evidence that she tried to kick at all  and a lawsuit has been filed against officer williams  the security company and the people who own the mall  a child riding a bike should not have to worry that a police officer will stop her without legal cause and brutalize her   said  tillman s attorney  vito  de la cruz   our communities are weary of another african american child being hurt by unwarranted and excessive police force  tillman  who is now a digital media student at bates technical college  had this to say  i feel like i was targeted because i am a person of color   tillman told the seattle times   it was frustrating because i knew i didn t do anything wrong  but i couldn t stop them  here s tillman  now   talking about the incident  saying all she wants is an apology williams still has his job featured image via video screen captures
