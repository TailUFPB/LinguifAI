during an interview with a bbc live host  a texas gun advocate defended his state s new gun law policies by saying that the only way to stop gun violence is to arm more people  c j  grisham  president of the gun advocacy group open carry texas and a candidate for the state senate believes that law abiding citizens should be able to access guns easily in order to counter those who have them illegally  he said  you can pass all the background checks you want  but a criminal gang member in chicago isn t going to run a background check on another gang member  the host then interrupted grisham and asked   sorry  how many of the mass college shootings were carried out by criminal gang members  grisham responds   well they were all carried out by criminals  not licensed carriers  the host then asks   so how did those people manage to access the weaponry that led to all of those deaths then  illegally  that s what i m saying   said grisham the host continues to drill grisham by asking   how do you tighten that up then   grisham s response is ridiculous  well  you can t stop all crime  you tighten it up by getting rid of gun free zones and allowing people to defend themselves no matter where they walk  no matter where they go  no matter where they study  so  just to be clear  c j   asked the host   the solution is actually having more guns in circulation in america  therefore  when a columbine happens  a teacher can open fire in a classroom against the assailant  so  guns in classrooms  you advocate that  well  there s already guns in classrooms  it s just that they re in the hands of criminals and the good guys can t defend themselves   said grisham the guns used in the columbine shooting were bought from an unlicensed private seller   the guns  were all purchased for them by dylan klebold s girlfriend   year old columbine student robyn anderson  who accompanied the two  year olds to the tanner gun show outside denver  shopping with their cash  she was what is called a straw purchaser  but it would not have been necessary  since youths were allowed to buy rifles and shotguns in colorado and no background checks are necessary when guns are sold by individuals rather than federally licensed gun dealers  president obama is currently proposing laws that would crack down on that type of easy access grisham s logic is very flawed  his idea is that if a person is in possession of a gun  then that person is likely to be safer in an unsafe situation  however   a gun is more likely to discharge accidentally in the home or be used by a family member against another family member rather than against an intruder  the reality is that the more guns are around  the more likely the gun will not be used  for self defense against a criminal feature image via youtube
