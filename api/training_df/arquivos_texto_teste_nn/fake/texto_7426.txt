the stupid part of america is riled up again after maryland made a small change to its state song  to make it a bit more modern  the state senate voted   to both officially reaffirm maryland  oh maryland  as the official state song  and to remove the words  northern scum so that citizens of the state can finally sing it without feeling a stinging sense of shame  maryland  oh maryland  was penned in  and adopted as the state song in   talking points memo notes that it is unclear why the song was adopted at that particular historical moment but notes there had been two recent lynchings in the state and the naacp was then advocating for equal pay for black teachers   in other words  it probably was not selected because people enjoy singing to the tune of   o tannenbaum  by enshrining a confederate war anthem  the general assembly may have been seeking symbolically to challenge such efforts   the ap notes the song is pretty inflammatory  currently  it ends with a rousing call to fight against those dirty northerners who wanted to end slavery  she is not dead  nor deaf  nor dumb   huzza  she spurns the northern scum  she breathes  she burns  she ll come  she ll come  maryland  my maryland  the song refers to president abraham lincoln as a  despot  and urges marylanders to  burst the tyrant s chains   the changes keep one verse from the old lyrics and add one from an  poem describing the natural beauty of the state of maryland   something more appropriate in modern times than complaints about lincoln and calls for an armed uprising  they keep the historic song  it s still there  but this bill is an excellent compromise to move forward  so that our children and our children s children and so that all maryland can be proud of our state song   said senate president thomas v  mike miller  d    at the present time  all of maryland cannot be proud of our state song  and so that s the reason i m voting green  changing the song is a completely reasonable action  given its inflammatory speech   so naturally  fox news fans became rather incensed when they learned about what they view on an assault on their heritage  whether they are from maryland or not   some complained about rap music for some reason  while others threatened to take up arms against the government  others whined about black people  some said that this is a form of white genocide  the systemic elimination of the white race that donald trump s supporters in the kkk believe is happening   and others still hold out hope that the south will rise again  and  of course  there were the customary calls for president obama s death that accompany literally everything that happens in the world                      unfortunately  this is where we re at as a nation   and donald trump s rhetoric has given these people  who would normally keep their shameful and idiotic opinions to themselves and their local klavern  the courage to speak out  whenever someone tells you that republicans aren t racist  we d tell you to show them this  but we all know they will simply claim that the hundreds of similar comments are left by  liberal plants  who want to destroy america   no matter how much evidence exists that this attitude is no longer the minority in the rapublican party the bill is set to go to the house  where it is expected to pass   a good thing for the state of maryland  but something that will likely cause at least a few acts of violence against african americans  it s just what conservatives do these days maybe next  legislators can hop on board the effort to change the name of negro mountain   or at least take down the numerous highways signs and remove the picnic area featured image via screengrab
