there have been a lot of strange this that have happened this presidential election season  but some things are definitely stranger than others  one of those things being the fact that rep  steve king  r ia  seems to know sen  ted cruz s speeches by heart now  one could assume that it s because he s heard them so many times and cruz doesn t change things up  so like a fan of a band he s mouthing the words  another assumption could be made that perhaps he helped write the speech  so he s proudly mouthing the words along side his partner in conservative crime  however  probably the most accurate assumption would be that ted cruz is actually king s ventriloquist dummy and he s not doing a good job of hiding the movements of his mouth need proof  watch this vine  now  this is still just a working theory  but it s one that makes the most sense  really  how else can one explain that they seem to be the same person in two different bodies  albeit  one is canadian and the other from iowa need further proof flickr amazoni can t be the only one who sees this  how uncanny is that  i mean  c mon however  i digress  maybe  just maybe  king should either practice his ventriloquism better  or learn to keep his mouth just so he doesn t appear to be a creeper in the background  either choice would work video featured image from  vine
