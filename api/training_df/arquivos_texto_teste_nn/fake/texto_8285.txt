if you have the stomach to actually follow the republican debates that seem to happen every other day now  you know that jeb bush has a singular mission at this point in his campaign  attack donald trump  bush  long considered the establishment favorite to win the republican nomination  has been pushed around by trump since the very first debate with very little success at firing back that s not for a lack of trying  bush  whose natural posture is slumpy and whose speech is frumpy  can t help but look like a bullied kid when he tries to defend himself against trump  his debate performances have been so lackluster he was even scolded publicly by his mommy  who probably wishes she had another dubya right about now  the dumber brother obviously got all of the charisma this latest round of  attack each other and say hillary clinton  a lot   also known as a  debate    saw jeb finally come up with a successful attack against trump  when trump started talking about the government taking private property by eminent domain to construct roads and bridges  jeb fired back with a story about trump s attempt to take the property of an elderly woman in atlantic city by eminent domain so he could provide a nice parking lot for limousines outside one of his casinos jeb had the crowd fired up  finally  an exchange between trump and jeb was going his way  that is until trump was offered the opportunity to respond  as trump tried to  make america great  his way out of yet another sordid detail of his past  jeb chimed in  interrupting him mid sentence  only to be shushed by trump  who had already twice asserted that jeb  wanted to be a tough guy  after his shushing of a grown man  which admittedly was a bit hilarious  trump got his share of boos  hitting back hard with  that s all of his supporters and special interests  other than the ridiculously botched introductions  it was the only part of the debate worth watching featured image via screen capture
