just when you thought donald trump s constant stream of offensive comments had died down  he goes and calls for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton to be shot trump s specific advice to his followers was  in the event that clinton wins the election and can choose her own liberal supreme court justices  that they should perhaps shoot her  hillary wants to abolish   essentially abolish the second amendment  if she gets to pick her judges  nothing you can do folks  though the second amendment folks  maybe there is   if a citizen had made a death threat like this against a government official  they would receive criminal charges   and trump should be no different  soon after those shocking words left trump s mouth  the former head of the cia went on cnn to drive the point home that trump should not be given a free pass on this in an interview with jack tapper  retired four star general michael hayden made it perfectly clear that if anyone else had said this about the second amendment  they d be in hot water  hayden said  if someone else had said that outside the hall  he d be in the back of a police wagon now with the secret service questioning him  hayden recalled the advice that he used to give his seniors at the cia  you re not just responsible for what you say  you are responsible for what people hear   then  he tore trump a new one  that was more than a speed bump  that is actually a very arresting comment  it suggests either a very bad taste with reference to political assassination and an attempt at humor or an incredible insensitivity   it maybe the latter   an incredible insensitivity to the prevalence of political assassination inside of american history  that is a topic that we don t ever come close to  even when we think we are trying to be lighthearted  you can watch hayden rip trump apart in the segment below featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
