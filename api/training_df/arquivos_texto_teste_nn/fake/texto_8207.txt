when thinking about the qualities of someone who should be president  it should be someone who embraces the founding principles as mentioned in our founding documents  someone who respects freedom of speech  freedom of and from religion  equality under the law  and so on when thinking about the qualities of senator ted cruz  he doesn t seem to embody much  if any  of those founding principles as they are written  however  he does embody the principles he imagines in his head of what the founders actually meant  he thinks the nation was founded on  judeo christian  principles  and sure  while some of the founders were christian  many were deist and didn t believe in the deification of jesus as mentioned in the christian bible however  cruz  and several of those who seem to believe what they will about the constitution and our founders  will continue to wrongfully tout the line that we re a christian nation  one of those individuals being the texas senator s wife while speaking to south carolina radio host vince coakley  heidi cruz first told us all the qualities that embody her husband  a man of faith  a believer  a constitutionalist  defender of values  and doesn t waver from his beliefs  however  then she goes on and says something that one can only assume is her declaring ted cruz as the second coming of christ  she said  when i thought about doing it for our country  it became very clear to me that our family must be in this race  and it also became clear to me that we are at a cultural crossroads in our country and if we can be in this race to show this country the face of the god that we serve   this christian god that we serve is the foundation of our country  our country was built on judeo christian values  we are a nation of freedom of religion  but the god of christianity is the god of freedom  of individual liberty  of choice and of consequence and i think that s something that this country really needs to be reminded of  is that christians are loving people  are nonjudgmental people  but there is right and wrong  we have a country of law and order  there are consequences to actions and we must all live peaceably in our own faiths under the constitution  and ted is uniquely able to deliver on that combination of the law and religion  ted cruz is going to show us the  face of god    what the heck kind of language is that  and if we don t elect her husband  we re going against god  how about this  let s not use any god as a political prop to garner votes in a flailing campaign  which is exactly what the cruz family seems to be doing oh  and if we re to live in a nation that respects  freedom of religion  that s all religions or lack there of  however  that freedom does not allow any religion to legislate by its religious principles  so while many are terrified of sharia law  which is not allowed  neither is christian law  freedom of religion is the freedom to worship whatever you want on your own time as long as you re not harming others  now  if someone comes into your place of worship and tells you that you can t worship your god  well then that would actually be a violation of your freedom  however  that s not happening  so all this  religious freedom  malarkey is being drummed up to rile up a base of voters that don t know any better  and if she thinks her husband is  nonjudgmental  she must not be listening to the same guy we ve all been subject to hearing for far too long now no  heidi  your husband won t show us the  face of god    he s not the second coming of christ  and he wasn t sent to this earth my means of canada to govern the united states by  judeo christian  principles  you are mistaken listen here to heidi cruz go on and on about her husband featured image  flickr wikimedia
