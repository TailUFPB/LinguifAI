if there s someone who has always stood up for the rights of women  it s hillary clinton  in fact  it s been pretty much her life s work  so  when a robotic  mansplaining candidate like republican sen  marco rubio decided he would throw jabs at clinton and her stance on abortion rights  as well as abortion rights in general  she did not hold back her opinion of the florida senator on abc s  this week  she said  it s really quite sad to see what senator rubio is becoming in this campaign  everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can  i ve been on record for many years about where i stand on abortion  how it should be safe and legal  and i ve had the same position that i ve had for a very long time  but what s really going on here is an effort by the republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn roe v  wade  to defund planned parenthood  to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme it s just so unfortunate that politicians like senator rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of concerns and i don t think he should be allowed to get away with that  rubio had stated that clinton would support abortion  even on the due date of that unborn child  during saturday night s gop debate while appearing on cbs  face the nation  clinton reiterated her disgust in his comments  saying  i think it s pretty pathetic  this is something that illustrates how senator rubio has just been going as far as he can to try to  i guess  buttress his credentials with certain parts of the republican constituency  i ve been on record for years about where i stand on making abortions safe and legal  the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into  and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions  decisions rubio  sans uterus  will never have to face it s disgusting that women and their reproductive rights are politicized each and every election cycle  because it s pretty much they only social issue the gop has left to get people to the polls  especially now that marriage equality is law of the land what a woman does with her body is her decision  and her decision alone  no ifs  ands or buts about it  and unless these republican men are cool with restrictions for their bodies as well  they better stfu hillary clinton calls rubio s comments on her abortion stance  pathetic    an attempt to  buttress his credentials  https   t co   face the nation   facethenation  february    featured image  cbs news
