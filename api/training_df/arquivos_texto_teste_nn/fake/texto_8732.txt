they say karma s a bi ch  and it continues to be for the republicans  first  it was rubio who was dragged off to court by the birthers who claim that he s not eligible to be president  now  birthers have gone after ted cruz in texas a texas attorney has filed suit in federal district court saying that cruz can t be president because he s not a  natural born citizen  of the united states  cruz was born in canada  one of the few requirements to become president in the u s  constitution is to be a  natural born citizen  of the united states  attorney newton b  schwartz  sr   in a  page complaint  is demanding that the u s  supreme court address the issue since  natural born  has never been defined  schwartz said   this  year question has never been pled  presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the u s  supreme court  only the u s  supreme court can finally decide  determine judicially and settle this issue now  cruz  who ironically is an anti immigration hawk  believes there is no issue  during thursday s debate  cruz went on the defensive against trump  who s been at the forefront of questioning cruz s eligibility  cruz said   there s nothing to this birther issue  since september  the constitution hasn t changed  but the poll numbers have  i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa  but the facts and the law are really clear  under longstanding u s  law  the child of a u s  citizen abroad is a natural born citizen  not so simple says respected constitutional lawyer mary brigid mcmanamon at widener university s delaware law school  the constitution provides that  no person except a natural born citizen       shall be eligible to the office of president   the concept of  natural born  comes from common law  and it is that law the supreme court has said we must turn to for the concept s definition  on this subject  common law is clear and unambiguous  the  century english jurist william blackstone  the preeminent authority on it  declared natural born citizens are  such as are born within the dominions of the crown of england  while aliens are  such as are born out of it   the key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one s country of birth  the americans who drafted the constitution adopted this principle for the united states  james madison  known as the  father of the constitution   stated   it is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance         place is the most certain criterion  it is what applies in the united states   based on this interpretation  cruz is disqualified  the irony in all this is that cruz supports denying citizenship to children born in the united states  but whose parents are not us citizens is it karma that the republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency   throughout president obama s seven years in the white house  many republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the united states  in fact  they propagated the idea so much that   of republicans believe this nonsense today the birther movement  which consists of many republicans  has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years  now  that same movement is after the very same institution  the republican party  that propagated it in the first place featured image via nation of change
