on tuesday  the new york state assembly passed a bill that legalized mixed martial arts  mma   but it was the debate leading up to the passage of the bill that got the most attention  state lawmakers compared the sport to slavery and gay porn  the claims were so outrageous that former ufc middleweight champion chris weidman said he was  embarrassed for them  new york is currently the only state that bans the popular mma sport and this was the first time the state assembly has ever brought it to a vote  despite the fact that the senate has passed it seven years in a row  so when lawmakers finally passed the bill  it was a big deal  unfortunately  it was overshadowed by a whole lot of stupidity during the debate sadly one of the most mindblowing comments came from a democrat  i thought i should learn a little bit about  mma    said assemblyman daniel o donnell  d manhattan   who is gay   well  i should really like it  you have two nearly naked  hot men trying to dominate each other  that s gay porn with a different ending  i m going to assume that o donnell  the brother of actress comedian rosie o donnell  was trying to channel his sister and be funny with his dissenting opinion  but he failed miserably  he wasn t the only lawmaker to make a crazy comparison  assemblyman charles barron said it was like slavery and police violence  you know how we feel about the chokehold in new york city  you can put him in a chokehold and the ref has to be determining whether he got choked enough or she got choked enough  this  sport  is not something we should legalize or regulate  that s taking it a little far  mma fighters know exactly what their sport is about   eric garner  however  did not expect the nypd to choke him to death when he sold loose cigarettes  comparing a sport to systematic police abuse is outrageous and offensive when asked about the lawmakers  comparisons  chris weidman said  some of the things they were saying were so ridiculous that i was actually happy and embarrassed for them for even bringing it up  it s things i ve heard people behind closed doors might be saying  but to hear them say it live and to the public  i actually thought it was pretty interesting   and probably good for us  i just thought it was embarrassing on their part  i have to agree with him  the lawmakers sounded ridiculous  we expect republicans to make outlandish claims when they are arguing against something  but when democrats do it  it s even more embarrassing  we are smarter than that and frankly  they should both apologize for their crass remarks featured image via steve marcus getty images
