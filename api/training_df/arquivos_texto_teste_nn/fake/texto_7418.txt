although i disagree with bill maher that donald trump is not a clown  a conman  or a klansman  i do think he has a point when he describes trump as a five year old child  maher said  what donald trump really reminds me of is a spoiled five year old throwing a tantrum  he is the grown up version of every pain in the ass kid who ever sat behind you on a plane kicking the back of your seat  while the parents did nothing    little logan  is just exploring  no   little logan  is being a d ck and if you won t shove him in the overhead bin  i will  here s the video   there s no doubt that trump reminds you of such a d ick and it seems that his voters are his enablers  tolerating condoning  and even applauding many of his crazy antics  trump s rise  maher argued  was not fueled by racism or xenophobia  but by what he called  the self esteem movement   as proof  maher played a montage of clips showing trump saying how he s the best at many things  he said  like they say on reality shows  the most important thing is just  you doing you   but what if you is a big a shole  maher said the real reason trump wants to be president is not to help america but so he can be called president  whatever the cause may be to his rise  it s important that the american people say no to this clown come november  featured image via video screenshot
