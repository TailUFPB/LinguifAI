it s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious  life threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important  so when fox business host john stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend  he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes the weekend segment was called  campus rape hysteria   and stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable  stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience  stossel said  colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex  california s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity  that means  i guess  a woman must repeatedly say   yes  please proceed   i doubt many college students do that  but it is the law  to get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get  stossel and his friends at fox created a check list type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be fox news screenshotwhen stossel showed his form to college students  most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the fox host visibly disappointed that america s youth actually had morals and respect for women  he said  the kids must laugh at it  i can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent  yet many students voiced the exact opposite  one male student said on the show  something needs to be done  i m not sure this is the right way  but i think women need more protection  you can watch the segment below featured image is a screenshot
