while discussing donald trump on abc s the view  the ladies all had very strong opinions about donald trump  and to be honest  none of them are good  and with good reason they discussed his blatant racism to the tragedy that unfolded at pulse nightclub in orlando  florida  they also discussed trump s horrific rhetoric surrounding the event  and how he wrongfully went after president obama joy behar then interjects with a question that should make everyone think long and hard about trump s use of language  do you think that because he is the  recruiter in chief   and by his words he s getting more people to go on the side of isis  that he could be considered treasonous  it was then that an audible gasp can be heard from the crowd  either from those in agreement  or those stunned that she would say such a thing  but here s the thing   she s not wrong trump s vile rhetoric is being used in recruitment videos by isis  so not only is he not cut out to be commander in chief  but his remarks are actually being used in an upsurge in violence against the very nation he wishes to lead treason  by definition  is the crime of betraying one s country  and by aiding isis with his language  he could be considered doing just that so  joy  very good question watch the ladies of the view go after trump here our co hosts react to donald trump s proposed immigration ban post orlando shooting  https   t co   the view   theview  june    image via video screen capture
