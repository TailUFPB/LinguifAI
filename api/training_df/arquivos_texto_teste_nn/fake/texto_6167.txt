rep  louie gohmert is perhaps america s most troubled congressperson  vehemently anti gay  the representative from texas has often made headlines for his nonsensical speeches  all of them were put to shame when gohmert walked up to the podium on may  and began speaking about asteroids  matt damon and gay astronauts while on the floor of the house  gohmert launched into a nearly hour long diatribe against obama s recent efforts to stop anti gay discrimination  having just killed his own party s energy and water spending bill because republicans noticed it might help lgbt people  gohmert was unhinged claiming homosexuality and transexuality were  perverse  mental disorders  gohmert decided to  prove  his point by offering up a thought experiment  it is a very dumb thought experiment i really wonder how many people who had the ultimate power to decide whether humanity would go forward or not  whether it was an asteroid coming  something that would end humanity on earth as dinosaurs were ended at one time  okay  we ve got a spaceship that can go as matt damon did in that movie  plant a colony somewhere we can have humans survive this terrible disaster if you could decide what  people you put on the spacecraft that would save humanity  how many of those would be same sex couples in fairness  we do need to give gohmert credit for acknowledging that the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid and not because noah couldn t fit them on his ark  sadly  the rest of his conjecture is stunningly stupid the premise that gay people shouldn t be given equal rights because they couldn t make babies in space is faulty for a number of reasons  but here are just a few gohmert s homophobic rant is quite possibly so idiotic that it isn t even offensive  watching a grown man base his hateful ideology on misunderstanding the point of a matt damon movie is profoundly sad  it begs the question   what are other republicans sitting in the house thinking   just knowing that your political views align roughly with that of a bonafide moron like louie gohmert is enough to give even the most hardened conservative pause  surely of course  there are dumb people of every political stripe  but there s only one louie gohmert and he s a proud republican   and that kind of says it all watch gohmert s insane rant below featured image via cspan
