appearing on face the nation this past sunday  hillary clinton was posed a question by host john dickerson surrounding voters and how many want what they want  even when it comes to their candidate of choice  dickerson insinuated that hillary may be trying to get bernie sanders out of the race  however  when it comes down to who is going to win the nomination  many voters are undoubtedly going to be disappointed  because their candidate was not the one chosen  yet  those voters will still have a voice  a voice that needs to be heard  and a message that needs to be spread far and wide hillary s response was honest  clear  to the point  and one that needs to be heard by every progressive everywhere who doesn t want to see the nation fall into the hands of donald trump  she said  i m three million votes ahead of senator sanders  nearly  pledged delegates ahead of him  he has to make his own mind up but i was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure donald trump doesn t become president  and i want to unify the party  i see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party  to move into not just november to win the election against donald trump  but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and i share we both want to raise the minimum wage  we both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on wall street and in corporate america to make sure they don t wreck main street  we have a lot of the same goals  and i hope we can unify around them  and she s absolutely correct  while the means to achieve some of the goals are different  the goals  nonetheless  are pretty much the same  while bernie wants to overhaul health care and education in one fell swoop  hillary wants the same things  but done over time  it s all about unifying behind the message and making sure we get there somehow  because if donald trump is to become president  or we can t manage to turn congress blue again  honestly  it won t really matter who is president  everything that needs to get done would be virtually impossible  see also  president barack obama with republican congress  no matter who the democratic candidate for president is  it s time to unite behind them with the common goal of progress for the greater good  not just the few on top  let s do this  progressives watch the whole segment from face the nation here featured photo by scott olson getty images
