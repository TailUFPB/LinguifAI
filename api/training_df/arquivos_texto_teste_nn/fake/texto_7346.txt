it s long been said that the  war on drugs  is a fiction created by certain interests in society  in order to attack particular segments of the american population  there s been plausible deniability for a while  but now the truth is revealed by someone who was there when it was engineered harper s ran a piece written by dan baum  who was writing in support of drug legalization  in which a very honest and completely damning quote was given by former nixon policy advisor john ehrlichman  the quote will give even the most ardent anti drug naysayers pause when they realize that the whole  war on drugs  that they ve completely bought into is a total lie the quote is below at the time  i was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition  i started to ask ehrlichman a series of earnest  wonky questions that he impatiently waved away   you want to know what this was really all about   he asked with the bluntness of a man who  after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison  had little left to protect   the nixon campaign in   and the nixon white house after that  had two enemies  the antiwar left and black people  you understand what i m saying  we knew we couldn t make it illegal to be either against the war or black  but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin  and then criminalizing both heavily  we could disrupt those communities  we could arrest their leaders  raid their homes  break up their meetings  and vilify them night after night on the evening news  did we know we were lying about the drugs  of course we did  i must have looked shocked  ehrlichman just shrugged  then he looked at his watch  handed me a signed copy of his steamy spy novel  the company  and led me to the door source  jezebelthis false war has been carried on for decades by subsequent presidents  as a useful tool to continue suppressing anti establishment segments of society  just look at ronald reagan s crack  epidemic   former cia officials have come forth to admit the drug was funneled into black neighborhoods as a form of social sabotage  it also provided an excuse for brutal over policing and mass incarceration of a majority of their young people for a growing profitable prison industrial complex baum also goes on to explain a huge reason why republicans are so strongly against the legalization of marijuana  despite its obvious success the citizens of the u s  jurisdictions that legalized marijuana may have set in motion more machinery than most of them had imagined   without marijuana prohibition  the government can t sustain the drug war   ira glasser  who ran the american civil liberties union from  to   told me   without marijuana  the use of drugs is negligible  and you can t justify the law enforcement and prison spending on the other drugs  their use is vanishingly small  i always thought that if you could cut the marijuana head off the beast  the drug war couldn t be sustained  source  jezebelwith the legalization of marijuana  a process has been started in america that would bring an end to a long used secret nixonian tool that was used for decades to attack liberal progressive and minority communities  this is exactly why republicans are so strongly against it  it s time for this secret war on america by the right wing to come to a permanent end featured image via flickr
