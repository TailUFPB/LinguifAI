it s still hard to conceive that donald trump is the presumptive nominee of the republican party and  although in the past the gop has produced bad candidates   like george w  bush   capable of doing serious damage to the country  a trump presidency could certainly finish the disastrous job bush started president obama has tried to fix the damage bush and the gop caused america and he will be leaving with a stronger country than when he came into office  no one knows more than president obama what had to be done to fix the economic  social  and political damage bush caused the american people  no one knows more than president obama that the most powerful and critical position in the world is no laughing matter  that s why the president s statement about trumps  presumptive nomination came with a warning  the president said  i think it s important for us to take seriously the statements he s made in the past  but most importantly  and i speak to all of you in this room as reporters as well as the american public  i just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job  obama went on to add  this is not entertainment  this is not a reality show  this is a contest for the presidency of the united states  and what that means is that every candidate  every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny  while many in the media and the public have found trump s antics entertaining  the joke will be on all of us if this man  who many never believed would get this far  becomes president  it s important that america goes out and votes this november  we can t go back to the bush years of war and recession watch video here featured image via video screenshot
