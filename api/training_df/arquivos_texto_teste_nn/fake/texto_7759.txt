the republican party cannot  in good faith  agree that they are still the  party of lincoln   because as president lincoln worked tirelessly to end slavery and reunite the nation  our modern day gop seeks to divide and is openly racist in yet another example of how modern day republicans are nothing like that of lincoln  senator mike rounds  r sd  has now said that he would back donald trump even if his comments regarding the ku klux klan were intentional  he s openly admitting that he would back a kkk loving presidential candidate over any democrat here are his comments in full regarding what trump had to say about the kkk  i think it s an unfortunate response  a very unfortunate response  like i say  i ve met mr  trump once  it was a businesslike discussion and i walked away thinking he s been doing a great job as a showman out here and he s brought a lot of people into this thing  there was a side of him that i did not see when i visited with him personally my choice would still be   honestly  i m still leaning to marco rubio  as i suspect there are others  are  but nonetheless  our critical issue is fixing things in the united states  and you can t do that if you ve got bernie or hillary  because they have a differing point of view about what s right and what s wrong with this country and there are some things wrong with this country   is very clear within  years   the  birthday of our country      percent of all the revenues we collect will go to two categories  interest on the federal debt and mandatory payments on entitlements  you can t fix that unless you ve got a team in here agreed that you re focused on it  and i just don t think democrats are going to do that  i think it has to be a republican even if you re disappointed with the way he s responding to things  even if you re mad at him  you disagree with him  if he did it intentionally   i don t think he did  i think he just made a mistake   even if he did  they re still going to do a better job with him there than if you had hillary or bernie in his place  rounds told reporter todd zwillich that trump would boost voter turnout and at the end of the day  if he is the nominee  then will he bring more people out or won t he  you can call it transactional  but it s factual  trying to mend fences  because he is one of the few people in a position to do so  speaker paul ryan  r wi  condemned trump s remarks  he said  when i see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and as a country  i will speak up  so today i want to be very clear about something  if a person wants to be the nominee of the republican party  there can be no evasion and no games  they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry  this party does not prey on people s prejudices  we appeal to their highest ideals  this is the party of lincoln  this is fundamental  and if someone wants to be our nominee  they must understand this  i hope this is the last time i need to speak out on this race  it seems ryan is in deep denial of not only his own party  but of the base of voters that continuously votes republican  as much as he wants to say the gop is still the  party of lincoln   they re not  that s been evident since the big party shift of the early  century when the south slowly went from democrats to dixiecrats to republicans  and the northern states went from republican to democrat  if lincoln were around today  he d denounce the modern day gop and unquestionably back the democratic nominee  that s a fact featured image  wikimedia commons
