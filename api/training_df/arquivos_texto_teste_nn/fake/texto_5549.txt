whether you realize it or not  the second amendment only applies to white people  while open carrying firearms is dangerous and stupid  mark hughes decided to bring his gun to a protest in dallas   something that is legal under current laws in texas and that made him a convenient target for police when other people began shooting almost as soon as bullets started flying  hughes  photo was blasted all over social media  as of now  his photo is still up on the dallas police department s twitter timeline as a  suspect   as soon as he learned that police were attempting to scapegoat him  hughes did something we typically don t see from open carriers  he located officers  turned himself and his weapon in  and cleared the situation up  unless  of course  you happen to be looking at dpd s twitter   but while he did everything correctly  besides  of course  bringing a gun to a peaceful protest in the first place   hughes was put through hell at the police department officers told their target that they had evidence linking him to the shootings of five police officers  after he was released from custody  he told cbsdfw  i just got out of an interrogation room for about  minutes  where police officers were lying  saying they had video of me shooting a gun  which is a lie  saying that they had witnesses saying i had shot a gun  which is a lie  at the end of the day  the system was trying to get me  hughes says that police have not once bothered to apologize to him for dragging his name through the mud and that he has received non stop death threats since his photo was released with the  suspect  label man wrongly labeled as person of interest in  dallaspoliceshooting  i can t believe it i can t believe it   via ktvt pic twitter com   dr  seema yasmin   doctoryasmin  july    might seem shocking  even unthinkable that police lied to him in an effort to coerce a confession  but that s perfectly legal  while it is a crime for you to lie to police  attorney chris burney writes in a blog post discussing myths related to criminal law cops are allowed to lie about anything let s repeat that  the police are allowed to lie to you  about anything the most common example of this is police interrogation   the cops are allowed to use any deception they like  in order to get a confession for example  they can tell you your partner s being interrogated upstairs  and just confessed  so you d better come clean if you know what s good for you  when they haven t even arrested your partner yet    they can say the victim told them you did it before she died  when she s actually still alive  and never said anything of the sort  the biggest lie  and one that works all the time  is that this conversation is strictly off the record    just between you and me   nothing you ever say to a police officer is ever off the record   if it can be used against you  it will the second biggest lie  also one that works all the time  is that  if you come clean  the officer will make sure you get treated leniently   he ll make sure the da gives you a lighter charge   he ll put in a word with the judge to make sure you get off with a lighter sentence   he ll only arrest you for the misdemeanor   complete horseshit  of course   that cop s going to make sure you go down for whatever it is you just confessed to   but it works all the time   people cut their losses  seeing themselves in a hopeless situation  and grasp at the opportunity to at least minimize the bad oh  and if you think innocent people don t do that too  then you ve got another think coming   innocent people do confess to crimes they didn t commit  for a variety of reasons    that s a subject for a whole nother myth    and lying cops is one of the big ones and the cops are completely within their rights to lie this way   unlike prosecutors and judges  who have professional ethics to comply with  the police are allowed to use whatever lawful tools they have in order to solve a crime   it s not against the law for them to lie   they re allowed to and so they will   they re trained to do it   they re supposed to do it   they re gonna do it in this case  police were hoping to wrap things up quickly with a confession from an innocent man  fortunately  it didn t work this time featured image via screengrab
