it s hard to believe that racism is still a key issue in a city with one of the highest african american populations in america  but that wasn t the case in philadelphia on new year s day  when white people dressed up in brownface for the city s annual mummers parade and insulted  blacklivesmatter protesters with racial slurs   while trying to argue that the parade wasn t racist the mummers parade has been a new year s day tradition in philadelphia where mummers  amateur actors philadelphia citizens  dress up in extravagant costumes and perform throughout the city  as part of the costumes  it used to be common practice for the actors to wear blackface but this was curbed in  after the naacp and supporting protesters pressured the city to have it removed from the parade  blackface was never officially sanctioned  so it still occurs despite the fact that blackface is now commonly regarded as racist  in response  the philly coalition for real justice decided to schedule a rally during this year s mummers parade in protest coverage of the rally ended up exposing not only rampant racism  but misogyny  along with the brownface  there were many men dressed up as  wenches  and some people even mocked the  blacklivesmatter movement by carrying signs that said wench lives matter    pirate lives matter  and  shark lives matter   which bared some resemblance to kkk attire  when parade participants heard of the philly coalition for real justice rally  they began flooding the group s mummers parade justice rally s facebook event page to convince america that the mummers day parade wasn t racist   and ironically showed an impressive amount of white privilege and n bombs it should be mentioned that  blacklivesmatter wasn t even the sole purpose of the rally   it was just one of many issues that protesters had with the mummers parade  and the rally s intention was not to shut the mummers parade down  the justice rally s page wrote  bring your signs  banners and noise makers to the mummers parade and let s represent for the issues that matter to our communities  our goal is to pack the stands and the parade route around city hall with people representing for  blacklivesmatter in a city   black  funding public schools  fighting for a   minimum wage  dumping trump  immigration rights and explosive oil trains  not one mention of shutting the parade down  just the innocent intention of improving the lives of philadelphians  here are some of the horrendously racist  vile things people posted on the justice rally s event page in response  so improving philadelphia is something to condemn  and yet behavior like what happened in the below facebook post is perfectly acceptable at the mummers parade if that had been a group of drunk black people p ssing on homeless people  this would have never been accepted  fortunately  there were also many people who recognized that the mummers parade does have a racist past and that racism and misogyny don t belong in such a widely celebrated parade     hopefully  will be the year that the more offensive traits of the parade get squashed featured image via joshua scott albert twitter
