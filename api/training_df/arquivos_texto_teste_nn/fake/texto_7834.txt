it looks like justice antonin scalia s untimely death is not just causes republicans to lose their minds in fear  a giant corporation embroiled in a class action lawsuit is just as scared  in fact  they are so afraid of the possibility of a split or liberal supreme court that they have settled their lawsuit for almost a billion dollars dow chemical was set to go in front of the scotus after a  ruling by a kansas court upheld a massive    billion judgement against the company for price fixing  the company sued and found liable after being accused of colluding with four other chemical companies  bayer ag  basf se  huntsman international llc and lyondell chemical co   to fix the prices of polyether polyol products   which are used to make urethane foam   in order to overcharge customers in the   and early  the company was counting on scalia to rule in their favor and overturn the huge judgement  but then he died  his death meant that one of two things would happen    they d go in front of  justices and get a split decision which would uphold the    billion ruling  or    they would face a liberal court if obama gets someone on the court and the judgement would also be upheld  when they realized that they were screwed they issued a statement announcing they d settled and blamed it on scalia s death the dow chemical company  nyse  dow  has entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the in re urethanes class action litigation  in this settlement agreement  dow has agreed to pay the plaintiff class   million growing political uncertainties due to recent events within the supreme court and increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits have changed dow s risk assessment of the situation  dow believes this settlement is the right decision for the company and our shareholders translation  scalia died and f cked us over  so now we are being forced to pay   million to all of the people we hurt scalia s death didn t just hurt dow though  there are a number of other huge corporations set to go in front of the court  including microsoft and tyson foods what s actually really infuriating about this is that dow was so sure that they were going to win this case until scalia croaked  this guy was such a corporate shill  as are the rest of the conservative members  that big companies who had judgements levied against them were happy to go in front of the court because they knew they d win so  while this sudden settlement may be hilarious  it is also pretty damning  it really highlights how much the conservative supreme court has hurt average americans in order to help big business featured image via wikipedia
