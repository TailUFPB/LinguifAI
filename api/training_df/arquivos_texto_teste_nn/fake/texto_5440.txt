following the tragic shooting of several police officers in baton rouge  louisiana earlier today that left three officers dead and three more injured  republican presidential candidate donald trump took the tragedy as an opportunity to bash president barack obama and make a pathetic attempt to convince america that things like this wouldn t happen under his watch in a post on facebook  trump wrote  we grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today  how many law enforcement and people have to die because of a lack of leadership in our country  we demand law and order  it s now becoming a trend for trump to exploit crimes against law enforcement to make himself look better to his racist tribe  he purposefully mentioned  law and order  in this facebook post because after the dallas attack  which left several police officers dead and many more injured  trump called himself the  law and order candidate  in a speech addressing the dallas attack  trump had said  we must maintain law and order at the highest level  or we will cease to have a country     we will cease to have a country  i am the law and order candidate  hillary clinton  on the other hand  is weak  ineffective  pandering  and as proven by her recent e mail scandal  which was an embarrassment  not only to her  but to the entire nation as a whole  she s either a liar or grossly incompetent  one or the other  very simple  following the baton rouge shooting  trump also took to twitter to vent and once again complained about how  divided  and  out of control  our country is  without considering how his hateful rhetoric and intolerant  racist values might be contributing to it  twitterthis shooting is the second nationally reported shooting in baton rouge this month  following the injustice of police brutality victim alton sterling  whose death inspired the shooting of police officers in dallas  it s clear that the ongoing tension between law enforcement and the african american community is growing after these incidents  however to exploit these tragedies and use them to bash obama is disgusting  if trump would shut up and do his research for once  he would know that cops have never been safer than while obama has been serving as president of the united states  and that the president is doing everything he can to keep our nation safe twitterfeatured image is a screenshot
