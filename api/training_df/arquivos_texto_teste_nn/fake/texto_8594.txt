since the september    attacks  the united states has been fraught with islamophobia  but the  republican presidential candidates  coupled with the recent daesh  isis isil  attacks and the san bernardino shooting  the hate has reached a fever pitch  in response to the rising tide of bigotry  a group of young filmmakers in tampa  florida called  peace house  have started fighting back with humor instead of anger ahmad hussan and nick amaro said that in the days following the arrest of ahmed  the clock boy  in texas  they decided to go into their studio and make a parody about the incident  their video shows a frightened uncle calling the police because his nephew is holding a clock  their brilliant mockery of the incident got nearly eight million views hussan told fox  news that they want to expose the  ridiculousness  of people s anti muslim sentiments  when you are laughing at something  you are kind of exposing it for its ridiculousness  and when someone refers to me  just because of my faith  as a terrorist  that is ridiculous  in addition to the clock video  the filmmakers have made a video that showcases ignorant family members sitting around a table during the holidays  they called it  happy hatesgiving   they also took on ben carson s comments that compared syrian refugees to rabid dogs  and in another they interviewed people for jobs with isis  we are making things that are funny   amaro explained   but ultimately  the goal is to make you think deeply about something  to help you understand an issue from a different point of view  the fact is  the gop field has used people of the islamic faith as punching bags for more than a decade  what s worse is that their constant fear mongering has put targets on the backs of innocent people who want nothing more than to live peacefully like the rest of us  it s nice to know that this group can laugh about it  but in reality they shouldn t have to  in  there is no excuse for the rampant ignorance that is so prevalent on the right featured image  video screenshot
