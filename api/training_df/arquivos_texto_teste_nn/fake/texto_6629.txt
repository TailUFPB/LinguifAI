for a party so terribly interested in governing this country  republicans sure do lack the basic knowledge about how governing actually works  one of the latest examples of this is ted cruz and his choice to pick a vice presidential running mate at this stage in the process  in an incredibly rare case of factual reporting  fox news explained in detail exactly why cruz completely screwed up by doing this in the video below cruz made a huge deal out of the fact he picked a vp  he had a press conference just to announce it  signs were made  people were cheering and then it turned out to be   carly fiorina  her low popularity makes her a strange choice  but when you re ted cruz it s very likely you can t get a lot of the more popular people to hang out with you unpopularity aside  cruz s pick of a vp is actually pretty ignorant for another reason   and this has nothing to do with carly the wicked stepmother  there s virtually no chance that ted cruz will get the nomination outright  he would come up about  delegates short  even if he won every single one of them from here on out  this means that if trump doesn t win outright  which he still can   the only hope cruz has is a contested convention that s where things completely go wrong for cruz  convention rules clearly state that a nominee cannot pick their own vp in a contested convention  the vp pick is up to the delegates  and if one were to make an educated guess  carly fiorina would not make the cut carly fiorina s popularity is non existent  her entire campaign only lasted for two states  and then she was out  convention delegates are extremely unlikely to pick a vp who they feel would be damaging to the party s chances of winning in november  so  this begs the question  did ted even bother to read up on the rules of how you run a campaign for the presidency  imagine his embarrassment after all the hoopla surrounding his pick  only to have her booted at the rnc watch fox news explain how ted cruz has no clue how running for president works featured image via scott olson getty images
