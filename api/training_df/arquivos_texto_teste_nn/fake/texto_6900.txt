on wednesday  democratic presidential candidate and front runner hillary clinton released a clear and very detailed plan for dealing with the epidemic of lead and toxic waste poisoning that is affecting millions of americans  many of them poor and or minorities exposure to pesticides and chemicals has been linked to childhood cancer  and the likelihood of such exposure can depend on where children live  for example  in the manchester neighborhood of houston  which is  percent latino and where  schools are within one mile of a high risk chemical facility  children who attend public schools are  percent more likely to get leukemia than those who live  miles away simply put  this is environmental racism  and the impacts of climate change  from more severe storms to longer heat waves to rising sea levels  will disproportionately affect low income and minority communities  which suffer the worst losses during extreme weather and have the fewest resources to prepare undoubtedly  this will be sneered at as pandering but since clinton s strongest supporters are  in fact  minorities and the poor  the word  constituents  seems more appropriate the title of the blueprint is hillary clinton s plan to fight for environmental and climate justice  and contains several concrete steps that are guaranteed to leave corporate polluters foaming at the mouth here  clinton cites the man made disaster unfolding at flint  michigan in which  insanely  no one broke any existing laws  a judge giving polluters in west virginia a slap on the wrist and donald blankenship receiving only  year of jail for killing  miners by ignoring safety regulations  each example is a case of the system coddling corporate criminals and throwing the public s health and safety under the bus here s the solution clinton will work with congress to update our environmental  public health  and safety laws by enhancing the criminal provisions of the safe drinking water act  adding criminal provisions to the lead disclosure rule  improving the lead inspection standards of the renovation  repair and painting rule  and increasing the penalties for violations of the mine safety and health act and the occupational safety and health act so that they are felonies that carry the possibility of serious jail time in other words  no more free passes to corporations that poison us to make a little more profit  big government  damn right it is  we formed a government to protect us from the depredations of the rich and powerful  it s about time it started to take that responsibility seriously america has a serious infrastructure problem  specifically  republicans have stopped allowing us to keep our infrastructure from crumbling  why  because infrastructure spending  while vitally important  is also really really good for local economies  you can t outsource replacing old pipes so all of that money spent goes right into the economy instead of the pockets of a few multinational corporations republicans also don t care because rich communities don t suffer from this problem aging and inadequate wastewater systems discharge more than  billion gallons of untreated sewage a year  posing health risks to humans and wildlife  disrupting ecosystems  and disproportionately impacting communities of color  clinton has a   billion plan to invest in modernizing american infrastructure  including drinking and wastewater infrastructure  and will work with states  municipalities  and the private sector to bring our water systems into the  century and ensure that all americans have access to clean  safe drinking water that s   billion to make our drinking water clean again and help the economy at the same time  republicans will fight it but how much more political damage can they take  is blocking clean water for children really a hill to die on flint is not the only place to suffer from lead poisoning and drinking water is not the only way to get it  old schools and buildings still have lead paint  placing children at risk the ongoing tragedy in flint has put a spotlight on the urgency of this crisis  but flint is not alone  more than   children are poisoned by lead in the united states  and children of color are more likely to be poisoned than white children clinton is pledging   billion just in federal spending to deal with this blight  and  again  as a bonus  all of that money spent goes right into the local economy   there s  a lot  more and it s just as well thought out  i encourage you to read the entire thing  it s fantastic  from expanding public transportation to investing heavily in green energy  clinton has developed a comprehensive strategy to dealing with several major issues confronting america  this is the kind of leadership we can expect from someone who s spent a lifetime serving the public and something we can all get behind featured image via getty
