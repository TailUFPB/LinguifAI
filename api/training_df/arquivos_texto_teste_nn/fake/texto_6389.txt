donald trump s tax return  we ve heard about little else over the last few days  voters are asking for them  mitt romney is asking for them  trump initially told us that he wouldn t provide his taxes because the irs is auditing them  well  the irs weighed in on that issue a couple of months ago  and they didn t mince words irs chief john koskinen explained in an interview with c span   the taxpayer controls his returns  there s nothing in an irs audit process generally that would keep you from sharing that information generally  any way you wanted to  koskinen further stated   it would be rare for someone to be audited every year   and that someone would not undergo another audit for a few years   two or three at least   after irs audit the previous year  it would be rare   koskinen stated source  greenville gazettehere s the video even that hasn t stopped trump from sticking to his audit story in interview i told  ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete  not after election   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    friday  though  his words were harsher  telling george stephanopolous that it s  none of  his  business  aside from his supporters  few people are buying the audit story  some are speculating that he might be a lot less wealthy than he says  romney speculates that there might be something a lot more nefarious  like mob connections there s also another possibility  and frankly  it could be a combination of everything  trump is simply pandering to his voters  angry white men hate the irs  the love paved roads and wars and many other things our tax money gives us  but they resent the fact that a percentage of their paychecks are going to the common good  as a matter of fact  trump was one of the only candidates who didn t say he wanted to abolish the irs altogether there s a good reason for that kind of rhetoric  polls show that among republicans  especially tea party republicans  only  percent view the irs in a favorable light  while  percent of democrats do  what could possibly be a better tactic than turning yourself into a victim of the evil feds  for trump voters  nothing featured image by scott olson at getty images
