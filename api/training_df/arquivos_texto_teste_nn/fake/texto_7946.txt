how fanatical is the republican party in   even marco rubio is being painted as an atheist while donald trump maintains a huge lead over his competitors  marco rubio and ted cruz are shooting for second place   and things are getting nastier by the minute  in a particularly egregious   albeit not surprising   bit of mudslinging  cruz s campaign spread an outrageous video they claimed showed rubio telling a cruz campaign staffer that he hated the bible  that s right  marco  i could look a rape victim in the eye and tell them not to have an abortion  rubio hates god  or so cruz s team would have you believe the video  released by the right leaning politics section of the the daily pennsylvania  captures a candid moment between rubio and one of cruz s campaign staffers named christian collins  rubio walks by collins  seated next to cruz s  batshit insane  father  rafael cruz  and reportedly pointed to a bible collins was reading  telling him  not many answers in it   the daily pennsylvania even helpfully provides captions for this exchange so you can comfortably ignore the fact that this was absolutely not what rubio said many news outlets ran the story without even a hint of skepticism  gawker framed it as marco rubio  trying to talk smack   but if you listen to the audio and ignore what the captions are telling you rubio is saying  the conversation seems much less hostile  in fact  rubio appears to be trying to bond with the cruz staffer over their shared love of the bible listening to just the audio  rubio clearly says  got a good book there  every answer is in there  especially in that one  that interpretation would make sense because marco rubio is a religious fundamentalist who  like many republicans  believes god has ordained him to become president  his stance on things like gay marriage and abortion are derived from his literalist reading of the bible  he really believes that  every answer is in there   the idea that rubio decided to out himself as an atheist to a random cruz staffer and cruz s dad  thereby effectively ending his own campaign  is so ludicrous that only a particularly dim cruz fan would be gullible enough to actually buy it many of them did  some with a splash of anti catholic bigotry despite the logical leaps  cruz s campaign limply tried to spread this rumor as well  why waste the moment  right  it was painful to watch  here s rick tyler  a cruz staffer  tweeting a link to the  rubio hates god  story what better way to shed that stigma of running a dishonest campaign than to push a story that rubio hates the bible  pic twitter com   josh jordan   numbersmuncher  february    immediately  the  higher ups  in the cruz campaign realized this story was a disaster in the making  they were okay when cruz suggested trump would abolish the second amendment  they were okay when cruz told iowans that ben carson had dropped out of the race on the night of the caucus  they were not okay with selling a narrative that marco rubio was an atheist cruz campaign  at the highest levels  tell me that this was a horrible media baited situation  my words   they confirm rubio praised bible   ali a  akbar   ali  february    s campaign has since frantically walked back its initial jabs at rubio  but it s clear that this represents a defining pivot for the race  cruz  already perhaps the most underhanded candidate in modern politics  is just chomping at the bit to pounce on rubio  his closest competitor  he is particularly interested in going after rubio s faith  because cruz s entire candidacy relies on appealing to the christian right  it s only reasonable to suspect cruz will continue to remind his evangelical followers of rubio s catholicism and  if he can get away with it  his  atheism  featured image via youtube screengrab
