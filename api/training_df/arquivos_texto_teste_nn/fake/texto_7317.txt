hillary clinton should file a lawsuit against fox news and rudy giuliani for this lie during an appearance on fox news with bill o reilly  former new york city mayor rudy giuliani blamed hillary clinton and president obama for the rise of isis   and actually had the gall to claim that clinton is a  founding member  of the terrorist organization  if you re talking about doing what she wants to do  which is to rally our forces against isis  you gotta come back to the white house  you gotta sit in the situation room  and you can t leave until you come up with a plan   giuliani said o reilly then whined about president obama not dropping everything to go back to washington once news broke of the terrorist attack on brussels ever since the attack  which killed over  and injured hundreds  conservatives have been unfairly criticizing president obama for not canceling his trip in cuba to hole up in the situation room the problem is that president obama can t really do anything beyond offering condolences and assistance if belgium asks for help  obama offered both in the aftermath of the attack  conservatives have also said president obama should go to belgium  but that would only distract the first responders and police officers from doing their job since security of the president would require lots of preparation and man power giuliani then went off the rails into accusations that are nothing short of slander  she helped create isis   giuliani bellowed  hillary clinton could be considered a founding member of isis  when asked how clinton created isis  giuliani told o reilly that she did so  by being part of an administration that withdrew from iraq  and  by being part of an administration that allowed maliki to run iraq into the ground  o reilly really didn t do much to challenge giuliani either  which is yet another example of the lack of journalistic ethics that he and fox news are known for in the end  giuliani said clinton should have resigned as secretary of state because  that s what a patriot does  here s the video via youtube the fact is  however  that it was president bush who signed the withdrawal of forces agreement with iraq and helped install nouri al maliki as the iraqi prime minister in  and let s not forget that bush ordered the invasion of iraq in the first place  which destabilized the region by removing saddam hussein  a traditional enemy of iran  from power  that alone caused a power vacuum in the region which allowed iran to have more influence in the region while creating the conditions for isis to rise bill o reilly ought to be ashamed of himself for allowing giuliani to make such outrageous claims  and hillary clinton should smack giuliani with a lawsuit because she clearly has a case against him for slander  clinton is not a member of isis and she certainly did not create isis  giuliani  however  is a lying asshole  featured image via  screenshot
