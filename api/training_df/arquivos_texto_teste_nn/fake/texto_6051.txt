it would make sense why trump claimed wages are  too high  as is  and why he supports getting rid of minimum wages standards and hates foreigners a report turned documentary on hbo s vice shows that the trump international golf club in dubai has been recruiting migrants from countries like pakistan  promising them   an hour  but instead paying them just half of that  if a migrant is lucky  they will make only   a month also documented was the inhumane treatment and near enslavement of these migrants  including the confiscation of their passports so they cannot leave  and packing  or more migrants at a time in a small room for hours on end  their rooms  miles outside the city and sitting in the dark desert  are infested with rats  mold and mildew sharing one kitchen for  people  and forced to bathe in troughs  the migrants are forced to relieve themselves where they wash  the bathrooms  as described in the documentary  are not fit for human use promising them standard eight hour shifts with the possibility of two hours overtime and a decent salary  the migrants were interested  but as the documentary shows  non of the promises were delivered and of course donald trump declined to be interviewed  and instead had his organization release a statement saying trump himself has no idea what s going on and that he doesn t take direction action in supervising  hiring  or building of entities he  lends  his name and brand to when asked if they preferred working in dubai or living in pakistan  they responded with the latter with his workers being treated with such little dignity  it s no wonder trump has no problem being a war hungry  xenophobic  racist monster how can he claim to value life when his organization enslaves hard working migrants who just want to have a decent salary here is a clip form the documentary detailing just a sliver of the conditions featured image via spencer platt getty images
