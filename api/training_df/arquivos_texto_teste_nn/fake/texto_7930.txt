thirty years ago  the state of california sentenced kevin cooper to death  in   his life was spared just hours before he was supposed to be executed  but now  more than a decade later  in a matter of weeks   he is once again facing lethal injection and even a federal judge agrees that he may be innocent in   cooper escaped a maximum security prison and was holed up in an abandoned house hiding from authorities  while he was hiding out in the house  two adults and two small children  just a short distance away in the chino hills suburb of los angeles were being murdered  when police found the bodies of douglas and peggy ryen  their  year old daughter jessica  and  year old chris hughes they zeroed in on cooper as the suspect  he was eventually convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that he did not commit the murders there was one survivor  a then  year old josh ryen who had his throat cut and was left for dead  when josh ryen recovered from his injuries  he stated that it was three white or hispanic men that attacked and killed his family and that cooper was not involved  this started a chain of events that reveal a  year cover up and blatant falsification of evidence by police and the prosecutor s office in san bernadino county in addition to the child s statement  which he later changed   there was another suspect  when the ryens were murdered  their station wagon was stolen and witnesses reported that they d seen three men in a vehicle matching its description near the crime  furthermore  the ex wife of a white supremacist  lee furrow  told the police that her ex had come home wearing bloody pants after the murder  she also said that a hatchet was missing from her home  she gave the police the pants and they never tested them for dna  finally  police also found the blood of two other people who did not match cooper or the victims at the crime scene cooper appealed his conviction and although the ninth circuit court upheld the conviction  five federal judges wrote a  page dissent  saying  there is no way to say this politely  the district court failed to provide cooper a fair hearing  the district court impeded and obstructed cooper s attorneys at every turn  he court imposed unreasonable conditions  refused discovery that should have been available as a matter of course  limited testimony that should not have been limited  and found facts unreasonably  based on a truncated and distorted record  public confidence in the proper administration of the death penalty depends on the integrity of the process followed by the state  so far as due process is concerned  twenty four years of flawed proceedings are as good as no proceedings at all  the state of california may be about to execute an innocent man  unfortunately  the supreme court refused to hear the case and that means that his conviction has been upheld  now  cooper is just weeks away from execution  he will be the first person in the state to be executed in the state since  if governor jerry brown does not grant him a stay it is unprecedented to have five federal judges warn that an innocent man may be executed  frankly  in a case like this that should be all that is needed for a new trial  at the very least the death penalty is controversial in this country  it is one of those things that even liberals are split on  but whether you are pro  or anti capital punishment i think we can all agree that if there is the slightest chance that someone may be innocent  the state should not be killing them  and i am saying this to you as a person whose father was violently murdered  governor jerry brown needs to halt this execution  if this man is put to death when there is so much evidence pointing to his innocence  our entire judicial system will be invalidated featured image via save innocents
