bee stings can have an impact ranging from mild swelling to death  depending on if the victim is allergic and the degree of the allergy  on friday  a swarm of africanized honey bees   killer bees   attacked a group of people in phoenix  arizona  stinging more than  unfortunate individuals  normally  a bee attack would not be national news  but it happened to muslims who were worshipping at a mosque  so fox news was all over it the bees descended on the mosque  sending at least one man to the hospital  firefighters fortunately arrived early enough to spray mounds of foam to get the bees under control and prevent further injury   after a bee stings you its stinger falls out and it dies ironic that a group of muslims were just attacked by suicide bees   libertarian larry     april    it s always a bad situation when you re talking about africanized bees  because once one bee creates a pheromone which sends off the other bees to attack   said joseph mikesell with truly nolen  it is unclear what set the bees off  but mikesell warns that if you see bees you should call a professional rather than attempt to deal with a problem yourself  experts say that the attack was unsurprising  as it is the height of  swarm season  the attack left numerous prayer rugs   and pretty much everything else   drenched in foam that members spent an exhorbitant amount of time shoveling out of the mosque with  whatever they could find   fox  s marcy jones  who called the prayer rugs  oriental   reported  she warns people not to wear black  red  or yellow because the bees might  think that you are a bear  and become more aggressive around you it s fortunate that no one was hurt too seriously  but when fox news insider posted this important national story on facebook  readers reacted exactly how one would expect people who have been groomed by stupidville to react   with utter glee some declared this to be god s judgement on the followers of allah  completely ignorant that  allah  is simply arabic for  god  and the two religions actually worship the same deity  others publicly wished that some of the muslims injured in the attack had died  some wanted more bees  the stupid part of america completely outdid themselves as they referenced biblical plagues  because a swarm of bees is totally like a plague of locusts   while others seized upon the opportunity to tell each other how much they hate muslims in short  finding out about this bee attack was the best thing that happened to many conservatives this week                             this is trump s america  folks  the supposed  christian  right is so wrapped up in hate that they are unable to show a shred of compassion when a group of people are attacked by a tiny yet deadly creature   all because they believe their imaginary friend is better than the other  who is actually the same guy watch a report on the attack below featured image via screengrab
