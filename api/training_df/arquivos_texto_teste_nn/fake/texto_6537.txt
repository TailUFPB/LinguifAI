shupee max towing in traveler s rest  south carolina apparently has some rules if you re looking to actually be towed somewhere  at least that s what cassy mcwade found out when she was in an accident and her family called for a tow  her regular mechanic wasn t available  so they called ken shupe  who arrived on the scene in about an hour mcwade  most likely relieved to see the car being cared for and the incident behind her  was stunned when shupe came around the car  told her he couldn t help her because of who she supports  got in his truck and drove away  yes  that just happened  according to wlos news   he goes around back and comes back and says  i can t tow you   my first instinct was there must be something wrong with the car  and he says   no  you re a bernie supporter   and i was like wait  really  and he says   yes ma am   and just walks away  this bernie sign and a message from the lord were all ken shupe needed to be an ignorant jerk   screen captureshupe claims it was a moment of clarity  he says he thinks the lord came to him and told him to get in his truck and leave  with his backwards thinking head held high and his ignorance on his sleeve  this idiot left a disabled woman sitting on the sidewalk  mcwade    suffers from fibromyalgia  chronic fatigue syndrome  psoriatic arthritis and early onset crohn s  all of which she said made the waiting by the side of the road with no restroom nearby  terrifying   mcwade told wlos  i personally don t believe that you don t have to agree on anything just to be kind to one another  i was like  what did i do to you  you know  i do believe i try to do right by people  so i was offended  and i don t know what exactly he thinks i would have done to him directly by being a believer in bernie  shupe s claims that it was all about his convictions and a message from god came crashing down when he got to the real reason he doesn t want to do business with bernie supporters  i ve had some horrible experiences in the last six months with towing cars for this mindset individuals  in that i don t get paid  they want to argue about a   tow bill  and it turns into just a drama and a fuss  and i said  you know  i m not going to associate with them  and i m not going to do any business with them  i m really not interested in doing business with that clientele  in other words   i believe bernie supporters are socialist commies who want stuff for free because internet memes tell me so  so my ignorant self just wasted a bunch a gas and made myself look like an imbecile in public   it would be highly doubtful that anyone could corroborate this guy s stories about all of his terrible misdealings with bernie supporters  should have stuck with god  at least the zealots will give you gofundme money watch the report from wlos below featured image via screen capture
