another conservative  christian  hypocrite gets exposed and you ll enjoy the hilarious twist at the end a female parishioner at the orlando baptist church in florida forced pastor david janney to step down in disgrace after she revealed through a lawsuit that he had an affair with her and promised her hush money to stay quiet about it in   janney made sexual advances toward arlene miranda  a church member since   and sent her text messages professing his fantasies about her  in september of that year  janney and miranda had sex at the offices of his charity world hope  inc afterward  he sent this text regretting that there wasn t a better time or place for their affair and told her that he needed to talk with god and work things out  you re beautiful  you re very sexy  your body is amazing and you re very passionate   the married  year old pastor wrote   i wish we had a better place and a better time for today  you re more than i fantasized  be proud of yourself  md now please give me a few days to work through my mind my heart and talk to my lord  more than anything i want to be the man of god and your pastor  janney later told miranda to stop texting him out of fear that his wife might catch him  to which miranda asked if she was just a one night stand  i have tried to help you with your feelings   he replied as if she s to blame for the situation   i do not have the ability to deal with your feelings all the time  you have to get a handle on this  according to the lawsuit  miranda sought council from another pastor at the church  who also seemed to fault her for the affair  miranda was told she has a  religious duty  to the church and should remain silent to protect janney once he learned that the person in this affair was david janney  pastor don told plaintiff that she had a religious duty to protect defendant  the church  and the orlando baptist church community by keeping the affair quiet and silently repenting and praying this all led up to church officials arranging to pay miranda for her silence  but once it became clear that they were all lying to her just to cover their own asses  she filed a lawsuit the church  of course  would rather pretend the affair never took place and released a bullshit statement on janney s resignation where they stress that him stepping down has nothing to do with the allegations  pastor dave janney resigned as the senior pastor effective sunday  february     not because the allegations against him are true  but because he felt his resignation was in the best interest of the church  orlando baptist church is saddened by the resignation of pastor dave janney  he leaves with our love and support  as a church we desire to extend grace and love to all  in all that we do  the church will be forming a pulpit committee that will lead in the process of selecting a new pastor  ultimately our church members will be able to ask questions of  and vote for  any new pastor  in other words  let s not hold the so called  man of god  accountable for his actions even though they go against everything he preaches here s a report of the lawsuit via wftv hilariously enough  pastor janney is the same pastor janney who participated in a campaign call for mitt romney in  with a group of conservative  christians  who blasted newt gingrich for his  moral failures   you know  because gingrich had a history of cheating on his wives and then leaving them for the other woman   when i look at his life i m not concerned about being embarrassed or distracted by his personal issues   janney said when he explained his support of romney over gingrich three years before inducting himself into the hypocritical christian hall of fame gingrich must be laughing his ass off right about now  featured image  wikimedia
