republicans are trying so hard not to expose themselves as the racists they truly are  now that their nominee for president of the united states is a proud and open bigot  other members of the gop are concealing their own prejudices   or at least some are then you have some who just don t care  and are perfectly fine with exposing themselves as ignorant  bigoted whack jobs take former republican representative joe walsh  a one term member of congress turned radio host  walsh made a name for himself by being an outspoken critic of the obama administration  and went from being a self described moderate to a full fledged tea partier  now  we all know how heartless he was when he called on the obama admin  to secure the boarder with moats and alligators  but now he s exposed himself as truly one of the most backwards honking racists in the american political atmosphere yesterday  walsh thought it would be a good idea to refer to the election of barack obama as the most racist event in american history the single greatest act of racism in american history was the election of barack obama people voted for him simply because he was black   joe walsh   walshfreedom  june     he actually said that  in his eyes  the election of the united states  first african american president was more racist than the following  the trail of tears  slavery  japanese internment  or jim crow  these are just some  but certainly not all  of the dark  racist brutalities committed in american history  and a middle aged  white republican man thinks obama being elected by the will of the people is the most racist thing to happen it s as if republicans are trying to officially be the party of racism and sheer stupidity and while republicans go on and on about how democrats don t respect the will of the people  they decide their best and brightest ought to insult the will of the american electorate  who decided to choose president obama  twice   not because of his skin color  but because his ideas were better than mccain and romney s republicans still have not managed to understand their own autopsy report from   when minority voters delivered one hell of a wake up call to their hopes of taking back the white house  instead of heeding the warning  they have decided to double down on the hopes that their precious white voters would ride in and save the day  it didn t work in   it certainly won t work in   and considering president obama s approval rating is at a five year high of  percent  insulting his election as  racist  and insulting the intelligence of his voters certainly won t help make the gop s case this is a guy who accused tammy duckworth  who beat him in his reelection bid  of politicizing her war record and injuries sustained in combat  this is the guy who  after his term ended  attempted to forego paying child support because he was  unemployed   this is the guy who thinks two national elections were decided simply because of a man s skin color this is the face of the gop featured image via gage skidmore
