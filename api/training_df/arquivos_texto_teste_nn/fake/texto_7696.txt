right wingers never have been very smart  but this one really takes the cake  there is an idea that the fact girl scout cookies are sold means america needs to end child labor laws  no  this isn t a joke and it isn t an exaggeration a piece from the federalist  is suggesting that children engaging in an annual fundraising drive by selling cookies are somehow no more offensive than  year olds working in steel mills  or coal mines  for  or more hours per day   days a week to quote the article the girl scout cookie program  in other words  teaches young girls how to be entrepreneurs  it teaches them how to work  it is  after a fashion  child labor  the great scandal is not that the girl scouts are promoting child labor  it s that there isn t more child labor in the united states today source  the federalistthe author then complains about the fact the government has outlawed  every meaningful kind  of occupation for children younger than   citing  any manufacturing occupation    most processing occupations    all work requiring the use of ladders  scaffolds or their substitutes    outside window washing  children younger than  should not have any meaningful kind of occupation other than school student  the sheer insanity of this is beyond words he goes on to say that there is even a  strong case  for abolishing what he calls  compulsory education   by letting them not go to school in exchange for being able to work full time instead  i m sure a  year old will land a good paying full time job where they can support themselves over the next  years with no schooling the american right wing has totally gone off the deep end  you might say  but this is only one writer s opinion   the problem is  it isn t  elected federal level republicans have resurrected the idea of removing safeguards against child labor just a few years ago  even wannabe presidential candidates have advocated for it  it s a real thing that republicans want to do  and that scares the hell out of me if those freeloading girl scouts can safely sell harmless boxes of cookies for one month a year  why aren t they working the other  months in a steel mill instead of wasting time being  forced  to go to school  right  god help us if these people take control featured image via wikicommons
