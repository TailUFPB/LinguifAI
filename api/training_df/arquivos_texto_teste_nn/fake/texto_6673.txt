up until recently  we ve all been witnessing donald trump speak freely with nothing really prepared except for the usual crumpled sheet of paper he d pull out of his coat pocket to read the latest poll numbers to tell us how wonderful he is  however  with clinching the republican nomination getting closer and closer  he s trying  and failing  to be more refined  which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him during his foreign policy speech on wednesday  it was painfully awkward to watch  you could hear him reading the speech  which did not come across naturally whatsoever  watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders  and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised  however  his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking for example  he read  our embassies in kenya and tanzania  but said  our embassies in kenya and tan zane ia  small blunder  sure  but one that was surely noticed by all and just another example of trump s clear ineptitude donald trump has a pretty interesting way of pronouncing tanzania   tanzaynia https   t co   dopeitstom   dopeitstom  april    notice of this blunder was none other than  well  pretty much everyone  but also white house press secretary josh earnest  when questioned about the moment  earnest quipped  apparently phonetics are not included on the teleprompter  watch here  apparently  the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter    presssec on donald trump foreign policy address https   t co orunelmrne  cspan   cspan  april    in all  it shows how ill prepared trump is at not only addressing the nation  but also reading  add this to the list of reasons not to vote for him  which is a very  very long list if you want to torture yourself  you can watch the speech in full here featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
