since the beginning of donald trump s campaign for president  his cornerstone plan has been to build a wall  a great  big  yuge wall  spanning the entirety of the united states and mexico border  he s got his fans so excited to be racist that they just can t wait to be the utter isolationists they ve always wanted the country to be well  it looks as though trump just disproved the effectiveness of walls as he was able to easily climb over one on his way to a campaign stop in san francisco  california  he needed to do so because of all the protesters who had arrived  and because things got very heated  with violent exchanges between the pro and anti trump crowds  the real estate mogul had to find an alternative way into the hyatt regency where his event was taking place of course  he noticed the very tangible hypocrisy in the whole ordeal  but he made a joke of it in very a trumpian fashion  he told his crowd  that was not the easiest  entrance i ve ever made  it felt like i was crossing the border  actually  which is both offensive because it s nothing like crossing the border  as many have died seeking better lives for themselves and their families  and it was true only in the sense that a border wall is a joke of an idea  clearly  as trump has just proven himself  one can find a way over  or even under walls  the centerpiece of his campaign was just flushed down the toilet by the reality star himself maybe trump will now start talking actual policy plans  ha  who am i kidding  he has no plans  he just wants to be king of america  because he clearly thinks he deserves it  despite not having any of the proper experience whatsoever   realdonaldtrump forced to climb over wall to attend his own event in san francisco    https   t co   nine news la     april    image via video screen capture
