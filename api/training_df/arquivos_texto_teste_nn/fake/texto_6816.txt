students at austin peay state university were both horrified and deeply puzzled by what appears to have been an art project gone horribly wrong  someone  allegedly with the approval of an art instructor  made  nooses  one for each color of the rainbow  and hung them from a tree on campus according to a statement posted on social media monday night  the nooses were found on campus near the trahern building  where most of the university art classes are held in a statement  president alisa white called the display  deeply disturbing  this incident is deeply disturbing and is hurtful to our university community   white said in the statement   regardless of the intent  the display has no place on our campus  i am saddened  and i am sorry for the hurt and offense this has caused and want our students  faculty  and staff to know that it will not be tolerated  as of this writing  no one has come forward to claim responsibility or  more importantly  explain what the hell they were thinking at the time  considering that tennessee has over  confirmed cases of post reconstruction lynchings  hanging any noose of any kind is  to be delicate  in extremely poor taste but  even more bizarrely  it might not have been intended as hate speech according to a student in the class who asked to not be identified  the display was a part of a project in an introductory sculpture class  the student said the project concepts and locations were approved in advance by the instructor comments on instagram indicate the rainbowed noose theme has to do with the number of suicides in the lgbt community  which i can sort of see if i squint really hard  admittedly  we ve all said or done something that sounded great in our head but turned out to be a really stupid idea in practice  i m leaning towards the suicide explanation because  frankly  i m having a hard time believing that an art instructor heard the pitch  i want to hang rainbow colored nooses because i don t like gays and black people  and thought it would make a lovely art project on the other hand  even if there was no ill intent  the student that convinced an instructor to put their job at risk in this fashion can apparently sell ice to an eskimo  stay tuned for more on this bizarre story featured image via instagram
