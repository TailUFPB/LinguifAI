with everything going on at donald trump rallies lately  it was only a matter of time before saturday night live took notice and included it in one of their sketches   however  they took it one step further and perfectly wove dr  ben carson s endorsement of trump into this past saturday s cold open jay pharoah appears as carson and says  donald and i are very different  we re like night and day  ebony and orangey  but he backs the donald nonetheless and leaves the stage only to moments later reappear with a  trump steak  over one of his eyes  this is when darrell hammond as trump says to the crowd  guys  what did i say  not this one  this is one of the good ones  clearly insinuating that carson was beat up because he was black and his supporters mistook him as one of the many protesters getting beat up recently at trump rallies the racism and violence coming out of the trump campaign is utterly abhorrent  trump himself is not only condoning it  but offering to pay legal fees  and encouraging it  kudos to saturday night live for this hilarious satirical spin  however  the reality of what s going on is no laughing matter at all  featured image via video screen capture
