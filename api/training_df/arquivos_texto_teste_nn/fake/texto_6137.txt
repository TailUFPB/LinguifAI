throughout donald trump s entire campaign  it s been the donald trump show  what does that mean  he s made it all about himself  how well he is doing  what poll numbers he is getting  what he can do for the country  how great he is  he s been saying all of these things as if he s doing all of this on his own without any help from anyone well  in a turn of events  trump just tweeted out something on twitter that seems to acknowledge  at least in parentheses  that he hasn t clinched the republican nomination for president completely on his own  there were actually voters involved he wrote  i  we  broke the all time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary   by a lot   and with many states left to go  thank you  i  we  broke the all time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary   by a lot   and with many states left to go  thank you   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    is yuuge for the donald to recognize that he s not actually moving forward to the general election based upon himself alone  he actually needed votes to get there  and it s nice that he kinda sorta maybe in parentheses alongside himself acknowledged the people who got him to where he is trump s narcissism knows no bounds  but maybe  just maybe he finally figured out how elections actually work  and because the rest of us already knew  we need to make sure he gets nowhere near the white house come november featured photo by spencer platt getty images
