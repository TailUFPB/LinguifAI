on wednesday morning  president obama nominated judge merrick garland to the supreme court  garland was an excellent pick who is liked by members of both parties  so much  in fact  that it would be extremely difficult for the gop to oppose his nomination  but if we thought that republicans would cut the bullsh t and do their jobs  we were wrong shortly after obama s announcement  senator mitch mcconnell promised more obstructionism  the next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the supreme court and have a profound impact on our country  translation  if obama s nominee gets through  our conservative majority will be destroyed for years and we won t be able to attack women  minorities  immigrants and fight for the one percent  mcconnell continued  so  of course  the american people should have a say in the court s direction  it is a president s constitutional right to nominate a supreme court justice and it is the senate s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent the senate will continue to observe the biden rule  so that the american people have a voice in this momentous decision  he went on to say  biden rule  about fifty more times and try to pin senate republicans  refusal to do their job on the vice president  unfortunately  republicans seem to forget that biden was speaking hypothetically back then  he did not actually obstruct the supreme court  unlike the gop right now who seems to have forgotten that americans had a voice in the direction of the court when they nominated obama twice but mcconnell wasn t the only republican to respond to obama s pick like a bunch of toddlers who do not understand the constitution  republican chuck grassley said  today the president has exercised his constitutional authority  a majority of the senate has decided to fulfill its constitutional role of advice and consent by withholding support for the nomination during a presidential election year  with millions of votes having been cast in highly charged contests the american people shouldn t be denied a voice  again  we had a voice when we chose obama over mccain and romney speaker of the house paul ryan tweeted under the  constitution  the president has every right to make this nomination  and the senate has every right not to confirm a nominee   paul ryan   speakerryan  march    far none of the republican presidential candidates have spoken out  but we are sure it is going to sound exactly like the idiots above  and while they are playing politics with the highest court in the land  democrats will be sure to remind the american people just how  seriously  republicans take their jobs watch mcconnell refuse to serve the people of the u s  featured image via video screen capture
