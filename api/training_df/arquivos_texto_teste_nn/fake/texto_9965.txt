washington post  is this the woman that michelle obama sees when she looks in the mirror now  free of the white house and the media scrutiny of presidential politics  after more than a decade in public life  can she freely shed the sheath dress and pearls for a wide brim black hat and dookie braids she just did by allowing herself to be photographed alongside  other members of beyonc s inner circle  obama reclaimed her image from the annals of stodgy first lady portraits  and  she did it by embodying beyonc s the image  in case you haven t seen it  is part of a birthday tribute to the singer who posted portraits of black women   some famous  others not   dressed in one of her iconic looks from the  formation  video for those who aren t able to pick out michelle without seeing her perpetual scowl or eyeballs rolling  she s the one in the middle the washington post took great pains to make sure there is no room for interpretation when it comes the reason michelle obama chose to publicly throw her support behind beyonce s divisive  cop hating music from the washington post both the former first lady and queen bey are two women who don t put images out into the world without carefully considering their meaning  so what s the former first lady telling us with this one first  that she loves beyonc   well  duh  their track record of public support dates back to the first inauguration  when the singer serenaded the obamas with etta james s  at last  second  that she loved  formation   undeniably one of  beyonc s  most overtly political tracks  the video featured stark images of the aftermath of hurricane katrina in new orleans  along with graffiti supporting the movement for black lives matter  a police cruiser sinking into a body of water and a young black boy dancing in front of a line of officers outfitted in riot gear  that s all before beyonc  throws up her middle fingers in other words there can be no denying that michelle has given up the front  and is coming out as a full fledged supporter of the anti law enforcement black lives matter domestic terror group the washington post wrapped up their piece by reminding their readers how painful it s been for michelle to be stuck in the white house  and how she s looking forward to living a  normal  life again  unlike the  stodgy  former first ladies before her in one of her final interviews as first lady  obama told oprah winfrey that she longed for a  normal  life after living in the nation s fish bowl  so it seems counter intuitive for her to participate in this such a public display of adulation for one of the world s most famous women add to that the controversial nature of the look   which hearkens to beyonc  in one of her more militant moments  remember that satirical new yorker cover  which cast michelle obama as a fist bumping  combat boot wearing  afro d commando  that image  obama has said   knocked  back
