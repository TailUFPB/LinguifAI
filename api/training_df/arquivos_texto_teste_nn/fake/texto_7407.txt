for decades  centuries    the right has perpetuated the myth of white superiority by pointing at black communities that are being crushed by poverty and crime  it was  they said  evidence that black people were inferior because white communities didn t have those kinds of problems republicans played to this racism with the southern strategy  which told poor white people that everything was ok as long as they were better than those people  more importantly  if they just voted for the gop  republicans would stop those people from taking their jobs white women opportunities etc  and it worked really really well  poor white people flocked to elect republicans who then gave trillions away to the rich and threw some crumbs at the poor people that elected them in the first place but then the economy collapsed and while it hit the black community harder  millions of working class white people were suddenly in the same situation  no job  no money and no future  the result  a massive increase in dug and alcohol abuse  suicide and crime in other words  they responded in much the same way economically devastated black communities did  but for your own safety  don t tell them that  now  a rational person would look at this and say   aha  so it s not some kind of moral failing on the black of those people  it s poverty and the lack of economic opportunities   but the conservative elite are not rational  they re the new french aristocracy  they re so dedicated to the premise that the have nots are morally  intellectually and spiritually inferior that they have begun to turn on their own base despite their matching skin tone over at the national review online  the right wing s premiere thought leader  you will find a growing hostility to poor white people  in a piece by kevin williamson  you will find this lengthy screed denouncing the republican base for siding with trump against their masters it is immoral because it perpetuates a lie  that the white working class that finds itself attracted to trump has been victimized by outside forces  it hasn t  the white middle class may like the idea of trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the cathedral  they may sing hymns to trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about  globalists  and   odious  stupid term    the establishment   but nobody did this to them  they failed themselves if you spend time in hardscrabble  white upstate new york  or eastern kentucky  or my own native west texas  and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency  the drug and alcohol addiction  the family anarchy   which is to say  the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog   you will come to an awful realization  it wasn t beijing  it wasn t even washington  as bad as washington can be  it wasn t immigrants from mexico  excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are  it wasn t any of that nothing happened to them  there wasn t some awful disaster  there wasn t a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation  even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence   and the incomprehensible malice   of poor white america  so the gypsum business in garbutt ain t what it used to be  there is more to life in the  century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the man closed the factories down the truth about these dysfunctional  downscale communities is that they deserve to die  economically  they are negative assets  morally  they are indefensible  forget all your cheap theatrical bruce springsteen crap  forget your sanctimony about struggling rust belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily orientals stealing our jobs  forget your goddamned gypsum  and  if he has a problem with that  forget ed burke  too  the white american underclass is in thrall to a vicious  selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles  donald trump s speeches make them feel good  so does oxycontin  what they need isn t analgesics  literal or political  they need real opportunity  which means that they need real change  which means that they need u haul  i was shocked at the tone  the absolute loathing for poor and working class whites is so thick you couldn t cut it with a chainsaw  this is the kind of hatred usually reserved for black people and liberals  but it s obvious this is not a newly formed opinion by williamson  the dripping condescension of  forget all your cheap theatrical bruce springsteen crap  forget your sanctimony about struggling rust belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily orientals stealing our jobs  reveals a long held contempt for what conservative elites like williamson usually refer to as  the real america  and just to make sure the conservative elites are on board with how terrible and degenerate these poor  white  people are  nro s david french quotes that entire segment above and then adds his own hate these are strong words  but they are fundamentally true and important to say  my childhood was different from kevin s  but i grew up in kentucky  live in a rural county in tennessee  and have seen the challenges of the white working class first hand  simply put  americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate  no one is making them do it  the economy isn t putting a bottle in their hand  immigrants aren t making them cheat on their wives or snort oxycontin  obama isn t walking them into the lawyer s office to force them to file a bogus disability claim he goes on and on and on about how they ve been seduced by welfare checks and food stamps and now they re just lazy  sound familiar   these two rich and privileged men are finally dropping the charade that the real war in this country is based on race  it never was  race was a ruse used by the rich to keep the poor squabbling while they stole the country  but now that the   has broken the economy for everyone  not just minorities  poor white people are furious at the people that promised them they would be better than those people the rich and their mouthpieces can t help but be enraged by the lack of gratitude on display  did they not drop crumbs for the poor to feast upon  did they not pass laws to make life even worse for blacks and gay people  now the poor whites that give the rich their political power are expecting to be treated like people  how dare they  we are witnessing the end of conservative politics as we know it  the rich were able to keep the poor distracted with shiny objects and race baiting but now they re in open warfare against each other with no realistic way to mend the schism between the greed of the rich and the needs of the poor get more popcorn  it s going to be quite a show featured image author generated
