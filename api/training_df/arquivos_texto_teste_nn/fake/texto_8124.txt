as soon as news broke of notorious hatemonger supreme court justice antonin scalia s death  some liberals joked that conservatives are so desperate to hate obama that they would accuse the president of murder  the idea seemed so nonsensical that it could never happen  sure  it was entirely expected that republicans would immediately vow to block any obama nominees no matter who they are  republicans have been working to stand in between obama and success since before he was elected the first time  but to accuse him of murdering scalia scalia  a man who opposed anything that advanced human rights at every turn  was a  year old obese gentleman who smoked  factors that greatly contribute to one s risk of death   but lived a full life   one he chose to waste opposing lgbt rights  a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion  racial equality  and other endeavors rational  thinking  decent human beings would consider reasonable that president obama will be nominating a replacement is something that frightens conservatives   apparently to the point that the gerbils that operate their brains have all simultaneously died  all across right wing social media  you can find a curious assertion repeated  that bastard obama gone done and killed scalia  on twitter  several hashtags have formed to push the moronic belief that the president s secret muslim enforcers gave scalia a heart attack   and there is such an outpouring of stupid  sarah palin will likely announce plans to speak about foreign policy for  minutes straight in order to regain her title as the dumbest f cking human being alive                    though scalia s true murderer is heart disease  the right is almost desperate to believe that the president had scalia killed  one gentleman calling himself  naturehacker manages to spin a particularly crazy theory that  this is a white house president government coverup  the fbi and cia with barack are probably involved  mercury nitrate may have been the poison of choice at dinner or the sulfate with lead  cadmium  radium  plutonium  uranium  or organophosphate  roundup is an organophosphate that could have been used by leonard nimoy  this justice was killed and found dead  he died of a premeditated murder  another term for this is that he was assasinated for his spot in the supreme court to be appointed by a liberal  naturehacker  explains that  after a night of partying and gorging on food  scalia  wakes up dead  what a coincidence   mr  genius says sarcastically  explaining that scalia was poisoned  to get him to die for obama s agenda  watch the insane rant below  and remember to vote blue in november  not only does the next president appoint at least two supreme court justices  but if conservatives have their way  he or she will appoint a third as well  featured image via screengrab
