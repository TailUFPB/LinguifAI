turning up to a trump rally to oppose the republican front runner can be life threatening  as trump and his rabid supporters have proven time after time that they re violent  mindless idiots that feel threatened by even the most peaceful of protesters on friday during an oklahoma city rally  a man took a stand against the candidate by reminding everyone about the business mogul s racist rhetoric and connection to white supremacists  the brave protester stood up and stuck his tongue out at trump  proudly displaying the fact that he was wearing a homemade shirt that said  kkk endorses trump  as trump s devout minions noticed the protester s shirt  the audience was overcome with boos and shouting  trump walked over to the protester  practically stared the man down  then paced the stage while he waited for his security to take the protester away  meanwhile  trump s fans chanted  usa  usa  usa   once the man was gone  trump took center stage once again and went on a rant against political correctness  saying it was to blame for the slow response to the protester  you see  in the good old days  law enforcement acted a lot quicker than this  a lot quicker  in the good old days  they d rip him out of that seat so fast  but today everyone is politically correct  our country is going to hell for being politically correct  going to hell  you can watch the confrontation below considering that earlier this week  trump faced another protester and threatened to  punch him in the face   this response from trump was mild although trump removed the protester  the man had hit on a part of trump s campaign that the goper is now trying to distance himself from  just hours before this confrontation  trump had brushed off the support of former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke  who d said not voting for trump would be against americans   heritage   before quickly changing the subject  the front runner said  david duke endorsed me  ok  alright  i disavow  ok  while trump may be trying to pretend that he s not a racist  it doesn t reverse the fact that trump has retweeted various white supremacists and is a favorite candidate amongst the most racist people in our country
