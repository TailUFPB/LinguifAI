the republicans have given us a lot of  wtf  moments lately  but this one is something you ll remember for a while   and just in time for easter earlier today  house speaker paul ryan  r wis   released a video over twitter announcing what he gave up for lent  a christian tradition during easter season where people give up specific comforts and luxuries for  days as a form of repentance  after you see this  the levels of rage you ll experience will make you wish ryan had just kept it between himself and the lord  seriously  the smug smile on his face is enough to make you sick i used to give up food  like beer or ice cream  for  lent  but this year  i decided to give up something different https   t co   paul ryan   speakerryan  march    what did ryan decide to forego for several weeks  anxiety  and impatience  he s dead serious  in the video  he said  i used to give up beer  or ice cream  or pop  but i ve given up so many things over the years  food wise  that i ve decided to switch my lenten vows to character deficiencies or problems i ve had  for ryan to refer to anxiety as a  character deficiency  is reprehensible  it is something that around  million american adults suffer from regularly  and can lead to serious physical issues such as ulcers and respiratory problems ryan  with his amazing amount of white privilege and insensitivity  referred to the everyday stresses that many americans face as an actual debilitating disorder  how nice is it that ryan can choose to give up anxiety for  days  people who actually suffer from anxiety don t even have that choice  and would probably give anything to live without anxiety for just one day  what ryan said has only further stigmatized a real mental health issue the stigma against mental health is a serious matter in this country  as discussions about mental health are usually delivered in a punch line or decried in public  it s no surprise that only a quarter of those with mental health issues believe that others understand and are compassionate about their condition  because of heavily engrained stereotypes about mental illness  many people will never seek treatment and get the help they need maybe if ryan is looking for more lent ideas  he could give up shaming people  at least that s a real  character deficiency  featured image via getty images
