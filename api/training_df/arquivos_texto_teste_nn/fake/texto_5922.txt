the nation is once again having a conversation on sexual assault after a former stanford student was sentenced to only six months in jail after being convicted of sexually assaulting a  year old woman  the slap on the wrist sentence is just one example of what seems like infinite examples of how society doesn t take sexual assault seriously enough one of the most common ways that people contribute to this problem is by making excuses for the sexual assailant s actions  a recently released video lampoons those who try to blame the victims of sexual assault by changing the crime committed to murder the video features two animated individuals discussing the recent murder of a man named james at a large party near their campus  here is a snippet of how the conversation goes  what was he wearing though  what  you know how he wears all of those v neck t shirts  yeah but i m just saying if you don t want to get stabbed in the neck consider wearing a turtle neck sweater or something  as ridiculous as that statement sounds  it s one that happens on a daily basis across the united states  one of the classic excuses that often come up during these conversations is that the victim of sexual assault  was asking for it  because of the clothes that they wear  other excuses include the victim s consumption of alcohol  what they were doing at the time  and who they were doing it with when people come at victims with these excuses  it does nothing but send a message that it is okay to sexually assault someone else  it creates a culture of acceptance of sexual violence  the victim of a crime is never to blame for the actions of the person who made them a victim no one would ever blame a murder victim for their own murder and no one should ever blame a victim of sexual assault for their assault you can watch the video in full below featured image via video screenshot
