always irreverent actor sacha baron cohen  best known for  borat   has a new movie coming out  but the movie s studio is frantically trying to prevent you from seeing it because of one particularly outrageous scene involving the current republican front runner according to a report by the huffington post  cohen s new film  the brothers grimsby  includes a subplot in which billionaire mogul and potential republican presidential nominee donald trump  accidentally contracts hiv   the scene in question has reportedly been getting rave reviews  audiences at test screenings both international and in the united states were left cracking up in a  scene  history repeats itself with  daniel  getting shot and his infected blood landing in the mouth of donald trump unsurprisingly  there was a massive cheer when that happened overseas  where people find it hard to believe that america s political process is being hijacked by a guy like trump  found an even more receptive audience in europe  there were standing ovations  the joke  done in baron cohen s standard over the top style  is proving cathartic to overseas audiences terrified by trump s rise cheering someone getting hiv is a bit cruel   but trump can t really complain  after all  during the ebola crisis  he very publicly suggested american doctors be abandoned to die of the illness in africa the u s  cannot allow ebola infected people back  people that go to far away places to help out are great but must suffer the consequences   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    while audiences are cheering  sony pictures isn t laughing  having slowly realized that  yes  donald trump is probably going to be the republican presidential candidate despite having no actual political expertise and his unapologetic bigotry  the studio is freaking out  their concerns are two fold  first  they don t want to alienate the millions of republican voters who suddenly adore donald trump  second  they are worried that trump himself will learn about the scene and literally sue them studio executives are nervous about angering the famously vengeful and litigious trump  compounded by the possibility of getting on the wrong side of the possible next president  if you were told that they re shying away from the movie because of the political implications  i can tell you that s  percent true   said a well placed source it s certainly not beyond the realm of possibility  trump has  at various times  threatened to sue nearly every person  corporation  or newspaper on earth  when the washington post tried to track down the number of lawsuits trump has threatened over the years  they gave up  saying the number was too high to count hilariously  sony s solution was to add a disclaimer to the beginning of the film that specifically tells audiences that trump had nothing to do with the film   as if they needed to be told  this will  of course  have the unintended effect of bring more attention to trump  not so funny is the disturbing implications of a major motion pictures studio censoring one of its own movies  at a high cost  just to avoid angering the man who wants to be president  already trump has hinted that  if elected  he will begin dismantling parts of the first amendment that deal with free press  instead  he vowed to  open libel laws  so he can sue newspapers that attack him it appears that just the threat of a lawsuit has already had a chilling effect on free speech  sacha baron cohen brutally mocked america s jingoism and in grained prejudices with  borat  during the bush years  if ever there was another time to take down a politician  it s now featured image via bbc screenshot
