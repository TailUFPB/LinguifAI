since the shooting in orlando  donald trump has been yammering on about how he was right about radical islamic terrorism and muslims all along  he s also been blasting president obama for the way he s handling isis  connecting obama to the orlando massacre  he just recently stepped that up  claiming again that he was right about all this  and also bringing hillary clinton into the ring of his accusations  he even has a source to back all this up now  the big question now is   bro  do you even news  usa today decided to answer that question with   no  he clearly doesn t   why  because he said  hillary clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the obama administration was actively supporting al qaeda in iraq  the terrorist group that became the islamic state  his source for that  breitbart  which is less reliable than fox news  they referenced a government memo from  on the situation and called it an  intelligence report   trump took that story and used it to gloat about being right about everything an  media fell all over themselves criticizing what donaldtrump  may have insinuated about  potus   but he s right  https   t co biidytvzyw  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    today  however  looked at that so called  report   and found that it doesn t say what either trump or breitbart claim  here s the relevant information dia memo  august   a  internally  events are taking a clear sectarian direction b  the salafist  the muslim brotherhood  and aqi  are the major forces driving the insurgency in syria c  the west  gulf countries  and turkey support the opposition  while russia  china  and iran support the regime aqi supported the uprising against syrian president bashar al assad from the beginning  and so did the u s  that s not a secret in any form of the word  and it takes an amazing leap of twisted logic to assume that means obama was actively supporting even working with al qaeda  usa today s report says that  for this to be true  several more countries would have to have been involved in this conspiracy  too now it s getting so complicated that it defies description to that end  though  usa today reached out to several middle east experts about this  one such expert  andrew tabler  said  the us never supported aq in iraq   not sure where that came from  another expert  perry cammack  called breitbart s story  amazingly poor reporting   and said  if anything the obama administration has been criticized for doing too little to support the syrian opposition  and it s frankly for exactly this reason  as far as hillary s involvement  that s trump and breitbart grasping at some very small  slippery straws  while the memo does list the office of the secretary of state  cammack says it would likely have been  read by worker bees   and incorporated into a larger briefing for hillary to review later in other words  that notation is meaningless  and trump s accusation is baseless usa today concluded their report by saying that trump s claims are the kind of conspiracy theories they d debunk in an article  and debunk  they did  they shot down this conspiracy theory rather soundly with basic research of which neither trump  nor breitbart  is capable  and they ll eventually be banned for this  featured image by mark lyons getty images
