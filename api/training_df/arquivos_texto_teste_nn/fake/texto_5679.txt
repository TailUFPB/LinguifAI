in a statement that was attempting to appeal to the left and to the worst conspiracy theorists on the right  donald trump accused his female opponent of raping the country with a trade deal in a campaign rally in pennsylvania  the gop frontrunner ranted about free trade agreements  he wants to force canada and mexico to renegotiate nafta and he wants to renegotiate the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trump s words were tailored to his audience  many of whom have personally suffered from the collapse of the american steel industry  i m going tell our nafta partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers  and i don t mean just a little bit better  i mean a lot better   trump said in pennsylvania if canada and mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact  trump said he would notify them under the agreement s terms  that america intends to withdraw from the deal  source  huffington postof course  most of the steel industry has moved to china  a country with whom we have no trade agreement  but why let inconvenient facts get in the way of a good narrative in yet another speech  this time in ohio  trump spoke of the ttp  calling it a  death blow  for american manufacturing  he said it was  just a continuing rape of our country  trump is right in that the trade deals have been bad for the american people and that they should be renegotiated  but trump s claim that he s a savior for american trade is disingenuous  much of trump s fortune has been built on the backs of those in foreign countries  in other words  the trump of today would probably not have been possible without the trade agreements he loves to criticize  afl cio s president richard trumka agrees  trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy  he has consistently sent american jobs overseas to line his own pockets  beyond that  though  is something more insidious and sexist  it s long been a republican meme that bill clinton is a rapist and that hillary clinton is somehow complicit in these  crimes   they aren t actually crimes because no one has ever found any criminal activity   trump may or may not choose to be overt in rattling off the hundreds of clinton conspiracy theories  but you can bet he ll continue with the more subliminal accusations  like one of rape  ironic  since he s been accused of the same featured image via jeff swensen at getty images
