during an on interview on this week  bernie sanders had to deal with some seriously weak interview questions  the interviewer  martha raddatz brought up an allegation that sanders  surging campaign has been  unsettling the markets   that accusation is as ridiculous as it sounds here is how the interview went martha raddatz  senator sanders  you said something to your supporters yesterday that caught my ear  you quoted with pride a wall street journal article calling you a viable candidate  saying it appears that we are making wall street a little bit nervous and that s a good thing  the article was quoting blackstone ceo steve schwarzman who said the markets are unsettled because of you  a slowdown in china and geopolitical risks  you re laughing  but i want to know why is it a good thing that the markets are in turmoil  people have their pension funds in the market  lots of middle class people have their  k s invested in stocks  it s not just wall street  everybody is affected by this  bernie sanders  the reason that i am laughing is i fully admit to having a big ego  like many other politicians  but the idea that bernie sanders  candidacy  because it has growing support all over this country  is unsettling world markets is absolutely absurd  the point i was making is we are getting the attention of wall street  wall street s greed and recklessness and illegal behavior drove this economy into the worst recession since the clutch plague  millions of people lost their homes  their life savings and their jobs  and yes i believe that we have to break up the major financial institutions  we have to reestablish glass steagall  and that we are now gaining the attention of wall street tells me that our campaign is doing very well  here s the interview for those not in the know  the blackstone group is one of the largest and most powerful private entities on the planet  they currently manage over   billion dollars in assists  stephen schwarzman currently has a net worth of    billion dollars  if anyone has been a beneficiary of the deregulation of wall st   it s schwarzman  it isn t surprising that he  the wsj   who notoriously published a completely debunked hit piece on sanders  and the mainstream media would be pushing this kind of nonsense  they just want to make it sound like sanders is coming after people s  k s  etc which couldn t be further from the truth  as sanders pointed out  people lost everything under our current system of wall street take all finance featured image credit  video screenshot via youtube  h t egberto willies
