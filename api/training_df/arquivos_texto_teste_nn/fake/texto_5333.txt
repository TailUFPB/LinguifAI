hillary clinton isn t just looking ahead to the democratic national convention  which kicks off this week  but she s also looking at the farcical clown show that was the republican national convention  when rnc speakers weren t busy spreading malicious lies for the purpose of driving fear  they were busy attacking her  and sometimes president obama   overall  very little was said about what they will do  and it made hillary kind of sad speaking on  minutes  she flat out said   i don t know what their convention was about  other than criticizing me  i seem to be the only unifying theme that they had  there was no positive agenda  it was a very dark  divisive campaign  and the people who were speaking were painting a picture of our country that i did not recognize   you know  negative  scapegoating  fear  bigotry  smears  i just was so  i was saddened by it  i seem to be the only unifying theme they had   that s a sad testament to how far the gop has fallen if there ever was one  republicans still can t decide how to unify behind someone as vile as trump  and the rnc wasn t well attended in part because of that  the fact that they can only unify in their hatred of hillary is  indeed  sad the only other unifying theme they have is the impending collapse of the u s   which is something of which the gop has been trying to convince us since nixon ran for president  that s not really new and can t be seen as true unity  it s dogma then there are prominent republicans like ted cruz  who openly refused to endorse trump even in front of an audience made up entirely of republicans  trump s presence at the top of the party threw a huge monkey wrench into the gop s plans to take over the country  and now they don t know what to do with him it d be hilarious if it wasn t so sad  it d be ridiculously depressing if it wasn t so hilarious  that s the massive contradiction of the republican party   they can only agree on how they feel about hillary  everything else  the gop civil war escalates hillary may well want a real race with a real opponent  and instead she got the three ring political circus that is donald trump and mike pence  and the nickname  crooked hillary   the gop is done if they can t figure this out  and it s looking increasingly like they can t featured image by gustavo caballero getty images
