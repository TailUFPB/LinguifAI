rachel maddow always brings us the most entertaining bits of political news  and we love her for it  her latest segment is no disappointment in that regard rachel had an exclusive report on the latest ppp poll  which listed a comprehensive group of unrelated items  all of these had one common theme among them  which do you have a higher opinion of   or donald trump you can probably tell where this is going already  but the list of things that beat him are funny as hell lice  traffic jams  used car salesmen  hipsters  the dmv  jury duty  nickelback  and root canals  when you ve lost to nickelback  where do you really go from there watch rachel s full segment below despite all the negative reviews  which trump deserves  to say the least   there is one thing that s a bit troubling  republican voters don t seem to care another part of the poll asked registered voters if they were uncomfortable with the three remaining candidates as the nominee of their party  here s where it gets weird  with all of the things people had a higher opinion of than donald trump  republican voters are only  percent uncomfortable with him as the nominee in context   hillary clinton  who has in no way said the stupid  asinine  offensive  racist  bigoted  misogynistic  or otherwise bad things that donald has is viewed as favorably to democratic voters as trump is to republican ones  that isn t saying hillary is very unfavorable either  a  percent margin is very respectable for any nominee of any party  especially this early in the primary process the popular theory that there is a huge fracture happening within the republican party simply is not true  yes  the republican maintsream was afraid of an outsider like trump usurping their party  while exposing it for the cesspool it really is  however  they will still be able to rely on their voter base  as the poll shows  anecdotal accounts of a few republicans changing parties are not matching with the national numbers  and now that the rest of the party establishment has reached the  stage of grief   acceptance   it is business as usual heading into november in the end  with the survey being among registered voters as a whole  trump probably still stands no chance of attracting swing voters   who  all things considered  are generally pragmatic and not seduced by racism  however  it s still worth remembering that the republican party really is unifying behind the court jester and a progressive victory can t be taken for granted featured image via video screen capture
