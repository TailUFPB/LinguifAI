celebrated congressional black caucus member  and  legend  corrine brown would like americans to believe that stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from underpriveleged children in her district  and using the money to vacation with her daughter  is not the reason she s been found guilty of  counts of fraud and corruption  it s because she is black  washington examiner   she partied with nancy pelosi  traveled on air force one next to president obama  and cast her superdelegate vote for hillary clinton  but on february     corrine brown was in federal court for stealing scholarship money from school children the disgraced congresswoman attempted to defend against charges that she funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from a non profit charity  one door for education  into her own pocket after her former chief of staff testified against her  the question was no longer whether or not she s guilty  it s why democrat brass would continually cozy up to a congresswoman who was so clearly corrupt from the beginning  brown s been shrouded in controversy  shortly after she won election in   the federal election commission accused brown of violating numerous campaign finance laws  most notably  she accepted donations from foreign citizens and failed to report the use of a corporate plane  and that s just the tip of the ethical iceberg a convenient rap sheet  put together last july by the florida times union  documents every allegation of wrongdoing brought against brown during her  year career  hollywood couldn t have better scripted some of the highlights in   brown cashed a    check from rev  henry lyons  the disgraced president of the national baptist convention who spent five years in federal prison for fraud  the congresswoman said tthat she used the unreported money to bus her supporters to an event in   brown battled back a house ethics investigation into her efforts to free imprisoned west african millionaire foutanga dit babani sissoko from federal prison  she appealed to attorney general janet reno for help  asking her to spring sissoko from prison  though unsuccessful  brown received a new lexus worth    for her trouble and in   brown took heat from the mayor of jacksonville after she had sandbags delivered by the city to protect her home from tropical storm fay  the congresswoman eventually pledged to pay the city   but none of this dissuaded democrats from palling around the florida woman  it s mind boggling that brown not only fundraised with the president but also enjoyed prominent perches on the transportation and veteran affairs committees first coast news   on thursday  november     the former jacksonville area congresswoman corrine brown took the stand  and plead for mercy from federal judge timothy corrigan  i am sorry you have to be here today to see me in this situation   brown said in her statement to the court   i never imagined i would one day be in court asking people to speak on my behalf   never  in hindsight  i wished i had been more diligent in overseeing my personal and professional life the idea that some people could believe these charges hurt me because it runs contrary to everything i ve ever believed and done in my life  i hope and pray these proceedings to don t make them  lose faith in the system  i humbly ask for mercy and compassion  brown was convicted on  counts of fraud and corruption in may the lead prosecutor in the sentencing hearing argued thursday that the former congresswoman should be sentenced to about   to  years in federal prison  her defense attorney is seeking probation and community service brown s defense attorney james smith objected to various aspects of the sentencing recommendations  including how much money brown should be culpable for prosecutor duva asked the court   what accountability does the law require   during his presentation duva said brown was accustomed to receiving money she should not have received  she also lied about donations to colleges  churches and other entities he also argued that brown has made ludicrous comments during the investigation  including a comment where she essentially said that had investigators not been looking into her case  the pulse shooting in orlando would never have happened  she also referred to the charges as  bogus  and  racist   implying that she was targeted for her race in the case duva objected to that notion by saying   she was targeted because she committed fraud  not because she was black or white  corrine brown had several witnesses come forward thursday in support of her through witness testimony during the sentencing hearing congresswoman sheila jackson lee provided a glowing character witness of corrine brown during her sentencing hearing thursday jackson lee described via telephone testimony it as her  privilege  to characterize corrine brown as a  loving person  she said brown has had a  pointed and direct effort  helping others  not herself  the veterans  community loved congresswoman brown  jackson lee said  stating that brown has helped those with ptsd and other issues following fighting overseas  she also stated brown helped tremendously with relief efforts during hurricane katrina in new orleans  that shows a character of giving to others unselfishly   jackson lee said additional arguments by defense attorneythe defense attorney belabored the point that they are against the notion that brown abused a position of trust  which is established by the evidence presented in the trial smith explained the definition of obstruction of justice  which brown is accused of doing while taking the stand by the prosecutor  stating that it is the  intention or deliberate effort while on the stand to make material falsehoods  the judge wasn t so sure and asked the defense attorney to elaborate smith appeared to get emotional after posing two questions   what type of sentence does justice require in this case   and  how do you sentence someone who is a legend  he attributes some of her actions to the progress our country has made in terms of relations for black people smith said he met with an orlando attorney who was from jacksonville and said the attorney described brown as  our martin luther king  for black jacksonville natives  none of those people had to push the boulder up the mountain like she did   said smith  referring to others in congress   she truly is a legend  there are a lot of moving parts in the case against corrine brown and her co conspirators carla wiley first became involved in the fraud scheme when she started dating ronnie simmons she was president of a charity called one door for education  which was never actually registered as a  c    the fake charity received more than    in four years  with about only    of it actually going to scholarships for students  that money is now gone simmons was dating wiley when he told her he needed a nonprofit to financially back a reception for congresswoman brown in   wiley offered one door for education as an option for that reception the charity claimed to give scholarships to poor and underprivileged children seeking the become teachers lead prosecutor a  tysen duva argued during the trial that ronnie simmons worked under brown and did her bidding by taking out   a day from the one door for education bank account and depositing it into brown s personal bank account  he did this numerous times  according to duva and evidence released earlier this month the fake charity was essentially used as a slush fund for corrine brown s travels  expenses and shopping  according to the prosecutors she used the money put in her bank account to go to nassau  bahamas with her daughter  fly to beverly hills and shop along rodeo drive  and attend a beyonc  concert  according to court documents and previous reports by first coast news the prosecutors also argued that brown committed wire fraud  mail fraud and stole money from the government after she lied on tax documents brown had friends in high places  such as former csx ceo mike ward  she would ask them for donation to open door for education and many of them gladly donated  according to previous reports and prosecutor testimony ward  for instance  contributed    to one door for education after learning that the money would go toward providing students with ipads for learning prosecutors also argued that brown lied about and inflated what she gave in tithes to various churches  the churches came forward in the trial and said the donations claimed to be given by brown did not match their records  to which brown said she sometimes gave anonymous donations other legitimate scholarship organizations came forward and said they had never received funds from brown s charity meanwhile  brown s tax returns claimed she contributed as much as       percent to a third of her income  to various charities
