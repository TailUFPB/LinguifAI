things got a little heated during a press conference with president obama in japan on thursday  the usually easygoing president snapped at a reporter who wanted to waste his time by asking about hillary clinton s emails obama told reporters that he was going to take one more question but when a member of the press asked him about clinton he changed his mind  saying  you know i take it back   i m not taking another question  we re in japan  don t you have something to do with asia that we want to talk about  i ll be talking about this in washington the whole time  i ve already said a lot on those issues   i think these are better directed to the campaign  we don t blame the president for being annoyed  his trip to japan was an historic trip as he became the only president to ever visit hiroshima  the reporter could have asked him a number of questions about that  but instead chose to ask a question about a manufactured scandal  as if that weren t ridiculous enough  the press also asked him if he thought clinton should release the text of her wall street speeches  obama responded to that nonsense by saying  during the course of the primary  people say things that they think will help them get some votes  and once the campaign is over  they move on  the noise that is going back and forth between the candidates at this point   if you want insights into how they re thinking about it  those  should be directed to them  president obama made it abundantly clear that he does not give a shit about all of the political drama going on  he has a job to do so he is going to ignore the bs and do what we elected him to do watch watch  president obama refuses to answer questions about hillary clinton s emails https   t co  pic twitter com   washington examiner   dcexaminer  may    image via atsushi tomura getty images
