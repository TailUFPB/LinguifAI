the gop implosion we have been waiting for has finally come full circle  now that john kasich and ted cruz have bowed out of the gop race for the  presidential nomination  trump pretty much has it in the bag  there s just one problem though  not all avowed republicans are supporting him  in fact  there s an active  nevertrump movement  and even a  republicansforhillary movement  in other words  sane conservatives are willing to do all they can to stop trump  now  we can add another name to the list of prominent republicans to the list of those who cannot find it within themselves to back trump  house speaker and gop convention chair paul ryan the new york times reports that speaker ryan insists that the gop establishment needs a  standard bearer  and trump is not that  ryan goes on to say  i don t want to underplay what he accomplished   that being said  though  ryan believes that the gop needs a nominee who  appeals to a vast majority of americans   he also said  we hope that our nominee aspires to lincoln and reaganesque  i think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles  there s a lot of questions conservatives are going to want answers to  well  mr  ryan  sane people  be they liberals  conservatives  or somewhere in between  definitely want nothing to do with the bigotry that trump is spewing  he is not a man we need anywhere near any position of power  however  you and your gop compatriots have spent eons playing to the bigotry of the stupid people of america  and this is your result  you created this monster  now  you handle it  get rid of trump at all costs  unless you want your party to die a slow and painful death sometime between now and november  you are already more than well on your way trump is dangerous  your job is to put country before party  not the other way around  perhaps your speaking sense today  speaker ryan  will rub off on your fellow republican politicians  we can hope and dream  right featured image via gage skidmore flickr
