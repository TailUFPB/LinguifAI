gop tennessee state rep  andy holt is done with terrorism  his solution  like with most in ammosexual republicans  is more guns  because that will suddenly make muslim men less angry with us  or something  to prove it  holt is putting his money where his mouth is and he s raffling two ar  s  because terrorism to be fair  holt had planned this giveaway before the massacre last sunday morning  but at the same time  sunday s massacre is only propelling him to go on with it because   a crazed muslim terrorist  shouldn t  change the plans or activities that we have as americans  i think there is nothing more that this particular individual would love  this terrorist  than to think that he has changed a significant number of plans for americans  and also that maybe gun control measures will be instituted regarding the use of firearms here in the united states because of his actions   holt said he added   i don t concede to the idea we should change our plans because this individual inappropriately used a firearm  source  cnnbecause that s what americans are thinking about this father s day weekend   obtaining maximum killing machines  okay  maybe that is what americans are thinking about this father s day weekend here s the video holt did concede  though  that maybe  just maybe  it s a bad idea to let people on the terrorist watch list have guns  i think there is a reason for terror suspects not to get firearms  a man that has devoted himself to isis and radical islam  that s a precursor   that should disallow an individual to have a firearm  we don t want to go too far  though  he says we have to be  strategic   which likely means doing nothing at all about the fact that yes  people on the terrorist watch list  including omar mateen  who brutally gunned down  people and was once on the list  bought his gun legally  we ll also likely do nothing about guns and mental illness or guns and domestic abusers  or about guns and anything  because in the good old u s  of a   guns are more important than people featured image via video screen capture
