as we ve all heard from trump  he didn t skip the debate because the thought of facing a woman who is willing to confront him turns his pants just a little brown  or because fox news would not pay him   million for the appearance  instead  he just wanted to do something nice for america s veterans  according to the billionaire  the rally he scheduled to air on fox s competing networks during the debate raised a whopping   million for veterans  unfortunately  this money all went to the donald j  trump foundation  which has an abysmal history of helping those who have served our country  with less than   of donations going to that particular cause while trump is perfectly willing to hide behind our vets as he pretends that he s not scared of being challenged by megyn kelly  a simply look at his recent history reveals how much he actually cares about people who  unlike him  put on a uniform and served our nation  last year  new york based veterans in command  an organization that helps homeless veterans  reached out to the donald for a donation more than a year ago  new york based veterans in command  an organization that helps homeless veterans  reached out to the donald for a donation while one might assume that trump would jump at the opportunity to help out  time went by and they received no response until just before trump s little debate day stunt  when the cash strapped organization got some mail from the trump campaign  but what was inside was not something that can feed or house those in need   unless  of course  someone feel like eating or building a home out of bumper stickers  unfortunately we are unable to make donations from the campaign   reads a handwritten note in the envelope   team trump   the letter informs the organization that mr  trump is very passionate about giving veterans the best life possible   included was a few trump campaign bumper stickers  afterward  veterans in command began receiving emails from the trump campaign asking them for money via ny daily newsthe group finds this response puzzling because they did not write to the trump campaign  we never wrote to his campaign   said veterans in command president larry robertson   now they want us to get out there and campaign and be on his team  without the veterans  he wouldn t be where he is today   the news that trump had raised money to help veterans  groups further confounds robertson and his membership  it just doesn t make any sense  he s campaigning for donations for veterans   said rodney moore  a retired u s  coast guard petty officer who works with veterans in command   we were a little deflated  after taking a proverbial beating for funneling money to his own foundation  trump finally released a list of  groups the donated money will benefit  veterans in command was not on the list despite reaching out to the billionaire  hopeful but  hey  at least they got some bumper stickers and campaign emails  after all  they re sure to support him after all this  aren t they featured image via ny daily news screengrab
