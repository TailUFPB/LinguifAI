this is what republicans have created by embracing right wing extremism  they own this in a plot that would have made the bundy standoff in oregon look like a schoolyard brawl in comparison  right wing extremist thomas david deegan called for seizing the west virginia state government by force and then executing several state leaders after a kangaroo court hearing presided over by so called sovereign citizens deegan was busted after the conference call he made calling for right wing extremists to launch a violent armed attack on the state capitol building was acquired by law enforcement  after listening to the recordings  it only took the jury an hour to come back with a guilty verdict  we are at war   deegan said during one call   the more that come to charleston  the less  for bloodshed  if you see the police coming and pulling up in a vehicle  i suggest you shoot them  again  this is the extremism that the republican party has built  they have literally been validating  excusing  and glorifying conservative extremism for decades  and now they have even invited extremists to become part of the mainstream which is why donald trump is about to win the gop presidential nomination and why we see violence at his rallies on a consistent basis rather than condemn right wing extremists  republicans welcomed them and now they feel more emboldened then ever before  which is why the bundy family was able to engage in two standoffs with the federal government in three years and why the number of right wing terrorist groups has risen in recent years make no mistake  this could have ended up as a full blown domestic terrorist attack by right wing extremists against a state government  and while deegan s plot failed  you can bet that there are other right wing extremists and right wing groups that are quietly cooking up some future takeover effort with all the new shiny guns republicans are letting them have by the weakening of gun laws  and next time republicans could really have blood on their hands featured image  wikimedia
