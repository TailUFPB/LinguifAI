the idea of a donald trump presidency is scary as hell for most of us  however  one florida man has a more positive take on things  the unidentified man  who politico reporter michael grunwald interviewed and described as a  year old latino democrat  plans to vote for trump for the most hilarious of reasons  he wants to see how nutty things can get  the man said to grunwald  the whole system is fucked  why not vote for the craziest guy  so we can see the craziest shit happen  to make you scratch your head even more  the man said that he voted for president barack obama in both  and   and would do so again if he could  however  he will not be tossing his vote toward hillary clinton this go around  because he seemingly just doesn t give a fuck  the man went on to say as to why he won t be going for clinton in   we got isis  we got zika  we got this  we got that  at least trump is fun to watch  politics sucks  man  all i can say about this is that while his answers are funny  they are also absolutely terrifying  donald trump is dangerous as hell  and fun to watch right now or not  i know that i m not willing to roll the dice on the future of the nation and the world and allow that narcissistic lunatic into the white house  now  this guy could have been fucking with the politico reporter  but somehow i seriously doubt it  he sounds like he s more entertained by the whole trump train fiasco than he is frightened  perhaps he hasn t thought this through  because if trump wins  we ll be entering a nuclear war in short order  we ll be alienating all of our allies along the way  with likely no way to survive the absolute catastrophe that the orange buffoon would most certainly create hopefully  this is the only democrat out there who is planning to vote for trump for the lulz  because this isn t remotely funny featured image via spencer platt getty images
