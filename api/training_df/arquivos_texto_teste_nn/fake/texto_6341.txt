the obama administration recently sent a missive to public schools nationwide  informing them that they must treat students consistently with their gender identity   even if it is different from what was biologically assigned to them by nature  long story short  this means no bathroom police in our schools needless to say  republicans didn t take this well  their reaction was something between obama telling them a  yo momma  joke and him personally burning the original copy of the constitution however  it seems that a victory for the administration will be handed to them by none other than the late antonin scalia himself  much to the distress of republicans everywhere in the   antonin scaia spoke for a unanimous court decision that found in favor of the plaintiff in a sex discrimination case  the case was brought from a man who was being bullied by other men and threatened with rape in the showers at his job on an oil rig  the man s employer ignored the problem  and he brought a lawsuit over it  scalia himself said that his employer s inaction was clearly discrimination based on sex  and he cited the civil rights act of  as supporting this decision  male on male sexual harassment was assuredly not the principal evil congress was concerned with when it enacted the  civil rights act  but statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils  and the words of the law can be easily read to forbid sexual harassment of any kind  source  oncale vs  sundowner offshore servicesand there you have it  antonin scalia just handed republicans one huge fat goose egg on their efforts to make segregation cool again in america by rebooting it to hate on transgender folks  the spirit of the law is incredibly simple to understand  you aren t supposed to be harassed at work  school  or other  public  venue places  especially because of an inborn characteristic like being of a particular gender  the harassment for transgender individuals is impossible to portray differently so it wouldn t be covered by the civil rights act republicans are aware of this  and this is why there has been a very recent outcry by many of them to have congress fundamentally dismantle the civil rights act  they d be willing to essentially trash the entire thing  exposing millions of people beyond only the transgender community to all forms of discrimination   all so they can militarize american restrooms featured image via rrstar com
