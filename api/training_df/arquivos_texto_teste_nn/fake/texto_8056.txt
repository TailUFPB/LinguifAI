racism is pretty prevalent on the interwebs  generally  if an article even mentions something to do with black culture  the racists are out in force  this happened so frequently on articles regarding hip hop and the like on the oregonian  which is  by the way  the west coast s largest paper  that one of their writers decided to address the problem of racism in their comments sections the piece  entitled  dear readers  stop being racist about hip hop  rips the racists in the comments sections to shreds  the writer of the article  david greenwald  first talks about how he is no longer shocked at the racism he encounters  even on the supposedly liberal west coast  then goes on to treat his readers to a sampling of the racism in his comments sections  and even in his email inbox i got an email over the weekend about our recent kanye west stories  no subject  it didn t need one   this is news   the reader wrote   about some n  rapping   every time the oregonian covers hip hop music  a rich and beautiful american art form invented to share the pain and joys and narratives of inner city black lives over  years ago  readers comment with hatred  here  from monday night alone  enjoy a few choice notes about kendrick lamar  the most important musician currently working in american music and new winner of five glimmering grammy awards  best  rap album  that  my friends  is a world class oxymoron   yardbird tells us  not since kanye west  has an individual with so little talent  been so worshiped and idolized by so many  even a superstar like adelle has been sucked into this clown s   music    donron adds  adele is spelled with one  l   she is also a blues singer who owes everything to the african american creativity that birthed hip hop and that s just for starters  greenwald then goes on to try to educate the ignoramuses that make up so much of his readership on the beauty and riches that hip hop culture has given america  however  at the end of the day  he says he understands that he cannot school people determined to be so ignorant  he ends the piece by saying  if you dismiss hip hop culture  if you paint it all with the same ignorant brush  if you say  hip hop masterpiece  is an oxymoron  if beyonc  and kendrick lamar and kanye west are just too black  you are a racist and you are wrong  and this will be the last time i write for you  and good for him  unsurprisingly  the very racists who need to take what mr  greenwald is saying into account completely missed the point of the article  and responded with   gasp    more racism  first  there were the ones whose response was to disparage the writer and the work of the hip hop artists  all the while using racist language then  of course  there was that one person who just had to pop out and declare themselves an expert on all things black because he once knew a black person and of course  those are just what is there as of this writing  with the article being quite new  i am sure the ugly and ignorance will continue  unfortunately  though  at the end of the day  the very people who needed to hear david greenwald s message have turned a deaf ear  and will remain as ignorant as they were prior to reading his brilliant piece featured image from video screen capture from the oregonian
