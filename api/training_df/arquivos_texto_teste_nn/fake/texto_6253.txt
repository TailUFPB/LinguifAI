bernie sanders supporters have been in an uproar about the democratic national committee s rules for primaries  specifically the use of  superdelegates   a superdelegate is someone chosen by the party to represent their interests in a given state  they are unpledged  meaning they are able to vote for whoever they choose at the convention  bernie sanders supporters  especially the  bernie or bust  crowd   those who pledge to stay home or vote for trump if hillary gets the nomination   have decided that the use of superdelegates circumvents the democratic process  making it impossible for anyone but an establishment democratic candidate to win let s put that into perspective real quick  if the rnc had the same rules they wouldn t be forced to nominate donald trump superdelegates act in the best interest of the party  there was a candidate in  who learned first hand that superdelegates can make or break a candidacy  her name was hillary clinton  the expected nominee from the start of the primary season  clinton found herself face to face with the up and coming barack obama  whose candidacy didn t truly flourish until half of the state primaries were over  as he gained in popularity and it became clear that he was the right choice for america to succeed dubya  those  corrupt  superdelegates  tasked with securing the best interest of the party  began switching their support to obama  who was ultimately nominated by quorum call on the convention floor by none other than hillary clinton that s the way these things work  bernie or bust may be upset that all those independent voters didn t get to just walk into a democratic primary and vote  but it really isn t anyone s fault but their own that they don t know the party rules  primaries aren t general elections  they re nominating processes controlled by the parties  make no mistake  if bernie sanders were in the lead or it looked like he was going to pull ahead  those superdelegates would shift their support and make sure the nominee was someone the registered voters of the party want to support when clinton was faced with the exact same scenario in   she wrote a letter to the superdelegates of the party with one last plea for support  her arguments include things like who polled better against the gop  who had spent more years arguing progressive causes and who was ultimately more qualified to execute the office of the president dear  the stakes in this election are so high  with two wars abroad  our economy in crisis here at home  and so many families struggling across america  the need for new leadership has never been greater at this point  we do not yet have a nominee   and when the last votes are cast on june   neither senator obama nor i will have secured the nomination  it will be up to automatic delegates like you to help choose our party s nominee  and i would like to tell you why i believe i am the stronger candidate against senator mccain and would be the best president and commander in chief voters in every state have made it clear that they want to be heard and counted as part of this historic race  and as we reach the end of the primary season  more than  million people have supported me in my effort to become the democratic nominee   more people than have ever voted for a potential nominee in the history of our party  in the past two weeks alone  record numbers of voters participated in the west virginia and kentucky primaries  and with  and  point margins of victory  it is clear that even when voters are repeatedly told this race is over  they re not giving up on me   and i am not giving up on them either after seven years of feeling invisible to the bush administration  americans are seeking a president who is strong  experienced  and ready to take on our toughest challenges  from serving as commander in chief and ending the war in iraq to turning our economy around  they want a president who shares their core beliefs about our country and its future and  gets  what they go through every day to care for their families  pay the bills and try to put something away for the future we simply cannot afford another four   or eight   years in the wilderness  that is why  everywhere i go  people come up to me  grip my hand or arm  and urge me to keep on running  that is why i continue in this race  because i believe i am best prepared to lead this country as president   and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock republicans have had on the electoral map and beat senator mccain in november recent polls and election results show a clear trend  i am ahead in states that have been critical to victory in the past two elections  from ohio  to pennsylvania  to west virginia and beyond  the results of recent primaries in battleground states show that i have strong support from the regions and demographics democrats need to take back the white house  i am also currently ahead of senator mccain in gallup national tracking polls  while senator obama is behind him  and nearly all independent analyses show that i am in a stronger position to win the electoral college  primarily because i lead senator mccain in florida and ohio  i ve enclosed a detailed analysis of recent electoral and polling information  and i hope you will take some time to review it carefully in addition  when the primaries are finished  i expect to lead in the popular vote and in delegates earned through primaries  ultimately  the point of our primary process is to pick our strongest nominee   the one who would be the best president and commander in chief  who has the greatest support from members of our party  and who is most likely to win in november  so i hope you will consider not just the strength of the coalition backing me  but also that more people will have cast their votes for me i am in this race for them   for all the men and women i meet who wake up every day and work hard to make a difference for their families  people who deserve a shot at the american dream   the chance to save for college  a home and retirement  to afford quality health care for their families  to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left over each month i am in this race for all the women in their nineties who ve told me they were born before women could vote  and they want to live to see a woman in the white house  for all the women who are energized for the first time  and voting for the first time  for the little girls   and little boys   whose parents lift them onto their shoulders at our rallies  and whisper in their ears   see  you can be anything you want to be   as the first woman ever to be in this position  i believe i have a responsibility to them finally  i am in this race because i believe staying in this race will help unite the democratic party  i believe that if senator obama and i both make our case   and all democrats have the chance to make their voices heard   everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee in the end  i am committed to unifying this party  what senator obama and i share is so much greater than our differences  and no matter who wins this nomination  i will do everything i can to bring us together and move us forward but at this point  neither of us has crossed the finish line  i hope that in the time remaining  you will think hard about which candidate has the best chance to lead our party to victory in november  i hope you will consider the results of the recent primaries and what they tell us about the mindset of voters in the key battleground states  i hope you will think about the broad and winning coalition of voters i have built  and most important  i hope you will think about who is ready to stand on that stage with senator mccain  fight for the deepest principles of our party  and lead our country forward into this new century the letter was followed by  pages of statistics showing that even though she was behind  the race wasn t over  in the end it was the support of superdelegates that gave obama the clear win as a bernie sanders supporter  i would love to see the last melee of primaries go his way  a big win in california and a couple of other states and there s a chance bernie becomes the best choice for the party  at which time he can realistically try to woo the superdelegates away from clinton  if hillary can hang on and secure the nomination  those of us who care about the future of our country will put our full support behind her featured image by nbc
