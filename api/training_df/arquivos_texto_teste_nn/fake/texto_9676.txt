visibly irritated during an interview with australian tv when she was asked about wikileaks  assange the interview with local australian tv has several delusional moments that reveal her continued bitterness and downright psychosis when it comes to the  election loss to donald trump  i think assange has become a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator   clinton said  apparently referring to russia s vladimir putin when the interviewer noted many people view assange as a  martyr for free speech and freedom of information  clinton wasn t having it and shot back  i mean  he s a tool of russian intelligence  if he s such a martyr for free speech  why doesn t wikileaks ever publish anything coming out of russia  the interviewer then did something our american media never does  she challenged clinton with this question  isn t he just doing what journalists do which is publish information when they get it  here s where hillary goes off the rails  i don t think so   hillary snapped   i think for number one  it s stolen information  and number two  if all you did was publish it  that would be one thing   she asserted  before claiming there was a  concerted operation between wikileaks and russia and most likely  people in the united states to  as i say  weaponized that information  hillary clinton says julian assange is a  tool of russian
