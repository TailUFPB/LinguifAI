looks like money can t protect you forever if you insist on being a lifelong asshole a texas judge on friday ordered the case of ethan couch to be transferred to an adult court  meaning the teenager faces jail time for a  drunken driving crash that killed four people the decision by the juvenile court in fort worth means that mr  couch will spend up to  days in jail  then finish his  year probation so he s only getting a maximum  month slap on the wrist for violating his probation and fleeing the country  we normal people would be screwed if we tried that  but money still talks apparently  that s the bad news here s the good news samantha k  jordan  a spokeswoman for the tarrant county district attorney s office  said a hearing  which is scheduled for april  would set the conditions of mr  couch s probation  if he violated his probation  she said  he could get up to  years in prison  it means he will actually be under supervision until    ms  jordan said   the penalties are tougher  but the way they maintain the supervision is stricter as well  considering couch is such a spoiled shit that his parents threw him a going away party after he was busted drinking when he was forbidden from doing so  there is almost no chance that he will be able to stick to his new probation  he ll get drunk again or skip a meeting with his probation officer or do something similarly stupid with the expectation of mummy and daddy taking care of it  but now that he s in the big boy justice system  it s very unlikely that the coddling will continue  one more slip up and justice will finally be served on patient zero of affluenza none of this excuses the fact that he got away with the murder of  people solely because he was rich  but at least we can trust that his continued irresponsibility will see justice served  eventually featured image via tarrant county sheriff s department
