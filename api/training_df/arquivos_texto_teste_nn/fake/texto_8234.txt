the nra tells us that guns make us safer  that a  responsible gun owner  or a  good guy with a gun  will leap into action at the first sign of danger to act as savior  unfortunately  many gun toting individuals completely fail to live up to the  gun rights  organization s lofty ideals  the problem is that a  good guy with a gun  is only a  good guy  until he pulls the trigger in a completely unwarranted situation   like in a  spat over dog poop a texas man found himself on the receiving end of gunfire after he stood his ground when a neighbor s puppy wandered into his yard and relieved itself  frustrated that the young animal came into his yard  ate his cat s food  and relieved itself  joe ramirez grabbed his trusty shotgun and ended its life  in true  responsible gun owner  fashion  he told investigators that he thought the gun was loaded with blanks   but  of course  it contained live ammunition the dog s owner heard the gunfire and the sound of her pet yelping  so she ran outside to investigate  another person noticed  as well   her neighbor  who applied a second amendment solution to the situation  when angela cruz saw ramirez standing over the dog and shooting it at close range  she opened fire on him and his roommate  fortunately injuring neither of them cruz was arrested on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon  ramirez was charged with cruelty to a non livestock animal  the dog owner and ramirez s roommate weere questioned  but were not charged with a crime unfortunately  as long as it is easy for quite literally anyone to buy a gun  we will continue to see incidents like this   where popping off shots becomes the first solution rather than an option employed only in self defense  ramirez should absolutely be charged   and punished   but think about how different the situation would have been if none of these people had guns watch a report on the shootings below featured image via screengrab
