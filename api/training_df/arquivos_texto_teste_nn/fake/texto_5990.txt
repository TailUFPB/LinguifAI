this is why republicans lost the black vote and will continue losing it for generations to come during a closed door meeting of hedge fund managers  the entertainment consisted of gop political strategist karl rove debating former al gore campaign manager donna brazile  rove is a white man from texas who frequently appears on fox news to argue for conservative points of view  brazile is a black woman who is currently vice chair of the dnc as well as an academic and author so when rove decided to  joke  that brazile should be grateful to him and the republican party because she isn t a slave today  it was not only insulting  it resulted in brazile crushing rove with historical fact  i did you a great favor bringing you into politics in the  campaign and this is how you repay me   rove asked   we re happy you got the right to vote but it wasn t your current party that was responsible for it  yeah  you read that right  rove literally took credit for the abolition movement and claimed that black people owe the republican party because of the end of slavery and the passage of the  amendment of course  republicans were liberals at that time and democrats were the conservatives  today  it s the opposite and republicans dominate the south  where racism still flourishes and confederate history is still celebrated but brazile fired back by pointing out that women did not have the right to vote until  and black people did not have their right to vote truly protected until the voting right act of   which the conservative leaning supreme court gutted in   which has led to red states instituting voter suppression laws designed to block black people from exercising their right to vote and then she really let karl rove and the republican party have it by blasting them for their hypocrisy and the fact that they have to reach back in time to the  to find an example of something good the party has done  i don t find it strange when karl rove brings up abraham lincoln because they can t bring up anything else   brazile told thinkprogress   it s easier for them speak of lincoln s accomplishments than what they are doing today on voting rights  they don t have a future reference  they have the past  exactly  flawless victory featured image via wikimedia
