trump hates the media with a passion  he often rails on twitter  and at his rallies  about the  dishonest media   and the  dishonest coverage  they give him  he complains that he s been treated very unfairly by any media outlet that doesn t immediately shove its head up his ass  and he bans outlets he deems to be too dishonest and unfair to have the privilege of covering him not once has he ever actually laid out what is  fair  but  thanks to his former campaign manager  corey lewandowski  we now have a definition for  fair  reporting  but watch out  it s pretty ridiculous  what  fairly  means is you don t editorialize  you report what he says  that s fair  if you look at the story that he did in the new york times on foreign policy  it was literally the transcript of what he said it wasn t editorialized at all  that s fair reporting  that was in response to don lemon saying that trump is bashing cnn for repeating what he says and fact checking it  so  basically   fair  is no fact checking  no discussion  just his words  nothing else all that does is give trump a license to say what he wants  because then he knows the media won t call him on it  of course  that s exactly what he wants to have happen  he wants everyone to believe him  to trust him implicitly  even though he s lying through his teeth  a huge part of his hatred toward the media is their penchant for fact checking him  and proving him false this is the most laughable definition of  fair  reporting imaginable watch a video of this below  beginning at about the   mark just now on  cnntonight  some frank talk about trump   the media with  clewandowski    donlemonhttps   t co   brian stelter   brianstelter  august    image by jeff swensen getty images
