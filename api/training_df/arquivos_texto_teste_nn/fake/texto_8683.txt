if there s one person that you don t want to mess with  it s amy schumer  she s a badass who will call you the f  k out no matter who you are  so  when one young critic decided he would bash the comedian in a tweet  needless to say  schumer had the last word  in fact  the original tweet looks to have been deleted however  the internet being what it is  the evidence remains the young film critic took a photo with schumer on the red carpet of the critics choice awards  however  instead of just being proud of that moment  because getting a photo with schumer is an honor in and of itself  he decides to try to be funny on twitter and tweets out  spent the night with amy schumer  certainly not the first guy to write that  seeing this  and obviously not amused  schumer tweeted back  i get it  cause i m a whore  glad i took a photo with you  hi to your dad  when misogyny starts young  pic twitter com   emma gray   emmaladyrose  january    young critic has since apologized because of the backlash that was thrown at him from all directions i truly apologize for the tweet i posted earlier  i m not a comedian and it wasn t funny   amyschumer  lightscamerajackson   lcjreviews  january     but the greater point still remains that this young man thought he was being funny by bashing a woman  this sort of humor is never thrown at men  and it is blatantly misogynistic  and to expand of schumer s remark of  hi to your dad   she is likely implying  nice job raising a new generation of jerks  this sort of humor from  mainly men  who think they re being funny going after women isn t anything new  it s an age old story that harkens back to the bible when eve was blamed for being tempted  men have always gotten a free pass when it comes to sexual promiscuity  and women are always shunned or made fun of for daring to show they are human beings too  so while  sure  this kid apologized for his stupid joke  because he was likely forced to by to the power of social media  he still thought it was okay to say in the first place let s stop shaming women  let s stop teaching young men that it s okay to shame women  then this sort of thing will never happen in the first place  and there will be no need to apologize featured image  twitter
