president obama is clearly in good spirits thanks to his surging approval ratings and perhaps just a dash of relief at finally getting some rest after his term ends  at a big l a  fundraiser meant to give a boost to democratic candidates this year  obama couldn t help but make a few jokes at the republican party s nightmare primary situation  and like any good joke  it was funny because there was some truth to it during the night  obama acknowledged that there are a bunch of very serious reasons to be terrified of what a trump presidency might look like  for women  minorities  those in poverty  or muslims  four years of trump are not an option  he noted that one voter met him recently and nervously asked  tell me that mr  trump is not succeeding you  but before americans despair  there is one silver lining  as obama told the crowd  the one thing we can thank trump and ted cruz for is making the stakes of this election absolutely clear  they aren t hiding behind innuendo any more  the gop s hostility towards progress is on full display  mr  trump has actually done a service as mr  cruz is doing a service and that is laying bare  unvarnished some of the nonsense that we have been dealing with in congress on a daily basis  people act as if these folks are outliers but they are not  we should thank mr  trump and mr  cruz for just being honest that this is how we re thinking these days  or not thinking these days  obama nailed it  what cruz and trump are doing is fighting for the true nature of the republican party   right out in the open  each competes to outdo the other s xenophobia  religious discrimination and hateful rhetoric  even while trump is being condemned by some in his party over his language  his closest competitor has repeatedly stated that he too will build a massive concrete wall along the southern border  both have floated the idea of discriminating against american muslims based solely on their religion  as the race sinks lower  it s hard to say which is the worse of the two for that  americans can get a clear sense of the stakes  the republican party is simply not an option if you care about women s rights  lgbt rights  the welfare of the poor  or religious tolerance  neither candidate has a platform that extends to minorities or young people  both have very high profile supporters with ties to white supremacy which is why  in a serious turn  obama said it was crucial for voters to oppose whoever gets the republican nomination ds tell  potus they will miss him   aren t excited about the  race  and i say   i have no patience for that    juliet eilperin   eilperin  april    i say to folks   we cannot be complacent    we cannot be cynical  because the stakes are too high     potus  juliet eilperin   eilperin  april    said  mr  president featured image via joshua lott getty images
