this is why john mccain really regretted blaming president obama for the orlando mass shooting on thursday  mccain told reporters in a senate hallway that president obama is  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in orlando that resulted in  people being killed and  people being wounded  barack obama is directly responsible for it  because when he pulled everybody out of iraq  al qaeda went to syria  became isis  and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama s failures   mccain said reporters gave mccain a fair chance to walk his comments back but he only repeated his claim  he pulled everybody out of iraq  and i predicted at the time that isis would go unchecked  and there would be attacks on the united states of america  it s a matter of record  so he is directly responsible  you can listen to mccain s remarks below not long after  mccain issued a statement claiming he  misspoke  even though he made his remarks twice  i misspoke   mccain said  i did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible  i was referring to president obama s national security decisions  not the president himself  as i have said  president obama s decision to completely withdraw u s  troops from iraq in  led to the rise of isil  i and others have long warned that the failure of the president s policy to deny isil safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire  plan  direct or conduct attacks on the united states and europe as they have done in paris  brussels  san bernardino and now orlando  of course  mccain is wrong about president obama pulling the troops out of iraq  that was a decision made by president bush in   president obama merely honored the agreement signed by the former president but mccain could be the former senator from arizona because of his inflammatory accusation against president obama as it turns out  donations have been pouring in for his opponent democratic rep  ann kirkpatrick to the tune of at least    alone since mccain made the remarks  mccain angered many people with his disrespectful comments about president obama and so they are responding by supporters his challenger in addition  a poll touted by kirkpatrick s campaign in the wake of mccain s remarks shows him losing to her by two points kirkpatrick spokesman d b  mitchell slammed mccain for his remarks and urged people to help oust him from congress  john mccain s reckless and appalling comments about the orlando mass shooting disappointed thousands of arizonans and people from across the nation   said kirkpatrick spokesman d b  mitchell   but his actions are just further proof that after  years in washington mccain has changed  and now americans are witnessing that he s no longer a  maverick   arizonans know it s time for new principled leadership  and that s why ann kirkpatrick saw the largest one day fundraising number of the campaign  we need a senator who will put our national security before partisan politics  we must do everything we can to elect ann to the senate and we are asking you to make a donation today  john mccain is currently facing one of the toughest re election efforts for a republican this year  losing his race could very well tip the balance in the senate and give the majority back to the democratic party you can donate to kirkpatrick s campaign here featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
