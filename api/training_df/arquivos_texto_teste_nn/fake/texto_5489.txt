no matter how well dressed  or how intelligent or how wealthy a black person is  there s no escaping skin color and there s no escaping the racial profiling that goes along with it  if anyone can prove that point  it s renowned physicist  neil degrasse tyson  who in a facebook post from tuesday  described dozens of encounters he s had with police  for no reason other than his being african american in the post  tyson told of a conference for black physicists he attended in   one evening  after enjoying good food and wine  the discussion turned to the police  the physicists began relaying stories of being pulled over by the police while most people probably have stories of being pulled over a handful of times in their lives  this table full of physicists had more than a handful of stories  and the intrusiveness of the stops was pretty telling as for me  i had a dozen different encounters to draw from  there was the time i was stopped late at night at an underpass on an empty road in new jersey for having changed lanes without signaling  the officer told me to get out of my car and questioned me for ten minutes around back with the bright head lights of his squad car illuminating my face  is this your car  yes  who is the woman in the passenger seat  my wife  where are you coming from  my parents house  where are you going  home  what do you do for a living  i am an astrophysicist at princeton university  what s in your trunk  a spare tire  and a lot of other greasy junk  he went on to say that the  real reason  why he stopped me was because my car s license plates were much newer and shinier than the  year old ford that i was driving  the officer was just making sure that neither the car nor the plates were stolen in my other stories  i had been stopped by the police while transporting my home supply of physics textbooks into my newly assigned office in graduate school  they had stopped me at the entrance to the physics building where they asked accusatory questions about what i was doing  this one was complicated because a friend offered to drive me and my boxes to my office  i had not yet learned to drive   her car was registered in her father s name  it was   pm  open topped boxes of graduate math and physics textbooks filled the trunk  and we were transporting them into the building  i wonder how often that scenario shows up in police training tapes  in total  i was stopped two or three times by other security officers while entering physics buildings  but was never stopped entering the campus gym as a scientist  tyson is cautious about jumping to conclusions  he noted that he and his colleagues had these police stops in common  were police targeting physicists for some reason  are smart people automatically suspicious  it couldn t have been the cars  some were old  some were new  some stops were during the day  some at night  the conclusion tyson made  though is that we were guilty not of dwi  driving while intoxicated   but of other violations none of us knew were on the books  dwb  driving while black   wwb  walking while black   and of course  jbb  just being black  it s rare that tyson jumps into politics  and he didn t specifically mention black lives matter or any of the infamous black victims of police  but one can certainly infer by the timing of his post  that it s in solidarity with black lives matter and it s further proof that all the education and poise in the world doesn t stop black people from being targeted  this is the very definition of white privilege he s also right  black people are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police and they re also more likely to be innocent of any wrongdoing during traffic stops  fortunately  tyson never had to go to jail  but black people are far more likely to be arrested  convicted  and yes  shot  if a group of scientists can conclude that there are racial disparities in the justice system  perhaps we should listen featured image via dimitrios kambouris with getty images
