phoenix mayor greg stanton is calling on the united states justice department to investigate arizona s  fiasco  election as arizona voters attempted to cast their votes during tuesday s presidential preference election  thousands were forced to wait in line  sometimes for up to five hours  those who were unable to wait  including thousands of voters with work  school and family commitments  as well as those with disabilities and other health problems  were forced to leave without casting a ballot as stanton points out in his letter to the justice department  maricopa county officials drastically reduced the number of available polling sites  ahead of the  election  between  and   officials eliminated  percent of polling locations  leaving just  sites open  to serve a community of more than four million people on wednesday  community leaders and angry citizens took to the streets in protest of obvious voter suppression used in maricopa county          if  d getelementbyid id

election protest in downtown phoenixposted by marc liverman on wednesday  march    complaints have not fallen on deaf ears in his letter to the justice department  stanton points out that the reduction in polling places primarily impacted black and latino communities  a prime example  in phoenix  a community in which the majority of voters are black and latino  there was just one polling place for every   voters on tuesday on the other hand  primarily white communities like cave creek carefree  there was one polling site per   voters  the same holds true in other majority white communities  including paradise valley  which had one polling location per   voters and fountain hills  where there was one polling site for every   voters but that s just the beginning of the story  on wednesday  sondra carr  a phoenix resident posted an account of what she saw on election day in maricopa county  after standing in line for hours  carr and her son finally entered the polling station here s what she says happened next when my son and i voted  there were seven voting  booths    these were cardboard dividers for privacy  there were seven  think about that   there are seven of the very things that are needed to vote and look to cost about a dollar fifty  so i m sorry but i don t buy the idea i ve since heard that this was a money saving decision  why were there not more  but that didn t even matter because when my son and i entered  there were no other voters inside  when i walked up to the booths  there were no other voters in them and while i was voting  only my own son came to stand next to me  they were purposefully trickling people in  leaving two thirds of the booths empty while  people waited outside for hours thousands of others  who waited for hours to cast their vote  discovered that their party affiliation had somehow been changed on the voter registration rolls  these voters were either turned away altogether or forced to cast a provisional ballot as mayor stanton also states  arizona has long  documented history of throwing out provisional ballots  according to stanton s letter  since   arizona officials have rejected more than   provisional ballots  that number does not include the thousands of voters who were improperly forced to vote by provisional ballot during the march  presidential preference election while election officials have attempted to cast blame on independent voters  who they claim came out to vote in tuesday s election even though they legally were barred from participating  there are two things wrong with this narrative first  many people who have been registered democrats for years discovered that their party affiliation had been changed without their knowledge or permission second  the media  arizona election officials and others also bear a large amount of blame for confusion on the part of independent voters  if they did indeed show up in record numbers at the polls   there s no actual evidence that this even happened  arizona s presidential preference election  which was held on march   is not the state s primary election the state holds its primary election on august   the actual primary does not include presidential candidates  anyone can vote in that election  including independent voters the presidential preference election is a closed election  only registered members of a political party can participate in that election so yes  independent voters can indeed vote in the state s primary  and no  tuesday s presidential preference election was not the state s primary  independent voters were not allowed to participate in that election  which was consistently referred to as the  arizona primary   when it actually wasn t blaming voters for trying to vote is a disgusting tactic  especially given the confusing system and the horrifying lack of clarity from the media and election officials mayor stanton spoke with kpnx on wednesday  watch the video below  the phoenix mayor is not the only politician to criticize tuesday s election fiasco  on wednesday  gov  doug ducey called the long lines and voter registration issues  unacceptable   while also calling for changes to the state s closed presidential preference election image credit  video screen capture via marc liverman on facebook
