vice president joe biden has nothing but glowing praise for democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders  biden  who contemplated a run for the presidency but decided to opt out  said of sanders  bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real  and he has credibility on it  and that is the absolute enormous concentration of wealth of a small group of people  with a middle class now being left out  biden was referring to sanders  consistent record of speaking out on and pushing initiatives about income inequality throughout his  career  sanders has made the issue a central theme of his campaign  biden also believes the issue of income inequality is of vital importance to the country  he said  there used to be a basic bargain  if you contributed to the profitability of an enterprise  you share in that profit  and that s been broken  productivity is up and wages are stagnant  sanders  strength is with young voters  with polls showing that he leads in double digits in that demographic  many millennials  for example  have enormous college debt and they continue to have a tough time in the job market  kei kawashima ginsberg  director of the center for information and research on civic learning and engagement  an organization that encourages young people to get involved in politics  said   part of it is really sort of the age that they grew up in  if you think about the millennials  that age group  they turned  as president george w bush took office  that s the world they grew up in  their country is at war  it seemed to have lost purpose  and then as they were graduating from college the recession hit  so the social contrast that people generally have   that you invest in your education and you get paid off   was a myth for them  one thing is his genuineness  he s been consistent warrior against economic inequality since the   and he hasn t changed a bit  although biden has not officially made an endorsement  he did meet with sanders last october to discuss campaign finance reform bernie sanders  campaign is moving in the right direction  gaining momentum at the right time more than any other candidate despite the fact that the media has not paid attention to him   if the current polls are indicative of things to come  the republicans better look out  polls show him trouncing all republican candidates  including donald trump by a wide margin featured image  marc nozell  flickr
