one of the arguments against nominating hillary clinton for president has always been that bernie would be stronger against donald trump  there was some ammunition to that argument  bernie was doing better in a lot of polls  now  hillary supporters have argued that bernie hasn t yet had full media scrutiny  but new polls show that that doesn t even matter  hillary is doing just fine on her own a new reuters ipso poll shows that hillary s lead over trump is quite comfortable and way outside the margin of error  according to the poll  she will beat trump by about eight points rasmussen is showing a tighter race  with only a four point lead  but still  a lead  even fox news shows a three point lead for hillary more significant  though  is what s happening  or not happening with donald trump  first off  the bernie or bust crowd doesn t seem to be as big a factor as many feared  only  percent of voters say they wouldn t vote or that they will vote for someone else  you can chalk that trend up to trump disillusionment at least as much as clinton disillusionment while hillary s approval ratings are going up  trump s are going down  and now  we re seeing a serious crack in his campaign  we know that trump is losing badly with women and every minority  but he s also not doing as well with white people as he needs fivethirtyeight argues that trump could win  if he brings in enough white voters  but he s not doing that trump has trailed hillary clinton in every national poll for roughly the last three weeks  he s led in only three of  polls since knocking ted cruz and john kasich from the race in early may  in fact  the only two pollsters who had trump ahead and have released a more recent poll  fox news and rasmussen reports  now show him trailing by  and  percentage points  respectively one big reason trump is trailing   by an average of  to  percentage points  depending on which aggregator you use   is because  despite all the bluster  he isn t doing any better than romney did among white voters  according to cohn s estimate  based on pre election surveys  romney beat president obama by  percentage points among white voters  to win  trump would need to improve on romney s margin by a minimum of  percentage points if the electorate looked exactly the same as it did in  and every other racial group voted in the same manner as it did in  the column goes on to say that trump is doing better than romney in what trump would call  the poorly educated   but he s doing much worse than romney with college educated white people  without women and minorities  that leaves trump in a losing situation  then  of course  there are the white people who aren t bigots featured image via getty images
