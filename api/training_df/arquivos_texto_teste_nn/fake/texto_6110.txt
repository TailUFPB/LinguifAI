as politico reports an almost neck and neck race between hillary clinton and bernie sanders  the los angeles times has endorsed the former secretary of state before the critical primary on june  the editorial board laid out plainly their support for clinton  highlighting her ability to get the job done in the face of rising populism as all the world knows  clinton would be the first woman elected president of the united states  that would be a joyous  long awaited  landmark moment in american history after centuries of discrimination and second class status for half the population  but the real reason to support her is that she is the democratic candidate most likely to get the job done as the mainstream media is peddling a completely false narrative that clinton s support is unexcited or unenthusiastic  the los angeles times destroys that now hackneyed talking point linton s candidacy might seem unexciting  but nominating a candidate for president is  or ought to be  serious business  as obama himself likely would admit after almost eight years in the white house  there is more to being president than grand promises  whether they are about  hope and change  or a political revolution  we admire bernie sanders  passion for progress and equality  but our endorsement goes to the candidate who is more likely to translate ideals into action sanders and clinton have been fighting hard to win over the california electorate  which offers up just under  delegates  nate silver s fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton a  percent chance of winning the state  but sanders has shown to be as competitive as ever the times pointed out that sanders  popular rhetoric amongst younger voters have made him a very formidable candidate who should be taken seriously  not brushed aside even heading into the convention  assuming clinton clinches the magic number of delegates to win   saying that he has made the race more substantive and he has drawn clinton to he left  the board seriously doubted his ability to bring republicans to the table but that s not to say he couldn t on the last day of registration  over   new citizens were admitted on the rolls   percent of which were between the ages of  and   a good sign for senator sanders  sanders also has outspent clinton in critical metropolitan areas all across the state  including los angeles  anaheim  san diego and so forth as the primary winds down  california will be the seemingly final hurrah in a long battle between the two progressive candidates  with one victor walking away as the nominee for president come july featured image via justin sullivan getty images
