so if natural disasters are sent by god to punish us for legalizing same sex marriage  what does it mean when a flood destroys the home of one of the biggest anti gay bigots in the country that s the question that should be asked of tony perkins  since he is now living out of an rv because a flood drove him and his family out of their louisiana home  forcing them to escape in a canoe during a family research council radio show on wednesday  perkins explained that once the water reached ten feet high his family loaded up in the boat and floated toward safety  they attempted to seek a place to stay but were denied by one shelter  so they sought refuge in the home of a former member of their church perkins is also still trying to figure out why god would smite his home  we re gonna look for what god s gonna do in this   perkins said   i m asking those questions and i m going to see  here s the audio via raw story usually  it s customary to feel sympathy for people who suffer losses due to flooding  but this is a special kind of irony that needs special commentary as we all know  conservative  christians  are constantly telling us that whenever there is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood that it s punishment by god over homosexuality or abortion or some other social issue that has them all in a tizzy  especially when that natural disaster doesn t affect them personally now  the idea that god is sending natural disasters to punish people is complete bullshit  but let s just pretend for a moment that that is the case  the perkins household just got severely damaged by a  flood of biblical proportions  as stated by perkins himself  and they were driven out of their home so by conservative logic  that must mean that he is being punished for something  and since perkins is an anti gay bigot who wants to suppress women s rights  one could easily surmise that god is sending perkins a message to stop being a dick toward other human beings  you know  actually love your neighbor and treat others the way you want to be treated but perkins will likely fail to see that message  he ll just twist it to his own advantage  because when it comes right down to it  conservative  christians  think natural disasters are only sent to punish others  but when they are affected personally they believe it s only sent by god to test their faith  in other words  complete and total hypocrisy the moral of the story  however  should be that conservatives should stop claiming that disasters are punishments by god  because there is a such thing as karma and tony perkins is learning that the hard way featured image via wikimedia
