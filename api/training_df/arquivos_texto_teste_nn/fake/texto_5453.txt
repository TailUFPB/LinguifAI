donald trump announced indiana governor mike pence as his vice presidential pick via twitter on friday and unveiled his campaign s new logo  to say the least  it didn t go over well  at all  twitter erupted in brutal mockery of the trump pence logo almost immediately  for reference  here is the image  it may well go down in history as the worst logo ever created people were quick to point out that  tp  stands for  toilet paper   which is remarkably appropriate when you consider all the crap that spills from trump s mouth every time he opens it  and of course  they had to drag poor beavis into it others were more taken aback by the way the  t  penetrates the  p   an angle that samantha bee from full frontal had quite a bit of fun with  posting the following gif with the caption breaking the mattress of america  breaking the mattress of america  pic twitter com   full frontal   fullfrontalsamb  july     the heat got a little too hot for the presumptive republican nominee  because by saturday morning the logo had completely vanished  trump and his conservative minions had scrubbed the image  trump s website no longer features the logo or even a picture of his new running mate  instead going with just a picture of the bigoted billionaire himself and his trademark slogan make america great again  the logo is also missing in action from republican the national committee s website if trump and his new best buddy pence thought it would be that easy to erase the existence of their disastrous logo failure  they clearly don t have a full understanding of how this whole internet works  this pitiful blunder will live on  if only for our amusement  in the future  trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos  honestly  you have to wonder if the logo s creator was really so clueless that the obvious shortcomings of the design just happened to slip under their radar  or if the image was just a very public trolling  either way  trump is trying really hard to pretend it didn t happen featured image via real time politics and twitter screen capture
