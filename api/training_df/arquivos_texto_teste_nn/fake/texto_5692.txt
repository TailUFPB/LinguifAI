while he s a lot wealthier  donald trump is no paul newman  like trump  newman pledges that the proceeds from his signature food sales will go to charity  trump promised that sales from trump vodka  trump university and two books would go to charity  unlike trump  newman makes good on his promise  in fact  the last time trump gave to charity  it was  if trump stands by his promises  such donations should be occurring all the time  in the past  years  trump has promised to donate earnings from a wide variety of his money making enterprises   the apprentice   trump vodka  trump university  a book  another book  if he honored all those pledges  trump s gifts to charity would have topped    million but in that time  public records show  trump donated about    million   less than a third of the pledged figure   through a foundation set up to give his money away  and there is no evidence that trump has given to his foundation lately  the last record of any gift from him to his foundation was in  source  washington postthe washington post has been on this story for a while  likely because amid claims that he gives millions of his personal funds to charity  trump refuses to offer up any proof in the way of tax returns or anything else all of this seems very strange for a man who has his own charitable foundation  while the foundation seemed to start off on the right foot  in later years  it resembles more of a way to collect money from other people than anything resembling generosity on the part of trump when he founded the donald j  trump foundation in   the mogul gave half a million dollars  and donated another million the next year  but throughout much of the   trump contributed little to his foundation  and despite his vaunted personal wealth allegedly totaling in the billions  according to publicly available records  trump personally contributed     to his foundation between  and    during that same time period  an additional     was donated by outside individuals and organizations   in seven of those years  trump personally contributed nothing even in some cases where foundation records show trump likely did follow through  the donations don t match the original lofty boasts  in   for instance  trump released  trump  the game   a version of monopoly  he bragged that the game would earn   million   and that he d give it all to aids and cerebral palsy research and toward helping the homelessness  trump barely gave money to his foundation for most of the   however two years later  a lawsuit against trump revealed that the game had earned him just    in royalties  with trump speculating that the game was perhaps too complex to be a big seller  in that same lawsuit  trump reportedly said he donated the full proceeds to his charitable foundation  he publicly said that total donations resulting from the game amounted to   million  an amount corroborated by public records source  buzzfeedthat s just the tip of the iceberg  buzzfeed documented numerous times when trump promised money and never delivered the washington post went even further and contacted  charities in search of those missing gifts promised over the last severn years  they found just one donation  it was somewhere between    and    to the police athletic league of new york city  that was it  one charity  one paltry amount of money  it makes one wonder if he wants the presidency as a money laundering scheme featured image via darren mccollester with getty images
