just when you think things can t get any more absurd than they already are  republicans go and prove you wrong  now  in the state of michigan  republicans are pushing for a law that would allow law abiding  citizens to carry concealed pistols without a government issued permit   who are these legislators that are introducing such absurd legislation  michigan reps  tom barrett  r potterville  lee chatfield  r levering  triston cole  r mancelona  and jim runestad  r white lake in hb   it states  a person shall not carry a dagger  dirk  stiletto  a double edged nonfolding stabbing instrument of any length  or any other dangerous weapon other than a pistol  except a hunting knife adapted and carried as such  concealed on or about his or her person  or whether concealed or otherwise in any vehicle operated or occupied by the person  except in his or her dwelling house  in his or her place of business  or on other land possessed by the person  to summarize  knives bad  guns good  makes sense  right according to mlive  cole  author of house bill   said the current concealed pistol license permit requirement in michigan is a  government over reach  that places an undue burden on residents who want to defend themselves against criminals   criminals don t have to go through a training class and wait for government permission to have a handgun before they commit armed robbery  yet a law abiding citizen who simply wants the option of self defense has to jump through all the hoops and pay a price to carry a concealed weapon   he said in a prepared statement  people who want to ensure the safety of their families against the criminal element should not have to beg for that right   cole said  here s a reminder for triston cole  guns safety laws are not  government overreach   in fact  the second amendment calls for a well regulated  ie  well trained and maintained  militia  the founders didn t write  well regulated  for no reason  they knew an armed populace also needs to be held under certain laws  restrictions and training  if getting a gun permit and or training is too hard for some folks  maybe they shouldn t have guns  because they apparently don t have the mental capacity to seek a proper permit  this sort of vigilante justice is exactly what s wrong with parts of america  we need more laws  not fewer  and we definitely don t need a bunch of people just going out  buying guns  and carrying them wherever they like it s amazing  really  guns and gun owners in michigan are about to have more rights than women  and the lgbt community  apparently   sodomy  is to be labeled a felony in the state and punishable by up to  years in prison  and as far as abortion rights for women  here are the restrictions in michigan keep in mind  abortion is legal nationwide  and has been since  it is absolutely outrageous how these republicans will say that going to get a gun permit is  government overreach   yet in the same breath go in to people s bedrooms and call them a felon  or into a woman s uterus and call her a murderer they definitely have their priorities backwards  and should be condemned for this outrageous way of thinking featured image  wikimedia commons
