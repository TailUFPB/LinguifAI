jedediah bila is at most  a lukewarm conservative  she s a hardcore trump hater  so the show gave her a little leeway when it came to expressing her lukewarm conservative views  apparently  no one gave her permission  however  to ask hillary clinton to accept some responsibility for her loss during a taped segment last week when hillary agreed to appear on the view to hawk her new book   what happened  that explains why everyone else is to blame after was clobbered in the  presidential election by donald j  trump  she certainly didn t expect to be challenged by the token conservative  who clearly hates president trump  in other words  hillary and likely the entire panel of dingbats on the view believed she was entering a  safe space   but that didn t turn out to be the case  as bila zinged her with an unexpected question  that forced hillary to scramble for an acceptable answer to her question  of course  hillary s answer had nothing whatsoever to do with the question bila asked her  as hillary hilariously attempted to blame the media for her loss  the   point is where bila crosses hillary not surprisingly only one week after bila s question of hillary  the token conservative host finds herself in the unemployment line  while meghan mccain  the daughter of one of the worst rino s in the senate will be taking bila s spot  as the lukewarm conservative on the panel of hosts with the dingbats of the view meghan mccain told liberal rag people magazine that she shed tears when donald trump officially won the gop nomination for president at the republican convention for anyone who thinks bila expected to be exiting the view  a quick look at a couple of her most recent posts on facebook show that she was gearing up for the next season with the dingbats at the view only  days ago  bila posted about hoping that hillary would come back to discuss the issues with her most of her questions were softball questions and she spent a great deal of time trashing our president  but something happened lately  as jedediah seemed to be actually defending her conservative principles  she recently challenged the racist  trump hating ca congresswoman  maxine waters and her over the top rhetoric about our sitting president  the hyena s on the panel and the clapping seals in the audience would have nothing to do with an opinion that is contrary to anything other than the hard left  why bila put up with those dingbats for so many seasons is a mystery to many who watched  apparently hating donald trump is enough to land a semi talented female a coveted seat at the view s leftist propaganda table watch maybe it was just the clinton interview that ended her career  or maybe it was a combination of the waters and then clinton interviews  either way  the view can sit back and rest easy  as meghan mccain doesn t have a conservative bone in her body  and the  goebbels sisters  can now carry on  uninterrupted with their disinformation campaign about president trump and about the american people who support him
