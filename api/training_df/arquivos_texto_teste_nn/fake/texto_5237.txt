when khizr khan took the stage at the dnc to give a heartfelt speech about the very real sacrifice his muslim son made in iraq  and to call out trump on his anti muslim hatred as the height of insult against people like capt  khan  many probably expected the gop to hop on board and repudiate trump  after all  insulting those who fight to keep us safe from terrorism is just sick and wrong it seems now that we ll all be waiting a long time to hear them do that  house speaker paul ryan  and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  have indeed issued statements against trump  but they re so weak and watery that they re meaningless  empty gestures mcconnell said  captain khan was an american hero  and like all americans i m grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like capt  khan and their families have made in the war on terror  all americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services  and as i have long made clear  i agree with the khans and families across the country that a travel ban of all members of a religion is simply contrary to american values  some of that is word salady enough to make us tilt our heads and think   say what   ultimately  though  mcconnell got what he deserved from the twitterverse  they see right through the meaninglessness of this statement  particularly because it s paired with the gop s continuing endorsement of trump     paul ryan s statement wasn t much better  he said   america s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it  as i have said on numerous occasions  a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values  i reject it  many muslim americans have served valiantly in our military  and made the ultimate sacrifice  captain khan was one such brave example  his sacrifice and that of khizr and ghazala khan should always be honored  period  his statement is clearer  but no less empty than mcconnell s  twitter saw right through him  too      given that trump has since insulted both khizr and his wife publicly  instead of apologizing to a grieving family for his cold hearted fuckery  it s more important than ever for the gop to publicly reject him  in fact  khizr has pleaded with them to do just that  they won t  though  these statements make that clear the only way for republicans to prove that trump doesn t speak for them on this issue is to directly and bluntly reject him  since he obviously doesn t represent american values  they should have done this months ago  and they didn t because they re impotent  now they re stuck supporting trump  which makes them the party of all the hate trump spews forth from his black and shriveled soul image of paul ryan by joe raedle getty images  image of mitch mcconnell by drew angerer getty images  images merged by rika christensen
