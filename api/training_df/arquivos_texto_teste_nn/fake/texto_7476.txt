republican front runner donald trump has caused a lot of outrage since stepping into the race for the white house  and with good reason  the billionaire is the worst person to run for the highest office since white supremacist george wallace in   but for all the anger he has caused  he s also given comedians a whole lot of material  the latest comedian to capitalize on the trump train wreck is russell brand and it is hilarious brand has long been a champion of economic and social justice in both the united states and the u k  the comedian often speaks out about politics and once said  i have never voted  like most people i am utterly disenchanted by politics  like most people i regard politicians as frauds and liars and the current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites  although  i don t agree with him not taking advantage of his right to vote in the u k   i do agree that lots of people have become disenchanted with politics  actually  part of the reason donald trump has risen to the top of the gop race is because he isn t part of the  establishment  and his imbecilic fan club believes he is honest   but  i digress brand has a successful v blog called the trew news which has unfortunately been on hiatus for the last six months  however  on tuesday  the comedian surprised us all by posting a short new video online where he absolutely pummels trump  in the video titled  trump   pixar hitler or aged baby   brand says  i like him cause he s like a big rich baby  i just want to breastfeed him  come here you silly c nt  have a bit of t t milk  he is like a giant  rich baby and he proves it every time he lashes out at people who do not give him what he wants  he d be a disaster for this country and everyone knows it  even comedians from other countries  we are a laughingstock all over the world thanks to him and all the dumbasses who support him watch the rest of brand s remarks in his video  featured image via instagram
