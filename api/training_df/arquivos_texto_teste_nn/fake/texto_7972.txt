it looks at though sen  ted cruz will actually have to contend with a complaint issued by an illinois voter who believes that the texas senator is not a natural born citizen of the united states  after all  it is true the cruz was born in calgary  alberta canada  so if found not to be a natural born citizen  it would disqualify cruz from not only being on the ballot in illinois  but would raise questions nationwide the voter  lawrence joyce  is bringing the complaint before the circuit court of cook county in chicago  he tried previously to have it be heard  but the case was dismissed  however  according to usa today  he appealed the decision and was granted a hearing for friday before judge maureen ward kirby  joyce  a pharmacist and attorney  and backer of ben carson  said  what i fear is that ted cruz becomes the nominee  come september  congressman alan grayson of florida will go forward with his threats and probably several other democrats will file suit to prevent ted cruz from being on the ballot  what democrats will do at that point is cherry pick which county courthouse they are going to show up in order to file these petitions  it will definitely be interesting to see what happens in this case  because if cruz is determined not to be a natural born citizen  the implications nationwide would be huge just recently  another complaint was brought up in new york over his eligibility  and yet another in the senator s home state of texas cruz has  time and time again  insisted that he is  in fact  a natural born citizen because his mother was born in delaware  usa  thus making his a natural born citizen through birth  although  this is still hotly contested by scholars nationwide  perhaps only time will tell  and we ll all have to wait for the outcome of this hearing featured image  flickr
