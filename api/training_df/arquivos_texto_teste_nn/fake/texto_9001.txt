just days after forsaking her stanford cardinals by supporting the iowa hawkeyes in the rose bowl to pander for votes  carly fiorina complained that ted cruz says  whatever  to get elected during an interview on cnn  fiorina launched an attack on the texas tea party hero  who is currently leading in some iowa polls ahead of the first primary vote in february  the failed former ceo of hewlett packard whined about cruz saying whatever it takes to get voters to support him  ted cruz is just like any other politician  he says one thing in manhattan  he says another thing in iowa  he says whatever he needs to say to get elected  and then he s going to do as he pleases  i think the american people are tired of the political class that promises much and delivers much of the same  but as right as she is about ted cruz  fiorina completely ignored her own hypocrisy when it comes to pandering for weeks  fiorina pandered to conservative  christians  by claiming that heavily edited planned parenthood videos featured footage of a live fetus being butchered for body parts  fiorina s claims have since been thoroughly debunked by media and medical professionals she has also pandered to women by falsely claiming that   percent of the jobs lost during barack obama s first term belonged to women   when in fact  women actually gained jobs fiorina also pandered to the military by accusing president obama of ending the careers of several generals  however  only two of the five she mentioned retired due to policy differences with their commander in chief time and time again  fiorina has lied in an effort to gain support  politifact has caught her lying around  percent of the time but her worst attempt to pander came on friday when she wrote a twitter post rooting for the iowa hawkeyes football team against her own alma mater in a clear effort to gain support from iowa voters love my alma mater  but rooting for a hawkeyes win today   rosebowl  carly fiorina   carlyfiorina  january    host dana bash also pointed out fiorina s hypocrisy on sunday  to which fiorina responded by claiming that the tweet was just her way of having a little fun and was not meant to pander at all  for heaven s sake  can t a girl ever have a little bit of fun   fiorina asked  that was a tongue in cheek tweet which the people of iowa understand  because i was asked over and over again in iowa  having attended a hawkeye tailgate  i was asked  they knew that my heart was torn  let s just say if the biggest mistake i make is a tongue in cheek tweet about a rose bowl  the american people will sleep safely when i am president of the united states   she added   it was tongue in cheek  for heaven s sake  a girl needs to have a little fun sometimes  i guess it was a slow news day in the media  here s the video via youtube however  contrary to what fiorina claims  iowa fans  nor anyone else for that matter  did not understand and were definitely not happy about fiorina s tweet as she was roundly criticized in reply after reply to her tweet furthermore  as mentioned earlier  fiorina s tweet is not the only mistake she has made throughout her campaign  nor is it the biggest  and it should also be noted that fiorina played the woman card to spin out of her twitter fiasco  rather than own up to her obvious pandering play  fiorina framed it as a girl just having fun and suggested that the media is being sexist sorry  carly  but that just doesn t fly  you are currently polling at  percent in iowa  clearly  you are desperate for higher poll numbers as it becomes ever more clear that your campaign is doomed  so  you made a choice to pander to iowans by throwing your own team under a bus instead of displaying loyalty to the university you graduated from  and then your decision was made worse after stanford absolutely destroyed iowa on the football field to win the rose bowl  if any other team had been playing the hawkeyes  perhaps your tweet would have been appropriate  but that was not the case  you got caught pandering and now you re trying to frame it as a girl having a little fun and an evil sexist media attacking you for it  that s called playing the victim and it s not very appealing to voters either carly fiorina should be so embarrassed right now that she ends her campaign in disgrace instead of continuing to pretend that people actually like her and that she has a chance to actually win featured image  flickr
