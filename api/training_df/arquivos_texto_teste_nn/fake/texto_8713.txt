donald trump practically got booed off the stage talking to a bunch of tea party activists on saturday after he started talking about ted cruz in a negative light  shortly after getting a taste of his own medicine  i e  throwing people out of his events  simply because he doesn t like them  trump suddenly called it a night and ended his speech  he must not have liked the booing very much here s what trump started saying before the commotion started  you give a campaign contribution to ted cruz  you get whatever the hell you want  and he s a very nice guy but you have to get   right  as soon as these very words left the crevice of trump s mouth  the booing immediately commenced  let s just say this  mr  entertainer didn t seem to like it very much  he quickly snapped back  saying a lot of the same things over and over very nervously while trying to maintain his composure  excuse me  excuse me  he didn t report his bank loans  say whatever you want  he didn t report his bank loans  he s got bank loans from goldman sachs  he s got bank loans from citigroup  and then  and then  he acts like robin hood  say whatever you want but it doesn t work that way  right now donald trump and ted cruz are locked in an intense battle for the top spot in the republican party  their so called truce earlier on in the primary season is essentially over if the last republican debate is any indication  but  that s to be expected  this is when the crazy season begins  the iowa caucuses are only two weeks away trump plans on hitting ted cruz more on his alleged birther status  and cruz will still pretend to like trump as long as his poll numbers continue to rise  that s the thing   it all goes back to the polls  republican candidates worship those numbers more than the bible  they ll do whatever works to win this thing expect trump to keep on saying negative things in an attempt to drive up his numbers  with ted cruz rising in popularity that only means the possibility of more booing for trump featured image via screen capture
