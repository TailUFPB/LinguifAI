john oliver has taken aim at the section of the financial services industry which has seen the most complaints registered with the consumer financial protection bureau   and it s beautiful credit reporting agencies like experian  equifax and transunion are responsible for providing an accurate assessment of a person s credit worthiness  their verdict decides whether a person can get a loan  buy a house  rent an apartment  or even get a job  but something has been going very wrong in the industry oliver notes that over half of employers are now conducting credit searches before choosing to hire prospective employees   even though someone s credit rating has zero link to their job experience or skill level what s worse  is that this largely unregulated industry has been found to supply false information up to   of the time  and those affected won t even know that the company is attributing false information in their name until the report has been submitted and the damage has been done a faulty credit report caused by some clerical error has the potential to reap havoc in your life   and yet  it is happening all the time  oliver cites the case of a man attempting to rent his dream apartment  who ended up fighting allegations of being a terrorist  after the credit company s faulty criminal background check no surprise then that more people complain about credit report agencies to the consumer financial protection bureau  that anyone else  yet  the industry recently boasted about being right   of the time  oliver explains exasperatedly  but when you are holding records for more than  million individuals  that  percent error rate affects  million people  they re basically saying   great news everyone   we only f cked up a group equivalent to the entire population of sweden  we re the f cking greatest    oliver takes revenge by setting up new websites for the leading companies in this remarkably dodgy industry experian becomes experianne com  a company that specializes in whispering passages from  mein kampf  into the ears of babies  without the permission of parents or the babies themselves   with the important disclaimer   please do not mistake us for experian  what they do is unforgivable  transunion becomes tramsonion com   we re a company whose only business is selling steaks made out of dead orcas from seaworld   and of course   we are not affiliated with transunion  we are not monsters  equinox becomes equifacks com  a company which  takes an animal from a shelter that needs a good home  lets it come to your house to lick peanut butter off your dick  and then immediately returns it to the shelter   make sure you don t mistake them for equifax though  because  those f ckers are evil  nice work mr oliver  nice work  featured image via screen capture
