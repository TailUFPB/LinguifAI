while democratic and republicans candidates continue to battle it out for who will win their respective nominations  new polling has suggested some very likely outcomes  it looks as though if donald trump is the republican nominee  not only will it tear the gop into shreds  but they also won t stand a chance of winning the general election in november according to a new cnn orc poll  both hillary clinton and bernie sanders would crush donald trump in the general election  in fact  the only candidate that may give either democratic candidate a run for their money would be marco rubio  but so far in this primary process he has yet to win one state  so the chances of that happening are little to none  clinton and sanders would also beat cruz  carson and kasich it looks as though hillary would best trump  percent to  percent and sanders  percent to  percent  and the pattern of polling suggests for both democrats that this will only increase for both of them as the months go on  needless to say  a trump republican nomination would handily lead to another democrat in the white house here s the thing  though  to make sure of this much needed defeat of donald trump  who is looking more and more like the potential nominee  liberals are going to need to unite behind whichever candidate gets the nomination  this would mean hillary supporters backing sanders  and sanders supporters backing hillary come november  basically  no matter who   vote blue  unless  of course  you d like to see a racist madman instill fascism into the nation  because in that case  by all means  stay home and have yourself a pity party all things considered  it s looking remarkably good for democrats and painfully desperate for republicans  if democrats are able to unite while the republican party disintegrates before our very eyes  we will have a democrat in the white house featured image  instagram flickr flickr
