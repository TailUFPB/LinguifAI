houston  texas trial lawyer and democrat mega donor steve mostyn died on thursday in what authorities are saying was a  suicide   according to the houston chronicle  mr  mostyn was only   he left behind a wife and several children  and earlier this year had announced that he was going to be stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family details about how mr  mostyn allegedly committed suicide are slim  however  his family said that it happened after he  suddenly  became afflicted with some sort of mental illness then took his own life  although they weren t clear as to what type of mental illness he suffered from but it is worth noting that mr  mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past  according to his family  further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died mr  mostyn was a progressive powerhouse who was heavily involved in politics throughout his career  he made his fortunes off of suing insurance companies after hurricanes ravaged his state  and used his wealth to fund numerous democrat and progressive causes  including the super pac  ready for hillary   which he and his wife co founded with susie tompkins buell  a radical environmentalist and member of george soros s democracy alliance mr  mostyn s wife  amber  was also a member of the democracy alliance and a close friend of former secretary of state hillary clinton  who was the keynote speaker at a  annie s list event honoring amber  the mostyns were close to the clintons in general  having held numerous high dollar fundraisers for hillary s failed  presidential run at their houston home houston chronicle  in  alone  mostyn donated    million to various pro democratic super pacs ranging from planned parenthood to texans for america s future to priorities usa action  a pro barack obama pac  according to the center for public integrity in   he and his wife donated approximately   million to democratic candidates  including state sen  wendy davis  who we running against republican greg abbott  davis lost  i am heartbroken   davis tweeted thursday   texas has lost an extraordinary person  steve was a committed and effective fighter for justice  a wonderful husband  father and friend  he leaves behind a lasting impact on everyone who s life he touched  mostyn and his wife  amber  were co founders of the ready for hillary pac  a political action committee supporting clinton s unsuccessful campaign for president  at the same time  state campaign finance records show he also contributed to a police affiliated pac that supported republican primary candidates mostyn also help fund the texas organizing project and battleground texas  two democratic comeback strategies for the party that has not won a statewide election in two decades  it s hard to really quantify the hole it leaves for progressives  he s probably the first true financial benefactor for progressives in houston  and i say that because it s really different than supporting individual candidates the way trial lawyers have collectively in the past  he really supported the underlying causes  which is a different kind of take  and i m not sure that gets filled  certainly not immediately  despite the mostyns and the law firm s high profile political activism   they contributed more than    million to texas politicians in    mostyn told the texas tribune in a september interview that he was growing tired of almost single handedly funding democratic candidates in a state that was solidly republican he said he intended to downscale his political giving to democrats in texas elections to encourage others to step forward   we ve asked other people to do it and they want to do it and i want other people to get credit for doing it   the tribune quoted him as saying   i mean this is a giant  giant state  if we were trying to flip vermont we d be done  however  their relationship came under stress in   when ethics watchdog group foundation for accountability and civic trust  fact  filed a formal complaint against hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the ready for hillary super pac  the daily caller reported  fact has also

actively considering acquisition of boeing aircraft  and this is a shameless pitch  in   boeing landed the russian deal  worth    billion  and two months later  the company donated    to the clinton

business deals involving clinton foundation donors now coming under scrutiny boeing shareholder david almasi recently confronted ceo james mcnerney about the ethics of it  that opens the door to charges of honest services fraud  that there was a quid pro quo between the clinton foundation  the state department  and boeing   almasi said in prepared answers to questions posed to boeing by fox

the long term interests and hopes of the haitian people   the spokesman said  the company also pointed out that it gave the american red cross    million after the devastating  earthquake clinton

gore adviser richard goldstein but the financial connections don t end there  boeing also paid former president bill clinton    for a speech in   it was a speech that was approved by the state
