twitter is presumptive presidential nominee donald trump s favorite platform for his many offensive rants  however  like most social media platforms  there are rules against certain kinds of language  that includes hate speech against marginalized groups of people  to that end  the twitter account of singer azealia banks was recently shut down because of racist and homophobic hate speech  that is a good thing  but  none other than bette midler pointed out something that should be obvious to all  if they are applying this rule against bigotry on their social networking platform  why the hell wasn t donald trump banned from twitter a long ass time ago midler tweeted twitter deactivated azealia banks  account for homophobia   racism so why is donald trump still here   bette midler   bettemidler  may     the thing is  nobody should be tweeting out hateful speech of any kind  but isn t it a little suspicious that trump can troll women  be an open racist and misogynist on a regular basis via his twitter account  and nothing happens to him  instead  the social media giant chose to use a black woman as a way to make the point that they are cracking down on the cesspool of an atmosphere on that site the thing is  the very nature twitter means that it s going to be a pretty rough and tumble place to hang out  the platform lends itself to deliberately off the cuff  say what you think when you re thinking it remarks  that in and of itself is a recipe for disaster and perfect haven for trolling  the thing is  though  if you re going to try to clean the place up  twitter powers that be  maybe you should start with the real problem  which is the likes of donald trump that would send a real message  nobody is saying that azealia banks didn t deserve to be suspended while she cools off for a bit  but the only message you sent with this suspension is a double standard when it comes to how you treat white men vs  how you treat black women  after all  trump is running for president and has been as hateful as they come via your platform on a grand scale for eons now  and you ve done absolutely nothing  is that really the message you want to send featured image via bette midler twitter
