if you re someone who looks at the prospect of four  or eight   years of president trump with a mixture of depression and terror  imagine what it must be like to be a soldier who may have to serve in the military under him trump will have no problem  say  ordering you to commit war crimes  or torture  or to go to war  the possibility of trump becoming president represents the likelihood that you will be made to do something that will not only dishonor your country  but yourself as well  needless to say  the prospect makes for some very worried soldiers in the united states military as part of a uso tour with president obama  jon stewart stopped by to emcee the joining forces  anniversary event at joint base andrews  most of his jokes were good natured  but the former daily show host couldn t help but addressing the very large  very orange elephant in the room while speaking about vice president joe biden  who joined stewart on stage  the comedian noted that many people criticize biden for   whatever he thinks of  whatever comes into his mind   but it reminded him of someone else  who would have thought that now  that gets you the republican nomination  so  um   laughter  don t worry  trump s gonna keep you busy when he s the commander in chief  you re gonna have to paint all the planes with  trump  in big gold letters  you re gonna be busy  during the extended punchline on trump  the audience went from laughing  to uncomfortable gasps and groans  to dead silence  it was a good joke  but the nugget of truth at the center of it was deeply unsettling donald trump has shown absolutely no ability to control himself during his campaign  his half hearted stabs at being more  presidential  have ended   without fail   within  hours  often these forays into  seriousness  end spectacularly  after the press had lauded trump for being more mature  he attended a rally in which he floated the idea that ted cruz s father was linked to the jfk assassination  he s about to have the most powerful military in the history of mankind at his beck and call painting  trump  in gold on airplanes isn t the only thing trump might have these soldiers do  given his temperament  his thin skin  and his ability to contradict himself endlessly  trump could wake up one morning and just  decide  to go to war  and to defend his bruised ego  he would be willing to send the very same men and women standing in front of jon stewart into battle  their silence speaks volumes they ll be busy alright watch jon stewart give his brutal prediction about trump below  via mediaite s tommy christopher  jon stewart tells troops  trump s gonna keep  by dailypoliticsfeatured image via daily motion screengrab
