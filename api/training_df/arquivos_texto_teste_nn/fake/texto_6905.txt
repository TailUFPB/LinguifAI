it looks as though there are still men who think forcing themselves on women should be perfectly acceptable  there are clearly also still men who feel the need to defend men who force themselves on other women  and speak out against programs that require consent yes  folks  this is the united states of america in the year  on thursday  fox news business host stuart varney had fellow fox flunky andrew napolitano on to discuss the  yes means yes  movement and harvard s secret society of all male clubs who stated that women can t be involved because men can keep it in their pants  i m sorry  because the men may be falsely accused of sexual assault  and because men may go after women  it s best to just continue the tradition of keeping women as second rate and exclude them from the clubs and of course  varney completely agreed with harvard  they are faced with the possibility of admitting women or are forced to admit women then they are therefore increasing the likelihood of a lawsuit  because if a man in this day in age holds the hand of a woman on a date without first asking permission  that is an assault  in come the lawyers  yeah  making light of rape is always a wise thing to do  for f cks sake varney apparently thinks   the real story here now is  the law is now controlling intimate relationships between men and women  lawyers  the law should not be in the middle of an intimate dating relationship between the sexes  yes  women  stay quiet and let men have their way with you  stupid lawyers and their wanting to uphold the law  keeping women safe and holding abusers accountable varney then goes on to complain about how  no means no  has turned into  yes means yes  because clearly getting consent in the affirmative is an overwhelming concept for him then napolitano agrees with him  saying that the whole thing  is insane   and thinks that  not every un consented to touching is any of the business of the government  adding  i can t imagine that the failure to say  yes  is a criminal assault  actually  andrew   that s exactly what it is the fact that these men are sitting here and defending unconsented touch is not only deplorable  but horrific  if they want to be able to force themselves on women  they should at least be forced out of a job  what say you  fox news featured image via video screen capture  ht  raw story
