despite donald trump s bravado and far too many in the mainstream media reporting on the hate and misogyny in his campaign as if it simply a normal presidential enterprise  there are some major problems on team trump a new report from the new york times finds all manner of dysfunction and infighting in trump s campaign  which previous reports have noted   simply didn t expect republican opposition to give up the ghost like it did during the primaries among the weirder dysfunctional behavior  trump staffers think they re being spied on a sense of paranoia is growing among his campaign staff members  including some who have told associates they believe that their trump tower offices in new york may be bugged this isn t out of nowhere  trump has built the campaign  as the time terms it  around his  unpredictable personality  and the  nearly a dozen republicans inside and outside the operation  told them the entire thing is a chaotic mess now  many republican officials worry that mr  trump is uninterested in transitioning into his new role  including the rigors of going up against mrs  clinton in a general election fight the trump operation  for instance  has talked for weeks about hiring a full time communications director  but has yet to bring anyone on board  ms  hicks is still the sole communications staff member  the clinton campaign  by contrast  has a press team of more than a dozen  including people devoted solely to the news media for black and hispanic audiences even more troubling for republicans  trump has expressed disdain for a data driven campaign  preferring instead to run as he did in the primaries  from one media spectacle rally to the next  but general election voters are not primary voters  they will not be excited and engaged by the racist antics of trump s anti latino  anti muslim  anti woman crowds  in all likelihood they will be turned off by it and in modern politics  as president obama showed in spectacular fashion in   data drives campaigns  in addition to a polished campaigner like obama  a candidate needs the nerds to mine the data  send out targeted messages  and get voters out to the polls  by all accounts  hillary clinton has done that  as the democratic party has continued to build on obama s success by contrast  republicans in the swing states  florida  ohio  etc   are now begging the national party for money and people while the democrats and the clinton campaign are already on a general election footing but trump has his personal jet and his rallies  so he s happy featured image via flickr
