this is hilarious and sad ever since new jersey governor chris christie became trump s personal whipping boy by endorsing him despite having nothing but bad things to say about the republican nominee throughout the primary he has been repeatedly humiliated in february  trump told his lap dog to leave the stage and go home and a hot mic caught the whole exchange  get on the plane and go home  it s over there  go home   trump told christie  who replied   okay  in march  trump totally embarrassed christie again during an attack against ohio governor john kasich  kasich is such a bad governor  trump claimed  that he may be even worse than christie  it was a burn that trump used as christie was standing nearby and in may  trump went on a rant about nabisco moving a factory to mexico  as he vowed not to eat another oreo  trump pointed directly at christie and told him that he can t eat oreos anymore either  neither is chris  you re not eating oreos anymore   trump declared now donald trump is once again humiliating chris christie  who  again  is a sitting governor  this time a story has emerged of chris christie being relegated to nothing more than trump s personal food delivery boy according to ryan lizza of the new yorker governor chris christie  of new jersey  another of trump s opponents early in the campaign  has transformed himself into a sort of manservant  who is constantly with trump at events   one republican told me that a friend of his on the trump campaign used snapchat to send him a video of christie fetching trump s mcdonald s order  yes  apparently there might actually be a video of chris christie picking up trump s order from mcdonald s which clearly make christie the laughingstock of republican party this is man who claimed to be a leader  this is a man who is infamous for being a bully  but he has been reduced to being nothing more than the head of fast food delivery for the trump campaign  that s pathetic and the people of new jersey deserve better featured image  sean rayford getty images  modified
