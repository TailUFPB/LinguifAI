we have roughly  billion opinion polls going around regarding the presidential election  and right now  they all show trump and hillary either locked in a dead heat  or hillary leading  across the nation and in key states  of course  this means the polls are rigged  or at least biased  right  right  so breitbart  being of sound editorial judgment  commissioned gravis to conduct their own poll  the results hillary leads trump  percent to  percent that s in a four way race  not a two way  the poll surveyed   people on august   and carries a   percent margin of error  so hillary is outside of even that alex marlow  editor in chief at breitbart  has this to say about their poll  it s an open secret that polls are often manipulated and spun to create momentum for a particular candidate or issue  breitbart news network s first national poll marks the start of a major initiative to give our readers an accurate assessment on where the american people stand on the key topics and people of the day   without the mainstream media filter  it s pretty telling when the poll you conducted  with the intent of being as neutral as possible  brings back the same results as the polls you think are biased  this poll has hillary leading trump by five percent  in a four way race  reuters ipsos  most recent poll likewise has hillary leading by five points  economist yougov has her up by six points  and even rasmussen reports has her up by three points but trump s crowds are huge and hillary s aren t  so of course the polls are screwy  breitbart and gravis are trying to put a positive spin on it  though  saying that the poll reveals areas where trump can reach more voters  for some reason  doug kaplan  managing partner at gravis  thinks things like  percent support for trump from the black community presents a problem for hillary  his rationale seems to be based only on the fact that hillary has less support from the black community than obama did in  hillary also won big when it came to the question   do you agree or disagree  donald trump hillary clinton would fight for people like me   overall  only  percent feel that hillary would fight for them  and trump had  percent of that  however  when it came to muslims  a stunning  percent said they think she ll fight for them obviously  trump won t have that kind of support from the muslim community  not with his islamophobic remarks toward them overall  breitbart walked away from this with egg on their face  because they sought to prove one thing and failed miserably  in the end  all they showed is that either gravis is biased  too  or that  gasp   the polls are more accurate than the right would like to believe photo of hillary by justin sullivan getty images  photo of donald trump by alex wong getty images  images merged by rika christensen
