the sweep of crazy anti transgender bathroom laws has brought out the bigots in droves  one such bigot is texas police officer tracy murphree  who is also potentially in the running to become sheriff of an entire county in the lone star state  murphree decided to post to facebook his feelings on transgender women   and that s not all  this cop actually said that he would beat any transgender woman in a public restroom with his daughter until she lost consciousness  this whole bathroom thing is craziness i have never seen  all i can say is this  if my little girl is in a public women s restroom and a man  regardless of how he may identify  goes into the bathroom  he will then identify as a john doe until he wakes up in whatever hospital he may be taken to  your identity does not trump my little girl s safety  i identify as an overprotective father that loves his kids and would do anything to protect them  luckily  murphree was quickly put in his place by amber dyden briggle  who once ran for denton county council  she also happens to have a transgender son  briggle responded to murphee  as the parent of a transgender child who is only  years old  tracy  this   really  really upsets me   she wrote   i know you are a protective parent  but so am i  if my son were to walk into a women s room  looking the way he does  he would no doubt be corrected and sent to the men s room  what we ve done now is call attention to a young child  only  years old  who is now behind closed doors with a bunch of men   had he walked in there to use the bathroom to pee in the first place  no one would have batted an eye  because he looks like and is a boy   let me put it another way  halfway through first grade  this perfect child of mine  who is just as miraculous and amazing today as he was on the day of his birth  stopped feeling comfortable using the girls  room  but  of course  the bigoted murphree doubled down on his hatred and said that briggle is the problem  not him  amber  you have demonstrated part of the problem  you advocate your right to defend your child and state that your child has the right to pee in peace  yet when i advocate my right to defend my child and her right to pee in peace i m a bigot and dangerous  i m not a bigot i have nothing against you or your child  i would defend both of you with my life  yes  i will be the next sheriff  and i will serve all citizens  i will not sit back and not voice my beliefs and opinions  i will not give in to the political correctness police  i won t be threatened by those who may call me a bigot or ignorant  i have no issue with transgenders  that s between them and god  the few transgenders rights do not trump the rights of the many  i will not stand by in political correctness afraid of being labeled and allow a male to enter a bathroom my daughter occupies  i just won t do it  mr  murprhee is the last person who should be on any police force  he has shown himself to be violent against those he hates and or does not understand  he is incapable of listening to logic and reason  or of learning to be accepting of diverse groups of people  this man is dangerous  he has explicitly said that he will harm his constituents for the  crime  of using a public bathroom denton county  please do not elect this violent brute as your next sheriff featured image via wikimedia
