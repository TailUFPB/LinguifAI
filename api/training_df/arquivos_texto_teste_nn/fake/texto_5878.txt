after the horrific attacks that claimed  lives and wounded  others in orlando  the nation was given two options  a leader who would respond with swift  collected action  or a reality tv host whose answer is  again  to ban all muslims well that was enough for one former republican senator  after listening to the two different candidates  larry pressler  who served in the united states senate from south dakota for  years  decided he would be endorsing hillary clinton for the presidency the moderate republican  who lost reelection to democrat tim johnson  arrived at the decision after coming to the conclusion that the united states need complete universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons after the shooting  he was even shocked at himself for endorsing clinton i can t believe i m endorsing hillary clinton for president  but i am  this morning i woke up and told my wife   did i really do that   but i did  if someone had told be  years ago i would do this  i wouldn t have believed them pressler slammed donald trump for his nazi german rhetoric and the republican party over stonewalling gun control conversations  saying the party is disenfranchising him and other republicans who want to see change we need to go the route of more gun control as a result of orlando and all the other shootings that have occurred  but it s almost as though republicans are saying gun control shouldn t be part of the conversation at all   this election is starting to sound like the german elections in the late   this is a very dangerous national conversation we re slipping into pressler  a mormon  also says trump is making mormons uneasy over his rhetoric  and says he knows all too well what religion persecution brings republicans have lost another of their own due to trump s dangerous demagoguery  and more will certainly follow  congratulations  nra  you re helping gun weary republicans see the light of your evils and manipulation featured image via amy sussman getty images
