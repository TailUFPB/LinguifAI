the conversation regarding super delegates has been very divisive in the democratic party  hillary clinton supporters cite her overwhelming super delegate support as evidence hillary clinton is the best candidate  while bernie sanders supporters cite it as evidence of corruption and an out of touch party  as many of those super delegates pledged allegiance to secretary clinton before the primaries even began super delegates don t cast their votes until the convention  so counting their votes before then when they can change until then is pointless  but it is noteworthy that bernie sanders finally received his first endorsement in the u s  senate  senator jeff merkley of oregon wrote an op ed in the new york times outlining why he supports bernie sanders for president  in the op ed  senator merkley said how he thinks both hillary clinton and bernie sanders are great candidates  but only bernie sanders will help us rethink how our economy and our politics work  under president obama s leadership  our country is fairer and more prosperous for all than it was seven years ago  but as we look toward the next administration  there is far more work to do  we need urgency  we need big ideas  we need to rethink the status quo   wrote senator merkley   it has been noted that bernie has an uphill battle ahead of him to win the democratic nomination  but his leadership on these issues and his willingness to fearlessly stand up to the powers that be have galvanized a grass roots movement  people know that we don t just need better policies  we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work  and for whom they work  oregon holds a closed primary on may  featured image courtesy of flickr
