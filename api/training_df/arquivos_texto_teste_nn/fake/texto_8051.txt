when donald trump launched his presidential campaign  he infamously blamed mexican immigrants for bringing crime to america  specifically  he accused them of being rapists and for trafficking drugs to the united states  he also has blamed the epidemic of heroin addiction on the southern border  as part of his campaign to blame many of society s ills on minorities  including blacks and muslims  but unlike the vast majority of latino immigrants who work hard and follow the law  trump is on record vouching for the character of a convicted cocaine trafficker  the smoking gun obtained the documents showing trump engaged in the questionable defense of a shady character in advance of joseph weichselbaum s november  sentencing by a u s  district court judge  trump wrote that the drug trafficker was  conscientious  forthright  diligent and a credit to the community  at the time trump wrote his character reference letter  weichselbaum  then in his mid   was already a twice convicted felon  in addition to his  plea to federal cocaine distribution and income tax charges  weichselbaum s rap sheet included prior convictions for grand theft auto and the embezzlement of more than    from a brooklyn manufacturing firm where he worked for a decade the site reports that the drug trafficker provided services to trump at the time  shuttling high rolling casino clients on his helicopter to trump s casinos in atlantic city  before they went belly up and bankrupt  of course   his firm also  maintained  stored  and provided pilots for trump s personal   million super puma helicopter  weichselbaum isn t even the only lawbreaking helicopter owner who rubbed shoulders with the current republican presidential front runner  the smoking gun notes another trump pal john staluppi  a colombo crime family member  was an owner of dillinger charter services  which flew gamblers into atlantic city on behalf of trump and other casino licensees like other unseemly news  the diehard trump fans who have handed him the current edge in gop delegates are unlikely to be concerned about their idol s indiscretions  but stories like this are sure to be fodder for democrats and their allies in the fall  as they don t fear a tongue lashing from trump like bush  cruz  and their acolytes seem to fear featured image via flickr the smoking gun
