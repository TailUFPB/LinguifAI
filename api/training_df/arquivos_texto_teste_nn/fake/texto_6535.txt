some people just can t handle the truth  even if it s handed to them on a silver platter  so  when legendary filmmaker rob reiner told joe scarborough to his face that donald trump supporters are racist  it did not go over well  you see  scarborough has pretty much given trump an open platform to spew his fallacies and propaganda on his msnbc show morning joe practically any time he wants  reiner clearly kicked the hornets  nest by being so honest directly to scarborough s face after being asked why people may support trump  reiner said  there are a lot of people who are racist  which got the reply   oh my god  did you just say that  but reiner didn t back away from the obvious truth  he added  that s true  they re not all racist  there are a lot of people who are  there is racism in this country that has been submerged for a long  long time  and all of a sudden there s a man speaking he s then interrupted by scarborough who tried to say trump supporters may just be angry working class americans  so reiner responded  let me say this to that  there are those that are following bernie sanders that feel the same way  then when mika brzezinski insinuates reiner is calling them racist too  reiner says  no  do you see any racist people at the bernie rallies  do you see any skinheads   you can see when somebody s got a tattoo with a swastika and stuff  c mon joe  be honest here  reiner is then continued to be dismissed by pretty much everyone  because apparently the truth is too much for them to bear  he also makes the very good point that trump is not doing a good enough job of dismissing his very racist base of voters  for goodness sake  he s been endorsed by white supremacists  instead  trump embraces support from pretty much anyone who tosses it his way  racist or not  and that s become very evident let s just put it this way  not all trump supporters are racist  but if you re racist  you re probably voting for donald trump watch here watch  how does director rob reiner explain the millions who voted for  realdonaldtrump  here s his simple answer  https   t co hgfwrqhmob  morning joe   morningjoe  may    image via video screen capture
