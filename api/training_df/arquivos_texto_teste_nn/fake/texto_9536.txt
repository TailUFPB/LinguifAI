after months of lying about passing debate questions to hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer  cnn  the former dnc chair donna brazile  finally came clean  during an interview with trevor noah of the daily show  brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling noah  well  first of all  i didn t have my hands in the cookie jar  i m an operative  i m a strategist  and part of what my role was  in addition to being a  political pundit   was to help advance the cause of justice and equality today s a new day  however  and donna brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell  tell all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the democrat party her book is about the chaos at the dnc during the  campaign  on thursday  she revealed a section of it at politico  what emerges from the excerpt is a picture of brazile as a heroine  of course   hillary clinton as the villainess  debbie wasserman schultz as incompetent and lazy  and barack obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party ouch in brazile s book  she claims that obama cleaned out the party  brazile writes that by the time she took over  the democratic party was  broke and   million in debt   according to brazile  obama  left the party   million in debt    hey  sort of like the country    and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year  furthermore  wasserman schultz had grown staff and allowed the dnc to pick up the check for obama consultants brazile also claims that hillary ran the party  hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the dnc so long as they got to run operations  gary gensler  cfo of the hillary campaign  apparently  described the party as fully under the control of hillary s campaign  which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the bernie camp  the campaign had the dnc on life support  giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses  while the campaign was using the party as a fund raising clearinghouse  hillary essentially laundered campaign money through the dnc  hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the dnc  but virtually all that money went to hillary s campaign  less than half of  percent of all money hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states  brazile explains when the politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the clinton campaign  hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady  bernie s people were angry for their own reasons  saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to hillary the party ran as an adjunct to the hillary campaign long before the primaries  meaning that bernie was at a severe disadvantage  brazile admits as much the funding arrangement with hfa and the victory fund agreement was not illegal  but it sure looked unethical  if the fight had been fair  one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead for entire story  daily wire
