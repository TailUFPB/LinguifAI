mitt romney tried to confront donald trump head on  but in the end  he was brutally humiliated just like jeb bush before him earlier today  romney spoke out against trump in a scathing speech that lasted for  minutes  here s what i know  donald trump is a phony  a fraud   romney declared in an attempt to convince voters in other states to deny the republican front runner the nomination   he s playing the members of the american public for suckers  he gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat  romney hypocritically criticized trump for not releasing tax returns  something the  republican nominee refused to do himself four years ago well into his race against president obama  who went on to win a second term then he attacked trump s foreign policy  focusing in particularly on his plan to ban all muslims from entering the united states  mr  trump s bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies  insulting all muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in their urgent fight against isis  and for what purpose  muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country  romney ended by urging republicans to vote for someone who can beat hillary clinton here s the video of romney s speech via youtube well  it didn t take long for donald trump to fire back  and his response was devastating right out of the gate trump reminded romney that he lost in  to president obama and was a terrible candidate overall it then trump proceeded to humiliate romney even further by telling of how the former republican nominee begged for his endorsement  i don t know what happened to him  you can see how loyal he is  he was begging for my endorsement  i could have said mitt  drop to your knees   he would have dropped to his knees  sounds like a pretty low blow to me  but it s exactly what trump has done to destroy every republican rival standing in his way thus far here s the video via youtube featured image  screenshot
