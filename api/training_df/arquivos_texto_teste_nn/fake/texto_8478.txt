on tuesday  trump announced that he would be skipping thursday night s gop debate because fox news host megyn kelly would be moderating it  and trump is scared sh tless of her even since she made him look like a complete idiot the first time moderated the gop debate since trump got his ego handed to him on a silver platter  trump has kept himself busy with a mostly one sided feud against kelly  solidifying the very sexist  misogynistic behavior the fox host called him out on during the first debate  it should come as no surprise that trump s supporters are just like him   disrespectful with unhealthy  hateful views toward women  and it couldn t be any more apparent than their activity on social media vocativvocativthe tweets from trump s supporters are hardly surprising   these are the same people who routinely attack protesters at trump s rallies   animalistic  violent behavior which trump sometimes even encourages because trump has refused to participate in the debate  trump s fans have been demanding that kelly be removed from her position as moderator after trump s initial demand for her exclusion was denied  trump s followers are all sexist  misogynistic babies and it s easy to see why trump appeals to these people featured image is a screenshot
