sam brownback and the current gop led kansas legislature have all but destroyed kansas  it s so bad that a coalition of former kansas governors  along with current political leaders  is working to raise money to oppose brownback s disastrous policies before they wipe kansas off the map entirely  they re called the save kansas coalition  and they re not all democrats  not by far the main problem is that the state cut taxes to try and turn kansas into the bastion of business and tourism that texas and florida supposedly are  but that failed miserably and now the state is worse than broke  to fight to get kansas back on track  former democratic governors kathleen sebelius and john carlin are joined by former republican governors mike hayden and bill graves  and all four are working to educate kansas  public about what s actually happening versus what brownback wants people to think is happening they can t even fund their schools halfway properly because their budget is such a mess the save kansas coalition wants balanced taxes  high quality public education  and access to healthcare  along with judicial impartiality  safer highways  and job growth  brownback s policies are not conducive to any of this  he s a hardcore  balanced budget  cutting taxes will stimulate the economy so we can balance the budget republican who doesn t get it in fact  his policies have driven some business out of the state  one such business owner  jeff blackwood  is working to relocate his business onto the missouri side of kansas city  saying  i can t  in good conscience  continue to give our tax money to a government that actively works against needs of its citizens we take care of people here and that is exactly the opposite of what is occurring  the funding problems have led to the closure of a mental health hospital and a state rehab office for the disabled  not to mention what s happening with the school system there  brownback s spokesperson said that his policies have led to five straight years of business growth  and yet  the state is floundering horrifically brownback and the republicans in the state legislature don t seem to realize that cutting taxes means taxes get cut  which causes budget shortfalls  which snowballs into a bankrupt state if it s not quickly addressed  back in november  kansas was looking at having a whopping    million in cash reserves  in other words  peanuts  because the projected tax revenue just wasn t there the save kansas coalition wants people to be aware of how serious their votes are  brownback and company didn t get into office by accident   the people of kansas voted for these policies  if they vote to re elect these ignorant pusnoodles  they ll be voting for more of the same problems since brownback can t admit that he screwed everything up  and as such  will continue to beat this particular dead horse no matter what featured image by win mcnamee getty images
