republicans have pessimistically said it can t be done  that renewable energy can t do for us what oil  gas  and coal have done for generations but germany just put republicans in their place and proved that clean energy can do just that if given the chance on sunday  chancellor angela merkel had good reason to celebrate as renewable energy sources provided nearly  percent of the nation s energy needs for the first time according to bloomberg solar and wind power peaked at  p m  local time on sunday  allowing renewables to supply   gigawatts as demand was   gigawatts  according to provisional data by agora energiewende  a research institute in berlin  power prices turned negative during several  minute periods yesterday  dropping as low as minus  euros     a megawatt hour in other words  clean energy saved people lots of money on their electricity bills on several occasions on sunday and proved that it is possible to replace conventional energy sources with renewable energy sources if you take a look at the graph below  you will see that solar power  as represented in yellow  surged to hit the red line  which represents the electricity consumption of the population  for that one shining brief period  clean energy surpassed the conventional sources and embarrassed every single republican who has scoffed at the prospect of clean energy in the united states just imagine if clean energy did this here  imagine if we actually put our full effort and focus into developing a clean energy infrastructure  we could watch as our electric bills shrink and our dependence on fossil fuels disappears  it would save us money and help save the planet at the same time but that s assuming republicans jump on board the clean energy train instead of continuing to be shills for oil and coal companies while claiming that god will save the planet featured image via wikimedia
