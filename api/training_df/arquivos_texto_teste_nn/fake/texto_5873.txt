when even fox news begins to call for gun control  it s a clear sign that republicans and the nra better start compromising gretchen carlson has been one of the most vocal hosts on the conservative network for years  and she has consistently toed the republican party line throughout her years as co host of fox   friends and now throughout her tenure hosting her own solo program but in the wake of a domestic terrorist attack that killed  people in an orlando night club this past weekend  carlson could no longer sit back and be a puppet for the gun nuts  which is why she went totally off script during her show and declared her support for banning assault weapons such as the ar  used in the massacre  there s no doubt omar mateen was able to kill so many people because he was firing an ar    carlson said   a military style assault weapon  a weapon easier to buy in the state of florida than buying a handgun  florida sets a three day waiting period for purchasing handguns  but the state mandates no waiting period for any gun that requires two hands to hold  carlson s remarks on florida gun laws appear to be a rebuke of florida governor rick scott  who not only just offered thoughts and prayers instead of acting to prevent future mass shootings in response to orlando  he s the one who weakened florida s gun laws over the last five years carlson further justified her stance by pointing out that  percent of americans support a ban on assault weapons  do we need ar  to hunt and kill deer  do we need them to protect our families   she continued   i m in favor of people being able to carry  i think some of these mass shootings would have been less deadly if that were the case  but despite her support of second amendment rights  carlson said banning assault weapons is just  common sense  and stated that it is time for americans to take a stand in order to prevent mass shootings in the future  but i m also with the majority today  taking a stand  can t we hold true the sanctity of the second amendment while still having common sense   percent of fox viewers  however  refused to shake off the brainwashing the nra has drilled into them over the years by overwhelmingly rejecting passage of a new assault weapons ban here s the video via youtube america once did have a ban on assault weapons in place  but republicans let it expire and refused to renew it  and mass shootings have increased ever since according to the new century foundation in  in the eight years since the assault weapons ban has expired  there have been  mass shooting events  that equals an average of   a year an increase of over  percent  that is a startling jump  by any measure during the ten year duration of the ban between  and   there were  mass shootings  in  alone there were at least six major mass shootings that occurred  more depending on what statistics and definition you use  so this is a continuing problem that isn t going away by praying  it s going to take action such as the action taken by australia in   after five mass shootings between  and   the country finally had enough of the carnage and banned assault weapons  there hasn t been a mass shooting ever since but it s different in the united states  we have a second amendment  therefore it is harder to ban guns entirely  however  banning assault weapons isn t the only change we could demand  we also need better background checks and we need law enforcement to have the ability to ban people from having guns if they are on the terrorist watch list  had republicans not refused to do that latter action  perhaps those  people would be alive today because mateen  who was an isis sympathizer  would not have been able to legally buy the ar  he used to slaughter them gretchen carlson deserves props for supporting a ban on assault weapons  even though she definitely risks being fired for doing so featured image  screenshot
