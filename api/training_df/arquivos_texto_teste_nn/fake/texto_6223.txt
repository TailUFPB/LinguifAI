an anguished oregon couple took to social media this week in hopes of getting justice for their one year old son  jacob  who was beaten by a babysitter two months ago pictures posted to facebook show scrapes  cuts  a black eye and deep bruises which were left on the baby s face and arms during the vicious assault image credit  joshua marbury via facebookwe can t even imagine the amount of trauma he must have experienced  all at the hands of an adult who was supposed to protect and care for him image credit  joshua marbury via facebookjacob s parents  alicia quinney and joshua marbury spoke to oregon live on friday  the first thing i saw was a black eye   quinney said   i thought maybe marker got on his face or something  when he turned over  his whole right side of his face   black and blue  quinney told oregon live that she knew right away that the babysitter had hurt him she took jacob to the hospital  police met her there and opened an investigation into the assault but prosecutors informed jacob s parents that no charges will be filed against the person who did this to their son as oregon live reports washington county deputy district attorney dustin staten emailed quinney a link to a story published by the oregonian oregonlive detailing the challenges the law poses for prosecutors  the headline  even pets are better protected than young kids under oregon abuse laws  prosecutors say  to convict a suspected child abuser of felony assault or criminal mistreatment  the article explained  prosecutors must prove that the victim suffered a  physical injury  under oregon law  that means proving the child experienced  substantial pain  the article explains that appellate rulings have made that hard to prove if victims can t talk about the extent of their suffering  prosecutors say children younger than  often aren t able to articulate  substantial pain   the same can be true for older children with developmental disabilities or those who don t want to speak out against their abusers in essence the law leaves vulnerable young children like jacob completely unprotected quinney took to facebook to express her outrage over the state s completely irrational and irresponsible law  writing after two months of waiting we only find out that charges are dropped because my one year old cannot tell you verbally he was abused and my son did not show he was in pain or that this person  intentionally  did this  i am so furious that i m not using profanity hoping something is done and this goes viral quinney goes on to say that portland authorities have a verbal confession  as raw story reports here  they also have multiple statements from medical professionals who showed quinney how the bruises on her baby were  handprints  even with all of that  the law still makes it almost impossible to  prove  the case animals can t talk  yet animal abuse is prosecuted in the state of oregon  how is it possible that a helpless infant has fewer protections under the law than an animal quinney points out in her post  a dead body cant tell you who killed them  yet a baby isn t held to the same standard because he can t talk  well neither can a dead body  that s blasphemy  you waited  months if not longer to tell us this  something needs to be done  nobody can just hit a child and more to just get away with it because the child cant verbally tell you  there s no doubt that oregonians need to change these outrageous laws  the law should protect the most vulnerable among us  instead  in oregon  the law excludes the most vulnerable from protection  that s not acceptable featured image via joshua marbury on facebook
