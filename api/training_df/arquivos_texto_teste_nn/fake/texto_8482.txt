the fbi is only just now beginning to take down the bundy terrorists in oregon  and cenk uygur is furious that it took them this long to take action ever since the redneck wannabe soldiers seized the federal buildings at the malheur national wildlife refuge on january   many have pointed out that if the militants weren t white  the occupation would have been put down harshly on day one and most of the gunmen would have been killed but because bundy and his buddies were white anti government right wingers  they were treated with kid gloves by the justice department and law enforcement  and only time will tell whether they are actually punished for their many crimes or just receive a slap on the wrist cenk uygur  however  didn t hold back on wednesday while laying the smackdown on the fbi for treating the militants as if there are separate laws for white gun toting conservatives  he became particularly upset after one militant outright called for killing law enforcement officials  something that would almost certainly cause police to drop the hammer if the militant were a muslim or a black man  we re going to have a conversation with these guys  they were free to come and go for three weeks  there was no perimeter  the fbi says   oh don t worry  we just set up a perimeter  why didn t you set up a perimeter the first time they captured a federal building  armed  talking about how they re going to murder people who come and try to take it from them  and here are these guys on camera saying   we re going to murder the cops if they come to get us   you stole  sh t  you criminal  you thug  the young turks host then went off on how much leeway law enforcement have given to bundy and his militants over the last three weeks just because they are armed white guys on the political right wing fringe  pointing out that if a left wing environmental group had done the same thing they would have been instantly executed without getting the opportunity to exercise their right to go in front of a judge or being heard by a jury of their peers  look at the white privilege here  and it s not just white  it s right wing privilege  because if left wingers had taken over  environmental groups had taken over and say   oh  we re going to do this and we re going to do that   it doesn t matter if it s a latino  a black group or it s just white greenpeace or animal rights guys  nobody gets to come and go and threaten cops and talk about killing them  this is white privilege  you can steal stuff  you can steal federal stuff and they don t even arrest you for three weeks  this is insane  man  there s two different laws in the country and we walk around pretending it isn t  here s the video via youtube  uygur s remarked begin at the   marker he s right  of course  if the militants had been muslim or black there would not have been a standoff at all  law enforcement would have fired every bullet they could get their hands on into the compound until every single one of them were killed  now  federal law enforcement should be applauded for waiting out the terrorists and taking them down with little bloodshed  but the point is that police should have the same tolerance and discipline no matter what color a person is or what religion or political views a person holds  if anything  this standoff demonstrated perfectly that we live in two separate americas  one where police will do everything in their power to not kill you as long as you are a white gun nut  and one where police will become trigger happy monsters when they come upon unarmed people of color and then hide behind their badges while they do everything to justify their unlawful actions featured image  screenshot
