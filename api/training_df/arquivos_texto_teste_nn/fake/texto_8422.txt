apparently  ted cruz is so hated that even fox news is now defending obamacare  it truly must be a cold day in hell during an appearance on fox news sunday with chris wallace just before iowans head to the polls to vote for their choice of who should be the republican presidential nominee  ted cruz found himself being called out for his most persistent lies about the affordable care act cruz has repeatedly claimed that obamacare has caused massive job losses and that it has caused more people to go without health insurance  but both have been debunked by the facts  something wallace pointed out much to the annoyance of cruz  the fact checkers say you re wrong   wallace said  since that law went into effect  the unemployment rate fell from    to   as  million new jobs were created  and   million people who were previously uninsured now have coverage  don t get me wrong  there are plenty of problems with obamacare  but more people have jobs and health insurance than they did before obamacare  of course  cruz responded by accusing  unfair  fact checkers of being  liberal editorial journalists  who  have made it their mission to defend obamacare  chris wallace couldn t believe that cruz would deny the facts so adamantly   there s certainly no question that more people have jobs and more people health insurance   he said  but cruz continue to argue  and even treated wallace like a child by telling him   don t interrupt me  undeterred  wallace continued to press the fact that  thirteen million new jobs have been created  and nailed cruz for trying to change the subject cruz claimed that the  million jobs  is a historically slow rate of job creation  and went on to tell a bullshit story about how small business owners have come up to him telling him that they are praying for the repeal of obamacare  and then he attempted to steal bernie sanders  platform by attacking the wealthy one percent and pretending to be a man of the people  cruz even had the gall to claim that the income gap is president obama s fault turning to what cruz would replace obamacare with  wallace pointed out that conservative think tanks agree that selling insurance across state lines  expanding health savings accounts and making insurance portable between jobs  would have almost no effect in giving people who are not uninsured health coverage  faced with that fact  cruz lashed out at the conservative think tanks and claimed that they are not accurate  basically  he threw them under a bus here s the video via youtube cruz is dead wrong about obama overseeing a  historically slow rate of job creation   the fact is that   jobs have been created per month under president obama and that ranks above ford  bush  bush ii  and eisenhower  the true loser in this category is george w  bush  who only saw   jobs created per month during his presidency here s a chart showing exactly that via usnews in short  this was yet another terrible day for ted cruz as he desperately tries to rebound from the rough night he had during the last gop debate  a debate that republicans say cruz overwhelmingly lost and continually repeating lies that most americans know have been repeatedly debunked isn t helping his case at all  the media  fact checkers  and conservative think tanks all say cruz is wrong and his healthcare plan isn t a viable replacement for a program that has insured  million americans  many for the first time ted cruz should be thankful that wallace didn t continue pressing him because if the discussion about obamacare had lasted much longer  cruz would have embarrassed himself even more than he already did  kudos to fox news for actually calling out cruz on his lies  featured image from pete souza
