president obama took aim at donald trump and his violent racist rhetoric on saturday  and it makes us wish he could run for a third term  america is pretty darn great right now   obama thundered in dallas in a direct rebuke of trump s campaign claim that american has somehow gotten worse over the last eight years  america is making strides right now  america is better off than it was right now  the american people should be proud of what we have achieved together in the last eight years since the recession hit  we are great right now  obama then went after trump and the other gop candidates for turning the election into a childish circus where lies reign over facts and violence against other americans is encouraged  something that has led to multiple clashes between trump supporters and protesters  what the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better   not insults and schoolyard taunts and manufacturing facts  not divisiveness along the lines of race and faith  certainly not violence against other americans or excluding them  we re a better country than that  here s the video via youtube but president obama was not done yet  as the crowd laughed  obama turned trump and his multiple business scams into a punchline  imagine what trump would say if he actually had a record like this instead of selling steaks   obama quipped  has anybody bought that wine   obama asked the audience   i want to know what that wine tastes like  i mean  come on  you know that s like some   wine  they slap a label on it  they charge you    saying this is the greatest wine ever  come on  and then president obama lambasted republicans for saying how shocked they are over trump s racist rhetoric  reminding them that their front runner is the same guy who would not drop his obsession with obama s birth certificate  republicans didn t say anything then  obama pointed out  because trump s rhetoric was not aimed at the gop like it is now here s the video via youtube indeed  the republican party and fox news built the monster that is now taking over the party and invited white supremacists to take a prominent seat next to him trump s status as front runner should be the end of the republican party as a legitimate political organization  but it appears trump is merely replacing it with a fascist organization that will be even worse  in their desperation to oppose president obama at every turn using hate and fear to gin up opposition and extremism  republicans created the atmosphere for someone like trump to rise and thrive and now they are paying the price for it  and so is america  one wonders how long it will be before even republicans wish that president obama could stay in office for another four years featured image via video screen capture
