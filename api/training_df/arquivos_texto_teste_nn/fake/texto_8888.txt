president obama held a cnn televised town hall meeting on guns in america on thursday night  during which he took a moment to remind those criticizing him for showing emotion that he gives precisely zero f cks about their opinions  he is focused entirely on saving lives  and bringing the plague of gun violence under control cnn host anderson cooper first replayed the president s emotional address for the audience  this is captured in the video below  obama doesn t work up some watery eyes  he has tears literally running down his cheeks as he recounts the  people gunned down at sandy hook elementary school   of them first graders  and the devastation of the loved ones left to grieve the loss  his growing frustration at the intransigence of conservative lawmakers to give so much as an inch in the face of such catastrophic and preventable tragedies has been clear in each new post shooting statement he has had to deliver to the nation however  conservatives have concocted all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories about what those tears really meant  one fox host even went so far as to argue obama was using a raw onion to produce the tears so  when asked about the reaction  obama took a moment to revisit his encounter with the parents of the children slain at newtown  what becomes clear is that any human being with a functional level of empathy should be breaking down in tears in the face of such horror  i visited newtown two days after what happened  so  it was still very raw  it s the only time i ve ever seen secret service cry  on duty it wasn t just the parents  you had siblings  you know   year olds   year olds   year olds  who in some cases didn t even understand that their brother or sister wasn t going to be coming home and i ve said this before  it continues to haunt me  it was one of the worst days of my presidency  to those who argued he was crying about the wrong thing  the president had a straightforward reply  i want to emphasize that there are a lot of tragedies that happen out there as a consequence to the victims of crime  you know  there are police officers who are out there laying down their lives to protect us every single day  you know  and tears are appropriate for them  as well  and i visit with those families  as well  victims of terrorism  soldiers coming home  you know  there s a lot of heartache out there and i don t suggest that this is the only kind of heartache we should be working on  you know  i ve spent a lot of time and a lot of hours  in fact  a lot more hours than i spend on this  trying to prevent terrorist attacks  it s a tough job  being the president of the united states  a role where decisions that are literally life and death have to be made every day of the week  america  and the world  need someone in the white house with the humanity to make those decisions with care and consideration  that s something to remember come november  featured image via screengrab
