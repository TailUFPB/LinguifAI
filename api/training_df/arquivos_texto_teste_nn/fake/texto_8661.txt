we all know that the only reason donald trump is so popular among the republican base is because he is because of his racist rhetoric  his trump hate  is very appealing to the vile voters the gop panders to  and every single time he says something bombastic his poll numbers go up  however  if you ask one of these trump supporters if they are racist they ll assure you that they are not   most of the time steve bowman of omaha is a different kind of trump supporter  because when he was confronted with a truth bomb  he actually admitted that he was wrong wowt reporter john chapman  an african american  approached bowman and asked him if  he thinks a sign in his front window that said  ni   r obama  was racist  bowman responded  well  i grew up in the   i remember racial riots  i know martin luther king  i m  so i grew up in the late  early  and i know what it s like the water guns the racial riots and birmingham  you know the south  i know all about it  i have a master s degree in history it might be a little racist  a little  no  it s a lot racist and apparently it s not the first time  according to his neighbors  an african american family  he often puts up racially charged signs  he s been putting up stuff like that constantly  constantly putting up stuff like that and i ll bring it up to him gently  you know   take that down please you know this is not the neighborhood for that  neighbor regina wright told wowt   he understands and he will take it down after i mention it to him  but then he ll put something else up  bowman took the sign down after the reported confronted him  but whether or not he puts one up again is anybody s guess  what s really ridiculous is that he tried to use the civil rights movement as some kind of explanation for his sign  it was almost as if he was saying  i lived through that  so i can t possibly be a racist  if anything  the fact that he remembers the horrific treatment of the african american community should be even more of a reason not to have something like that in his window but as we know by now  common sense and inclusiveness do not grow in trump supporters  gardens watch   featured image via video screenshot
