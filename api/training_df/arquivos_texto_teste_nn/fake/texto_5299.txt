marco rubio  who is now working doggedly to keep his mostly empty senate seat  actually has something new to say about donald trump  he s drunk the kool aid  but it must have been an especially strong cup of it  because his statement actually makes trump and the rnc look worse than ever  if that s possible trump must learn about an awful lot if he s going to be president   considerably more than most other presidential candidates in our history  rubio said  as he settles into this role as the nominee and ultimately the president  access to these issues is going to begin to  in some ways  kind of shape some of the policy positions given reality versus perhaps what you might read about on a blog somewhere  har de har har don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts  and on top of that  the stupid here just burns  sure  nobody s born knowing how to be president  and all of them have things to learn as they go along  trump  though  has shown zero interest in learning anything at all and rubio knows that  this is the man who said  at a presser just this morning  that he s never had a second thought  this is the man who said his best foreign policy adviser is himself  this is the man that emailed foreign governments for campaign donations this is the man who called on russia to help him win this election  russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing  i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press  despite all that  here s rubio  now saying that donald trump will learn once he s elected  he s completely forgotten that trump gets a lot of his news from sites like the drudge report and alex jones  infowars  just how strong was that kool aid  anyway  it s a wonder rubio doesn t suffer some kind of poisoning from it  trump will never accept sane advisers  because sane advisers won t tell him what he wants to hear rubio is in a close race in florida  the  nevertrump crowd could decide to sit out the vote over this  or vote for democrat patrick murphy  considering that trump might be  a moment of reckoning  for republican candidates and the party as a whole  defending trump by saying it s perfectly okay if he learns once he s elected  when he s proven time and again that he s certain he already knows everything imaginable  is pretty stupid  buh bye  marco featured image by angel valentin getty images
