donald trump appeared on fox news on monday night  only to be embarrassingly stumped by bill o reilly o reilly wanted to know if trump plans on taking military action against iran if he becomes president  and trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand  if you re elected president are you going to take military action against iran   o reilly asked   are you going to do something to that country  well  i would want to help saudi arabia   trump replied with what seems to be a reference to iranians attacking the saudi arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the saudis recently committed on new year s day in which  were killed  including a shiite cleric   i would want to protect saudi arabia   trump claimed   but saudi arabia is going to have to help us economically trump suggested that he might attack iran if saudi arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get america involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the middle east o reilly continued to press trump for an answer  calling him out for dodging the question trump then went on a tirade against the iran nuclear deal  calling it a disastrous deal that iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon  clearly  trump is not aware of the fact that iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the russians  which is definitive proof that the iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do the iran nuclear deal stands as one of president obama s greatest achievements  and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working  furthermore  saudi arabia is nothing more than isis posing as a legitimate nation  they use sharia law and behead so many people every year that isis leaders must be envious  the only reason our government has failed to call the saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world this is why it is not only important for the united states to reject military action in the middle east  we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on saudi arabia for our energy needs  frankly  the united states government should grow a pair and strongly condemn saudi arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization the bottom line  however  is that donald trump is unfit to be commander in chief  he not only wants to send american troops to die needlessly in iran  he wants to make saudi arabia pay for it  basically  trump would turn america into a puppet for the saudis  but more likely  he would damage relations with both nations and put america squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into world war iii america does not need more war  we need peace  and as o reilly pointed out  voters have the right to know what trump plans to do  even if trump thinks they have no right to know at all here s the video via youtube featured image via video screen capture
