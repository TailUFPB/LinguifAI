in the interest of wasting as much time and energy as possible pushing their religious beliefs into anything and everything you do  the christian right has had its case heard that you can t teach sciencey stuff like evolution if you can t teach the reality of creation  creation can be proven because it s in a book  you see  that was written by god through the vessel of man he created whereas evolution is just a silly collection of data about things we ve learned by going out and looking since creation is the only viable explanation but our government won t allow it in schools  the next necessary step to keeping our children as uneducated as possible is to see that nobody teach anything at all  ignorance is bliss  that was  at least  what the citizens for objective public education  or cope  hoped would happen when they argued to a federal district court that teaching evolution and the way man has come to understand his own ancestry is the same as teaching them the religion of atheism  they obviously don t understand the words they use sometimes  but that s ok according to cope  into the religious sphere by leading them to ask ultimate religious questions like what is the cause and nature of life and the universe    where do we come from  the purpose of the indoctrination is to establish the religious worldview  not to deliver to an age appropriate audience an objective and religiously neutral origins science education that seeks to inform  isn t that precious  a group of ultra religious zealots who want your children to believe the earth is barely  years old are calling evolution  indoctrination   how dare you teach things scientists have gone out and dug into the ground to find and prove  in the end it all comes down to the same thing  god had a plan  that plan couldn t possibly be to ignite the big bang and watch a universe develop  no  the plan has to be the story from the book that was stolen from the other book that learned it from another book that heard it passed down at dinner time for   years  when god was goddess and men were washing her feet the  circuit court of appeals in denver snickered a bit and responded  cope does not offer any facts to support the conclusion that the standards condemn any religion or send a message of endorsement  and any fear of biased instruction is premised on cope s predictions of school districts  responses to the standards an attempt by cope to recast a future injury as a present one  americans united for separation of church and state chimed in  saying that cope feared that scientific facts would cause  kansas schoolchildren to be subtly manipulated into rejecting their lord and savior jesus christ  so  these people don t want things like science and fact get in the way of their sunday morning fairytale  where strict obedience is all that s truly needed in the end  americans united continued  it s a nonsensical argument  which is why courts have unanimously rejected it  cope  it seems  isn t interested in promoting facts  it s interested in forcing public schools to conduct far right religious and political indoctrination  it s a shame that in today s day and age we need to have a society to separate church and state  it s like a cold with a runny nose the country picked up in the  that we just can t shake featured image by education images getty images
