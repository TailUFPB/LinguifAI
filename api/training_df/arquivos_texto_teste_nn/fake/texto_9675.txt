the view s joy behar was beaming after watching a clip of eminem trashing president trump at the bet awards  where he told his fans that if they support trump  he doesn t need them to purchase his music  behar suggested that eminem was being brave because literally no one in hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand   that s why you need to give him  credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say   i don t care if you don t support me  this is more important than  than my popularity   i have never seen it  frankly   really joy  what planet have you been living on for the past  years co host sonny hostin told the adoring liberal crowd   i was actually at the hair salon watching the bet awards and the salon just um  roared when that happened    she went on to condemn trump for using twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that   i just thought it was very brave  that s when meghan mccain  who appeared to be silently seething  as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they re speaking to an audience who s been living on an alternate planet  or don t have any access to real news finally spoke up  saying   actually  it s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in hollywood  that s when whoopi lost it whoopi made a complete fool of herself when she embarrassingly attempted to prove that meghan mccain doesn t understand history and that communism in hollywood was really a right wing movement  huh  whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to amazon to purchase a few books should help meghan to understand the history of hollywood  that of course  only whoopi truly understands  whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in hollywood  the first example she used was comedian tim allen  whose top rated show   last man standing  was just clearly canceled by abc for political reasons  whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on tom selleck who hasn t acted in a major movie or television show for decades  selleck s career peaked in the  s  outside of his occasional appearances on  friends  as monica s boyfriend  selleck s career has been almost non existent meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in hollywood and that it s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in hollywood than a conservative   she said that she lived in los angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there  meghan told that cast that it s more popular to be an obama and hillary  and even bernie supporter whoopi then embarrassed herself again  when she tried to convince the panel that meghan s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in hollywood is ridiculous  whoopi laughed and corrected mccain saying   except that all of the conservatives in hollywood are working  they re the ones that are working    she tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in hollywood   the first example she used was comedian tim allen  whose top rated show   last man standing  was recently canceled by abc for his political views  whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on tom selleck  wow   conservatives in hollywood  way to not prove your point whoopi watch
