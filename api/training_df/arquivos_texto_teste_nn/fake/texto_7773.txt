this year s academy awards nominations received loads of backlash for their lack of diversity  sparking a boycott and the widely used hashtag  oscarssowhite the  academy awards was hosted by black comedian chris rock  who made sure to comment on the overwhelming whiteness in his brilliant monologue  where he spoke of how black actors deserved equal opportunities  here s just a sample of how rock blasted the lack of diversity at the ceremony  i m here at the academy awards  otherwise known as white people s choice awards  if they nominated hosts  i wouldn t even get this job  y all would be watching neil patrick harris right now  this year things are gonna be a little different at the oscars  this year  the in memoriam package is just gonna be black people shot by the cops on their way to the movies  at the end of the awards ceremony  rock closed the show with three important words   black lives matter   and as expected  chris  powerful human rights message was lost amongst racists  even those who work in the hollywood industry  hollywood producer juergen pichler levine even had the audacity to say that the oscars were too black  levine posted  and then deleted  a meltdown that he shared with his   instagram followers about the obscene number of black people at the oscars  levine said   god bless america but not these monkeys  and complained about obama levine wasn t the only one  fox news had a field day when contributor kevin jackson ripped rock over his remarks  when host brian kilmeade asked jackson about what he thought about rock s remarks  jackson said  it was tragic  it was fun though watching a group of white racist liberals get put back on them the things that conservatives face every single day  at the end of the day  you can t say that hollywood is racist because blacks have been getting awards in proportionate numbers for the last couple of decades  so at the same time i m watching these very sanctimonious liberals suffer  i also know that it s not good for the country that we go through this  jackson also said that rock was solely responsible for the  worst performance  the oscars had seen in years  he argued  it was definitely one of the ones i wish i had a chance to miss  i think it was more just this idea how he was treating hollywood of being so racist because black people hadn t been nominated  you can watch jackson spit straight nonsense below even cnn s carol costello couldn t take the fact that racism still exists in america and watching it on television made it uncomfortable for her to sit smugly in her white privilege  her reaction was   please stop and let me enjoy this for a moment  guest commentator michaela angela david agreed and said that the hashtag   oscarssoawkward  would have been more appropriate  you can watch the exchange below rock did a great job at the awards ceremony  regardless of what anyone says  sometimes the truth is uncomfortable  but we should not avoid exposing it just because it s hard to hear  featured image via video screen capture
