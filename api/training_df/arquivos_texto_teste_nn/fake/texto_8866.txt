yesterday  president barack obama made a touching tribute to the victims of gun violence  just days after his executive action on gun control  obama announced that he would be leaving an open seat at his future state of the union address to represent every life that has been lost in senseless gun related deaths   a sentiment that anyone who been affected by gun violence could appreciate this move from our president isn t surprising  the obamas have hosted family members of gun violence victims in state of the union addresses before  obama s empty state at the state of the union will be in the first lady s guest box on a conference call with organizing for action  obama explained the reason behind his gesture  we want them to be seen and understood  that their absence means something to this country  we want to tell their stories  we want to honor their memory and we want to support americans whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence and remind every single one of our representatives that it s their responsibility to do something  obama also reminded his supporters that  these kinds of important gestures only matter if it translates into action  like clockwork  it didn t take long for a republican to swoop in and ruin the moment  this time  it was texas senator and presidential hopeful ted cruz  who decided to take the president s emotional  heartfelt remarks and turn it into a gop talking point on abortion  pro birth cruz  who has been known for his abortion and sex related rants  tweeted this awful thing in response to obama s tribute ted cruz twitterhow sensitive  like many of his conservative peers  cruz has been resisting obama s executive action hard  and making sure to add his unwanted opinion wherever and whenever possible  currently  there is a fundraising appeal on cruz s campaign website that claims that obama  wants your guns   even though obama has repeatedly said that he believes in the second amendment and that legal guns will not be confiscated  featured image via gage skidmore
