how very bold of the white yahoo sports writer greg wyshynski  who affectionately refers to himself as  puck daddy  to call out one of only a handful of black men in the nhl for not standing up for the black lives matter  anti cop movement  that disrespects our flag  and our veterans in one fell swoop wyshynski writes  p k  subban said on tuesday that he will  never  kneel during the national anthem to protest something politically subban performed at a fundraiser on tuesday night at zanies comedy club in nashville  to benefit comedy cares  he told the audience that he would  never  take a knee during the national anthem because he has too much respect for the american flag  his comments were sent to us by two eyewitnesses and confirmed by the predators  subban  who is canadian  is considered the most prominent black player in pro hockey earlier in the day  the nashville predators announced that  as a team  they would not engage in any protests during the national anthem  this came less than two days after hundreds of nfl players  coaches and executives showed solidarity in rebuking president donald trump s comments that players who protested police brutality against african americans during the national anthem were  sons of bitches  who deserved to lose their jobs said ceo sean henry  to the tennessean  when this all came about  we wanted to get together with our team because everything we do is collaborative  when we say what we re going to be doing  it really is a  we   everyone had input on it  we are honoring the anthem and the flag and the country by standing during the anthem  we invite our fans to do so with us   it is also our way of honoring what else it stands for  and it does provide for the freedom for others to express their views and protests in a manner in which they feel comfortable doing  we just think there s proper forums for all  our games have become this unifying celebration  so we have decided that we re all going to stand together to honor the country and all that comes with it  according to seth dean  a predators fans who attended the comedy fundraiser event  subban took the stage and said  he will continue to stand  respect  and sing along with u s  anthem   at one point  he pointed out a friend of his in the crowd who was a law enforcement officer from boston from dean  he also addressed why he always shuffles his feet during anthem  he first said it could be add but he was never tested  then he mentioned just being pumped up by crowd and excited to support usa even as a canadian  he even jokingly suggested we should all stand and sing anthem there at zanies  which didn t happen   he obviously wasn t going to go against lavy s proclamation that players were going to stay standing  especially with his coach in the room  but he made his support for anthem as unequivocal as he possibly could  in an email to yahoo sports  hailey  another attendee  described the scene in more detail tonight was a comedy fundraiser at zanies in nashville  for which ryan hamilton was the headliner  as my attendance was spontaneous  i was pretty excited when pk subban was the first  comedian   much to my surprise  his allegedly  impromptu  set ended with a tense promise from pk that despite his previous dancing antics during the national anthem  he would never kneel during the national anthem  followed by a long rant about his  respect  for the american flag
