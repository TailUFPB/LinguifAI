on sunday  the nation learned that former first lady nancy reagan    had passed away at her los angeles home from congestive heart failure  nancy was the wife of republican hero ronald reagan and after his death in   she became an outspoken activist for a cure alzheimer s disease and huge beacon of support for families whose loved ones suffered from the degenerative illness  while republican presidential candidates have expressed grief over her passing  her longtime friend  larry king  said he is relieved that she will not be here to see the end of the gop s disgusting presidential race during an interview with cnn s wolf blitzer  king said  i ll miss her  i love socializing with her  i love gossiping with her  i love talking with her  if there s one thing glad about this   he added   she isn t around to see the end of this political year  because she was very upset by it  we can understand why she would be upset  the candidates running for the republican nomination have constantly tried to equate themselves with her husband  even though a number of his children have spoken out and said that reagan would be appalled by the comparisons while these candidates  like ted cruz and  shudder  donald trump  name drop the former president during every gop debate  they behave like schoolyard bullies and pledge to never compromise with democrats  reagan may have had faults  a lot of them  but he knew how to compromise and he never  ever behaved the way the current republican party does as a matter of fact  if ronald reagan was a candidate in this race  the others running would probably call him a rino and a traitor  and they damn sure wouldn t support any amnesty plan for undocumented immigrants  like the one he is well known for  the current gop is so gross that when news of nancy s passing spread  their voters took it as on opportunity to attack the current first lady  michelle obama with all of this  is it really any wonder she was upset watch https   youtu be  featured image via video screenshot
