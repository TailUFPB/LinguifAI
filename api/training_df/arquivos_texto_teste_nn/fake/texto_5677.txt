nate silver is great at predicting the outcomes of political races  he predicted all  states correctly in the last presidential race  which involved presumptive nominees barack obama and mitt romney  in the race before that when john mccain unleashed sarah palin upon us  he correctly predicted the outcomes of  out of  states  well  the legendary political analyst has now weighed in on the  presidential race  and he predicts overwhelmingly that hillary clinton will be the next commader in chief while appearing on good morning america with george stephanopoulos  silver said  here s how to think about it  we re kind of at halftime of the election right now  and she s taking a seven point  maybe a  point lead into halftime good morning america  there s a lot of football left to be played  but she s ahead in almost every poll  every swing state  every national poll  silver isn t  poll wise  wrong  either   according to a recent poll  clinton beats trump in iowa  michigan  florida  pennsylvania  north carolina  ohio and virginia  these aren t small wins  either   they are from  to  points  so  in other words  the nation definitely appears to favor clinton over trump  silver said of the numbers  it s been a crazy year  politically  for example  arizona looks like a toss up  maybe georgia  maybe missouri  north carolina again  likewise  if trump gains ground on clinton then maybe a state like maine   used to be a swing state  not so recently    could be in play  too  in other words  trump is in trouble  as he should be  the nutjobs who are uneducated and uninformed who helped trump rise to claim the republican presidential nomination do not represent the nation  this is where the gop messed up   they lined up behind a charlatan who is running the greatest reality television show scam the american people have ever seen  and he s gonna lose remember  if you realize how dangerous trump is  vote blue  no matter who featured image via slaven vlasic getty images
