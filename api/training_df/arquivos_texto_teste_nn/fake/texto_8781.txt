when a president says one of his main goals is to cure a disease that has killed millions and is one of the main causes of death in the united states  one would think that all would applaud such a noble goal  not so with fox news  who found a way to try and discredit the president for saying he wants to cure cancer  here s what the president said last night at his final state of the union address  with the new moon shot america can cure cancer  so tonight i m announcing a new national effort to get it done  let s make america the country that cures cancer once and for all  on fox and friends  the hosts said that the president or his writers got the idea about curing cancer from the show west wing because the words he said were apparently similar to a scene from the hit show  rob lowe s character  sam seaborn  says  we ve reached for the stars  and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp  and so i announce to you tonight  we will cure cancer by the end of this decade  as usual  fox has the tendency to sensationalize a message instead of applauding the effort of the president   if you re going to rip off somebody  rip off aaron sorkin   said one of the hosts  referring to west wing s creator whether the words the president said are or aren t similar to a television show is irrelevant because the message itself is so much more important  one can only imagine if the country utilized all its resources to tackle a disease that has wreaked havoc on virtually every american family unfortunately  for fox  finding a way to attack the president takes priority over a wonderful message  it s typical of their so called right wing journalism featured image via youtube screenshot
