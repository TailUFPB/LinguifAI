 in a little over two weeks  the republican party will hold its convention to  hypothetically  name donald trump as the official nominee  conventions are usually three day long infomercials that whip up the base and kick off the tone of the campaign for the general public  they re masterpieces of propaganda with the agenda scheduled down to the minute but that was before donald trump with just a few days left before the big weekend  no one knows who is speaking  who is attending or  seriously  how much time trump himself will spend at his own nomination much of the program remains in flux  including who will speak  how and when mr  trump will arrive  and what he will say when he does and after months of promising that his convention would be special  and not  boring  like previous ones  mr  trump says he is now embracing a less is more approach one thing there will be less of  which might come as a surprise to anyone expecting all the brashness and ubiquity of trump branding  is the candidate himself trump is refusing to speak all three days of the convention  you know  his convention  apparently he just can t be bothered  he s worried people will think he s  grandstanding   because donald trump is all about moderation and humility  said no one ever but part of the problem  ok  most of the problem  is trump himself  no one wants to be seen endorsing him and trump literally has no idea what the hell he is doing at one point  two aides confirmed  mr  trump was not even aware that the event had to be held in cleveland  a decision made almost two years ago by the republican national committee that s the kind of statement that drives republican operatives to straight up alcoholism  or suicide  or both very few prominent republicans have agreed to take the stage to support trump and trump  being the pettiest of men  has declared that he will try to block people like ted cruz and john kasich from speaking unless they bend the knee to him  a most unlikely occurance trump is still promising to have big celebrity names at his coronation in lieu of big political names but he s become so toxic  it s hard to imagine anyone who is not already deeply ensconced in right wing culture showing up  ted nugent would happily get on stage to shout about guns and muslims but his appeal is limited to inbred yokels and ammosexuals on top of all of this  trump still doesn t have much in the way of a campaign organization  he s just winging it and assuming his sheer awesomeness will win the day  but at this rate  his campaign  already on life support from his numerous gaffes  scandals and general idiocy  will be doa out of the starting gate and it s not clear that trump would be able to recover from the impending disaster his debut is shaping up to be featured image via spencer platt getty images
