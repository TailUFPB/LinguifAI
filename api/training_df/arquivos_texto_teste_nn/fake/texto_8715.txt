ever since president obama made history with a groundbreaking nuclear disarmament deal with iran  republican lawmakers have tried to undermine the nature of the agreement by pointing to several american citizens who were still languishing in the country s prison  they argued that no deal can truly be reached until iran released the imprisoned americans  that all changed on saturday  january   when the obama administration pulled off yet another victory  securing the release of five american prisoners  who will now get to return to their families this is great news  right  apparently  not if you are a conservative politician rather than celebrate  republicans  still allergic to acknowledging obama s accomplishments  no matter how uncontroversial   whined and complained  donald trump  the current republican front runner  even suggested the prisoners should have stayed in iranian prison because it was a bad deal  they re getting seven people  so essentially they get   plus seven  and we get four   the billionaire said marco rubio agreed with trump that the prisoner swap was a bad idea  his disingenuous argument was that  swapping  made america weak  despite the fact that america has had no problem using the technique since the revolutionary war one of the main criticisms republicans leveled at obama was that he didn t care about the prisoners  just days before the white house announced the release of the prisoners  republican politicians and pundits were claiming obama didn t care about them at all you can t ask  jasonrezaian bc obama did a deal with iran thugs who have held jason hostage for almost  days  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  january    iran  you have exactly  days left to push a us president around  enjoy it while you can  after that  there will be hell to pay   joe scarborough   joenbc  january    fact  we now know with certainty that nothing could be further from the truth  secretary of state john kerry has been working around the clock to get these americans home   note  obama isn t the only one who gets no credit  not a single republican thanked kerry for his efforts  either  ted cruz did thank god though  praise god  surely bad parts of obama s latest deal  but prayers of thanksgiving that pastor saeed is coming home  https   t co   ted cruz   tedcruz  january    political posturing might play well with the fringe right who love to hear about obama s  failures   but the families of the victims are telling an entirely different story  according to the wife of one of the prisoners  obama was dogged about getting these americans home to their families on cnn  naghmeh abedini  the wife of christian pastor saeed abedini  imprisoned in iran since    said obama assured her that he and his administration were doing everything they could to bring him home   even while republicans screeched on fox news saying the opposite  speaking with wolf bltizer  abedini said  it s been wonderful  especially the last year  constant communication  constant updates  of course last year  we met with president obama  he was in boise  idaho   we had a private meeting with   the last  year has been the best support  they were continually updating us  talks they were having with iran and the side negotiations  i had a feeling in the last few months that it was coming to a close  but i wasn t really sure and i wouldn t trying to get my hopes up  in other words  the obama administration had been doing all the things you would hope a president would when wrestling with a tense negotiation with a foreign country that doesn t exactly love america this has been a common theme during obama s presidency  fox news pundits and right wing politicians hoping to score cheap political points take potshots at the president  because they know he can t respond  obama s silence wasn t apathy  it was necessary in order to make the deal work  so rather than tank the negotiation for his own reputation  he took the punches and worked on in silence it s worth remembering  particularly on a day like this  that the republican alternative to these successful negotiations was to quite literally start a war with iran  it s never been clear how exactly they reasoned that a new world war would help things  but then  war has always been an easy answer  diplomacy takes more intelligence  and a heck of a lot more courage watch abedini s interview via cnn below featured image via cnn
