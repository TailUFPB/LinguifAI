dallas police chief david brown just completely desecrated the favorite myth of gun nuts everywhere  that a  good guy with a gun  will heroically save the day when a bad guy starts shooting  we ve all heard it from the nra and its minions  the delusional fantasy that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun  turns out  this is bs and brown just explained why brown was taking questions on monday following a press conference discussing the vicious attack that left five police officers dead on thursday  he was asked about the open carry laws in texas  we know that there was at least one gentleman who was a subject   person of interest  during the demonstration he had an ar  around his   around his shoulder   he was asked   what does this tell you about people using the new texas law of open carry at a demonstration like this  after finding out that the person asking the question was indeed local  brown explained the position law enforcement finds themselves in as a result of open carry laws put in place by lawmakers who are in the pocket of the nra  in the process  he completely laid waste to the myth of a  good guy with a gun  saving the day  all right  so  it s a little different here in texas in the way we view open carry  concealed carry  we ve had great dialogue with our state legislators about this  we ve expressed all of our concerns  we are trying as best as we can as a law enforcement community to make it work so the citizens can express their second amendment rights but it s increasingly challenging when people have ar  slung over and shootings occur in a crowd and they begin running  and we don t know   or we don t know if they re the shooter or not  or they begin  it s been the presumption that a good guy with a gun is the best way to resolve some of these things  well  we don t know who the good guy is versus who the bad guy is if everybody starts shooting  and we ve expressed that concern as well  brown concluded by saying that he hopes lawmakers will listen to input from law enforcement when in comes to gun laws  i have every belief and trust that our folks are listening at the state on this issue  particularly as it involves protests   said the chief he also noted that time after time  congress offers  thoughts and prayers  when mass shootings take place  yet they do nothing to take any meaningful steps towards preventing tragedies like this from occurring  brown s message to elected officials was crystal clear   do your jobs  watch dallas police chief david brown obliterate the  good guy with a gun  myth  featured image via stewart f  house getty images
