conservatives and republicans love to claim that martin luther king  jr  is one of their own  they claim that the legendary clergyman and civil rights icon was a republican  and sometimes even claim that he was a conservative this is a lie dr  king had harsh words for both parties actually  the negro has been betrayed by both the republican and the democratic party  the democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the southern dixiecrats  the republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern republicans  and this coalition of southern dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights   but he said in an october  letter to a civil rights supporter that he had  always voted the democratic ticket  and in his autobiography  dr  king said he voted for john f  kennedy in  because he  felt that kennedy would make the best president   he also wrote that  had president kennedy lived  i would probably have endorsed him in   as far as the republican party  dr  king specifically attacked them for their hard turn to the right in  with the nomination of conservative barry goldwater  king said that the party had begun pandering to racist elements  and as a result  he could not support goldwater in the election versus sitting president lyndon johnson the republican party geared its appeal and program to racism  reaction  and extremism  all people of goodwill viewed with alarm and concern the frenzied wedding at the cow palace of the kkk with the radical right  while not himself a racist  mr  goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist  his candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand  in the light of these facts and because of my love for america  i had no alternative but to urge every negro and white person of goodwill to vote against mr  goldwater and to withdraw support from any republican candidate that did not publicly disassociate himself from senator goldwater and his philosophy  similarly  the right s claim that dr  king was a conservative is laughable  king was well to the left of even the democratic party  and opposed the party on key issues like the vietnam war  to which king objected  king was also a big supporter of an increased minimum wage as well was worker s rights like unionization  does that sound like a conservative martin luther king jr  was one of the most effective and dynamic leaders in american history  he was not a republican  supported democratic presidential candidates  and was a strong liberal on a host of key issues  too often king is depicted as sort of a black santa claus  devoid of politics and ideology  but that isn t the true king  he was a man of the left  and he succeeded because of that political leaning combined with his faith and the hard work of millions committed to progress featured image via wikimedia
