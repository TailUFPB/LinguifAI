former republican congressman joe walsh appeared on cnn this week where he defended a tweet that he posted threatening president obama and the black lives matter movement   this is now war  watch out obama  watch out black lives matter punks  real america is coming after you   walsh tweeted after the shooting in dallas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers on thursday during the appearance  walsh insisted that he was not trying to incite violence towards president obama  yeah  oh  absolutely  because i stand by what i meant  don   walsh said   i didn t intend to say everybody go threaten barack obama or incite violence against barack obama  i don t know of a sane person that would do that  that s not what i meant  don  walsh then went on to blame obama for the deaths of the officers killed in dallas  because i m pissed off  a lot of americans are pissed off  and a lot of police officers around the country are upset because there really is a war on our cops and a lot of police officers believe that it started with barack obama   walsh explained   the last couple of years  barack obama has done nothing but hate on cops  accusing cops of being bad and racist  but that s not accusing cops of being racist   lemon replied   he s actually pointing out a fact there is systemic racism in this country and there are police departments that need to be reformed  walsh then went on to say that most americans   himself excluded of course   are just simply too dumb to understand what president obama has said regarding his public statements on systemic racism in the criminal justice system  when he said there s systemic racism in the police department after the minneapolis shooting  he s telling people on the streets that police officers are racist  now  maybe you and i can make that distinction  but when people on the street hear the president of the united states time after time say that there is racism in police departments all over the country  man  that kind of hating leads to what you got in dallas  yeah  because  this is now war  real america is coming after you   is such a loving statement to make  maybe if has been tea party politicians such as walsh didn t say things like  obama has done nothing but hate on cops  repeatedly on social media and on television  then those  average people  might not be so quick to jump to the conclusion that president obama hates police officers  you would think that a self identifying above average person like walsh would understand that you can watch the segment below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
