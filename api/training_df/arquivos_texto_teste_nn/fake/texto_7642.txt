the last gop debate showed republican presidential candidates marco rubio and ted cruz once again joining forces and ganging up on the party s disgraced front runner donald trump what started off as a tense moment quickly diffused into a hilarious one as the two candidates made fun of trump s ability to do yoga  considering how  flexible he is on issues and policies  now  cruz and rubio are piggy backing off this comedic moment to boost their fundraising efforts this whole yoga incident started with trump trying to interrupt cruz  as usual   and cruz putting him in his place by scolding him like a child  donald  please  i know it s hard not to interrupt  breathe  breathe  breathe  you can do it  breathe  i know it s hard  i know it s hard  rubio couldn t resist jumping in and saying  when they re done with the yoga  can i answer a question    prompting cruz to add   i really hope that we don t see yoga on this stage  rubio went in for the closing punch and said  well   trump s  very flexible  so you never know  all the while  trump stood up on the debate stage looking like a complete idiot  it was possibly one of the funniest moments in the debate  and cruz s campaign immediately decided they wanted to capitalize on it   by selling their very own branded yoga mat on the campaign s online store  jeff roe  cruz s campaign manager  tweeted about the new mats to announce their arrival twitterrubio s campaign also did something similar to troll trump  on the campaign s twitter account   teammarco advertised yoga pants that had the  dumptrump hashtag on them  this product has since been deleted from rubio s website  likely because of a caveat that p ssed off supporters   fine print that read  note  you won t actually get  dumptrump yoga pants  but your   donation will help marco stop him  twitterthis is definitely the first time that yoga apparel has been a part of candidates  yoga campaigns  but considering how much the gop has made this race an absolute circus  it s hardly a surprise you can watch the moment where this whole anti trump  yoga  campaign originated from below featured image via gage skidmore
