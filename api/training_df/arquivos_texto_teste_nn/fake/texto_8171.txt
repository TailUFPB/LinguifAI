imagine you re a billionaire who buys himself an nfl team  you re obviously doing well if you can afford to even consider such a venture  but you re about to start raking it in big time  at an average of   per ticket    people or so are going to come pouring through the gates they aren t allowed to bring any food or drinks with them  of course  so if they get hungry they ll be feasting on    hot dogs and   cheese steaks  if you toss a couple of oreos in the fryer at a cost of about  cents they ll fork over another six bucks  that s not including the drinks  the bottom of the barrel at most stadiums is the   bottled water owners love to chalk up the price of tickets and concessions to the amount of money they pay their players  that certainly does factor in  but if you walk through your local mall you ll see ridiculous amounts of merchandise from teddy bears to framed pictures  hats  jerseys  shoes and even pet clothing with your team s logo on them  it s not there for free  multiply that times every mall in a team s fan base and what you have is an entity that is so ridiculously profitable it goes beyond description why  then  are we footing the bill to build these elitist one percenters new stadiums  with very few exceptions  when an owner wants a stadium  they go directly to those whose campaigns they donate to and get the ball rolling on state funds  they sell fans on voting for these funds because  don t you want to have a nicer stadium than the one in philly   ask a washington fan the answer to that one at the federal level  owners bilk all of us out of tax dollars through a tax exemption on bond interest that means that even if you live in billings montana with no chance of ever going to a wranglers game  because your market is too small for such a team to exist in any sport   you re paying for that shiny new facility they re planning in los angeles according to a  bloomberg report  the exemption amounts to roughly   billion in federal taxpayer money  in president obama s  budget  the exemption is eliminated  which would create a savings of   million for the year and hopefully create a more cost conscious building process for stadiums that will still be footed largely by taxpayers at the state and local level it s welfare for billionaires  a family of four can save for a year and spend upwards of a thousand dollars for a single afternoon at texas stadium  but jerry jones should be able to be exempt from millions in taxes because he has so much debt on a stadium he could have written a check for the presidents proposal will  of course  be met with republican opposition  because they are in the business of giving billionaires as much of your money as possible featured image from cowboyzone com
