a smart presidential candidate would immediately fire their campaign manager if he were charged with battery   especially if the person he assaulted was a female reporter  but  as donald trump has proven time and again  he is not a smart candidate  instead of firing corey lewandowski  he called into all of the morning shows and defended him on wednesday  unfortunately for him  his interview on today went downhill quickly as he was met with fierce opposition from the hosts host savannah guthrie dispensed of pleasantries and immediately asked trump is he would acknowledge that his campaign manager lied when he said he  never touched  reporter michelle fields  the billionaire immediately started making excuses for lewandowski  guthrie cut him off and said  he said he didn t touch her and the video shows he touched her  is that not a lie  the republican frontrunner responded  i really don t know   it s not all that surprising that a man who lies more than three quarters of the time can t tell when someone else is being untruthful  but then he had the audacity to say  she made up this story  savannah  if fields made up the story  why has his campaign manager been charged with a crime  clearly trump is grasping at straws after some more back and forth with guthrie  trump asked host matt lauer if he was going to  destroy a man s life after what happened   lauer didn t rise to the bait  he said  right after this incident  corey lewandowski tweeted that he was calling bull blank on ms fields  he tweeted that she was delusional and he tweeted that he never touched her  the video tape easily and plainly shows that  in fact  he did grab her and did pull her  whether you want to debate whether she almost fell down or not  he didn t tell the truth  if you re president of the united states and a member of your staff  your chief of staff  goes to the american people and publicly doesn t tell the truth in the way that corey lewandowski hasn t told the truth  would you put up with it  trump responds by saying  it was so minor  that his campaign manager probably didn t even know it happened  seriously  at that point you can hear trump clearly getting annoyed that the hosts would not allow him to get his talking points out  when lauer says they will have to  agree to disagree  and attempts to end the interview  the republican got really nasty and again accused the media of trying to ruin a great man if this is his idea of a good man  i d hate to see who he thinks is bad watch the explosive interview below featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
