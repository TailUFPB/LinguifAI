on monday  jimmy kimmel mercilessly mocked sarah palin for denying climate science by literally bringing real scientists on his show  we ve had  of the  hottest years ever since    kimmel told his audience  that s not an opinion  it s a fact  for some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue  the politicians debate it  our scientists don t  a huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening  they say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us  there s no debate about the greenhouse effect  just like there s no debate about gravity  it someone throws a piano off the roof  i don t care what sarah palin tells you   get out of the way  it s coming down on your head  kimmel said that he expected right wing trolls to attack him for his defense of science and his prediction became reality as many palin fans flocked to social media to prove their stupidity so  on wednesday  kimmel responded rather than respond by writing back to his haters on facebook and other social media platforms  kimmel chose to just embarrass the hell out of them instead by reading their comments on national television  it might seem i only picked comments from people whose grammar is bad  but the truth is  the vast majority of the comments came from people whose grammar is bad   kimmel began before reading a series of comments from people who clearly needed to pay more attention in school jim jacob couldn t even get kimmel s name right when he wrote   mr kimble if you are so smart many you should get a real job like climate scientists i give up you   erik simmy defended palin by accusing scientists of  lying to teeth  sarah palin might not be a scientist what she is saying doesn t need to be science to be understood the very scientists who claim to be telling the truth about global warming they know they re lying to teeth to help the government control our lives in the name of global warming  there are more comments and they are just as ridiculously idiotic as the other ones here s the video via youtube these right wing trolls had no idea that their stupidity would be aired for all to see  if they had known  perhaps they would have kept their mouths shut  jimmy kimmel just taught them a valuable lesson  watch what you say on social media because you re not as anonymous as you think you are featured image via screenshot
