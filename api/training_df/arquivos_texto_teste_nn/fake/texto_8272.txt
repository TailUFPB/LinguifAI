in a brief sent to the state attorney general s office on february   texas governor greg abbott insisted that putting christian crosses on police vehicles is a constitutional right in his brief  abbott wrote  even under the u s  supreme court s expansive interpretation of the establishment clause s limited and unambiguous text  the court has never held that public officials are barred from acknowledging our religious heritage  to the contrary  the u s  supreme court has long recognized the demographic and historical reality that americans  are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being  of course that an absolute lie  the supreme court has repeatedly ruled against any government sponsorship or endorsement of religion abbott goes on to claim that christian cross bumper stickers on police vehicles  neither establish a religion nor threaten any person s ability to worship god  or decline to worship god  in his own way  i wonder if he would feel the same way about islamic symbols on police vehicles  what about symbols used by the church of satan  do those belong on police vehicles like most americans  i am tired of hearing the religious right whine about how their religion is under attack in the u s   every time a judge tells them they cannot use public funds and resources to promote their personal religious beliefs there is a big difference between the state oppressing christians and the state banning christians from promoting or endorsing their religion with taxpayer dollars and or taxpayer property if you want to put a christian bumper sticker on your personal vehicle  no one is standing in your way  if you want to put one on a publicly owned vehicle  that s an entirely different story why is this so difficult for right wing christians to comprehend much to the dismay of the christian right  the government is not a vehicle for enforcing their hypocritical religious beliefs on the public in light of the christian right s constant attempts to use government to force their religious doctrine on others  it makes perfect sense that they would try to slap biblical bumper stickers on police cars when state legislatures pass laws banning oral and anal sex  denying rights to the lgbt community  attempting to ban non christians from practicing their religious beliefs  making atheist marriage illegal  even suggesting laws that would make not going to church a crime  it s already frighteningly clear that they want police to act as the armed enforcers of their religious doctrine in spite of governor abbott s ill informed brief on this subject  even the slightest semblance of police being used as the  enforcers of christianity  is a clear violation of the establishment clause over and over and over again these right wing nuts whine about how their religion is being oppressed in the united states let s get something straight  religious oppression is when the government attempts to keep you from practicing your religion on your own time and using your own resources  barring you from using the stuff other people paid for to promote your religion  is not oppressive if the government were to force all christians to wear a special id badge designating their religion  that would be oppressive  or if the government were to bar christians from entering the country  simply because of their religion  that would be oppressive  or if the government were to create a special database for christians so that they could be easily identified and closely watched  that would be oppressive only the government does not do that to christians on the other hand  right wing christians in government  including texas governor  greg abbott  sincerely want to do those things to muslims thankfully  the establishment clause was created to protect christians from experiencing the kind of government oppression they would gladly inflict on others it s also there to protect the rest of us from right wing christians who would use our government  our tax dollars  our public property and our public employees to force their skewed version of christianity down everyone s throat with a police issued revolver image from  on flckr  cc     some changes were made to this image
