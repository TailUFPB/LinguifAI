president obama made a change in policy this week that has added weight to the boycott  divestment and sanctions movement against israel moving forward  goods produced in the occupied west bank and sent for sale in the u s can no longer be marked  made in israel   they must state their place of origin as the  west bank   this will mean that  for the first time  americans will be able to boycott israeli goods produced in the west bank  this option was not possible before the change  as consumers would have no idea whether the product was made in tel aviv or ramallah  the clarification makes actions against israeli companies that are occupying the west bank much easier to target the law itself has existed since the clinton administration  but is rarely  if ever  enforced  as forward notes according to an april  u s  customs and border protection notification  products made in the west bank or gaza  shall be marked as  west bank    gaza   or  gaza strip  and shall not contain the words  israel    made in israel    occupied territories israel  or words of similar meaning   moreover  it states   failure to mark an article in accordance with the requirements shall result in the levy of a duty of  percent  of the product s value however  the obama administration has issued a memo stating that from now on  this rule is not optional for israel  now it s mandatory why the change  obama has been notably opposed to the boycott movement since its inception one contributing factor may be that us israel bonds are at their weakest after a number of mendacious moves by israeli leader benjamin netanyahu first  netanyahu had israeli security services spy on private nuclear deal talks between the us and iran  and sold the secrets to republican lawmakers in washington then  netanyahu worked out a deal to deliver a speech in the u s congress  just two weeks before the israeli elections  in which he railed against obama s deal with iran  a foreign leader  undermining the foreign policy of america s president  from the floor of its own congress  was unprecedented aside from these huge spats  the israeli leadership have thwarted all attempts at bringing a just and peaceful solution to the occupation of palestine  most notably  ordering the expansion of the illegal settlement program on the very days the john kerry and joe biden flew in for peace talks  this total intransigence has meant that the situation for palestinians is now markedly worse than at any time in the history of the conflict the west bank has been broken up into a series of open air prisons  around which israel has built its giant apartheid wall  the wall is higher and longer than the berlin wall  and cuts across the west bank  shutting off city  town and village from one another  the wall is controlled by israel  meaning palestinians are imprisoned in their own towns  unable to travel to work  or see friends or family members cut off by the wall meanwhile gaza on the west coast is penned in by a wall of its own  again controlled by israel  in the last decade  israel has launched no fewer than five large scale military offensives against those living in gaza  the summer of  saw israel launch a  day air  ground and sea assault on the gaza strip  israeli forces killed   palestinians  of whom   have been identified as civilians  including  children  they destroyed the homes of more than   people and over   people  a third of them children  were left with life altering injuries  i was reporting on the ground from gaza during this period and what i saw amounted to nothing short of a massacre if the world community is uncomfortable with palestinians using the rudimentary armed response to these aggressions with which they are equipped   home made rockets  or suicide attacks   then it is imperative that they support non violent resistance such as the palestinian led  global boycott  divestment and sanctions  bds movement  the bds movement seeks to put economic and diplomatic pressure on israel s apartheid state in a similar way to that applied against south africa s apartheid state in the    only with aims to be more systematic and specific than its predecessor  it is starting to have a tangible impact that is being felt within israel in response  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has declared war against the bds movement  last year  strategic affairs and information minister gilad erdan s office was given the task of fighting bds  and awarded  additional ministers and an  million      budget increase to fulfil its mission  the propaganda efforts seem focused on branding all external bds movement support as  anti semitic  while deeming internal critics as  the enemy within  israel s greatest threat is not the bds movement  obama or the palestinians  the greatest threat to israel is zionism  and the rising fascism promoted by this ideology  an ideology which says jewish people alone have the right to live in freedom  peace and dignity in a land which has been a melting pot of several religions and ethnicities for thousands of years in order to preserve itself as a jewish state  israel must import jews and exile non jews   and such conditions make democracy impossible  this is what anti zionist israelis know in their hearts  and why they support the palestinian led bds movement despite such opposition at home   because they re consciences will not permit them to do otherwise featured image via flickr incog
