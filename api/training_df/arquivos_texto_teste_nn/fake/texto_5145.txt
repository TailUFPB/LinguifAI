more proof that donald trump s presidential campaign is helping the fascist arm of the right wing has just come in  during the july broadcast of his radio program  rocky suhayda  the chairman of the american nazi party declared that trump s campaign is a  real opportunity for people like white nationalists  not only does suhayda think that trump presents an opportunity to build new  politically active white nationalist coalitions  he also believes that trump will win the election in november for  various reasons   suhayda believes that the  enemy  is in for a real surprise  i m gonna project  that i believe that trump is going to win the election this november  for various reasons which i don t want to go into again  i think it s gonna surprise the enemy  because  i think that they feel that the white working class  especially the male portion of the working class  and with him  his female counterparts have basically thrown in the towel  given up hope of any politician again standing up for their interests  suhayda then goes on to say that it is time for an american nazi political caucus to form in congress  he also urges his followers to adopt the guise of being  pro white  rather than overtly racist against minorities  now  if trump does win  okay  it s going to be a real opportunity for people like white nationalists  acting intelligently to build upon that  and to go and start   you know how you have the black political caucus and what not in congress  and  everything  to start building on something like that  okay  it doesn t have to be anti  like the movement s been for decades  so much as it has to be pro white  it s kinda hard to go and call us bigots if we don t go around and act like a bigot  that s what the movement should contemplate  alright  trump has received support from the worst of the worst within the white nationalist and white supremacist movements  it s ridiculous to think that trump might actually win the presidency this november  poll after poll shows democratic challenger hillary clinton winning the election  that being said  trump s campaign itself is being used as a  conversation starter  for the kkk to recruit new members  according to the washington post trump s campaign is dangerous for the united states  republicans who support him are supporting white supremacist movements  well  more so than they already tacitly do through racist policy decisions  november is fast approaching and it is time for republicans across the united states to dump trump and the fascist factions of the far right that support him you can listen to the radio broadcast below featured image from scott eisen getty images
