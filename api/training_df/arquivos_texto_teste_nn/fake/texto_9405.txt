it s pretty common knowledge for anyone s who s tortured themselves by watching the view  that it s really nothing more than a liberal  think tank for dummies with too much time on their hands  only one month ago  meghan mccain left her job at fox news as a co host on  the five  to plant herself at the end of the table  where anywhere between   angry women spend one hour every weekday telling their viewers why they re angry  and why they hate president trump and anyone who supports him  thankfully for meghan  she s the daughter of rino senator john mccain  one of the angriest men in politics  so she knows a thing or two about how to handle angry  and irrational people  who are driven by hate  and inspired by their desire to seek revenge  she also knows that her position at the end of the table  where the token  conservatives  are seated on the view   was likely offered to her because she was already on the anti trump train and didn t need any coaching every day  it becomes more and more obvious to the viewers that the pressure cooker relationship between unhinged co hosts  joy behar and sunny hostin  and their hated opponent meghan mccain won t last  if i was a betting woman  i d bet mccain is packing up her dressing room and heading back to fox for another attempt at more intellectual discourse and meaningful dialogue by the end of this year watch   there s a lot of democrats asking for  to step down if you can believe it i don t just watch fox   mccain said  looking at behar   fox is sex harassment central   behar interrupted  you know what  that s so cheap  i m trying to talk about the fact that i watch other networks and people in your party are calling for the stepping down of al franken because of this investigation being a distraction   a frustrated mccain shot back whoopi attempted to interject  before losing her words and simply exclaiming   well  shoot  i was responding to joy  i just don t think that saying fox is x  i know  i used to work there   mccain continued   we re talking about the present  this is what s exhausting about this conversation  i totally agree with you that it s absolutely disgusting at this point that we re still having conversations about roy moore  he should step down  but right now we re talking about another senator  we re also talking about hypocrisy  which is what provoked my outburst   behar explained   trump s hypocrisy  fox s hypocrisy  breitbart  sean hannity  all of them  what about the hypocrisy of bill clinton right now   mccain asked  prompting joy to ask   why bring up bill clinton at this point  it was at this point whoopi stopped the conversation in its tracks  saying   we re doing and we ll be right back   before the show went to commercials   toofabdo you think meghan mccain will last another month on the view  we d love to hear your thoughts below
