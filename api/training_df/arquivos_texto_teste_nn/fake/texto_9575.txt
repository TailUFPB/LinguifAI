well  well  well as a famous  reverend  once said  obama s  chickens have come home too roost or as mike huckabee said   govmikehuckabee  i think it s easier to find bigfoot and amelia earhart than it is to find collusion between the russians and donald trump pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  october    for america  ofa   the former president s political organization  has directed nearly a million dollars to the very same law firm that funneled money to fusion gps  the firm behind the infamous steele dossier since april of   obama for america  ofa  has paid over    to perkins coie  records filed with the federal election commission  fec  show the washington post reported last week that perkins coie  an international law firm  was directed by both the democratic national committee  dnc  and hillary clinton s campaign to retain fusion gps in april of  to dig up dirt on then candidate donald trump  fusion gps then hired christopher steele  a former british spy  to compile a dossier of allegations that trump and his campaign actively colluded with the russian government during the  election  though many of the claims in the dossier have been directly refuted  none of the dossier s allegations of collusion have been independently verified  lawyers for steele admitted in court filings last april that his work was not verified and was never meant to be made public fec records as well as federal court records show that marc elias  the perkins coie lawyer whom the washington post reported was responsible for the payments to fusion gps on behalf of clinton s campaign and the dnc  also previously served as a counsel for ofa  in shamblin v  obama for america  a  case in federal court in florida  federal court records list elias as simultaneously serving as lead attorney for both ofa and the dnc ofa  which managed obama s successful re election campaign in   retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president s agenda during his final term in office  the group reorganized again after the  election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose president donald trump  during the entire  campaign cycle  the group spent only    million  according to fec records federal records show that hillary clinton s official campaign organization  hillary for america  paid just under    million to perkins coie in   the dnc paid nearly    million to the law firm in  the timing and nature of the payments to perkins coie by obama s official campaign arm raise significant questions about whether ofa was funding fusion gps  how much obama and his team knew about the contents and provenance of the dossier long before its contents were made public  and whether the president or his government lieutenants knowingly used a partisan political document to justify official government actions targeting the president s political opponents named in the dossier  according to the washington post  fusion gps was first retained by perkins coie on behalf of the democratic national committee  dnc  and hillary clinton s presidential campaign in april of  at the same time that hillary s campaign  obama s campaign organization  and the dnc were simultaneously paying perkins coie  the spouse of one of fusion gps s key employees was working directly for obama in the west wing  shailagh murray  a former washington post reporter turned political operative  was serving as a top communications adviser to obama while the obama administration was reportedly using information from the dossier to justify secret surveillance of trump campaign staff  murray is married to neil king  a former wall street journal reporter who was hired by fusion gps in december of   while at the wall street journal  king worked alongside fusion gps s core team  even sharing bylines with glenn simpson  the fusion gps executive who personally hired steele to probe trump s alleged russia connections as you might suspect   neil king was a thick as thieves with cnn  the wsj and the washington post  the lines between investigating the truth and fake news were blurred in a big way when king and catan jumped from the wsj to fusion gps  as the daily caller reported cnn s reporting on the trump russia dossier has left out at least one crucial fact  the close ties between the network and the opposition research firm at the center of the dossier controversy cnn s reporting on the dossier  led by justice correspondent evan perez  has been favorable to the firm  fusion gps  and hyped the dossier s credibility  left out of perez s reporting  which has relied largely on unnamed sources  is his personal closeness to fusion gps  operatives  fusion has repeatedly been described in senate testimonies as a smear for hire operation that manufactures misleading or false media narratives for its clients  another fusion founder  tom catan  worked as a reporter for the journal at the same time as perez and simpson  the third fusion co founder  peter fritsch  worked above perez and simpson as the senior national security editor king  fusion gps  on the right  photo posted on facebook by perez  cnn simpson and fritsch left the wsj in  to launch fusion  perez jumped from the paper to cnn in   another longtime journal reporter  neil king  left the paper to join fusion in december  perez   left  and all of fusion the importance of the fake dossier and how it was shopped around to the press comes into focus when you realize that obama  clinton and the dnc had fusion gps create this smear campaign on trump  this also opened the door for the phony russia collusion investigation whereby the trump campaign and family members were spied on because of something fake read more  the federalist
