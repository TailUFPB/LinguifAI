the entire southeast is on a right wing tear with bills designed to directly attack the rights of lgbtq people  and especially those of transgender people  first  it was north carolina gov  pat mccrory signing a horrible  sweeping piece of legislation that literally legalizes discriminating against lgbtq people in the state  and stopping cities from doing anything about it on their own turf  south carolina has now followed suit of course  this means that violent  nutty right wingers are up in arms  thinking there will be  men in women s restrooms   one facebook page  however  really takes the cake  american   strong  posted this vile meme to their page  and the hate for transgender people poured in so fast it would make your head spin  here is the meme if you think that s bad  the comments are even worse  the people on that page are not even hiding their out and out hate  in fact  these dangerous right wingers sincerely believe that transgender people should be murdered  just for using the bathroom in public like everyone else  here are just a few of the comments on that vile page other comments  while not overtly violent  were certainly steeped in disgusting fear and ignorance  and there s certainly plenty more comments like that where these came from  these people aren t just ignorant  they are dangerous  some of them literally said that they would murder transgender people over a visit to public facilities as far as i am concerned  anyone advocating for murder online  especially toward a group of people who are already murdered at an alarming rate just for existing  should be in jail  shame on anyone who thinks violence like this is okay featured image via wikipedia
