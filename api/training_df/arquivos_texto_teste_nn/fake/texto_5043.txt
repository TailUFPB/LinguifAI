donald trump s refusal to release his tax returns has been an issue that has dogged him for his entire campaign  while it is not legally required for presidential candidates to release those documents  it has been tradition for them to do so in the interest of transparency for the electorate  however  trump refuses  he uses being audited as an excuse  but that makes no sense since all of the returns from previous years are not being audited  and  even if they were  that would not prevent him from releasing them  trump isn t releasing his taxes because there is something in there that he doesn t want us all to see  it s as simple as that well  gop rep  steve king made an appearance on msnbc s morning joe on monday morning  and of course  trump s tax returns became a topic of conversation  rep  king says of the matter  i just think the window for that has passed  when he said that he wouldn t release his returns till the audit was over  and he d been being audited for  years  i d say that for him to release them is just a forgone conclusion  donald trump will not release his tax returns  king added  if he drops it now  into this presidential intense sprint around to the final turn part of the race  i think that would be the only discussion we would hear all the way until november  well  rep  king  they ll be talking about it anyway  trump should release his returns so that people can see that he has nothing to hide  you re right in saying that it is way past time for him to release these tax documents  and you re likely right that he won t do it  because there s probably some very damning things in there that would hurt his candidacy even more than the heat he is taking for refusing to release watch rep  king s remarks below   stevekingia  the window for trump tax returns has passed https   t co   morning joe   morningjoe  august    image via video screen capture
