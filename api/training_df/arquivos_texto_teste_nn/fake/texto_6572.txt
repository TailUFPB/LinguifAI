donald trump is an idiot  ted cruz is also an idiot  ted cruz s father  rafael cruz is an idiot who is responsible for the birth of an idiot  now that that s out of the way  on tuesday donald trump managed to say something so ridiculous that he makes cruz and his father look like utter geniuses by comparison  in his desperation to attack the greasy  weasly  lying right wing extremist  trump actually blamed ted cruz s father for the assassination of president john f  kennedy recently  the national enquirer claimed that a photo unearthed from the warren commission s report on kennedy s assassination depicted the elder cruz handing out pro castro literature with oswald just months before the latter shot and killed the president  rafael cruz was an open castro supporter and a self avowed  marxist leninist   but even if he was photographed near oswald that doesn t mean he was responsible for murdering a sitting president of the united states or does it   spoiler  no  f ck no  asked about rafael cruz stumping for his son  trump told fox and friends that ted cruz s father is responsible  at least  in part  for kennedy s death  citing the enquirer story  he said  you know  there s a whole thing and  you know  his father was with lee harvey oswald prior to oswald s being   you know  shot  i mean  the whole thing is ridiculous  what is this  right prior to his being shot  and nobody brings it up  they don t even talk about that  that was reported and nobody talks about it  but i think it s horrible  i think it s absolutely horrible that a man can go and do that  i mean  what was he doing   what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death  before the shooting   trump continued   it s horrible  https   www youtube com watch v myehlknbtfuted cruz later responded to trump s claims that his father was at least partially responsible for killing jfk  after calling trump s assertion  nuts  and rightfully pointing out that is  not a  reasonable position   cruz had some fun with the situation  i guess i should go ahead and admit that  yes  my dad killed jfk  he is secretly elvis  and jimmy hoffa is buried in his backyard  whether or not cruz actually killed jfk  the enquirer stands by its claim that the photo does indeed depict cruz and oswald together  though cruz denies even that much  it s entirely possible that the photo may be legitimate  but there is as much chance that rafael cruz was involved in a presidential assassination as his son s likelihood of being elected president can we say for certain that rafael cruz didn t kill kennedy  no   but i think it s a reasonable assumption that  if cruz were involved  donald trump would not have broken the story watch cruz mock trump below featured image via houston chronicle getty images  scott olson
