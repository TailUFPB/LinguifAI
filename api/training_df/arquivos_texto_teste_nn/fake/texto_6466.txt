right after ted cruz suspended his presidential campaign  evangelical christians went nuts  pouring sadness and fear all over social media about their own fate now that their personal government crusader was not going to make it to the white house  now  it seems they ve gone into complete  total and utter despair  crying that there s nobody left to represent them and their dominionist ideals according to the washington post  nebraska pastor gary fuller had a sunday service planned around ted cruz remaining in the race  instead  he had to tell his congregation to vote according to their convictions because he didn t know what else to say  he also said  in a sense  we feel abandoned by our party  there s nobody left  honestly  b o o h o o  religion needs to be left out of government  and if they have to learn that lesson the hard way  tough bananas the post notes that evangelicals tend to vote according to social and moral issues  and ted cruz ran his campaign on those issues  candidates that run on social issues tend not to do well  though  because there are far more pressing issues on which to vote than who s screwing whom  who s marrying whom  and what women are having done in their doctors  offices these people have a problem with trump s being married three times to three different women  and the fact that he doesn t have much interest in fighting for their ideals on social issues  he s a hardliner on immigration  and his main focus has been on that  plus jobs and the economy  however crazy and unworkable his ideas actually are  social issues are non issues to trump right now  which  if the gop unifies behind him  makes them non issues for the entire party russell moore  of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention  whined to the post  this year the republican party has not just surrendered on the culture wars  they ve joined the other side  and that s a unique situation  many evangelical christians don t seem to believe in the  amendment   some  like disgraced alabama supreme court justice roy moore  even think religious protection only applies to christianity  anything else is infringement on their beliefs  even if it doesn t directly affect them ted cruz was their savior  and now he s out to this  we say our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them and their dashed hopes for turning us into a christian nation this year featured image by richardlwelsh  licensed under cc by sa   via commons
