it s infuriating that there are still men who act like total pigs ellie parker only wanted to have a wonderful first valentine s day with her girlfriend  so she took her to asahi japanese steakhouse in lafayette  indiana  they had expected good service and good food to make their evening special and memorable  but it only became memorable for all the wrong reasons she explained on facebook that she and her girlfriend attended dinner with a group and the chef came out to their table to to cook the food right there in front of them  which is pretty cool  not cool is what the chef did next  he proceeded to ask the women at the table if they were with their boyfriend or husband  and then acted completely rude when parker said she was with her girlfriend that s when the chef crossed the line from professional to creepy asshole  he not only told both women that they needed a man  he inquired as to whether he could be that man as if he could turn the lesbian couple straight but parker describes the incident much better  i m not normally one to complain on social media  but the service i had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining  i took my girlfriend out to asahi for our first valentine s day together  our chef came to grill our food for us and was asking everyone if the person with them was their boyfriend or husband  he got to my girlfriend and i and asked where our valentines were  we told him we were each other s valentines  we were holding hands mind you  clearly a couple  he proceeds to say  well it is legal  but it s such a waste to not have a man   later he continues to insult our relationship by saying he could come home with us to  heat things up   i am appalled that i would receive this kind of treatment  i cannot believe i paid over   to have my relationship insulted and sexualized  at the end of dinner  parker wrote on the receipt  don t tell lesbians they need a man on valentine s day   apparently  the restaurant was so embarrassed that they gave them their money back here s an image of the receipt via parker s facebook page         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt i m not normally one to complain on social media  but the service i had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining  posted by ellie parker on sunday  february     asahi should either fire the chef or at the very least force him to take sensitivity classes because this is about as unprofessional as it gets  featured image from facebook
