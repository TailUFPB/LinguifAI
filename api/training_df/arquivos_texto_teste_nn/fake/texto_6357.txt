a meteorologist wearing a rather classy dress was shocked when a male anchor humiliated her on air because he felt her clothing was inappropriate  in a scene straight out of the  s   anchor chris burrous decided that libert  chan s dress was a huge problem   large enough to interrupt her reporting of the weather with the breaking news that he felt she was dressed like a dirty  dirty harlot as she was delivering the wind report  chan noticed a hand entering the frame  that hand was clutching a drab  gray sweater  what s going on   chan asked   you want me to put this on  why  because it s cold  we re getting a lot of emails   burrous explained as he thrust the sweater forward  what   a shocked chan replied  echoing the sentiments of any reasonable person watching the broadcast  really  chan smiled uncomfortably as burrous put the sweater on her in the middle of her report   there you go   he said condescendingly  i look like a librarian now   she said as she attempted to process what had just happened  that works   the anchor responded   it s a librarian who s gone to a cocktail party  everyone s got an opinion about your dress this morning  interestingly  chan had just spent a considerable amount of time off camera where she could have been approached about her dress if there was a problem  but  of course  there wasn t a single issue with her clothing   the anchor  however  chose to shame her on camera simply because she looked good in what she was wearing  i m sorry but the other dress didn t work   chan told her asshole of a coworker   i had to wear something  the rest of chan s report was uncomfortable  with the meteorologist doing a spectacular job of masking the rage that was building inside her after she was shamed for simply wearing a piece of clothing  at one point  she broke into nervous laughter  i m trying to hold it together in my little sweater   she explained unlike burrous  she managed to keep things professional the rest of her time on air  the male anchor was correct  though  everyone does have an opinion on chan s dress   more specifically  his reaction to it  unfortunately  he s not going to like those opinions         just to add some perspective  these are the hugely professional shorts burrous was wearing as he shamed his coworker the station has not yet released a statement  but anything less than  chris burrous has been fired  and we apologize for shaming our incredibly talented meteorologist who deserves a raise  is inadequate watch it below  via raw story featured image via screengrab
