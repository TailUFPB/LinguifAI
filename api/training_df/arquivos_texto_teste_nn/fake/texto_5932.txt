all the political buzz right now is whether or not elizabeth warren will be hillary clinton s vice presidential nominee  the once neutral massachusetts senator has now passionately endorsed clinton to be the democratic party s nominee for president of the united states  and women s groups are ecstatic at the thought of a two women ticket but what s more significant isn t that a clinton warren ticket would be comprised of two women  it s that it would be comprised of two former republicans coming together to usher in one of the most progressive party platforms this country has ever seen clinton  who was a goldwater girl and a republican until   and warren  a republican until   both had their reasons for leaving the gop and joining the progressive movement  clinton let over her opposition to the vietnam war  and the party s veiled racist messages at the  republican national convention  these veiled racist messages would later be known as the southern strategy  elizabeth warren  on the other hand  who is roughly the same age as clinton  stayed in the gop for a lot longer  but realized  coincidentally  during the clinton administration  that they were nothing but a bunch of frauds suckling at the teat of big money  i was an independent  i was with the gop for a while because i really thought that it was a party that was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets  and i feel like the gop party just left that  they moved to a party that said   no  it s not about a level playing field  it s now about a field that s gotten tilted   and they really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle class american families  i just feel like that s a party that moved way  way away  two iconic  liberal women  both former republicans  now  they may be the next president and vice president of the united states compared to warren  and indeed sanders   clinton is certainly the more moderate one  but that doesn t mean she isn t a progressive in her own right  fighting for the rights of women and children for decades and standing up to lobbies that want to turn back the clocks  clinton s compassion for working families  coupled with warren s watchdog zeal for the big banks  seems to make us forget they started with conservative backgrounds it s interesting how that works  from humble  conservative backgrounds to being the front page news on the cusp of history   as democrats some conservatives cow tow to the elites  like the so called  reagan democrats   and others wake up one day  look around  and realize that the system isn t working anymore  so they become democrats  and fight to make the country a better place while the democrats have  hopefully  chosen an evolved ticket  republicans have nominated a constant flip flopper  trump was a democrat before   republican from  to   reform from  to   democrat again from  to   republican again from  to   independent from  to   and is now a republican  again these two ladies had what s called a natural progression  trump  he s seen opportunities to benefit him and only him with warren and clinton  america gets exactly what they see  with trump  who knows  but what we do know is this  clinton   warren chose to become democrats  and have stuck by that principle for decades  and they may very well be our next president and vice president featured image via mark wilson getty images
