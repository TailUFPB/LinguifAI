donald trump has released a campaign ad detailing his plans for his first day as president of the united states of america  it is a window into hell the video was released via trump s facebook page and twitter account on friday night  and for those hoping for a little more policy detail from trump  we got it  sadly  it is a little worse than we imagined what would trump do on his first day  he would rescind every single executive order made by president obama  why  because he doesn t have to go through congress this would mean trump took primary aim however  at gun control and immigration  trump would revoke the new gun control laws put in place in response to sandy hook and the mass shooting epidemic  he would also remove the protections obama put in place for the children of undocumented immigrants that would prevent them being deported  these are people who have been born  or raised for the majority of their lives  in the united states  but trump wants these protections removed so he can fulfill on his plans for the forced mass deportation of undocumented migrants and any children living in the united states he says  i would get rid of the attack on our second amendment  because that s what obama is doing when he does that i would very  very strongly get rid of the attack on the border  we have a border that s like a piece of swiss cheese  people are pouring through  that order will be the single first thing i do and we will work on all of these executive orders  and the bad ones  of which mostly that s what you have  will be terminated immediately my first day in office  never mind that the man can t construct a simple sentence without turning it into word soup  this is what a trump white house will look like  it would a more cruel  more authoritarian  less safe america  eight years of progress  disappeared  with the swipe of a pen  https   www facebook com donaldtrump videos  featured image via screenshot
