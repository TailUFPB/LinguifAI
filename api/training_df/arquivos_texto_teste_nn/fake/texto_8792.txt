rowan county clerk kim davis already had her five minutes of fame  her time is over and done with  or is it  at  least  it was until some republican by the name of jim jordan  r ohio  gave tickets to president obama s last state of the union address to the family research council  who then  in turn  gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to mrs  davis now  unfortunately  her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes  heck  we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world tuesday night  but  the reality is  she is  for some reason  people can t get enough of kim davis   she must have all the makings of a star a reporter caught up with davis after obama concluded his last remarks for the night  and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience  it was a speech  en exclusivit  mondiale  kim davis pour l afp   je voulais encourager tous les chr tiens  pic twitter com   ivan couronne   ivancouronne  january    not the kindest reply  it certainly was much more of a speech   it also wasn t the most thought provoking either  but  hey  what else do you expect coming from the mouth of kim davis  here is a suggestion for kim  in four words   just do your job in all fairness  the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was  and it s not even close  while it s never a good thing to be mean  she must have known a good roasting was coming her way here are a few of the top  and funniest  comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via uproxx pic via uproxx pic via uproxx pic via twitter pic via twitter what can we say  kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we  as a people  continue taking the bait  she may not be relevant  but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that  her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized  right up there with speaker of the house paul ryan  he appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech  with a few slight movements here and there  it was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and kim davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying  maybe they were playing chicken with each other  we don t know  what is clear is that kim davis will forever be in our memories  if not in our hearts featured image via screen capture
