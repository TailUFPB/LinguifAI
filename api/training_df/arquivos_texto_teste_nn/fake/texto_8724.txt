if there s one thing that conservatives and fox news want more than anything  it s for president obama and his administration to fail  this has been their narrative since he took office  and they d love for him to follow through with what they ve been saying  unfortunately for them  that s just not the case  the economy has recovered  more people have health insurance  osama bin laden was killed  marriage equality is the law of the land  credit card companies are better kept in check  and a deal for a nuclear free iran was reached on top of countless other achievements on the latest edition of traitor tv  fox news seems rather upset that obama and his administration are actually getting the job done  five prisoners have just been released from iran  four as part of a negotiation  one of the prisoners released is washington post journalist jason rezaian who was held for more than  days in iranian captivity  according to cnn  the release was arranged as part of a prisoner swap involving seven iranians held by the united states on sanctions charges  the officials confirmed  the deal comes after more than a year of secret negotiations  this is a huge development  and also goes directly against the narrative republicans have been touting during debates  and fox news has been delivering for years  they ve insisted that president obama is going to get us into war with iran  but more and more evidence to the contrary keeps making itself known and because they re technically a news media outlet  and not officially the media branch of the republican party  fox news  fox   friends had to report these latest negotiated releases with iran  however  by the looks on their faces  they don t seem thrilled to deliver the good news  after all  they ve just been proven to be the liars that they are  yet again  video featured image  c l
