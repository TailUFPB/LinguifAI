this article contains spoilersthe district attorney responsible for the questionable  convictions of steven avery and his  year old nephew brendan dassey for the murder of teresa halbach has found a new and sickening way to profit from his actions  he is going to write a book ken kratz became infamous after the release of netflix docu series making a murderer  produced over  years by film makers moira demos and laura ricciardi  the  part series details the harrowing plight of steven avery and his young nephew first  avery is falsely convicted of the rape of a woman and spends  years in jail before new dna evidence clears him of the crime then  just two years after his release  and when he is on the verge of a   million settlement with the manitowoc sheriff s department for their role in the false conviction and the failure of subsequent appeals  he is arrested for another murder   year old auto trader photographer teresa halbach disappears after an appointment at avery s salvage yard  weeks later her car  and burned remains are found on steven avery s property despite the overwhelming physical evidence  questions linger in manitowoc  wisconsin  is the sheriff s department framing him again  as the defense team start examining the evidence  it becomes clear that all is not right with this  evidence  but just as the prosecution s case is beginning to unravel  they obtain a confession from avery s  year old nephew brendan dassey  katz holds a press conference which he opens like the title sequence of the twilight zone  warning viewers under  years of age to leave the room  he launches into a harrowing and explicit description of teresa halbach s murder it later emerges that teenager s confession  was obtained after hours of interrogation  during which he had no attorney or legal guardian present  much of the testimony appears to be fed to him by the investigating officers  and it is clear that dassey  with an iq of just   has very little idea of what is happening  essentially  a false confession wrangled out of a mentally disabled teenager regardless  kratz milked the  later retracted  confession for all it was worth  holding no fewer than seven pre trial press conferences in which he implicated dassey and avery in the crime legal experts have blasted kratz for these tactics  which effectively ruled out any possibility of a fair trial for avery and dassey  ben kempinen  university of wisconsin law school clinical professor of law and director of the prosecution project  told the post crescent  to me  those press conferences would suggest a colorable violation of the  bar association  trial publicity rule  the risks of prejudice are magnified in smaller communities because of the pervasive nature of the publicity and the likelihood that virtually the entire community will have strong feelings about the case  the avery case appeared to have captured the attention of the fox valley market   and you cannot un ring that bell  avery s lawyers filed a motion on this basis  asking the judge to dismiss the charges against their client due to inflammatory and highly prejudicial  pre trial publicity  however  manitowoc county circuit judge patrick willis rejected the motion  ruling there was no legal precedent for such  drastic  action both avery and dassey were convicted in   and have remained in jail ever since  it is hoped that the popular outrage mobilized by the doc series will add new weight to their appeals process meanwhile  ken kratz was later caught up in a scandal of his own making  in   married  year old kratz was prosecuting a domestic abuse case on behalf of  year old victim stephanie van groll  however  van groll was forced to turn to police after receiving more than  sexually explicit texts from kratz during the course of the prosecution  according to radar  kratz began with sexually suggestive messages  i know this is wrong  i am such an honest guy  and straight shooter but i have to know more about you  are you the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected da the riskier the better  however  when van groll refused to engage with his fantasies  he turned nasty  fast  below are three of the many texts he sent her after she ignored his advances  hey  miss communication  what s the sticking point  your low self esteem and you fear you can t play in my big sandbox  you may look good at first glance  but women that are blonde   tall  legs and great bodies don t like to be shown off or to please their men    he wrote on oct    i m the atty  i have the    house  i have the  figure career  you may be the tall  young  hot nymph  but i am the prize van groll told police she was terrified  kratz hinted he would throw her entire case out of court if she continued to refuse his advances  leaving her at the mercy of her violent partner a year later  kratz was divorced  and forced out of office over the scandal  van groll later filed a case of sexual harassment which was settled out of court in  now  kratz is seeking to weasel his way out of the shadows with a book about the case  telling action  news that he is finally grateful to tell the whole story  given kratz s track record  we expect he is more grateful for the opportunity to cash in on the global attention generated by the success of the docu series if new evidence cannot be found  steven avery will remain in jail for the rest of his life  and brendan dassey is not eligible for parole until the year   the fact that kratz is still looking for ways to milk this injustice confirms what we suspected   this is a man without shame featured image via netflix post crescent
