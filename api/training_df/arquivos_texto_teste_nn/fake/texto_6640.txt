a little noticed detail in the  biography lost tycoon  the many lives of donald j  trump has just resurfaced and come back to haunt him   big time no one gave it much thought when trump s then wife  ivana trump  revealed to her friends that despite being amazing at erecting skyscrapers  the business mogul struggled in the bedroom department  thanks to an initiative by politico to bring five of trump s biographers together to discuss the republican party s frontrunner  this little detail came back to life  politico reported what the different biographers have revealed  with ivana s comments coming from harry hurt iii  want to know where trump inherited his entrepreneurial bent  gwenda blair traces it to his grandfather  who ran a series of restaurants in the klondike that featured some of the best food in town  as well as private areas where  sporting ladies  could  entertain  miners  who was really doing the deals that made trump famous  wayne barrett will tell you the only signature that really mattered on a contract belonged to trump s father  fred  what broke up trump s first marriage  harry hurt iii writes that ivana  confided to female friends that donald had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection  that personal detail managed to fly under the radar and actually make it into the published book because it was overshadowed by ivana s claim that trump attacked and raped her during their marriage  hurt was the first reporter to break that news  and the only reason that his publisher was able to avoid a lawsuit was because trump was too dumb for his own good  hurt said  prior to the publication of my book  he and his lawyer  jay goldberg  came to scream at the folks at norton  mainly about ivana s divorce deposition  and finally donald got so frustrated  he jumped up and he pulls a tape recorder out of his coat pocket  he said   i ve been recording all this   and our little lawyer looked at him  and goldberg just turned like this napkin  white   you ve been recording this and you didn t tell us  that s not right   and i m going   yeah  they walked out and i said   he can t sue us now  he s not going to sue us because they just shot themselves in the foot  now of course  making fun of someone s issues in the bedroom is no laughing matter  but the fact that it s trump   a man who forced millions of people to watch him talk about how big his d ck was during a gop debate   is slightly humorous  it merely validates what we ve all known   trump s brash  vulgar behavior is just a cover up for some deep seated insecurity featured image via ralph freso   getty images
