many people will assume those who are religious will automatically vote republican  that may be true with evangelicals and protestants  but that s not the case with catholics  jews and muslims but there is one religious group that is stuck between a rock and a hard place  mormons it s no secret mormon voters  especially in utah  hate donald trump  he s arrogant  vulgar  an adulterer  a liar and a sneak  and he openly exults it with little to no shame the new york times found that trump does in fact have a  mormon  problem  with only  percent having a favorable view of the republican candidate  in the utah republican primary  trump finished dead last with only  percent of the vote  ted cruz won  when it comes to hillary clinton  mormons often give the same response   the cold shoulder   but not with the same vitriol as shown to trump that s why clinton is seizing the opportunity and appealing to weary voters in utah and aboard  hoping to solidify a coalition of traditional religious  republican voters in an op ed featured in a newspaper owned by the mormon church  clinton makes that appeal head on  writing i ve been fighting to defend religious freedom for years  as secretary of state  i made it a cornerstone of our foreign policy to protect the rights of religious minorities around the world   from coptic christians in egypt to buddhists in tibet  and along with jon huntsman  our then ambassador in beijing  i stood in solidarity with chinese christians facing persecution from their government we stood up for these oppressed communities because americans know that democracy ceases to exist when a leader or ruling faction can impose a particular faith on everyone else clinton drew parallels between mormons  who were once profiled and discriminated against  and trump s call to ban muslims from entering the united states everyday trump continues to prove he lacks the morals to be our commander in chief  with a new and outrageous headline seeming to pop up every day  it s easy to forget that trump showed us his true colors early on  when he proposed banning all muslims from our shores  that would undue centuries of american tradition and values  when it comes to religion  we strive to be accepting of everyone around us  that s because we need each other the editor of the newspaper shed some hopeful light on the prospect of a clinton win for utah  stressing that the republican  mormon voter base has a  libertarian streak  when it comes to the issue of immigration  which affects the southwest more than any other region in the united states  sensing that immigrants make communities stronger  mormons tend to be more sympathetic to their plights  and the newspaper also noted that mormon voters are  very sensitive  to religious persecution  which trump has successfully made a crux in his campaign the last democrat to win utah was lyndon johnson in   let s make it happen again in  featured image via steve pope getty images
