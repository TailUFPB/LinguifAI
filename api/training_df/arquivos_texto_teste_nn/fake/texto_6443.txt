the country woke up to confusion today as budweiser beer company abruptly announced that  america s no   full flavored lager  will be replacing its name with  america  on its cans and bottles until the election in november  why  who knows  but that s not all  the company will also pack in even more patriotism per can  ppc  by adding a potent mix of quotes from the pledge of allegiance and lyrics from  the star spangled banner  and  america the beautiful  if that seems like something conservatives would be all over  then they are about to be very disappointed  as hemant mehta over at the friendly atheist noticed  the cans have opted to replace  in god we trust  with  e pluribus unum    the original  albeit unofficial  motto of the united states  out of many  one the latin phrase  which was widely used from the country s inception  and has only recently taken a backseat to america s later  official  motto putting the country s faith in god  is a reminder that from america s outset  the founders put a lot of stock in the concept of national unity and strength in togetherness  the lesson  god is great and all  but a country full of varied and immensely multi cultural backgrounds needs to unify around itself  not any particular god for some  that may be some bitter beer to swallow  given the nearly endless capacity for conservative christians to get offended  this motto change will likely prompt a strong backlash from the people who brought you the  starbucks red cup  boycott  suddenly  a watery beer will become ground zero for the ever expanding  war on christianity  that conservatives assure us is really  definitely  totally happening ironically  the fact that a beer can emblazoned with  america  on the front will now be heavily politicized along party lines and highly controversial kind of says it all  doesn t it  america  indeed featured image via budweiser
