just over a week ago  the state of florida became home to the worst mass shooting in modern american history  omar mateen walked into pulse nightclub in orlando and opened fire with a semi automatic rifle  murdering  people and injuring  others  in the week since the attack  republicans have proven just how little they care about the people they are supposed to serve and there is no greater example of this than greg evers   a gop candidate for congress evers is a candidate for a congressional district that is located just a couple hours away from orlando and he has decided that the best way to honor the people lost at pulse is to give away a gun that is similar to the one they were murdered with  the candidate announced the independence day raffle on facebook  saying  with terrorism incidents on the rise  both at home and abroad  protecting our constitutional rights has never been more important  with all that s happening in the world today  i ve never felt stronger about the importance of the second amendment in protecting our homeland than i do now  the washington post reports the custom built ar  rifle  which the evers campaign says is the  homeland defender  collector s edition  will be given away to one randomly chosen person who has liked and shared evers  page or signed up on his campaign website  it is open only to adults in the district  the winner will be selected on july  and must pass all required background and security checks the rifle was made in santa rosa beach  florida  and displays the second amendment on a metal plate on the right side near the trigger guard on evers  facebook page  which has a whopping   fans   evers whined that his gun giveaway post had been removed  after a california based liberal activist reported the post for  promoting graphic violence    it s interesting that he is trying to convince florida voters that a scary liberal from california is out to get him  especially given the fact that facebook does not tell users who reported their posts https   www facebook com  photos a      type  theaterso  not only is evers an nra puppet  he is a lying nra puppet as a florida resident and the best friend of someone who lost someone in the shooting at pulse  i can not adequately describe how sick it makes me to see republicans using the massacre to push their moar gunz  agenda  if the gop actually cared about us  they would pass common sense gun legislation  but they refuse  their response to the shooting is more evidence of why we should vote blue  no matter who featured image via facebook
