the reason republican presidential frontrunner donald trump decided to bring  sarah palin back into the limelight is still unclear  she was the poison pill for john mccain in   and has made a career off saying wildly moronic things the latest wildly moronic thing she said happened when she decided to blame president obama for her son s domestic violence arrest  she said  they come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country  and that starts at the top  it s a shame that our military personnel even have to question  have to wonder if they re respected anymore  it starts from the top  the question  though  it comes from the top  the question  though  that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder   do you know what we go through  do you know what we re trying to do to secure america and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us  so when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back  i can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of ptsd and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with  and it makes me realize more than ever  it is now or never for the sake of america s finest that we ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them  she s more than implying that president obama doesn t currently respect our troops  which is just an outright lie  and it is also not the president s fault if her son may suffer from post traumatic stress disorder  ptsd   nor was it his fault her son was arrested  knowing this  and calling sarah palin out for this uncalled for and vicious attack  is the head of the new york city based veteran s organization iraq and afghanistan veterans of america  iava   paul rieckhoff said  it s not president obama s fault that sarah palin s son has ptsd  ptsd is a very serious problem  a complicated mental health injury and i would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular  also stating  it s important to recognize that track may need help like many veterans  this is a great opportunity for sarah palin to sound the alarm about ptsd  now that she has endorsed mr  trump  i would encourage her to talk with him about it  mr  trump s campaign is pretty light on specifics about what he would do for veterans  adding  i hope this doesn t become a political chew toy in a political campaign  reickhoff seems to really hope that palin chooses to discontinue her efforts of politicizing ptsd  hopefully  palin can recognize that she is a public figure and can use her position in politics to not just become famous  but rather promote positive change in the lives of veterans nationwide  outright blaming the president for ptsd is petty and wrong  and thankfully she was called out on it featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
