when nbc news chief foreign affairs correspondent andrea mitchell calls a presidential candidate  uneducated  on foreign policy  we should listen because that s precisely what she had to say about republican front runner donald trump on sunday during an appearance on meet the press mitchell has been nbc s foreign affairs expert for over  years so she knows what she is talking about  so whenever trump has opened his mouth to talk about international affairs  she is taken aback  he cannot stick to a subject  it is remarkable   mitchell told chuck todd   and when he doesn t know something  he just changes the subject  and makes it all about himself  todd had just referenced an interview where trump changed the topic rather than answer a question about whether he would use a nuclear weapon against isis chuck todd mentioned that national security talk is especially noticeable to people like mitchell who have literally spent their careers keeping up with foreign policy  he would cancel defense treaties with japan and south korea against north korea   mitchell said in reference to a trump interview with the new york times   he would be okay if japan and south korea go nuclear  american policy for decades since world war ii has been trying to keep nukes out of that arena  then mitchell explained how trump would hurt america by cutting off our oil supply from saudi arabia if the saudis refuse to pay the united states more money for defense  which would likely hit our economy like a ton of bricks as oil prices rise and the price of gas skyrockets  if we re going to make america less dependent on foreign oil  we have to do so gradually because all at once would be a disaster but she was particularly concerned about the fact that trump doesn t seem to understand that iran isn t allowed to buy american planes  nor does he know that china is north korea s biggest trading partner  he is completely all over the lot  mitchell said   on iran  he complains that iran isn t buying our planes  it had to be pointed out to him that iran is still under sanctions and cannot buy american planes  he thinks north korea and iran are the biggest trading partners  when north korea s biggest trading partner is china  and then she finished slaying trump with a single line that should worry every american  he is completely uneducated about any part of the world  todd went on to consult katy tur about what she has learned about trump s lack of foreign policy chops  and she mentioned that trump  doesn t understand the function  of us military bases around the world and  why they are there   which would be a very important thing to know to be an effective commander in chief of our armed forces here s the video via youtube donald trump is an idiot when it comes to domestic policy and foreign policy  but considering the issues we face internationally whether it be terrorism  rising tensions in the middle east  competing with china on the world economic stage  and dealing with a refugee crisis  the last thing america needs is a leader who doesn t know anything about any of these issues beyond campaign rhetoric that lasts a full sentence before the subject is changed presidents cannot just change the subject rather than deal with a foreign policy crisis  they have to figure out a solution to the problem and being uneducated about the situation to begin with doesn t exactly build confidence that the problem will be solved competently and since trump has proven that he can t do that  it doesn t make any sense whatsoever to elect him to the highest office in the land with a greatest responsibility in the world featured image  screenshot
