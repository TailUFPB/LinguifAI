jennifer lawrence has been speaking her mind lately  in an interview with glamour  the academy award winning actress went no holds barred on a lot of issues  including the recent attacks on planned parenthood  she said  it s so awful  it isn t an attack on abortions  it s an attack on women  because planned parenthood is so much more   my mom was really religious with me when i was young  she s not so much anymore  and i wouldn t have been able to get birth control if it weren t for   i wouldn t have been able to get condoms and birth control and all these things i needed as a normal teenager who was growing up in a jesus house  lawrence was referring to the november attack on a planned parenthood clinic in colorado  when robert lewis dear killed three people and wounded nine  planned parenthood  which delivers sex education and reproductive health care to women  has faced attacks before  there have been three attacks since september after an anti abortion group accused planned parenthood of selling baby parts  the flames were fanned by republicans  including presidential candidate ted cruz  who said  they were certainly caught on film  that there is no doubt that they were selling baby parts  that is unambiguous  the videos show senior planned parenthood officials selling the parts of unborn children  and it is a federal criminal offense  it s a felony to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit  that accusation has proven to be false  but the damage done when a public figure makes such statements is enormous  similar to trump s verbal attacks on islam  which has caused a spike in attacks on muslims across the united states  lawrence s feelings about the republican party are already documented  i was raised a republican  but i just can t imagine supporting a party that doesn t support women s basic rights  lawrence believes that planned parenthood provides important services to women  and she was horrified by the recent attacks  she said  i am a successful woman who has not had a pregnancy    but seriously  what harm comes from supplying people with birth control  condoms  pap smears  and cancer screenings  she s right  planned parenthood provides services to women that they wouldn t have access to otherwise  a recent study shows  for the millions of poor women who depend on planned parenthood clinics  this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling  as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections  stis   later in the interview  lawrence was asked why she decided to take a stand on major issues  she said  i keep going back and forth on being opinionated  my business is based on everybody buying tickets and seeing my movie  it s not smart  business wise  to be opinionated  but then what s the point in having a voice at all if i m not going to use it for what i truly believe in  you can read a transcript of jennifer lawrence s full interview here
