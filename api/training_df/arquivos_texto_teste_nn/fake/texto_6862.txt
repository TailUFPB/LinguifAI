if you watched the most recent democratic debate between candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders  you may have noticed that things got a bit brutal  with the crowd noises even seeming reminiscent of a wwe showdown clearly noticing this were the folks over at saturday night live  who literally had hillary  played by kate mckinnon  and sanders  played by larry david  going head to head  are you feeling that bern     snl pic twitter com   saturday night live   nbcsnl  april    the snl reenactment of the debate they had a members of the audience ask the candidates questions  and since the debate took place in new york city  one of the trusty citizens was  elaine benes  from the hit show seinfeld played by this week s snl host julia louis dreyfus  who perfectly reprised her famous role elaine wanted to know how exactly bernie was going to break up the banks  and lets just say  she wasn t too fond of his answer  bernie answered  once i m elected president  i ll have a nice schvitz in the white house gym  i ll sit them down and yada yada yada  they ll be broken up  with elaine replying  you can t yada yada at a debate  of course   yada yada yada  also being a famous line from seinfeld   and seeing julia louis dreyfus back with larry david who co created the show alongside jerry seinfeld was definitely amazing elaine  clearly annoyed  asked hillary  doesn t it suck to be the only girl in a group of guys  and when hillary said yes  elaine added   don t worry  because everyone thinks you are by far the funniest i mean  the most qualified  there were also questions from  rachel green  from friends  but elaine had one more question for sanders  senator sanders  you believe the super rich should pay more in taxes  but wouldn t that be bad for actors who made a lot of money on a certain very successful sitcom  even worse for the person who created that sitcom  of course  speaking of herself and david david s sanders responded  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  you should vote for her  all in all  it was definitely a lot of fun to see elaine back in action  now  if only she would do her infamous dance featured image via video screen capture
