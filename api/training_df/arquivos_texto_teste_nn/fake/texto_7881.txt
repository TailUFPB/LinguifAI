republican national committee chairman and anthropomorphic weasel person  reince priebus  joined cnn for an interview where he tried to convince alisyn camerota that the rnc was  in control  of trump and republican voters  to say it was not convincing would be an understatement priebus actually thinks that the rest of america doesn t hear his entire party railing about how bad trump is  and how his fascistic platform will be the doom of the gop  priebus responded  i embrace all of these candidates there folks are competing to join us  they are competing to join the republican party as our nominee depending on what the delegates decide to do or who wins the requisite amount of delegates  in cleveland  we re going to vote on the floor for who that nominee is   that nominee joins the republican party  that s what s happening priebus actually seems to think that trump is going to come to him  kiss his ring  and request his permission to be the nominee  while i can t read trump s mind  i would bet hard cash that will never happen camerota pointed out that there is a huge amount of the republican establishment that has been railing against trump  and planning what are essentially anti trump firewalls to halt his juggernaut like campaign and popularity  but you re making it sound simpler than  in fact  it is  because as we have heard time and again over the past few weeks  there is a whole chunk of the republican establishment that is not embracing donald trump  in fact  they re rejecting him  we have heard about all of the big donors  all of the republican party elders  all of the people in congress who are basically saying anyone but trump  camerota piled on more  reading an editorial from the washington post that was critical of priebus and his apparent cowardice to stand up to trump and his hate fueled campaign  the reaction from priebus was simply priceless  i ve heard comebacks from  year old schoolboys that were better the best part of it  though  is watching priebus have to try to respond to the attacks calling him a powerless leader without also insulting trump  it would be painful to watch him tie himself in knots like this  except for the fact he s a republican  that makes it just pure entertainment watch reince priebus get proven to be the most impotent and powerless rnc chairman ever below featured image via video screen capture
