cnn host chris cuomo definitely drew the short straw when he was asked to fill in for host don lemon  on  tonight with don lemon   unfortunately for cuomo  he was tasked with interviewing the outrageous  nonsensical lavar ball  father of ucla basketball player liangelo ball  who was arrested in china for shoplifting  americans were outraged when lavar refused to  thank  president trump for asking chinese president xi to allow the young men to be set free  and took it a step further when he insisted trump didn t deserve any credit for his son s release watch cnn compiled a list of some of lavar ball s most incredible comments during the interview  here is a sampling of lavar s bizarre remarks during the interview  our comments are in italics   it s not like he was in the us and said  ok  there s three kids in china  i need to go over there and get them  that wasn t the thought process  right  i don t have to say  to go around saying thank you to everybody  you come around and shake my hand  and meet me  or meet my son  or anybody and then say you know what  maybe i can help you out  just because people say things  you know  that s supposed to be true  like hey  i stopped him from serving ten years  maybe we were doing some talking with other people before he even got there  i don t have   no doubts about what he did  i got doubts about what he didn t do  huh  if i m coming to get you out of trouble  you best believe i m going to take you with me  it s just somebody ask me a question and i gave a lot of confusion to you  uhh while we re talking about confusion  can someone please explain what the hell he just said  why is it confusing  are you concerned  somebody can make a suggestion and somebody could do something  you have people that make suggestions you got people that do things  why are we talking about this with all these political matters going on in the world  says the guy who has no idea why president trump was in china in the first place  i know exactly what i said  but you buffered it up like you said that you don t want to say thank you to nobody  buffered it up  i know you re trying to add tone to it because that s what you do  can you  add tone  to someone s tone when they  themselves are speaking on tv  i had some things done  i talked to some people that did some things  too  if you want something  and you want it  you shouldn t just go and steal it  you can to africa and somewhere and do the same thing anywhere you go in someone else s country  yes  it s going to be a little deeper than what you thought it was  ball asked cuomo if trump paid their bail  suggesting that if he did  then  he would be grateful to the president  this comment is nothing short of spectacularly incredible  i m asking you  i m asking you  did he do it  let him do his political affairs and let me handle my son and let s just stay in our lane  somebody asked me a question  man  i give him my opinion  but i am not taking a shot at the president   yeah  okay lavar  whatever you say i m not the other guys  though  i m not the other guys  i m doing something else  i m not the other guys   lavar ball then goes on to ask cnn host chris cuomo to  thank  him  can you say thank you  mr  lavar ball  when cuomo seems to be confused as to why ball is asking him to  thank  ball  ball then asks another idiotic question   give me a couple of reasons why you re thanking me  you don t say thank you like any kind of word  next  lavar reminds the cnn host that he has a title  and would appreciate it if chris cuomo would address him by his title  my title is lavar ball  the big baller  the ceo of the big baller brand  but the chinese people were like  you know what  he s ok  he has so much character in  years that he s allow to have a pass for that  uhh actually  no they weren t  they were thinking about how many years his son would be sentenced  possibly to hard labor for the crimes he committed in their country this may be the funniest line of all  ball asks the anti trump cnn host if he s  trump s brother   are you trump s brother  you want me to thank you  did you thank the doctor for bringing you into this world  well  you better go back and find him  because you lucky  apparently  this is lavar logic ball then changes gears and makes yet another strange comment  i like how you keep saying my whole name  man  cuomo then responds to ball  explaining that his friends call him  mo    my friends call me mo  you can call me mo  finally  ball makes his final and completely ignorant remark to end the completely off the wall segment with cuomo   chrome mo like google  like the google chrome
