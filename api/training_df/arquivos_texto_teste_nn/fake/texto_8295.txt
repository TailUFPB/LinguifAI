on january   president obama declared a federal emergency in the city of flint  michigan  the president s declaration was issued even as evidence mounted that officials in the state s government had willfully and knowingly allowed tens of thousands of flint residents to consume poisoned water for more than a year as a result of decisions made by michigan governor rick snyder   children under the age of six have been confirmed to have irreversible lead poisoning  as testing continues  another   children are likely to be diagnosed with elevated levels of lead in their blood emails and leaked documents from the snyder administration show that the governor and his appointed emergency managers were aware of the problem with the city s water for more than a year as addicting info reported here  an in depth report by the aclu of michigan shows that state officials falsified documents and rigged tests  to purposely mislead the epa regarding the amount of lead in flint s water in addition to poisoning thousands of people with lead  michigan officials  including the governor and his hand picked emergency managers  not only ignored a massive spike in cases of legionnaires disease  but blocked attempts by health officials to determine the cause or take appropriate steps to protect public health ten people died from exposure to the waterborne legionella bacteria in spite of the fact that state officials knew that the water was likely contaminated with this deadly bacteria and poisoned with lead  they repeatedly assured flint residents that it was safe to drink while it is tempting to believe that what happened in flint can t happen to any of us  the reality is that unless we learn from this unprecedented disaster  it not only can happen to us  it likely will here are the ten most important things that americans must learn from the flint water crisis michigan s emergency manager law  passed by the state s republican tea party legislature and signed by governor rick snyder  provides for the establishment of a puppet government across the state  the law gives governor snyder the legal authority to remove elected officials  democrats  and replace them with a single  unelected  manager  every emergency manager in the state is hand picked by the governor the state s emergency managers are bestowed with unlimited power to make decisions on behalf of the local government  in the meantime  the people elected by the citizens are stripped of power  and their voices are silenced  in flint  detroit  pontiac  benton harbor and elsewhere across the state of michigan  local residents have been shut out of the decision making process entirely make no mistake  the state s emergency manager law not only allowed the citizens of flint to be poisoned  it allowed snyder officials to cover up the contaminated water for more than a year as republican governor chris christie advances a michigan style emergency manager law in new jersey  it s vital that residents of atlantic city understand how this law set the stage for the flint water crisis flint is a horrifying example of what happens when right wing extremists are allowed to make decisions that impact the lives of thousands of citizens the decision to use the flint river as a water source for the city was made by snyder s appointed emergency manager in flint  ed kurtz  there s also evidence that this decision came down directly from the governor s office the story of how   people were poisoned by their own government is best understood in terms of right wing ideology  the people who were charged with making decisions for flint can be described as typical right wing extremists  they are epa haters  regulation opposers and science deniers these underlying beliefs allowed them to justify their illegal actions  both to each other and to themselves  to them  rigging tests  falsifying documents and flat out lying to the environmental protection agency was just a way to get around the  evil epa  with all its  oppressive  costly and unnecessary regulations  did they believe that their actions would cause harm to tens of thousands of people  it s possible they did  but it s more likely that their underlying anti federal government  anti regulation ideology allowed them to convince themselves that their actions would not really harm anyone  these are people who really believed that  evil government regulations  only exist to oppress the free market  not protect the public those beliefs are exactly why politicians who subscribe to right wing ideology can never  ever be trusted to make decisions that could potentially impact the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a long list of people  all appointed by michigan governor rick snyder  played a role in the flint water crisis  all of them were uneducated  inexperienced and unqualified for the positions they were appointed to  not a single person who played a role in the switch of the city s water source to the flint river had any knowledge or experience in this area nowhere is that more evident in the fact that emergency manager ed kurtz eliminated the use of corrosion control  to save roughly    a day that single uneducated decision virtually destroyed the city s infrastructure  and created the lead contamination flint residents are facing today to understand the level of ineptitude this plummets to  bear in mind that flint is the only city in the united states that had no plan for corrosion control whatsoever corrosion control for all municipal water supplies is mandatory under the safe drinking water act in order to cover up for the fact that corrosion control was eliminated by snyder appointed officials  state officials lied to the epa as reported by dr  marc edwards of the flint water study program here on february     mdeq s stephen busch unequivocally and falsely responded to epa that  the city of flint has an optimized corrosion control program  and  conducts quarterly water quality parameter monitoring at  sites and has not had any unusual results  this was a flat out lie it wasn t until much later that the epa learned that michigan officials had been deceiving the agency about the use of corrosion control in flint as mlive reported nearly a year later  epa officials were stunned when they discovered the truth  i was stunned when i found out they did not have corrosion control in place   miguel a  del toral  regulations manager in the epa s ground water and drinking water branch  said in an interview with the flint journal mlive today  jan    in my head  i didn t believe that  i thought  that can t be true that s so basic  that s not possible  unfortunately  it was possible it was also the direct result of governor snyder appointing a list of unqualified  uneducated and inexperienced businessmen to be in charge of the city s water supply a close examination of michigan government shows what can happen when a single political party seizes control of all branches of government the two party system of government is essential to a healthy democracy  not only is the system meant to safeguard against the kind of dictatorship being imposed in michigan  but a second party with at least some amount of political power is necessary to keep government in check in michigan  the right wing has virtually succeeded in suppressing any voice that is not its own michigan s single party rule has eliminated from government anyone that could reasonably be expected to investigate corruption or hold state officials accountable for their actions michigan has a right wing attorney general  secretary of state and governor  along with a legislature that is entirely controlled by tea party and republican representatives  there is virtually no  other party  with any power in michigan  because of that  there is no one to act as a watchdog for state government and there is no one to hold state officials accountable when attorney general bill schuette finally announced an investigation into the flint water crisis  michigan residents laughed  no one was surprised when scheutte chose a private lawyer  who is not accountable to the public  to conduct the investigation  nor was anyone surprised when it was revealed that the recently hired investigator is a republican party donor  who helped elect rick snyder as democracy web explains it there are ideological movements that reject the central tenets of multiparty electoral democracy but exploit the system s freedoms and processes to seek power  these include fascism  communism  and some forms of religious fundamentalism and ethnic or racial nationalism  generally  parties with such ideologies use a utopian vision for the future to justify the imposition of a dictatorship once they reach government  while other parties are sometimes allowed to exist under their rule  real political power is exercised solely by the governing party  in these single party systems  the ruling party is also a source of patronage  the main vehicle for personal advancement in politics and society  and a mechanism for strictly enforcing conformity to the dominant ideology  underground parties or movements often organize against such regimes  but these are subject to severe repression the flint water crisis could not have happened without this total imbalance of power in the state s government michigan citizens apparently voted for rick snyder because of his  business experience   that was their first mistake snyder s experience as a venture capitalist and corporate ceo did not make him more qualified to govern a state  if anything  it made him less qualified throughout his career  snyder has been driven by the corporate doctrine of shareholder profit above all else  the only thing considered  unethical  in the corporate world is losing money we got a first hand glimpse into the corporate decision making process in   that year leaked documents showed that the ford motor company had compared the cost of recalling the company s pinto to the cost of letting people die when the car s engine exploded  the company s analysis showed that it would be cheaper to let people die than to recall the car  so they did corporate ethics revolve around doing whatever you can get away with to protect or increase shareholder profits  this is the world that ceo s like governor rick snyder live in in relation to flint  the media narrative has been that the source of flint s drinking water was switched to the flint river to  save the city money   this narrative is simply not true a feasibility study ordered by former michigan state treasurer andy dillon showed that switching the source of flint s water would cost the city more  that report was thrown out by state officials emails released earlier this month  however  verify that it would have saved flint hundreds of thousands dollars to stay with the detroit water and sewer  even in the best case scenario after the switch  flint residents experienced a massive hike in their water rates  the increase in cost left many citizens unable to afford to keep water on in their homes  but those citizens who lost access to flint s poisoned water may have been the lucky ones if snyder considered the citizens of michigan his  shareholders  than none of these decisions make sense  he wasn t saving the city money as he repeatedly claimed  he wasn t doing the citizens of flint any favors  either but snyder s decisions were never based on what was best for the city of flint  nor the residents of that city there s a whole different set of  shareholders  whose identities are not yet known these are the people who michigan s emergency manager law was set up to benefit the law is formally known as public act   embedded in the text of this law is the provision for state emergency managers to receive unlimited amounts of private cash section    f  reads in addition to the salary provided to an emergency manager in a contract approved by the state treasurer under subdivision  e   this state may receive and distribute private funds to an emergency manager  as used in this subdivision   private funds  means any money the state receives for the purpose of allocating additional salary to an emergency manager snyder set up a fund for these secret private donors  which he originally called the nerd fund  cash was transferred through this fund directly into the pockets of snyder s emergency managers after a public outcry over the nerd fund  snyder told the citizens of michigan that it had been eliminated  that was another lie snyder simply changed the name of the slush fund from the nerd fund to the moving michigan forward fund the same unnamed donors who have been lining the pockets of michigan emergency managers for several years  are now footing the bill for snyder s recently hired pr firms watch this video from wxyz the fbi and the department of justice criminal division are now investigating the flint water crisis  let s be clear  without the hope of an independent  outside investigation by federal authorities  michigan citizens would be left without recourse michigan is one of two states in the country which exempts the governor and all state lawmakers from freedom of information requests any government that goes to these lengths to hide what it is doing from the public is a government that cannot and should not be trusted right wing lawmakers have no desire to make government work  they work to make government fail  nowhere is that clearer than in the state of michigan  where snyder s appointed officials repeatedly broke federal laws  with devastating consequences  it s no surprise that republicans are now trying to use the flint water crisis as proof that  government doesn t work  there s nothing more dangerous to a corrupt government than an informed and involved citizenry being informed doesn t mean getting your news and information from the same source or sources all of the time  either sometimes being informed just means talking to other people  reaching across the aisles and stepping outside of your usual comfort zone the people of flint tried for more than a year to get the public s attention  we should ask ourselves why we didn t listen sooner if we are to make sure that what happened in flint never happens anywhere again  then we have to decide that we will not let factors like income or race or political affiliation determine whether or not we are willing to listen to our fellow citizens if we can learn anything from the flint water crisis  it s how important it is for each and every one of us to use our voting rights now  if we don t  we can  and almost surely will  lose them later right wing politicians like rick snyder do not believe in democracy  they do not support your right to vote  nor your right to participate in government make no mistake  the only rights the people of michigan have left are those which are protected by the federal government  at the state level  the right wing legislature has removed the people s ability to participate in local government  these same lawmakers virtually eliminated the citizen s ability to recall their elected officials  they have also made it impossible for the voters to repeal legislation this is what the far right has accomplished in michigan in just a few short years imagine what they will do if they gain complete control of the federal government these are certainly not the only lessons we should learn from the flint water crisis  but if we all just learn these ten  and we truly take them to heart  our society will be so much better off going into the  election  image credit from michigan municipal league
