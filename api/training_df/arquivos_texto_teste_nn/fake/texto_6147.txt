as the presidential race heats up and the coffers start to pour in for a general election  senate democrats are preparing to introduce a package of reforms aimed at curbing  once and for all  the influence of big money in politics  this is a liberal s dream come true spearheading the reforms is senator chuck schumer of new york   who is poised to become majority leader should the democrats take back the senate  closely involved with schumer are sens  tom udall  sheldon whitehouse  claire mccaskill and tammy baldwin included in the package is a constitutional amendment that would overturn citizens united and other supreme court decisions that have allowed dark money to be injected into the political process the disclose act would be included  which would require outside  anonymous groups that spend money on political campaigns to make the identities of their donors public  no more dark money  no more twice removed parties  no more secrets in campaign finance a new program in the package would replace the watered down  virtually powerless fec with a five member independent agency that would tasked with enforcing rules an regulations in a fair and open manner when it comes to fixing america s broken election system  democrats will include in the package the fair act  which would effectively end partisan gerrymandering by requiring the states to establish independent commissions to draw district lines  and not lawmakers who hold majorities senator claire mccaskill has apparently bee working on a reform to increase voter turnout and participation  which could mean a provision establishing automatic voter registration according to msnbc there are other efforts to address voting rights on capitol hill  a group of democratic lawmakers earlier this week announced the formation of the voting rights caucus  which has  members  all democrats  they said they ll introduce legislation next month that would ban voter id laws that force voters to pay an associated cost  for instance by requiring them to obtain a birth certificate to get id a new constitutional amendment  a new agency to replace the fec  automatic voter registration and an end to gerrymandering  this is a package every american should support  considering the overwhelming majority of americans  including republicans  support getting money out of politics  oppose dark money contributions  and support fair elections  the gop has no leverage to oppose any of these measures but they will  such a package would surely fail a republican controlled senate and house  but this is an election year  and a year where democrats could make great strides  if democrats show up at the polls in droves  we could finally have an america free of big money in politics if democrats are serious about political revolution  they will need to come together to have a blue white house  congress  supreme court and state legislature featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
