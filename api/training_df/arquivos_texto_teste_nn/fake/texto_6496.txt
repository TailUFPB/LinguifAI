thanks to an absurd legal ruling  donald trump won t have to answer to charges of defrauding people of tens of thousands of dollars until after the election  a federal judge decided it would be unfair to make him testify while he s running for office   presumably because it could give people the impression that he s a conniving huckster who fleeces gullible rubes in order to line his pockets  heaven forbid trump s lawyers were extremely satisfied that they managed to convince a federal judge to schedule trump s trial   including his appearance on the witness stand   after a previous judge had scheduled the hearing for june  it could have seriously hurt his political career  instead  a san diego judge told trump s legal team that the law could wait until late november   three weeks after the election donald trump will testify after the presidential election on a class action lawsuit that accuses the billionaire businessman and his now defunct trump university of defrauding people who paid up to    for real estate seminars it seems likely that  should trump win  the lawyers will change their mind about trump attending the trial  however  he ll be busy organizing his transition team and preparing to move to the oval office  or moving the oval office to trump tower  perhaps  it would seem that getting to the bottom of whether or not donald trump willfully defrauded eager students of non existent  real estate seminars  of    would be very important for voters who are deciding whether or not to put that man in office  as it stands  most voters will likely have no idea of the pending litigation against trump come election day as if to highlight the baffling favoritism  the fbi recently announced that despite not finding any evidence that hillary clinton committed any crimes with her emails  they are asking her to come into conduct a series of interviews with them just to be sure  the meetings will be sure to be covered wall to wall on the news networks and will lend further credence to spurious claims that she had done something wrong  fair and balanced so there we have it  one candidate who has never been charged is subjected to endless scrutiny and legal harassment  another who has more pending and settled lawsuits than any presidential candidate in u s  history got a federal judge to do him a solid and postpone justice for the people who he ripped off before he decided he d move onto bigger scams  if the moral arc of the universe does indeed bend towards justice  than we are still clearly behind the curve featured image via tom pennington getty images
