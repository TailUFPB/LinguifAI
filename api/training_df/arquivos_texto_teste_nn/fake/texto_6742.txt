california is one of the most expensive areas of the nation to live in  that s no secret  however  there are plenty of people who live there who aren t high rolling actors  singers  producers  and other wealthy beverly hills types  there are plenty of everyday folks who live in california  and many are being priced out of their homes and neighborboods  this problem is something that people are attempting to resolve in costa mesa  through ordinances regarding development  but one official has a completely heartless  solution  for poor families who cannot afford to live there  move somewhere else the idea of an ordinance to make a town affordable for a variety of income levels sounds like a good one  right  well  not to city council members in costa mesa  the original idea was that there would be a choice for housing developers  either have some units that almost anyone could afford  or pay the city for the privilege of providing only luxury housing  however  the entire idea has now been shelved  council member katrina foley says of the original idea  which she personally championed  the goal is to try to protect the quality of the community   don t overbuild it  use measured development that is planned and thoughtful  i don t see that we re doing that in any way  shape or form  and we re definitely not providing housing for our workforce  another member of the costa mesa city council  sandy genis  says the ordinance would essentially apply to those developers who somehow benefit from building in costa mesa  if we re giving something  we need to get something  if we re going to have a healthy community  we need to have housing for our workers  the thing is  though  the idea for the ordinance in costa mesa is not a new one  the ever increasing costs of living in a place like california mean that  according to records  one third of cities and counties in california have adopted some form of inclusionary zoning   as it should  california does not have an asterisk next to its name that says  only rich people welcome  however  mayor pro tem jim righeimer is totally heartless on the matter  he says he is  quote   completely against  affordable housing ordinances  and insists that if people cannot afford costa mesa  they need to pick up and go elsewhere  i m going to be very clear  and this is a wakeup call to people  if you cannot afford to live here and your kids can t have decent housing  you should look at where you can afford  that is  of course  the most cold hearted response to this housing crisis this horrible man could come up with  does he really think poor families can afford to move across the country at the drop of a hat  hell  the move itself would cost thousands  that s not even including the part about switching schools for children  finding new jobs  finding places to live in a new location  leaving extended family behind   the list goes on and on does this guy even think about what he is saying here  mr  righeimer  we re all aware of how expensive california is to live in  and it is that expense that is the problem  not the poor people you want to price out of their homes you  sir  have no business holding office anywhere if you cannot represent all of your constituents   including the poor ones featured image via mark boster getty images
