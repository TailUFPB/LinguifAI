the party that claims to be  pro life  sure has a funny way of showing it  this week  the cdc released a dire report on the spread of the devastating zika virus in the united states which found that the number of confirmed cases in pregnant women has ballooned to  in a matter of months  the disease which has only a mild effect on adults has been shown to lead to major birth defects in children  including a major risk of microcephaly how did republicans in congress respond  by underfunding the fight   and then earmarking it for next year  and only if democrats to agree to slash welfare funding of course  on tuesday  the senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on thursday of    billion to fight the mosquito borne zika virus  which has been linked to birth defects  unlike the senate legislation  the house bill requires that the    million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere  many conservative republicans in the house refuse to approve zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits  while democrats and some senate republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts by next year  the number of cases will likely be in the thousands and the already lowball funding will be even less effective  if that sounds like a truly idiotic plan  experts agree and have condemned it  in response to which one republican whined   we will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill for next year s zika response  so to suggest that somebody is being shortchanged the money is just being prudently laid out at the appropriate pace and paid for along the way    note   hundreds of millions  is less than    billion  is right now really the time to get  serious  about stewardship of the federal deficit   absolutely   say republicans who may have just realized they only have a dwindling number of months to stick their thumbs in president obama s eye and can t miss this opportunity a month ago  a deal was almost hammered out to provide about half of the    billion obama had asked for  but that fell through when republicans tried to use the spending bill to derail the unrelated iran nuclear deal  when it became clear that democrats were not going to destroy the historic multinational deal just because republicans had zika infected hostages  the republicans dropped the bill entirely   and any pretense of actually caring about the victims of zika  their new option  put forward by the house gop  offers just   million and is worse than the original in every way  partly because  as mentioned above  it won t even kick in until next year while republicans play these games  dr  tom frieden  the director of the cdc  has been emphatically insisting that time is crucial and that defunding other programs to move the money around is monumentally idiotic  you can t rob peter to pay paul  that s no way to fight an epidemic   frieden said   let down your guard in one place  stop fighting one challenge and threat to americans here to fight it better there   that s not a way to keep americans safe  which  of course  is of very little concern to republicans in congress  keeping americans safe has always taken a backseat to blocking any opportunity for obama to  win   if that means putting the lives of thousands of women and their unborn children in jeopardy  well  that s a small price to pay for not having to go back home and look a tea party voter in the eye while explaining why he or she worked with the president on anything if the zika virus could vote  it would surely support the republican party featured image via john moore getty images
