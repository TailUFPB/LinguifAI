while few who know anything at all about the realities of the world support donald trump  and while media figures don t generally offer their support to trump  they are completely complicit in the billionaire s rise  mostly because he makes them a lot of money  dan rather has been part of the media for a very long time  and what rather is seeing this time is anything but democratic  what i worry about is  in a way  the media is a political partner  a business partner of donald trump   rather said on cnn s  reliable sources  the media wants the ratings   he went on   trump delivers the ratings  in a way  they re business partners  i think there has been some media complicity in the rise of trump  it s not the only factor  but it has been a factor of providing him so much airtime  and in some cases being complicit in arranging that airtime   he said source  huffington postrather did offer a solution to the problem  and it s a pretty obvious one  but the media would have to ignore its ratings grab  the role of the journalist is to be an adversary  so i think the defense is  make an editorial judgment  make sure you offer the same to the other side   he said   i m not sure you want to have him live three times a day for an hour and a half at a time  rather is right  back in march  it was reported that trump had had   billion in free advertising disguised as news stories  they often broke away from other candidates in favor of covering trump rallies to put that amount of money in perspective  it was widely reported last week that hillary clinton had nearly  the money that trump s campaign had  but that  at   million  compared to trump s    million  is still a drop in the bucket  compared to   billion in media coverage  the amount of money clinton would need to raise to make up for that media deficit is virtually impossible featured image via larry busacca at getty images
