remember former cia director mike morell s lies about benghazi  he totally covered for hillary and the obama administration after benghazi could this be connected to the reason morell is now coming clean about targeting trump why is he admitting guilt now former acting cia director michael morell thinks that intelligence agencies were too harsh to trump during the campaign and presidential transition  according to an interview released monday morell  who left the cia in  after serving as its acting director twice  endorsed hillary clinton in an august  new york times op ed politico s susan glassner asked morell if getting involved was a mistake and the former cia official said that it wasn t  but that  there were downsides to it that i didn t think about at the time  i was concerned about what is the impact it would have on the agency  right  very concerned about that  thought that through  but i don t think i fully thought through the implications   morell said  so  let s put ourselves here in donald trump s shoes  so  what does he see  right  he sees a former director of cia and a former director of nsa  mike hayden  who i have the greatest respect for  criticizing him and his policies  right  and he could rightfully have said   huh  what s going on with these intelligence guys   right  and then he sees a former acting director and deputy director of cia criticizing him and endorsing his opponent   morell continued   and then he gets his first intelligence briefing  after becoming the republican nominee  and within  to  hours  there are leaks out of that that are critical of him and his then national security advisor  mike flynn  morell is referring to an nbc report that said flynn was repeatedly interrupting briefers during the session  and so  this stuff starts to build  right  and he must have said to himself   what is it with these intelligence guys  are they political   the current director at the time  john brennan  during the campaign occasionally would push back on things that donald trump had said   morell told politico the former cia acting director continued to reference leaked reports during the interview  then he becomes president  and he s supposed to be getting a daily brief from the moment he becomes the president elect  right  and he doesn t  and within a few days  there s leaks about how he s not taking his briefing  so  he must have thought right  that   who are these guys  are these guys out to get me  is this a political organization  can i think about them as a political organization when i become president  he concluded   so  i think there was a significant downside to those of us who became political in that moment  so  if i could have thought of that  would i have ended up in a different place  i don t know  but it s something i didn t think about
