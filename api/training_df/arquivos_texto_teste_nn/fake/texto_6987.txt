have you ever seen something so stupid that you wish you could just go back to bed on the off chance that it was a dream  that s how my day has gone so far  you know  we regularly hear from the nra that gun owners are  responsible  individuals ready to leap into action and save us from all the isises  commies  and other assorted  largely imaginary   bad guys  who are lying in wait to attack us while we re walking around a grocery store or eating at chipotle  though  of course  the food there might be seen as a reasonable threat these days   in some incredibly rare circumstances  it might be useful to have a gun  but  as usual  one of the nra s chosen has reminded us that the risks of universal gun ownership far outweigh the benefits a woman who reportedly lives in the southern united states didn t like that her kids disobey her  practically live on social media  and basically are teenagers  while most parents would take their children s electronics to teach them some respect  this unnamed woman decided a second amendment solution was in order   so she grabbed her shotgun and began shootin  stuff while someone else recorded  i hereby denounce the effects that social media have on my children   the mom shouts at the beginning of the video  her trusty boomstick ready to dish out some justice  their disobedience and their disrespect   she then takes aim at her children s iphones and fires a shot  blasting them to bits  she then instructs the man behind the camera to place the broken bits of electronics back on the tree stump because she isn t quite through with them yet up to this point  the kids have been quite disrespectful  cursing at her and even flipping their mother  the bird   in other words  she is likely right that they deserve punishment   but she continues to take things to the extreme i refuse to be cursed   she bellows   i refuse to be disobeyed  i take back my role as your parent   this shining example of much of what is wrong with america then instructs the cameraman to make sure the kids are on camera   and they can be seen standing with their arms crossed as their mother continues to go insane  one of them throws up both middle fingers because he s exactly the sort of kid someone like this would raise  she fires another shot  blowing the already destroyed cell phones to even smaller bits  anything left put it on top   she tells the cameraman who dutifully obeys  mom then announces that she refuses  to have them influenced in negative ways    like  hypothetically  if their mother were to line them up and force her children to watch her shoot their belongings while screaming like a crazy woman  she wouldn t stand for that  oh  wait to emphasize her point  she grabbed a sledgehammer and beat the fragments of the phones with it  i m done   she yelled as she dropped the hammer and walked away it s easy for some to imagine a world in which everyone is armed   but they fail to realize that people like this woman exist  who think a second amendment solution is appropriate for even the most mundane of scenarios  she was not defending her home  saving lives  hunting  or even fighting back against an oppressive government  she used her weapon in an apparently failed attempt to intimidate her children  but let s face it  everyone in this scenario is an asshole   fortunately  no one was hurt  but someone could have been  watch it below https   www youtube com watch v  image via screengrab
