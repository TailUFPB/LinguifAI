when comedian alison leiby tweeted a pretty cute  common sense joke in december  she had no idea how violent the repercussions would be  conservative extremists have been sending her threats of rape and death every since on december    leiby tweeted her   followers a fairly straightforward gag as a woman  i just hope that one day i have as many rights as a gun does   alison leiby   alisonleiby  december    describes what happened next in a piece for medium somewhere along the way an account with a large and conservative following retweeted it  an action that flooded my notifications page with people calling me  stupid  or a  moron  or  one of my personal favorites  a  retarded liberal   fine last monday evening  however  the replies went from annoying and insulting to violent and threatening  men were replying to me and taking my joke to a horrific  new place  some said they wanted to ban me from public places and silence me  others said they wanted to lock me in their closet when they re done with me  a few choice gentlemen suggested i  like their gun  have a  rough brush clean my holes  she is not exaggerating the backlash  even by the darkest depths of twitter standards  it makes truly grim reading  we won t give the losers the honor of the airtime here but you can check out the twitter conversation for yourself by clicking on the original tweet above obviously  this reaction is hyper hypocritical from people who present the case for their guns as a freedom and liberty issue  if they want the right to bear arms  doesn t leiby have the right to free speech  it s not like they have to read what she writes  they made a choice to read it  as she points out  if you don t like the taste of fish  you wouldn t go to a restaurant  order the trout  and then call the chef a stupid bitch for serving it to you  so why do people do it on the internet  misogyny is not a joke  it is not some hobby horse that  angry women  ride around to piss men off  it killed   women in the last  years  this means that more women have been killed at the hands of their husbands and boyfriends since    than americans died during    and in all terror attacks and wars since in a  study  yet to be repeated  a leading cause of death among pregnant american woman was homicide by their male partner or ex  only pregnancy related complications ranked higher this is a crisis  a crisis which leiby came at from about the least offensive  lightest way possible  yet she faced the united  violent reaction of the very same men who likely commit and defend these crimes  their intention  to stop women from raising these issues in the public space  so we need to keep raising these issues  defiantly and relentlessly  until the day they are consigned to the dustbin of history   which is the only place they belong  featured image from twitter
