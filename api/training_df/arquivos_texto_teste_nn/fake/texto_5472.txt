howard dean  who famously dropped out of the  presidential race for being too exuberant  knows a thing or two about being called crazy  he s also rarely one to mince words  so when he characterizes the gop frontrunner as a  lunatic   well  people might want to listen the  election will go down in history for a number of things  not the least of which is that republicans have nominated a narcissistic xenophobic billionaire as someone who s just like them  but  it will also go down for being a year of anger  people on both the right and the left are angry about politics as usual  for good reason  even some angry people on the left have vowed to vote for trump because they see him as an outsider  or they are nihilists who want to tear everything down before building it back up if you are a trump voter  dean has some choice words for you and they aren t exactly partisan  dean was in ohio campaigning senate candidate ted strickland  dean had some somewhat kind words about ohio s republican governor  john kasich   mostly because kasich has refused to endorse trump  i disagree with your governor on a large number of issues but one thing i do not disagree with him on is supporting a lunatic for the president of the united states is not a good idea   said dean  a former democratic national committee chairman he added that kasich  unlike republican sen  rob portman  had  guts  for not endorsing the presumptive gop nominee  kasich has told reporters he would support trump only if the businessman had an experience akin to saul s conversion on the road to damascus  portman has endorsed trump while condemning some of trump s more controversial comments like attacking a federal judge for his mexican heritage source  usa todaywhile dean didn t mention bernie sanders or bernie or busters  his next sentence seemed to be directed right at the people considering trump over clinton  look  i understand people are mad at washington  i m mad at washington  but that doesn t mean you have to elect a crazy person   dean said recent polling has shown that the vast majority of bernie supporters plan on voting for clinton  but  percent are still either on the fence  vowing to not vote at all  or pledging to vote for another candidate  including trump  this could be a close race  and that small percentage could mean the difference between a safe but not particularly revolutionary choice and a complete lunatic  i know which way sane people will be voting  so does howard dean featured image via brad barket at getty images
