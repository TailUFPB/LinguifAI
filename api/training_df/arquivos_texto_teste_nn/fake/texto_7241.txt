let nobody tell you racists don t have options this election  if you re a racist who is turned off by trump   or perhaps  fired from his campaign   you can always jump onto the cruz train and fit right in that s what former trump adviser sam nunberg discovered when he was abruptly fired from trump s campaign for the impressive feat of being too racist for trump  he didn t have to stay out in the cold for very long  now he s shilling for cruz in an exclusive with politico  nunberg completed his  degree spin on trump and now says cruz is the only choice for president  cruz is a reagan conservative  donald trump does not have a coherent political ideology   if anything  i would describe him as a chris christie republican    when did i decide that i could no longer support trump  last fall  when he did not have any idea of what the nuclear triad is in a debate  actually  he didn t  decide  when he should stop supporting trump   he was fired by trump for a series of vile facebook posts targeting president obama  african americans  and liberals with racist  violent rhetoric  in   he called civil rights leader al sharpton s daughter the n word he frequently referred to obama as a  socialist marxist islamo fascist nazi appeaser  or a  pan arabist marxist muslim   he is also   of course   a rabid birther  his comments were so noxious  that trump was forced to part ways with him and now he s team cruz and he has a completely different versions of events  hilariously  he told politico that it was trump s failure to denounce  fellow  white supremacist david duke as part of what led him to have a falling out with trump  apparently nunberg believes in firing him  trump got rid of the wrong racist in his campaign nunberg s effortless shift to cruz only reinforces what many critics have been saying all along  the  vote cruz to stop trump  movement within the republican party  endorsed by moderates like mitt romney  isn t picking the  lesser  of two evils  both candidates are shockingly bad options  and vile in their own ways  voting for either means resigning the republican party to its worst elements  racism  xenophobia  religious fanaticism and war mongering  the choice isn t between trump and cruz  it s between either and decency republicans should work on building a party that nunberg feels uncomfortable in  he shouldn t have options to choose from  he should be left out completely featured image via talking points memo
