major insurers everywhere have dumped massive cash into lobbying against the aca  their corporate owned republicans have insisted it would destroy america in any number of strange and unusual ways  now a new study reveals why they say helping sick people afford to see a doctor is bad for the country data has become available for  and  enrollees to blue cross and blue shield  who were picked up through the affordable care act s health insurance exchanges  it shows that the people who the aca was specifically created to help are actually going to the doctor and using medical services  huge shock  right  the entirety of the republican and corporate establishment s opposition to the aca resides in a single thing   money  more for them  and none for regular people  if the poor and middle class suffer and die needlessly  that s just their cost of doing business people who got back into the insurance market  thanks to the aca  were shown to have a  percent higher medical cost than those with employer based coverage in   the average monthly spending numbers for the new enrollees was   in  compared to   for group members who had it through an employer  the same new enrollee segment increased from   in  to the previously mentioned   in  the irony of the situation is that the very corporations who are whining about having to pay the bills of sick people were the primary engineers of their own self imposed disaster  these are the same corporations that spiked health insurance costs  causing people to be unable to afford it  they are also the same corporations that outright refused to sell people coverage  because of  pre existing conditions   pre existing conditions that could be literally anything they wanted them to be  after sometimes decades of unmanaged health issues  these new enrollees are consuming services at elevated rates  insurers basically screwed themselves for short term profits  and now they have to pay some of it back  pardon me if i am less than sympathetic towards them this shows just how desperately needed the aca is  and how incredibly dishonest health insurers are about their business model  the fact insurance payouts rose as much as they did in as short a time is proof just how many americans were suffering without need  that is where the darker truth of the health insurance industry comes into plain view  these companies are still wildly profitable  they just want to keep more money for themselves  simply put  they ve become a caricature of their own greedy reputations the tragedy of this all is that the same data showing how desperately needed the aca is  also is being used as misinformation to completely lie to america about how bad it is for the country  the only tidbit being presented is that it is increasing costs to insurance companies  which does mean their premiums might go up  however  the overall increase in premiums is at a slower rate than before obamacare became law  even with the increased payouts for more consumption of services right wingers and unscrupulous insurance companies are taking the very truth about why it is a good law  and perverting it into a lie about how it is bad by purposefully omitting all context until the  truth  is whatever they want it to be  if you add in the fact that initial expenditures are going to be higher until we catch up with decades of a lack of care  you can argue a case that premiums would have actually dropped if all other things were equal  due to massive amounts of new customers spreading out the cost burden as more new data becomes available  and initial over consumption tapers off  the last arguments to be made against the law will ultimately boil down to profit over people  if anything will prove how obsolete the american health insurance industry is  and why single payer is needed  that will be it featured image via joe raedle   getty
