very few of donald trump s fans are more blindly loyal to him than former house speaker newt gingrich  but trump s behavior of late has really pissed some people off  including newt gingrich  trump has denigrated the family of a fallen iraq soldier  he s kicked a mother with a crying baby out of a rally  bashed his fellow republicans  accepted a purple heart from a soldier for no other reason than to show it off  and said he thinks his own daughter should just get a new job if she s being sexually harassed at work in short  trump is imploding  taking the gop with him  and to gingrich  that is  unacceptable   in fact  he used that very word when describing what s happening  the current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable  because right now neither of them is acceptable trump is helping  to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is  he also dropped this bomb on trump s election chances  he cannot win the presidency operating the way he is now   can t be bad enough to elect him if he s determined to make this many mistakes  now  gingrich isn t saying he ll endorse or vote for hillary  but he stopped being trump s apologist for a moment  and is even one of the republicans that s working on staging an intervention for trump  they re hoping to get him to change course before the damage to their party is irreversible trump has also refused to endorse either paul ryan or john mccain in their re election races  proving yet again that he would rather pick petty fights over imagined slights than actually focus on running for president  to gingrich  he s still acting like it s primary season  and like he s still competing against  other candidates don t let trump hear him say any of this  though  gingrich so pansy assed about this that he furiously tried to backpedal on twitter  maybe he thinks that trump won t notice his comments if he pretends the media is making this up media has wildly misinterpreted my critique of a bad week for trump  trump is vastly better than hillary as president   newt gingrich   newtgingrich  august    featured image via john moore getty images
