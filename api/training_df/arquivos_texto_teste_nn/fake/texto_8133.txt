moments after learning that long time supreme court justice antonin scalia had died in his sleep  congressional republicans were already vowing that they would spend the next  days preventing obama from appointing a new justice   as is required in the constitution sen  ted cruz  who bills himself as a  constitutional scholar   boldly demanded that the country wait a year before appointing a new justice simply because he doesn t like obama justice scalia was an american hero  we owe it to him    the nation  for the senate to ensure that the next president names his replacement   ted cruz   tedcruz  february    staffer for senator mike lee  r ut  also swore he would never allow president obama to fulfill his job of appointing a new justice  in a series of shameless tweets  sent almost immediately after supreme court chief justice john roberts confirmed his  year old colleague had passed away  conn carroll said there was a  less than zero  chance that republicans would let obama pick a new nominee what is less than zero  the chances of obama successfully appointing a supreme court justice to replace scalia   conn carroll   conncarroll  february    anything this will put a full stop to all obama judicial nominees going forward   conn carroll   conncarroll  february    majority leader mitch mcconnell also endorsed the idea of preventing obama s nominee mcconnell goes there   this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president    rick klein   rickklein  february    anyone who has followed politics in recent years  the idea that republicans would openly express a desire to prevent president obama from doing his job is nothing new  however  with the supreme court  the stakes are even higher than usual  until today  the court was divided   in favor of republicans  this meant that things like citizens united and the infamous hobby lobby decision went in favor of conservative interest groups  with obama s chance to appoint a new justice  the court is poised to flip  liberals  for the first time in years  will have the majority for a bit of perspective  the longest congress ever took to confirm a nominee is  days  if republicans succeed in preventing president obama from his right to make an appointment  it will clearly be due to obstructionism and political underhandedness  already we see they are vowing to not confirm his choice   and they have absolutely no idea who it is yet  that s a level of partisanship that should shock and disgust you  regardless of what side of the aisle you re on feature image from flickr flickr
