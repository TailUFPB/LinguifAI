one of florida s most infamous gun shop owners is yet again making headlines   this time for selling targets that have the faces of president barack obama and  democratic presidential candidates bernie sanders and hillary clinton on them last year  florida gun supply owner andy hallinan raised eyebrows by banning muslims from his store  when he made this announcement via a youtube video  i have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety of all patriots in my community  and so effective immediately  i m declaring florida gun supply as a muslim free zone  i will not arm and train those who wish to do harm to my fellow patriots  this of course  got the attention of the racist murderer of  year old trayvon martin  george zimmerman  naturally  the two gun nuts joined forces to sell confederate flag paintings through hallinan s store so that zimmerman could pay his living expenses  apparently racism and hate speech works  because zimmerman was able to make    on a painting so horrible a first grader could have done better now  hallinan s latest stunt is an idea all of his own  on his website  bernietargets com   he is selling the targets with the three democrats  faces on them for     marked down from    bernietargets com hallinan has several other  classy  products for sale on the site  such as a  muslim free zone vehicle sticker   an  isis hunting permit   a  mohammed target   a  muslim free yard sign    liberal tears gun oil  and a  hillary for prison  yard sign  if this guy is a fan of presumptive republican nominee donald trump  that wouldn t be a surprise at all  hallinan clearly agrees with trump s anti muslim rhetoric  and is probably right on board with the donald s horrific proposal to ban all muslims from coming into the country   which is pretty much what hallinan tried to do on a smaller scale with his store last year this type of xenophobia  and blatant hate toward those with different religious  and political views  is so dangerous  having targets with the faces of president barack obama  who trump has repeatedly implied is muslim  and this year s democratic candidates is truly blurring the line between parody and inciting violence featured image is a screenshot
