oregon is showing republicans in congress how to get sh t done republicans in congress may be refusing to adhere to the paris climate agreement  but oregon democrats are rolling ahead with legislation that would make the state the first in the nation to rely on  percent clean energy for all of their electricity needs in fact  both the statehouse and the state senate passed the clean energy and coal transition plan despite republican cries that going full renewable energy will make energy costs skyrocket  which isn t true  as it turns out  clean energy sources are poised to become less expensive than energy generated by coal and gas  both of which are finite resources when governor kate brown signs this bill into law oregonians will get to work enacting it to get the state completely off of the coal grid by   in a statement  brown praised the legislation  saying it  equips oregon with a bold and progressive path towards the energy resource mix of the future  oregon already draws  percent of their electricity generation from hydropower  and making the state  percent clean energy means oregon will not be contributing near as big of a carbon footprint as other states in the country  according to oregon utility company pacific power  the new measure would reduce carbon pollution the equivalent of taking over six million cars off the road this is the second major liberal victory in oregon this week earlier this month  governor brown signed a minimum wage bill into law making oregon the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation even the white house praised oregon s determination to  boost the paychecks of hardworking americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet   while also urging republicans in congress to do the same for the rest of the american people so not only is oregon leading the way on making sure americans make a fair wage  they are leading the way to make sure people have an environment and a planet to enjoy in the future featured image  wikimedia
