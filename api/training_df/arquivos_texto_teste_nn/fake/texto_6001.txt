in an unprecedented and unconstitutional move  new york s governor  andrew cuomo  has issued an executive order creating a blacklist of businesses in the state that are involved in the bds movement against israel  bds stands for boycott  divest and sanction  and is a major way of protesting israel s illegal actions in palestine the order actually tells state officials to compile a list of businesses involved in the bds movement so cuomo can order the state of new york to boycott them  as baher azmy  of the center for constitutional rights  put it  this is  century mccarthyism  and it s vile speaking at the exclusive harvard club  cuomo had the gall to say  if you boycott against israel  new york will boycott you  if you divert revenues from israel  new york will divert revenues from you  if you sanction israel  new york will sanction you  citizens united pretty much gave businesses first amendment rights  and this violates those rights  cuomo is using government power to coerce   even force   businesses into supporting israel whether they want to or not  he called bds an  economic attack on israel  that must be stopped while various states have bills in their legislatures that would likewise sanction businesses involved with the bds movement  cuomo s executive order gives him immediate power to take care of these businesses with a list that will be made public once it s finished  he even said that passing legislation can often be tedious  as though that s justification enough for issuing an order like this omar barghouti  a founder of the bds movement  said this isn t surprising and explained what israel is busy doing  having lost many battles for hearts and minds at the grass roots level  israel has adopted since  a new strategy to criminalize support for b d s  from the top   he said in an email  adding that such actions were meant to  shield israel from accountability   israel will live by the sword for as long as it can  it will occupy all of the land for as long as it can  and it s afraid its time will draw to a close sooner rather than later if the u s  officially condemns their actions in palestine  as such  they re brainwashing us alphonso david  cuomo s general counsel  said that this order specifies the bds movement  but would target any boycott aimed at israel  he also said it s meant to send a message about the bds movement  mr  david said in an interview that the executive action was meant to send a clear message that  the b d s  movement is deplorable   he added that the governor s order was not meant to be interpreted as  opining on actions taken to empower palestinians   or meant to discourage debate over israeli actions in the middle east  rather  it intends to stake a position on a movement that  the state of new york unequivocally rejects   as the order puts it  the state of new york can reject whatever it wants  it can issue a statement to that effect  it should not be allowed to trample the  amendment rights of anybody for any reason  especially to protect a country guilty of heinous atrocities constitutional rights are inalienable  unless you use them to protest israel featured image by stephanie keith getty images
