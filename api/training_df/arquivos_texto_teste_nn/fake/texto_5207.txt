a father decided to record his daughter after she got her wisdom teeth removed and probably got a more interesting response than he bargained for  in a video that is making the rounds on social media  he asks the teen girl if she would vote for donald trump or hillary clinton  at the mention of trump s name  she instantly began crying  oh my god  donald trump is the redneck leader   she says quite accurately   he s going to take you away from me  why would he take me away   dad asks  because it s the redneck people that take us away from here   she replies   once again  accurately  she then begins rambling incoherently in what sounds like arabic  i need to go  oh my god  allah needs to come protect me from this   then she begins praying  oh my god  he is a redneck   the girl says  adding that  he looks like an orange  and  his parents were so ugly  he s going to kick me out  he s going to kick all of us out   the hysterical girl cries as her father reminds her she was born in the united states  in utah technically  that just means that he would force her to register in a national database  wear a special little badge informing everyone she is a muslim  and be rounded up into a concentration camp  you know  as a  temporary measure  the teen then notices her mouth is bleeding and asks   is this blood from the rednecks  while this is hilarious  the question of what donald trump will do to her family and every other muslim in the united states must be weighing on the girl s mind in some form  unfortunately  muslims will not like the answer to that watch the video below https   www youtube com watch v  image via screengrab getty images  john moore
