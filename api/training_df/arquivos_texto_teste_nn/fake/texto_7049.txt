in growing signs that rumors of a fox news split on gop frontrunner donald trump are true  bill o reilly is the latest fox news heavyweight to take a swing at the trump campaign  the o reilly factor host described the behavior of donald trump as  not presidential   and called on the campaign to  stop the nonsense  o reilly starts with trump s response to losing to ted cruz in wisconsin  which for those who missed it  was to issue an aggressive statement denouncing  lyin ted   last night after losing wisconsin  trump issued a statement calling ted cruz names  not presidential  not a smart move seems the trump campaign is confused we were hoping the candidate would appear on the factor this evening  we negotiated with his team for days  but he declined that of course  is his prerogative  apparently there is angst in the trump campaign because charles krauthammer sometimes hammers trump on the factor  so that s what has driven the trump campaign into a frenzy  like any playground battle amongst toddlers  it is all about who is hanging out with whom  o reilly is known to have pulitzer prize winning columnist charles krauthammer on his show fairly frequently  but krauthammer hates donald trump  which means the trump campaign hates charles krauthammer and everyone is now throwing sand in each other s faces and just to reassure you  if this all sounds like the sort of immature behavior that is demeaning to the office for which donald trump is running  you re right   it is  but this is the gutter into which the republican party has dragged itself in recent years  and where it may well die in its own juices in a week where greg gutfeld and megyn kelly gave powerful denunciations of donald trump and their colleagues who soft pedal interviews and debates with him  o reilly stepped up with some home truths of his own  the veteran host made it absolutely clear that his team would not be intimidated by the schoolyard bully tactics of the trump campaign  drawing a clear line in the sand  we have been very fair very fair to donald trump on this program  but that does not mean we ll not criticize him or cancel guests who have a dim view of him  o reilly goes on to demand the trump campaign  stop the nonsense  and learn to answer fair questions directly  because it will be the only way he gain the support to win  his current level of support  not nearly enough to secure him the white house  ouch  it seems the trump campaign is busy alienating every friend it ever made  by demanding an exclusivity of pro trump content  or else  donald trump was clearly watching the show  as he took to twitter immediately to refute o reilly with a one liner   totally proving o reilly s point i was not scheduled to be on the  oreillyfactor  pure fiction   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    could spell the beginning of the end for donald trump  the trust fund tycoon who has no place in the oval office featured image via screengrab
