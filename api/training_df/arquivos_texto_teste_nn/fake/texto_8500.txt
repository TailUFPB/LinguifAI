a u s  marine s letter to bernie sanders that expressed the utmost gratitude for the senator s position on not sending u s  troops to iraq has recently gone viral  and it s easy to see why the letter surfaced on tuesday morning  when reddit user charliedarwinsfather created a post titled an open letter to bernie sanders from a veteran of the iraq war  in the subreddit sandersforpresident  where many of sanders  supporters gather to share news about the democratic presidential candidate  the letter s author had been based in north carolina and had served in combat during the second battle of fallujah in iraq during    and  having lived through those battles as a young adult and seeing the short and long term effects that war had on his fellow marines  the author thanked the vermont senator with great sincerity for opposing the iraq war  and said he wished that america had more politicians like sanders who weren t afraid to fight for real peace  in his letter  the u s  marine wrote  senator sanders i want to thank you  i want to thank you for exercising sound judgement even when everyone around you was beating the war drums see i fought in the streets of fallujah  iraq  i saw more blood and death than any  year old ever should  the amount of friends i ve lost to war will likely be surpassed by the amount of friends i ve since lost to suicide i know first hand the moral cost of war  one of the most painful truths that i must go through life with is that i fought in an unjust and unfounded war  while my intentions were good and i fought hard for the men to my left and to my right  and while i thought what i was doing what was right for the people of iraq  i was wrong you knew this  you knew this before we went to war and you fought  and you spoke truth to your peers and though your words largely fell on deaf ears  i am truly heartened to know that i now have a chance to vote for a man who exercised sound and moral judgement when the war drums were beating the loudest i have a son  he is only one and a half years old but someday he will be  and i fear that if we continue to elect the same establishment politicians  he too will face the same decision that i did  and he too will go off to fight in an endless quagmire and that he too will come home  broken  and never fully returned or worse  never come home at all so thank you  senator sanders  for being of sound mind and judgement  thank you for being the only voice in this race that does not want to continue this legacy of warfare  thank you for being the only voice that is and has been standing up for those of us that fought in these misguided wars  thank you for giving me hope for a peaceful future  sincerely  a u s  marine    operation iraqi freedomthe letter has gone viral  and it s easy to see why as sanders  anti establishment approach continues to win over americans across the country  now more than ever  we re becoming more aware of the affects that war has on our veterans  and just how common homelessness  suicide and mental illnesses like ptsd are this letter is especially noteworthy because sanders recently pointed out   during monday s democratic town hall on cnn   that presidential candidate hillary clinton had supported the war while sanders rallied against sending troops to iraq because he was afraid it would create more power for extremists  which he was right about  sanders has been passionate about preserving peace for a long time   as this video of sanders giving a passionate speech in  reveals sanders  who is the former chairman and a current member of the senate veterans  affairs committee  continues to fight for america s veterans and has made it a crucial part of his campaign  this mission is spelled out right on sanders  website  sen  sanders believes that just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war  so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war  it includes caring for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one  it includes caring for the hundreds of thousands of veterans with multiple amputations or loss of eyesight  post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury  it includes veterans who are having difficulty keeping jobs in order to pay their bills  and it includes the terrible tragedy of veterans committing suicide  and regardless of whether or not you think america should go to war  it s impossible to argue with sanders when he says  while serious people can have legitimate differences about when our country should go to war  there should never be a debate whether we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who served this country in the military  as a nation  we have a moral obligation to provide the best quality care to those who have put their lives on the line to defend us  featured image via fort rucker   flickr
