veteran investigative reporter carl bernstein outed donald trump as a fascist on sunday  and if you don t believe him just google the definition of fascism and you ll see he s right during an appearance on cnn  bernstein was asked by brian stelter why he thinks trump is a neo fascist and the former washington post reporter who broke the watergate scandal wide open in the  obliged  it is a difficult term  and the word  neo  has a lot to do with it   meaning a new kind of fascist in our culture  dealing with an authoritarian demagogic point of view   bernstein began  nativist  racist  anti immigrant bigotry that he appeals to  i think we need to look to the past  and i m not talking about hitlerism and genocide  i m not drawing a direct paralel to mussolini but it is a kind of american fascism we haven t seen before  this goes beyond george wallace  who was merely a racist  this goes to authoritarianism and the desire for a strong man who doesn t trust the institutions and democracy and government  bernstein then slammed the media for not examining trump and fascism more closely during this campaign  we now need on cable news to have a debate  a historical debate on what fascism was and is and how donald trump fits in the picture  because it is something very foreign to our political cutltue in terms of the    century  that s going on in print and online but it is not part of our debate on cable  no interviewer as far as i know has asked donald trump  what is fascism  mr  trump  how are you different from the fascist message  when asked to confirm that he is calling trump a neo fascist  bernstein responded in the affirmative  pointing out that trump incites violence at his rallies and uses a methodology similar to ones used by fascist leaders of the past  which includes nativism  berstein also stressed that up to now he had never used the term to  describe a living american politician  here s the video via youtube bernstein isn t the first to point out that donald trump is acting an awful lot like a fascist the daily show with trevor noah also perfectly demonstrated how trump is a fascist fascism is  a cult of action  celebrating aggressive masculinity  fear of outsiders  intense nationalism  intolerance of criticism  and resentment of national humiliation  noah and the daily show team discovered   i m shitting myself   noah remarked   it all lines up so perfectly  doesn t it  it almost stops being funny as you re watching it  and even actor george clooney called trump a fascist during an interview with the guardian earlier this month and quite frankly  bernstein  noah  and clooney are all correct when they say donald trump is a fascist  for months  trump has viciously attacked immigrants and journalists while bragging about his masculinity and how america needs to be a bully in the world  he has also adopted anti women rhetoric and even managed to lead his supporters into pledging themselves to him with a nazi salute that looked eerily like something out of nazi germany make no mistake  trump is scary and he is only becoming more frightening as he moves closer to winning the republican nomination  we could  indeed  be watching the first fascist rise to national power in the united states  don t believe me  just click here and if you need any more proof  consider this  earlier this month  a holocaust survivor spoke up and said trump reminded him a lot of adolf hitler  if that doesn t make you believe trump is a fascist who seriously threatens our nation  nothing will  featured image via twitter
