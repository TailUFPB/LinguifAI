while many republicans are lining up behind ted cruz because they say that trump s policies are too extreme  here s some news for them  these two clowns are one in the same  the only difference is ted cruz seems to be a bit more slick and polite about his racism than the bombastic trump  jimmy kimmel proved that on his show jimmy kimmel live with an  ad  he says was created by mitt romney which urges republicans to vote for ted cruz  kimmel said  the republican establishment seems to be doing all it can do behind the scenes to topple donald trump and in front of the scenes too  mitt romney  in particular  has his magic underwear in a bunch when it comes to donald trump  he s asking voters to stop what he calls trumpism and support ted cruz  in fact mitt released this powerful ad that really tells the differences between trump and cruz in a very easy to follow way  the  ad  then goes on to show the striking similarities between the two candidates  whether it s building a wall or deporting  million immigrants  the candidates are one in the same  the candidates also agree on no gun control  ending abortion  repealing obamacare  and oppressing american muslims so  why the uproar about trump  trump is simply more vocal and bombastic about his plans for america than the creepy ted cruz  who comes off more professional but is just as dangerous watch the video here  featured image via video screenshot
