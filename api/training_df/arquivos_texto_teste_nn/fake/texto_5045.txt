john oliver had a field day mocking donald trump on sunday night for repeatedly shooting himself in the foot and it was an absolute laugh riot the hbo host of last week tonight began by talking about how hillary clinton released her tax returns and has had to answer questions about clinton foundation connections to the state department  which could have helped the republican nominee if he hadn t utterly screwed himself and his own campaign by running his mouth  she was eclipsed by the imploding star that is donald trump  the owner of what you might describe as a  resting rich face   oliver said you see  trump tried to briefly act sane by reading his speech material off of a teleprompter  which the right wing hypocritically whines about president obama doing  so he can t go off script and say stupid things  this was the  consecutive week he was going to put his campaign back on track   oliver quipped but no sooner had trump started doing that when he started calling for  second amendment people  to do something about hillary  claimed the the election is rigged  and declared that president obama literally  founded isis  wow   oliver remarked   now clearly what he just said is absolutely absurd  but even when people try to help him reframe it  he doubled down  indeed  during an interview with right wing radio host hugh hewitt he doubled down on his accusation despite being given an opportunity to walk his statements back  only to then claim that he was merely being  sarcastic  when he repeatedly called the sitting president of the united states the leader of a terrorist organization  he s so insistent   oliver continued   he s like the guy drowning but waving off a lifeboat saying   get out of here  i m very buoyant  i m the most buoyant  everybody talks about my buoyancy  i m a tremendous floater   and yes   sarcasm  is a bullshit excuse  it s the douchebag s apology  after incredulously noting that trump walked back his  bullshit excuse   oliver then took on trump s dangerous charge that hillary will only win the election because it is  rigged  what is really worth taking note of there  and is worth thinking about  is that he s suggesting the election may be stolen by his opponent  and that s actually dangerous  he is priming his supporters to question the result when he loses pennsylvania  as polls indicate he will  and as all republican presidential candidates have since   in fact  trump actually urged police officers who support him to patrol polling places to make sure voters don t vote multiple times  in short  trump supporters are primed to intimidate minority voters on election day  because as we all know  conservatives believe minority voters cheat the system  but oliver pointed out how americans will know if trump somehow wins the election  in a way  we are all trump election day observers  because if you look out of your window in november and see the four horsemen of the apocalypse you ll know  oh shit  they just called florida  oliver then explained that his team signed up as an  election observer  on trump s website to see what would happen and they got an email declaring that  we are going to do everything we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked hillary from rigging this election   and that prompted oliver to question if trump knows what is legal and what is not since his own lawyer once claimed that spousal rape isn t real  plus  again  trump suggested that gun nuts assassinate hillary clinton here s the video via vidme donald trump is a con man who is trying to become the most powerful person on the face of the planet  he is so good at lying to his supporters that he has even told them to their faces that he is lying to them and they were too dumb to notice featured image via screenshot
