president obama carried out his annual youtube interview on friday and revealed what he carried around with him each and every day inside his pockets  while normally what s in a person s pockets might be self explanatory  i e    phone  wallet  etc   the president is no ordinary person  and the items he carries around aren t ordinary  either  there s also an in depth explanation for each one of them here s obama in his own words  i stick these in my pocket to remind me of all the people i ve met along the way and the stories they ve told me  so  this is what i had in my pocket today  this is rosary beads pope francis gave me that obviously means alot to me cause i so admire him and it makes me think about peace and promoting understanding and ethical behavior  this is a little buddha that a buddhist monk gave me  this is a lucky poker chip that s metal that this biker gave me  this is a hindu statuette of the monkey god hanuman that a woman gave me  and  i ve got a coptic cross  this is from ethipia  so  i ve got a whole bunch of this stuff but the reason i showed you these is because i carry them around all the time  president obama says he s  not superstitious  and reiterated that the real reason he carries them around is because he likes to be reminded of the people who gave him the distinct privilege of being president of the united states even though president obama clearly carries around both a cross and rosary beads from the none other than the pope himself  the only thing religious extremists can focus on is the hindu monkey god and little buddha  why is that  they somehow think this is evidence that he really is the antichrist  after all pic via twitter pic via twitter now compare this to what george bush is known to have had in his pockets  in november   at a roundtable with latin american reporters  bush was asked what he carried around with him  here is how he responded  according to the associated press  the president stood up  fished in his pockets  then dramatically pulled his hands out holding nothing but a white handkerchief that he waved playfully in the air  he said   es todo  that s it  no dinero  no money  no mas  nothing else  no wallet   the joker that he was  he was also asked if he brought a watch  to which he replied  si  timex  but i m not supposed to be endorsing products  it s amazing how what s in a president s pockets can reveal what kind of commander in chief they are  clearly  obama has put a lot of thought into this  while bush hadn t featured image via screen capture
