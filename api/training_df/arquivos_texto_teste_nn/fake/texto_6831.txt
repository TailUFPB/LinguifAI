recently  liberal firebrands like george clooney and his wife  amal alamuddin  have come under heavy fire from the left for their    per couple fundraising dinner to benefit the candidacy of hillary clinton for president some people were so incensed they literally threw dollar bills at clinton but here s the kicker  the majority of the money raised at the clooney clinton dinners aren t going to clinton   they re going to down ticket candidates to take back the house and the senate while appearing on meet the press  clooney  who brushed off the notion that he is a  corporate shill  as  one of the funnier things you could say about me  told host chuck todd it s  going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back congress  and the reason that s important  is    we need to take the senate back because we need to confirm the supreme court justice  because that fifth vote on the supreme court can overturn citizens united and get this obscene  ridiculous amount of money out so i never have to do a fundraiser again  and that s why i m doing it politifact rated that as  mostly true   here s how it goes so only    out of    will go directly to clinton  that s approximately   percent   less than one percent while leftists threw dollar bills at clinton  democrats across the country were getting the support they so need to take back two chambers  possibly three with the supreme court  thanks to george clooney featured image via justin sullivan getty images
