there has been a lot of tension lately regarding supposedly  liberal  hollywood s overt racism  many influential actors of color have chosen to boycott the biggest hollywood awards show of the year for those gracing the silver screen  but one person was obligated to be there because he was hosting   comedian chris rock  however  that did not stop him from making his feelings known on the matter he said that white liberals   especially in hollywood   could be what he called  sorority racist   they aren t overtly hateful  but they still practice racism without even realizing it  he used the equivalent of rushing greek organizations on college campuses as a comparison  saying in that epically funny way that only chris rock can  we like you ronda  but you re not a kappa  rock also went on to make fun of the supposed efforts of the academy to make sure there was more diversity in the coming years  in both voters and nominees  then  the most awkward moment ever happened  when rock introduced none other than clueless actress turned fox news talking head stacey dash as the new director of the academy s  minority outreach program  and the winner for least funny  oscars bit goes to  foxnews   realstaceydash  https   t co  pic twitter com   matt wilstein   themattwilstein  february     if you recall  dash is internalized racism personified  she has said that channels like bet should be done away with  and has complained about the oscars boycott  those examples are just the tip of the iceberg  because she is clearly the last person black america needs representing us in hollywood or anywhere else  then again  knowing chris rock  this was completely on purpose the thing is  chris rock is right  this  sorority racist  stuff is what minorities all over the place go through daily in this white supremacist society no  we are not a post racial america  not by a long shot  not even in  liberal  hollywood well done  mr  rock  for saying what needed to be said featured image via video screen capture
