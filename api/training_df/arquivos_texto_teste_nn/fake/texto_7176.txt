university of virginia professor and political scientist larry sabato has just released his map predicting the electoral vote outcome of the  election  and it forecasts a blowout win for the democratic party based on the likely nominees being hillary clinton and donald trump  sabato currently forecasts a   electoral college victory for clinton  candidates need a majority of the  electoral votes in the united states to win  currently that number is  sabato notes  election analysts prefer close elections  but there was nothing we could do to make this one close  the predicted map looks very similar to  s electoral map  but with north carolina flipping from republican to democrat  in   mitt romney won north carolina  but just by    sabato also predicts a close race in other states that were previously republican territory  arizona  missouri  indiana  and georgia  notably  president obama won indiana in   and the large black population in georgia has had many thinking it could soon become a swing state addressing the storyline that has surfaced in the media  that trump could appeal to blue collar voters in some states and flip democratic votes  sabato throws cold water on the idea trump supporters and some independent analysts assert that his appeal to many blue collar whites in rust belt states  such as michigan  ohio  pennsylvania  and wisconsin  could pull these states  electoral votes into the republican column  the problem is  there is little evidence that the non college voters supporting trump in the primaries are defectors from the democrats  most have been backing gop candidates fairly consistently  so the net addition for trump could be small sabato is no random crank or egghead  his  crystal ball  forecasts are highly cited and in the past he accurately predicted the results of the           and  elections within a few electoral votes or senate house races in  on msnbc  anchor lester holt told sabato  he  predicted democrats would pick up the six seats needed to take over the senate   it appears they have done just that   you ve got an impressive record and i m going to call you later  we re going to go over stock picks  so when he predicts a big electoral college win for the democratic party  republicans should be very worried featured image via public domain
