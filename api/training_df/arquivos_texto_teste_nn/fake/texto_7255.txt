on sunday  on cnn s state of the union  trump campaign spokesman stephen miller got into a bizarre argument with the show s host jake tapper tapper questioned whether trump s recent attack on ted cruz s wife was befitting of a person running for president  in an apparent attempt to bring the gop primary election to its rock bottom  trump recently took to twitter where he retweeted a photo that attacked cruz s wife  the image showed two photos  one of cruz s wife and one of trump s wife  the image had a weird threat written on it  which said   no need to spill the beans  the images are worth a thousand words  miller defended the retweet earlier in the week during an earlier interview on cnn he wanted to evade the question at all costs  so he decided to try and steer the conversation towards immigration tapper wasn t having it  he pressed the issue  and that s when miller got a little erratic  miller said  we get wrong what we re mad about in america  we don t get mad when americans are murdered by illegal immigrants  we don t get mad when people have their jobs taken by cheaper foreign workers here on visa programs  we don t get mad when entire cities are crushed by our trade policies that send jobs overseas  tapper wasn t going to let miller off the hook that easy  he continued to press miller  stating that he doesn t want to know why miller was being so evasive  you want to get into an argument  then we ll get into an argument   miller exclaimed   he just accused me of standing up for sexism  and that is absolutely inappropriate  miller continued  saying  i said in that interview that it is a trivial issue to be debating retweets when it is a fact you have americans dying every single day as a result of immigration policies  americans all over this country see their communities destroyed by uncontrolled migration  the irony of the interview is that miller is using evasion tactics that cruz is famous for  when pressed on social issues  cruz often jumps to a completely different topic  this was best exemplified when reporters asked cruz about his stance on lgbt issues  particularly his lack of support for gay marriage  cruz  then inexplicably went into a rant about the dangers of the islamic state you can watch the segment below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
