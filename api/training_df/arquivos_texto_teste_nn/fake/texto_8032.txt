during a press conference in south carolina on wednesday  ted cruz proved that as things heat up in the republican primary election  the republican candidates  crazy is being brought to a boiling point south carolina is the republicans  firewall state against anti establishment candidates  it s the state where candidates such as donald trump are supposed to burn out  after trump s win in new hampshire  all the candidates are fighting like mad to secure a win in the first southern primary so  enter ted cruz at a press conference where he has to be seen as both more moderate than trump and also win over his supporters  that s why during the press conference he is forced to posture  saying things like daring trump to sue him the real hilarity comes  though  when ted cruz does his best to try and lampoon his not trump rival  marco rubio  during the press conference  cruz answers questions from reporters  cruz both brings up and attempts to dismiss things that he has come under fire for  the whole thing amounts to very long  nearly schizophrenic  rant  whoever told ted cruz to do this  needs to be fired  i don t think that this press conference did anything except possibly make rubio look much more practical in the eyes of moderate conservatives cruz spent a lot of time denying what he calls lies being put forth by trump and rubio  specifically  most of those lies that revolve around allegations that cruz using push polls in south carolina  the washington post first reported on the push polls that have been very supportive in their calls to voters throughout the state  they appear to be being conducted by remington research  a research firm hired by the cruz campaign cruz claims that anyone could be conducting the polls  which is ludicrous  especially in light of the fact that cruz seems to now be trying to paint this as a conspiracy being orchestrated by some combination of trump  rubio  and well  anyone cruz can point his finger at you can watch the press conference below featured image from video screenshot
