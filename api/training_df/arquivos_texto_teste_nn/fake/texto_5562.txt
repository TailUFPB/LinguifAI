professional clinton witch hunter trey gowdy probably expected the public grilling of fbi director james comey to go a lot better than it did  on thursday  unsatisfied with the lack of prosecution of a certain person whose name rhymes with  schmillary schminton  republicans decided to investigate the investigators  for hours  comey maintained a superhuman level of cool as he answered every ridiculous question gowdy and pals threw at him as they struggled to find something   anything   they could use to rake the former secretary of state over the coals while discussing intent to commit a crime  gowdy explained to comey that the fbi director was a  white collar prosecutor  while he was a  gutter prosecutor    something that appears to be a dog whistle term for  black people    and that the people gowdy prosecuted were too stupid to know that murder is wrong gowdy told comey that he is  reading a specific intent element into a gross negligence statute  regarding clinton s supposed willful lawbreaking   and that s when comey dropped the hammer  the question you gotta ask is why is it that the department of justice since  has not used that gross negligence statute but charging it once in an espionage case  whether their decision was smart or not  that is the record of fairness  so you have to decide  so i treat this person against that record  and if i do is that a fair thing to do  even if you re not worried about the constitutionality of it  my judgment is no reasonable prosecutor would do that  that would be celebrity hunting picture if you will comey picking up his microphone  flattening his palm  and dropping it on the floor  that s basically what happened  the look on gowdy s face was priceless  silence filled the room and gowdy was left with nothing but his dumbfounded expression watch it below  it will make your day featured image via screengrab
