during a wednesday rally at the university of iowa in iowa city  a protester hurled tomatoes at donald trump after the republican presidential frontrunner referred to bernie sanders as a  communist  in a news release  officials said andrew joseph alemao    was observed throwing two tomatoes at trump  the real estate mogul and front runner for the republican presidential nomination alemao has been charged with disorderly conduct  a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to   or  days in prison  he is currently being held in the johnson county jail he was taken into custody by the secret service and the uipd after throwing the tomatoes  the release said at least three sanders supporters were apparently escorted by security out of the rally  with trump shouting   get  em outta here   to the cheers of his fans in the crowd not one of the tomatoes actually hit trump but it shouldn t matter frankly  regardless of how vile  obnoxious and ultimately dangerous trump might be  there s simply no excuse for anyone to engage in physical violence against him  or any public figures for that matter  it s childish  unacceptable behavior   especially for liberals who ought to know better  if activists are incapable of making an argument using words  evidence and reason  they should figure out how it s done  rather than embarrassing the rest of us  especially other bernie supporters  by lashing out like an infant who refuses to eat and hurls his food at the wall in protest the same goes for pie attacks against william kristol and ann coulter  or red paint attacks against condoleezza rice  in fact  at the time  i wrote something similar when a protester attacked george w  bush by throwing shoes at the former president  feel free to applaud these kinds of attacks   i m sure it s cathartic   but know that by encouraging such atrociously violent  kneejerk behavior  you re only encouraging more of it and  so  don t be surprised when conservative activists retaliate with the same thing against liberal leaders and celebrities  not unlike how a pissed off wingnut attacked hillary clinton back in   put another way  it s probably not difficult for trump supporters to worm their way into democratic rallies just to be clear  it s entirely possible that the tomato tosser wasn t a bernie supporter at all  featured image via video screen grab
