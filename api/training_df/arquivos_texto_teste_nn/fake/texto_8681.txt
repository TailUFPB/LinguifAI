the film industry wants us to believe that it is liberal  that there is no racism  however  nothing could be further from the truth  and the fact that for the second year in a row all of the oscar nominated actors are white  yes  you read that right  even with iconic films such as selma out there  the academy didn t see fit to nominate any actors of color well  this obvious bias didn t go unnoticed by powerful and successful actors of color  most notably spike lee  to that end  on the annual celebration of the martin luther king  jr holiday  the celebrated actor took to instagram to tell the world that he would not be attending this year s oscars  and why  using the hashtag  oscarssowhite  lee said  in part  after acknowledging and thanking cheryl boone issacs  president of the academy  for giving him an honorary oscar this past november but  how is it possible for the  consecutive year all  contenders under the actor category are white  and let s not even get into the other branches   white actors in  years and no flava at all  we can t act   wtf   it s no coincidence i m writing this as we celebrate the  anniversary of dr  martin luther king jr s birthday  dr  king said  there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe  nor politic  nor popular but he must take it because conscience tells him it s right  here is the post  in full  oscarssowhite  again  i would like to thank president cheryl boone isaacs and the board of governors of the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences for awarding me an honorary oscar this past november  i am most appreciative  however my wife  mrs  tonya lewis lee and i will not be attending the oscar ceremony this coming february  we cannot support it and mean no disrespect to my friends  host chris rock and producer reggie hudlin  president isaacs and the academy  but  how is it possible for the  consecutive year all  contenders under the actor category are white  and let s not even get into the other branches   white actors in  years and no flava at all  we can t act   wtf   it s no coincidence i m writing this as we celebrate the  anniversary of dr  martin luther king jr s birthday  dr  king said  there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe  nor politic  nor popular but he must take it because conscience tells him it s right   for too many years when the oscars nominations are revealed  my office phone rings off the hook with the media asking me my opinion about the lack of african americans and this year was no different  for once   maybe  i would like the media to ask all the white nominees and studio heads how they feel about another all white ballot  if someone has addressed this and i missed it then i stand mistaken  as i see it  the academy awards is not where the  real  battle is  it s in the executive office of the hollywood studios and tv and cable networks  this is where the gate keepers decide what gets made and what gets jettisoned to  turnaround  or scrap heap  this is what s important  the gate keepers  those with  the green light  vote  as the great actor leslie odom jr  sings and dances in the game changing broadway musical hamilton   i wanna be in the room where it happens   people  the truth is we ain t in those rooms and until minorities are  the oscar nominees will remain lilly white   cont d a photo posted by spike lee   officialspikelee  on jan    at   pstspike lee is right  and he isn t the only actor who is upset about these gross and racially motivated injustices when it comes to recognition for achievements  lee is just the latest person of color who also happens to be a member of the hollywood elite to criticize the all white oscar ballots  jada pinkett smith has made similar comments  she said of the entire situation  the academy has the right to acknowledge whomever they choose  to invite whomever they choose  and now i think that it s our responsibility to make the change  maybe it is time that we pull back our resources and we put them back into our communities  into our programs  and we make programs for ourselves that acknowledge us in ways that we see fit  that are just as good as the so called mainstream ones  begging for acknowledgement or even asking for it diminishes dignity  diminishes power  and we are a dignified people and we are powerful  and let s not forget it  in addition  pinkett smith made her views on the matter known on facebook via a powerful video  also uploaded just in time for mlk day  just like spike lee s instagram post            if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt we must stand in our power we must stand in our power posted by jada pinkett smith on monday  january    they are both right  we have to realize that we are the ones who are going to have to create change  it won t be white america  and it sure as hell won t be hollywood  it will be black americans with voices  especially those in positions of power and influence  who will stand up and say what needs to be said  and do what needs to be done  if it takes boycotting what is arguably the biggest film industry event of the year  then so be it thank you  spike lee and jada pinkett smith for telling it like it is featured image via screen capture from twitter
