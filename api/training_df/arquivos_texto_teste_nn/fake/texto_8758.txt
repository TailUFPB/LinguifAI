on january     michigan governor rick snyder held a press conference to announce the  discovery  of an outbreak of legionnaire s disease in the city of flint according to officials in the snyder administration  there have been  confirmed cases of the disease  ten people have died as a result legionnaire s disease is caused by a deadly waterborne bacteria  called legionella unlike lead poisoning  the other major water related health crisis now facing the people of flint  legionnaire s disease is not caused by drinking contaminated water  instead  the bacteria enters the body through the lungs  via water droplets in the air on wednesday snyder officials claimed that they can neither confirm or deny that the outbreak is linked to the city s contaminated water supply as the atlantic reports here  the outbreak began shortly after the snyder administration switched the city of flint s water supply to the flint river according to the us center for disease control  cdc  an outbreak of legionnaire s disease occurs when two or more people are infected with the bacteria in flint  almost ninety people are known to have been infected by the disease between june  and november  what s infuriating about the legionnaire s outbreak in flint is that officials in the snyder administration certainly knew about it long before wednesday s press conference  yet they said nothing until now as reported here  between june  to march   the number of confirmed cases of legionnaire s disease in flint skyrocketed during the previous five years the city saw a fairly steady number of cases of the disease  which averaged about eight to ten cases during a ten month reporting period but by march of   the number of confirmed cases had spiked to  the prior average  between june  and march   there were  confirmed cases of the disease  seven people died from legionnaire s disease during that ten month period yet after seeing this sudden increase  officials in the snyder administration took no action  there was no effort made to identify a possible source  although the center for disease control provides specific guidelines for doing so  the public was also not notified that there was an outbreak  although the state health department knew  or should have known  at least by march of last year  if not sooner between march of  and november of   another  cases of legionnaire s disease were confirmed in flint  three more people died after being exposed to the waterborne bacteria still there was no mention of an outbreak until january    snyder s press conference on wednesday was the first time any official made mention of a legionnaire s outbreak in the city  although at least ten deaths have been caused by the disease state officials virtually ignored this deadly outbreak for almost a year  then all of the sudden  on wednesday  governor snyder called a press conference to inform the public that there is an outbreak of legionnaire s disease in the city the question of how state officials could have just now discovered something that has been going on for this long may not be difficult to answer last week the federal government announced a justice department probe into the flint water crisis  the announcement followed an investigation by the aclu  which revealed that state officials had falsified documents and rigged tests to cover up the fact that the city s water is contaminated with lead over  children are confirmed to have lead poisoning because of the actions of snyder and his appointed representatives  an additional   children are likely to be impacted  the number of adults who are affected is currently unknown  but likely stretches into the thousands a justice department investigation into the flint water crisis would undoubtedly reveal that the snyder administration concealed information on the legionnaire s outbreak from the public what else has rick snyder s administration been hiding and lying about  we may never know just as the snyder administration was coming under intense scrutiny over the city s toxic water  someone allegedly broke into flint city hall  as addicting info reported here  the break in conveniently targeted the vacant office where flint s water records are stored according to the cdc  a state health agency is responsible to conduct an investigation into the source of an legionnaire s outbreak  such an investigation is advised by the cdc any time there is an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease or an increase in the severity of cases  such as when the disease causes hospitalizations and deaths  outbreaks of legionnaire s disease  such the one happening in flint  would require an immediate investigation to determine the source as well as an urgent response from the state health department because of the timing and severity of the outbreak  which directly coincided with the switch of the water source  public health officials should have started an investigation into the source of the bacteria months ago  instead they did nothing state officials say they haven t made a  direct connection  between the city s contaminated water and the outbreak of the disease  that s more than likely because they never tried to identify the source of the outbreak  they just ignored it watch this video  recorded by  in january of last year  which shows the quality of the city s water   we know that the water in flint is contaminated with lead  a substance that causes a wide range of physical and mental disabilities  especially in children  we also know that the citizens of flint were repeatedly told by the governor and members of his administration that the water was perfectly safe to drink what s most frightening about the possibility that the city s water is the cause of the outbreak of legionnaire s disease is that people do not have to drink it to be exposed to the bacteria  this bacteria is associated with inhaling water particles  meaning that people can become deathly sick from simply bathing  showering  washing their hands or performing other tasks that most of us take for granted handing out bottled drinking water and lead filters isn t going to cut it i cannot think of a single reason why the people of flint would trust anything that governor snyder or members of his administration tell them about the water  they have been told lie after lie by this administration  ever since the city s water source was switched to the flint river what we can already say about the legionnaire s outbreak is that state officials were aware of it months ago  yet they took no steps to protect public health  ten people are dead snyder says he s not sure if the city s water is responsible for those deaths  that acknowledgment alone is enough to cause public outrage  it is his job to know  it was his job to know back in march  when there were already seven deaths attributed to this disease  but he didn t give a shit back in march  you know why  because the federal government was not investigating flint s water crisis back in march snyder and every member of his administration has got to go  every shred of trust the public may have had in this administration is gone  it will never be back  no amount of pr from the governor s office is ever going to repair this these are life and death issues for flint residents  they need answers that they can trust  and they deserve to have representation that they can trust as they try to navigate their way through this incalculable nightmare it was bad when they couldn t drink the water  now there s a new threat looming over their heads  and that threat comes from the possibility that any contact with the water whatsoever could cause them to become deathly ill these citizens cannot be expected to look to the same people who caused this disaster for answers now  they cannot be asked to trust the same administration that has lied to them over and over in the past  to tell them the truth now snyder and his administration are now saying they aren t sure if the city s water killed ten people  they don t exactly know if the water is safe to shower in  bathe in  wash your hands in  that s what they re saying now  when last week they said they were sure the water was safe for all of those things at least a dozen petitions to recall governor rick snyder have been filed in recent days  the michigan board of state canvassers continues to throw the recall snyder petitions out oddly enough the right wing majority board had no problem approving two tea party backed recall petitions targeting state legislatures who voted in favor of a tax increase to help repair the state s dangerously neglected roads to the citizens of michigan i would ask  how many people have to get sick  and how many children have to be poisoned  and how many deaths have to be counted  before partisan political bullshit takes a backseat to the health and safety of your fellow citizens you need to get this man  and every member of his blatantly corrupt administration out of office  featured image credit  video screen capture  com
