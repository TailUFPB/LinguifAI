chris christie s campaign has signaled that the new jersey governor has finally read the writing on the wall and will announce the end of presidential campaign soon  it s surely a victory for america  although probably disappointing for new jersey residents  to see christie return from whence he came  but amid the celebrations let s remember  there were some good times too like when christie single handedly destroyed marco rubio s chances of ever being president it will go down in history as one of  s defining political moments  live and on the debate stage  a combative christie managed to utterly embarrass the ill prepared  shallow marco rubio in a matter of seconds  in an election that has been far too consumed with cheap talking points and heavily rehearsed performance art  we got to see  in that instant  the moment two candidates stopped being polite and started being real rubio crumpled   and it was painful to watch it s hard to know what rubio was thinking after getting so completely shut down   in fairness  it s hard to think above the noise of whirring of gears and cpu cooling fans   but afterwards the effect was clear  the candidate most journalists had already ordained as the presumptive republican nominee was dead in the water  rubio s campaign limps on  but in the way a ghost might if his end was so sudden he never realized he died at all the washington post s dana milbank puts it better tuesday night  rubio proved true the axiom popularized by alan simpson  the wisecracking former senator from wyoming   one day you re the toast of the town  the next you re toast  now  to be clear  let s not give christie too much credit for his kamikaze finish  the infamous blowhard was   and remains   a complete asshole  his quest to take down his opponents doesn t stem from some higher moral principles   he just likes being a bully  returning to new jersey  he will go on being a bully  that s christie s whole shtick  in this light  christie s rubio takedown was a joker like desire just to see the world burn  he takes down rubio because he can  not because he wants to but regardless of motives  christie was a refreshing change of pace  trump also insults his fellow candidates  but his diminished intellect and massive ego mean that they are typically low blows  potshots and vulgarity  christie  having practiced the artform numerous times against teachers and nurses  is capable of bullying on the next level now christie returns to new jersey  a place where most residents despise him and most attorneys have grown fat off his nearly endless stream of self induced scandals  at one time he was considered a republican frontrunner  it never panned out  instead  he ll have to be content with the idea that while there will never be a chris christie white house  there won t be a marco rubio one either thanks to him we all have our parts to play  maybe this one is christie s feature image from screengrab
