a customer at a new orleans family dollar store was forced to endure a bigoted  anti lgbt rant by a cashier on friday  turning what should have been an ordinary shopping trip into a nightmare melissa langford was simply minding her own business when she heard the cashier making a not so subtle announcement that she hated gay people  langford recalled the experience on facebook  it started off with the cashier loudly voicing her opinion on how much she hates gay people  after five or six minutes  or at least it felt like that long  of listening to her yell and preach to each customer about how  gay people need to get  the fuck   they got somethin wrong in they head   edit  that she had the right to refuse service to anyone she wants  gays are sick  etc  hearing this level of bigotry and hate broke langford s heart  and she quickly became emotional and decided to speak up  i started to writhe away internally  i wanted to cry right then and there  in fact  i m crying right now  cuz yall didn t hear the hateful passion in her voice  she was so loud  so cruel  so uneducated  selfish and just outright mean  anyways  i spoke up i said   excuse me  but im very very gay and you re really offending me  think what u want but keep it to yourself  and then  the cashier  flipped out   while carrying on her homophobic rant  the woman behind the counter refused to serve langford  and even denied service to the customer in front of her because they were both defending the rights of the lgbt community  at this point  langford began recording the encounter with her cell phone  langford said that when she started filming  the cashier calmed down slightly  as far as leaving the counter and goin by the exit just to not serve my gay ass  in the video  you can see the chaos unfold as langford and the other customer argue with the cashier  you can hear the man in front of langford shouting  you ignorant  why are you going to hate on people for who they are  and they re spending their money here just like everybody else   as the cashier continues to refuse service and rail against gay people here s what langford was able to record the encounter devastated langford  she said  im really upset  this is the worst antigay s t ive ever had to deal with in my  years  in the interview below  langford shares her feelings on the awful incident  featured image is a screenshot now langford wants an apology  but she hasn t gotten it yet  she had contacted family dollar headquarters  but hasn t gotten a response  according to nola com  a manager at the store refused to do something about the cashier s behavior and said  i can t control nothing   can say and do what she wants  hopefully now that langford s video and post has been shared thousands of times  the store will be forced to do something about this cashier s horrendous behavior  featured image via screenshots
