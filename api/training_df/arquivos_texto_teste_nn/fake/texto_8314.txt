if you didn t think republicans could stoop any lower  think again because if they have their way  there will be a state law in washington that will guarantee that even our private body parts no longer remain private in their effort to persecute transgender people  washington state republicans have chosen to push legislation that would force everyone to show their genitalia before they are allowed to use a bathroom according to pink news senate bill  would amend equality legislation to state   nothing in this chapter grants any right to a person to access a private facility segregated by gender  such as a bathroom  restroom  toilet  shower  locker room  or sauna  of a public or private entity if the person is preoperative  nonoperative  or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated  and because the bill solely relies  on the presence of genitalia  to determine who can use which bathroom  it means girls and boys would have to show their vaginas and penises to whatever stranger is guarding the bathroom in order to be let in imagine going to a library  a theme park  a theater  a business  or even school and having to stand in line for the bathroom with the horrifying thought that some strange person is going to have to examine you below the belt to determine which bathroom you can use  it s sounds pretty damn embarrassing  not to mention cruel but this is the strategy republicans have come up with to discriminate against transgender people the same kind of perverted legislation has already been proposed in virginiathat bill was strongly blasted by civil rights advocate tim peacock  this is what the conservative movement has devolved into  forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never before seen act of violence or sexual aggression  that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections   human rights campaign spokesperson sarah warbelow called the washington bill urged people to demand that the bill be killed  we urge all fair minded people across the state to demand their lawmakers immediately stop these offensive assaults on fairness and equality  and we call on the senate to vote down these dangerous measures if they come to a vote on the floor  republicans might as well announce to pedophiles everywhere that this is their chance to legally examine the private parts of children  because that s what this bill basically does  an adult would be required to look at the private parts of children to determine which bathroom they can use so that a transgender child doesn t use what conservatives claim is the wrong bathroom it s not hard to see that if this bill passes the lawsuits are going to pile up and clog our judicial system even more than it already is  it s also not hard to see that this is a conservative dream come true  and it s a sick dream at that featured image  pixabay
