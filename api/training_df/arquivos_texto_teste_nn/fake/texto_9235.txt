when candidate trump promised he would put america first  he wasn t kidding  president trump posted a powerful video on twitter tonight  blasting democrats for putting their desire to give illegal aliens amnesty before the safety and security of american citizens  as they demand amnesty as a condition for funding the government here is the transcript of president trump s powerful speech that he posted on twitter only minutes ago  help me  dad   those were the last words spoken by kate steinle  as she lay dying on a san francisco pier  a precious young american woman  killed in the prime of her life  kate s death is a tragedy that was entirely preventable  she was shot by an illegal alien  and a  time convicted felon  who had been deported  times  but he was free to harm an innocent american  because our leaders refuse to protect our border  and because san francisco is a sanctuary city in sanctuary states and cities  innocent americans are at the mercy of criminal aliens because state and local officials defy federal authority and obstruct the enforcement of our immigration laws  last week  in a final injustice  kate s killer was acquitted of all of most serious charges  yet one more reason why americans are so upset by sanctuary cities and open border politicians who shield criminal aliens from federal law enforcement and all of the problems involved with the whole concept of a sanctuary city  they re no good we mourn for all of the american families of all backgrounds  who will have any empty seat at christmas this year because our immigration laws were not enforced  no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country  our cities should be sanctuaries for americans  not for criminal illegals   unfortunately  democrats in congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration  and crack down on sanctuary cities   now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the government  holding troop funding hostage  and putting our national security at risk  we cannot allow it  every senator and congressman will have to make a choice  do they want to protect american citizens  or do they want to protect criminal aliens  reasonable people can disagree on many things  but there can be no disagreement that the first duty of government is to serve  protect and defend american citizens  people can have different views on the technical details of budget policy or transportation  but no one who serves in office should disagree that our highest priority must be the safety and well being of our nation s citizens  thank you  watch no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country  our cities should be sanctuaries for americans   not for criminal aliens  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december
