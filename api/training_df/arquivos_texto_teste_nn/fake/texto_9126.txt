the la times is reporting that moviegoing is at the lowest level since   the article blames americans who are going to see fewer movies  on streaming services  which  to some extent  could be true  but from the majority of the comments we ve seen on our facebook page  which reaches almost   million followers  americans are no longer interested in paying their hard earned money to support the anti american and anti trump hate machine that is hollywood  while there are a few openly conservative actors in hollywood  the majority of them are swimming in a cesspool of liberalism and are consumed with hate for president trump and his deplorable supporters   from george clooney trashing trump over his stance on refugees coming to america from muslim hotbed nations  to meryl streep using a televised award ceremony to trash our newly inaugurated president  to has been pop stars like madonna saying she d like to blow up the white house  america has had it up to their eyeballs with people who are some of america s top earners  thanks to the support of people they openly mock for supporting president trump   the la times reports  that hollywood is celebrating the end of  with astronomical sales from  star wars  the last jedi   which is on track to soon exceed   billion in global ticket sales and eventually become the biggest movie of the year  but that won t be enough to write a happy storyline for the industry although movie ticket sales in the u s  and canada are expected to dip just below last year s record of    billion  the number of tickets sold is projected to drop   to   billion   the lowest level since   according to preliminary estimates from studio executives the falloff in ticket sales can mostly be explained by a handful of movies that flopped  especially during the dreary summer season that posted the worst results in more than two decades  even such massive hits as  wonder woman    thor  ragnarok  and  it  couldn t make up for a lackluster summer lineup populated by rickety franchises   alien  covenant   and poorly reviewed retreads   the mummy   however  the long term decline in attendance reflects systemic challenges facing the industry  audiences are spending less time going to the movies and are consuming more entertainment on small screens and through streaming services such as netflix and amazon that are spending billions on original video content sorry to burst your liberal bubble  but now that the curtain has been pulled back  the deplorable crowd isn t interested in supporting hate filled  liberal hollywood  deal with it
