remember when republican front runner donald trump made a huge fuss in january about skipping a gop debate in iowa and holding a fundraiser for veterans instead  well  some people are scratching their heads and asking where all those donations really went just days after his fundraiser  trump was bragging about how much money he was able to raise  at a campaign rally in iowa  trump boasted   one hour  six million dollars   according to the business mogul  there were over  groups that the money would benefit  trump said  these people that get these checks are amazing people  amazing people  but it s been several weeks since the fundraiser  and a summary released on thursday by trump s campaign reports that only about   million has been donated to the charities trump listed  where s the other half after trump s campaign would not give details about where the donations had gone  the washington post contacted every single one of those  veterans charities  asking them how much they d received from trump  the post said the numbers only added up to less than half of the   million  and the post was being generous   according to cnn s investigation  the network could only account for      and not all of it was directly from trump  here s the report from cnn after these investigations  trump spokeswoman hope hicks criticized the media for its curiosity and said that the rest of the money would eventually be released to the veterans groups  but she didn t specify when  if the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated  rather than trying to disparage mr  trump s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation  we would all be better for it  for the veterans groups that were promised donations  the situation has been more than frustrating  for many of these organizations  a donation like the ones they were promised could be life altering  keith david from the task force dagger foundation  one of the veterans groups that trump said he would be disbursing the money to  asked  where s the rest of the money going  david s group received a check for only      a small amount considering how much money trump had actually promised the groups  david said with reasonable concern  there s a large chunk missing  i m just kind of curious as to where that money went  i d like to see some of it come to us  because we are on the list  because of the missing donations  questions are being raised about how much longer trump will keep the donated money in his personal charity  the donald j  trump foundation  which gives donations to  boost his political brand   meanwhile  trump continues to brag about the fact that he is  self funding my own campaign  i don t think i get enough credit for self funding   but what trump doesn t tell us is that his self funding isn t really self funded at all most of trump s funding is actually from  candidate loans   which trump must pay off with donations from individual contributors   and he s struggling  in january  the same month trump s veteran fundraiser was held  trump got    million in candidate loans  but only    million was raised from his donors if trump is concerned about his opponents calling him a con artist  he s certainly doing a great job validating their insults
