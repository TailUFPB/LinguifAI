at the beginning of the year  a new law went into effect in texas authorizing  responsible gun owners  to carry their weapons around pretty much anywhere as long as they have gone through the incredibly easy process of obtaining a concealed carry permit  as the nra tells us   constantly   these individuals  these  good guys with guns   are ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger to protect the innocent from  bad guys with guns  unfortunately  the problem is that the  good guys  often can become  bad guys  the moment they get a little bit angry  something we saw unfold on friday and saturday in uvalde  texas  four people are dead after a  hour standoff with police at a trailer park   it s a mess in there right now   a uvalde county sheriff s office deputy told news  san antonio details are scarce  but police have announced that no officers were hurt in the battle with an unannounced number of gunmen and or women  uvalde county sheriff s had responded to reports of shots fired at the trailer park  after police arrived  the suspects opened fire on responding officers   none of whom were hurt  fortunately  people in the trailer park and in neighboring homes were not permitted into the area while the blood battle between  good guys with guns  and police unfortunately  the mass proliferation of guns in the united states creates a situation where no one is ever truly safe   not in their homes  not in church  not walking down the street  or anywhere else  the lie that a  good guy with a gun  will save the day is a gross misrepresentation of reality  in fact  they re just as likely to score a headshot on the person they are  saving  as to actually save someone while many argue that it s their right to carry their self confidence on their hips  the fact is that keeping a gun around actually makes you less safe than having no gun at all  and then  of course  there s the chance that any  responsible gun owner  could snap at any time and start shooting  while it s true that we don t know what sparked this shootout  we can safely assume that the people who turned their guns on police surely thought of themselves as the  good guys  featured image via daily mail
