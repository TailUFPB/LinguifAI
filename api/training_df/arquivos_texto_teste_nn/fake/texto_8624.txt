when the bundy moron militia first took over the malheur wildlife refuge in harney county  oregon  ammon bundy put out the call for  murican  patriots  to come and join the  fight   in essence  a man who advocated for armed idiots to aim their assault rifles at federal agents because his father is a freeloading government leech called on the worst america has to offer to join him in doing it again  this time as aggressors his call was answered by the likes of jon ritzheimer  whose insatiable appetite for attention couldn t resist and a slew of other unfavorable imbeciles who decided a patch of forest in oregon was more important than their wives and children the oregonian  a local publication that has been covering the occupation  has uncovered that  at least  one of the men who showed up isn t just dangerous because he follows right wing terrorists  he s actually a convicted murderer courtesy of the oregonianniel sigurd wampler  circled above  was convicted in  of the second degree murder of his own father at  years old  after denying that he is the same niel sigurd wampler that the oregonian uncovered a murder conviction on  they confirmed his identity from his unusual name and a matching date of birth as well as a positive id from a former prison guard who remembered him from when he was locked up the details of the murder reveal an extremely disturbed individual  according to court records  wampler killed his father while was sleeping by clubbing him in the head with an  inch steel eye bolt while he was in bed  wampler apparently called the police and told them   i have just killed my father  the leaders of the bundy bunch have distanced themselves from wampler  denying that they know who he is  but as you can see from the picture above  he s been out and about and in plain view  often seen talking to other terrorists as well as the press wampler was also one of the men who appeared at the bundy ranch incident in nevada  where the las vegas review journal quoted him saying   i myself am willing to be shot and killed for constitutional rights and principles   he was also present at the sugar pine mine confrontation last year in southern oregon  for the leaders of the terrorists to refuse to acknowledge shows a great deal about his character  or lack thereof that poses an interesting question  how is a man who is a convicted felon part of an armed occupation  according to a spokesman from wampler s home town of san luis obispo  california  wampler is forbidden from owning or possessing a firearm due to his felony murder conviction  when asked by the oregonian if he was armed  he answered   oh  yes   but refused to show his weapon the serious problem this man poses is that if it is confirmed that he is or has been carrying a weapon in violation of oregon law  will law enforcement continue to allow him to walk free  we re not talking about just guns here  either  oregon law prohibits a convicted murderer from possessing  any instrument or weapon having a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force or any blackjack  slingshot  sandclub  sandbag  sap glove  metal knuckles or an electro muscular disruption technology device  taser   or who carries a dirk  dagger or stiletto  there is a  year statute of limitations for those laws  unless the felon in question was convicted of murder  there s no word yet from law enforcement about action against a particular individual at the refuge  but clearly this man  who admitted to being armed  poses a direct threat not only to the local  state and federal agents he comes in contact with but also to the press covering the stupidity and the children the terrorists are using as a shield things just keep getting worse  not only for the bundy terrorists but for the entire right wing extremist movement in general featured image via the oregonian
