when it comes to racial tension in america  nothing is new  it s just now being shown for what it is  with the emergence of cell phone cameras capturing police brutality  people going after the president for the color of his skin  and a republican presidential candidate who openly says racist things  it s been getting very ugly however  fox news being fox news  and jeanine pirro being great at the art of inflammatory rhetoric  she decided to say that we don t really live in a racist society  but president obama somehow wants us to pirro decided to say  the problem is that this president is looking in a rear view mirror  it doesn t matter if he s at a prayer breakfast and says   you christians had it coming  and it goes back to christ and jim crow and slavery  i mean  why doesn t he look forward  then after listening to the stupid being passed around the room that somehow president obama is to blame for increased racial tension in america  pirro adds  we ve passed the civil war  we ve passed the civil rights era  we ve got the laws in place  he is identifying things that he thinks are a problem and he doesn t get his facts straight  america was colorblind when we voted for a black president twice  the problem is primarily fixed  he keeps making it worse  they have fewer jobs now  he is just stoking the flames  here s the thing  president obama is very much living in the present and just because he s shining a spotlight on existing problems  doesn t mean he created them  nor were they gone  if you don t call something out  and only ignore it  it doesn t go away  but rather stews and gets deeper ingrained into the core of many people  no matter if you re racist  or have been the victim of racism also  there s no such thing as being colorblind  nor should we as a society seek to ignore what makes us different and unique  we need to embrace our differences  not paint over them and pretend they don t exist pirro is clearly vying for being the dumbest person on the network with this sort of thinking  because she s clearly missing the ability to think rationally watch the stupidity unfold before your eyes here  featured image via video screen capture  mmfa
