in what could be seen as an omen of sorts  a fly just landed on donald trump s head  but had no idea what it was in for it s true that flies are attracted to poop  so for the fly to land on trump  a man that spews utter bullshit daily  it really should come as no surprise to anyone that a fly would land directly on top of his head  unfortunately for the fly  though  he seemed to get tangled into what can only be called a nest of sorts that lays directly on top of trump s head you can actually watch the bewildered bug land  crawl up on top of his hair  because apparently that s possible with the amount of hairspray used  but then fall in and under  and your heart breaks when you know that may be it for the little fella of course  many are making the comparison of this fly to the moment when the bird landed on bernie sanders  podium in portland  oregon  clearly showing what sort of creatures are attracted to either candidate   a bird of hope and a fly attracted to bullshit watch the lord of the flies and his new little friend here https   www facebook com  videos  featured image via video screen capture
