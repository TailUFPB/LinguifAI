fired back  at the hateful  liberal  public school librarian with class and dignity   it s so refreshing to finally have a first lady with class in the white house first lady melania trump fired back friday at a massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of dr  seuss books  claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda  stephanie grisham  director of communications for the first lady s office  said in a statement to fox news that the response was  unfortunate   and mrs  trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can  she has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office  and sending books to children across the country is but one example   she said   to turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate  but the first lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere  to celebrate  national read a book day   the first lady had sent out a collection of  dr  seuss books to one school in each state across the nation  the titles included   the cat in the hat    one fish  two fish  red fish  blue fish    wacky wednesday    green eggs and ham   and  oh  the places you ll go  she followed in the footsteps of her predecessor  michelle obama  who often read dr  seuss books to children  former first ladies hillary clinton and barbara bush also read to children at dr  seuss themed educational events remember when mooch read seuss to a room full of kids at the white house  hmmm was mooch promoting racism  to turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate     first lady melania trump s office i wanted to send you a special gift  dr  seuss s oh  the places you ll go  is a book my son and i have read over and over again  and one that we want to share with all of you   the first lady wrote in her letter to students   please also remember that you are the future of america and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to  but despite the gesture  liz phipps soeiro  a librarian at a public school in cambridge  wrote a letter to the first lady  which was then published on the horn book blog  notifying mrs  trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection  explaining that her school didn t have a  need  for the books  due to her school and library s  award winning  status   fox  percent fed up  soeiro on tuesday penned an editorial for the horn book s family reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation  my students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science   she wrote  multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance   soeiro added trump s package reportedly included such seuss classics as  green eggs and ham    the cat in the hat  and  one fish  two fish  red fish  blue fish  soeiro criticized seuss for being the only author represented in trump s donation  citing controversy over some of his illustrations  you may not be aware of this  but dr  seuss is a bit of a clich   a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature   she told trump  another fact that many people are unaware of is that dr  seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda  caricatures  and harmful stereotypes  i work in a district that has plenty of resources  which contributes directly to  excellence   soeiro wrote   my students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science  soeiro went on to slam the white house and education secretary betsy devos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities   which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by devos  policies but soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves another fact that many people are unaware that the hypocritical and smug liberal librarian was seen celebrating dr  seuss only  years ago here s d c  librarian who rejected melania s dr  seuss book donation  steeped in racist propaganda  as cat in hat  pic twitter com   clay travis   claytravis  september
