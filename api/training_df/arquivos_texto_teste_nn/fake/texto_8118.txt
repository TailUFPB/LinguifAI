with the death of a supreme court justice many implications follow  including who will be their replacement  after ultra conservative justice antonin scalia s death many are left wondering what will happen next  and others are trying to sway decision making altogether  including republicans who don t want president obama to have the ability to pick who will be the nominee senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  wrote on facebook just hours after scalia passed away that  the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice  therefore  this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president   of course  he s completely politicizing the vacancy  while also assuming the next president will be a republican noticing this absolutely pathetic attempt to thwart president obama s constitutional authority to nominate the next supreme court justice was none other that massachusetts senator elizabeth warren  d   in her own statement released sunday on twitter  she said  senator mcconnell is right that the american people should have a voice in the selection of the next supreme court justice  in fact  they did   when president obama won the  election by five million votes  article ii section  of the constitution says the president of the united states nominates justices to the supreme court  with the advice and consent of the senate  i can t find a clause that says  except when there s a year left in the term of a democratic president the senate gop took an oath just like democrats did  abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the constitution   our democracy  abandoning their senate duties would also prove that all the republican talk about loving the constitution is just that   empty talk  and she s absolutely correct  president obama is granted  by the constitution  the ability to select who he deems appropriate as a nominee to replace justice scalia  what we are seeing right now is republicans slip in to panic mode  because they are terrified that the replacement for their most conservative justice in the supreme court has now fallen into the hands of obama the people more than showed their voice in who they want to have chosen as their supreme court justices  they did so in november of  and again in november of  with the election and reelection of president obama featured image  flickr
