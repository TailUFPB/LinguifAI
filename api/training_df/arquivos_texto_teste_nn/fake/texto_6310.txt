ever since the attacks on the u s  diplomatic compound in benghazi  libya on september     republicans have been trying everything within their powers to throw the obama administration  in particular former secretary of state hillary clinton  under the bus  however  after several investigations surrounding the attack  it has continuously been shown that there was no wrong doing even fox news reported  investigation by the republican controlled house intelligence committee has found that the cia and the military acted properly in responding to the  attack on a u s  diplomatic post in benghazi  libya the report alleges no wrongdoing by obama administration appointees debunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies surrounding the incident  the report concludes that there was no intelligence failure  no delay in sending a cia rescue team  no missed opportunity for a military rescue  and no evidence the cia was covertly shipping arms from libya to syria  yet  the investigations still continued and questions are still being raised to this day something just happened during an interview on fox news  however  when one of the lead republicans who s been leading the charge against the obama administration accidentally admitted the truth  but then tried to pivot away while rep  trey gowdy  r sc  was discussing the fact that one of the lead investigators for benghazi just quit because there was nothing more to discover  he seemed to debunk his main conspiracy theory that there was a  stand down  order given  which would have prevented military help from arriving at the compound in time to help gowdy said  whether or not they could have gotten there in time  they couldn t  i don t think there s any question about that  but then clearly pivoting as if to give the illusion that he didn t say such a thing  he adds  why could you not  why were you not positioned to do it  why could we not do a lot of things  gowdy  why could you not get a decent haircut that didn t make you look like you crawled out of a harry potter novel  the fact of the matter is  he just admitted the obama administration is in the clear and there was nothing more they could have done to get help there in time what s most interesting is the fact that gowdy is now raising questions that hillary clinton raised right after it happened with her now infamous line   what difference does it make   because in full context  her response to questioning was  with all due respect  the fact is we had four dead americans  was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they d they go kill some americans  what difference at this point does it make  going on to say that we need to figure out what happened  what we can do differently  and how we can go forward to make sure it never happens again gowdy is all out of arguments and the benghazi attack investigations have been settled  what we need to do now is make sure we keep our current diplomats protected and prevent another attack from occurring  which is what republicans should be focused on rather than try to use the attacks as a political posturing move to throw the obama administration and hillary clinton under the bus  maybe we should have an investigation into how many unwarranted  tax payer funded investigations we ve had  featured image via video screen capture  ht c l
