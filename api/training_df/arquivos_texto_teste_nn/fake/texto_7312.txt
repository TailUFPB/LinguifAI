a group of college professors have released a report that claims the federal government s attempts to combat sexual harassment are stifling educators  free speech on university campuses the american association of university  aaup  found that the current interpretation of the government s title ix laws which cover sexual harassment have made it hard for professors  especially female professors  to teach their students  right now  if a student finds something offensive and complains about it  universities immediately open up an investigation into that teacher s actions  no matter how  questionable  that complaint is according to the report  the failure of the federal government to make  meaningful distinctions between conduct and speech or otherwise distinguish between hostile environment sexual harassment  is putting academic freedom and free speech in jeopardy  the general counsel of the association and the chairwoman of the subcommittee who wrote the report  risa l  lieberwitz spoke to the ny times  saying  we need to protect academic speech and the freedom that goes with academic speech  as well as due process  universities are acting in a way that is overly precipitous as well as applying overly broad definitions of sexual harassment because they are afraid of scrutiny  the report even gives examples to support their claims  one of those was regarding sociology professor patty adler s class  deviance in us society   at the university of colorado boulder  adler had taught the class for more than twenty years and each semester around five hundred students enrolled in it  but in  some of the students complained that her class  constituted sexual harassment  at the conclusion of the term  undergraduate teaching assistants participated in and witnessed role playing exercises featuring subjects relevant to course material involving the global sex trade  these performances animated character types  such as an  eastern european  slave whore   a pimp  a  bar whore   and a high end escort   adler s dean offered her a buyout for early retirement and indicated if she did not accept the offer  she could incur penalties up to and including forfeiture of her retirement benefits her other option was to return to the classroom but never teach the course again  when students  faculty and advocacy groups found out what was happening they protested the school s ultimatum and eventually the university relented and welcomed her back without any conditions  however  the incident took such a toll on her that she only stayed for one semester and then retired professor adler is not alone  similar incidents have happened all across the country and that is the violation of free speech and academic freedom the aaup found so troubling  the group is not advocating sexual harassment  they are just asking that the government draw clearer lines between what is and what isn t harassment so that students can be properly educated right now  the lines are so blurry that colleges and universities are doing a disservice to the students who pay thousands of dollars for a well rounded curriculum  of course  these schools should act if a professor is violating the law  but there is a huge difference between harassment and  well  this is an uncomfortable  intellectual topic   nobody benefits when schools don t use common sense when investigating claims featured image via kevork djansezian getty images
