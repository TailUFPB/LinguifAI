as republicans grow anxious and weary about an impending trump general election candidacy  democrats are pouncing on every opportunity to take back an unlikely chamber  the house of representatives in   democrats suffered their biggest defeat   one not seen since the world war ii era   and subsequently lost seats  after gaining in   in the  election  in total  between  and   republicans picked up a net  seats  cementing a strong lock on power but democrats are hoping to turn the tables in november  and their biggest weapon is donald trump an analysis from real clear politics shows that while democrats have a very good chance of taking back the senate  winning back the house would be a very steep climb  but it is possible  all democrats have to do is show up to vote  and link every republican running for congress to frontrunner  and now candidate  donald trump  oh  and democrats need to vote down ticket if they want to see congress turn blue if current trends continue  however  democrats may have an opportunity to win substantial gains down the ballot  in the most recent rcp average  clinton leads trump by   percentage points  that lead could increase  decrease or disappear before november  but it s a positive sign at this point for house democrats  data from recent elections indicate that very few voters split their tickets  voting for one party in the presidential race and another down the ballot  if this pattern holds  presidential performance will be intricately linked to how house candidates will fare this november in other words  if clinton maintains her landslide lead  yes  landslide   that means the house could finally be free of the wrath of the freedom caucus and paul ryan republicans currently hold  seats in districts obama won in  and  in which romney won by less than  percent  real clear politics  analysts contend that if clinton could pick up all  from obama s districts and just half of romney s  due to down ticket voting   the chances of democrats taking back the house become inevitable donald trump may be the best thing to happen to democrats  but a coalition of liberals  progressives  moderates  independents and center right democrats will be needed at the booths if this is to become a reality should sanders or clinton clinch the nomination  the prospect of a blue white house  house and senate  and supreme court could be a reality with the media constantly propping up trump to be this god like figure  it s up to democrats to keep the truth out there for the electorate  that there is virtually no difference between the de facto leader of the gop and house republicans  who time and time again have threatened women s health  immigrant families  and the healthcare of millions of low income americans democrats have a solid chance  it s time they get out and vote an deliver on the promise to keep progress moving forward featured image via mark wilson getty images
