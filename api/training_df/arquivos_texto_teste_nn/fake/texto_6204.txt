president barack obama made history when he appointed a christian air force veteran to the president s advisory council on faith based and neighborhood partnerships  since conservatives love our troops  this is a move that they widely celebrat oh  wait   they have a problem with it satin is quite successful  she served as a member of the united church of christ s executive council with great success  in fact  she is the first openly transgender member of the ucc executive council  and was involved in the church s decision to include transgender individuals in the ministry of the church  of course  her successes are the reason conservatives hate her  the white house notes that barbara satin is the assistant faith work director for the national lgbtq task force   she is an active member of the united church of christ and served on the denomination s executive council as its first openly transgender member   ms  satin recently worked on the development of spirit on lake  a lgbtq senior housing project in minneapolis   she served on the board of directors for outfront minnesota from  to  and has served as chair of glbt generations since    she has also served on the board of directors of pfund foundation  a regional lgbtq community foundation advancing social justice in iowa  minnesota  north dakota  south dakota and wisconsin  since   given the current political climate  i believe it s important that a voice of faith representing the transgender and gender non conforming community   as well as a person of my years  nearly    be present and heard in these vital conversations   satin said in a statement after the president selected her for her new position the mission of the president s advisory council on faith based and neighborhood partnerships  which  brings together leaders and experts in fields related to the work of faith based and neighborhood organizations in order to make recommendations to the administration on how to improve the partnerships it forms to serve people in need   is quite admirable but conservatives just can t get past that whole  transgender  thing  in the comment section of the blaze  our frenemies on the right really let their hatred flow  some complained that obama appointed a  dude   the only time in their lives in which they were angry about a white man being appointed to an important position                  satin is a good woman who served her country honorably in the military and continues to do so  conservatives  unfortunately  care nothing for that because she might or might not have a penis featured image via screengrab cbn
