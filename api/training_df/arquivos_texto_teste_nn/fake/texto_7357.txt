with the primaries indicating that donald trump is coming closer and closer to securing the republican nomination for president  the reality of a trump presidency is actually starting to sink in for many  if that reality terrifies you  you re likely in the majority  if you welcome the idea  what the f ck is wrong with you trump is as racist as he is narcissistic  and he s pretty damn into himself  all the proof you need is at any rally where he makes his talking points about himself  and spends no time actually speaking in depth on any policy positions  it s always about how much people love him and how  great  he is  or how  great  he ll be for the nation  just count how many times he says  i    me   or  my   although  you ll likely lose count after around   speaking on behalf of all sane and logical minded individuals worldwide is none other than the brilliant comedian patton oswalt  he took to twitter on  national poetry day  with the quintessential poem most would like to read to trump oswalt perfectly tweets  via twitter is it crude  yes  it sure is  as is trump if you weren t already paying attention  in fact  trump isn t only crude  he is vile in his contempt for the  other   he s scapegoats all the nation s  or for that matter  the world s problems on anyone but those who are just like him  it s always someone else s fault  and he gets his band of merry morons to fall in line and believe him  it s pathetic  it s sad  and kinda scary so  kudos to oswalt for telling it like it is and with the best response that is indicative of how we all likely feel  pattonoswalt pic twitter com   alexandra cruz     march    featured image via youtube
