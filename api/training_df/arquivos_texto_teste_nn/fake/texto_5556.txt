what do hillary s emails and police murders of unarmed black citizens have to do with each other  powerful white men  i e  the powerful  white men who currently run congress  who are absolutely pissed and screaming in ugly indignation at the fact that the fbi didn t recommend indicting hillary for her emails  and the department of justice listened one tweet  posted by  ohnoshetwitnt  explains the connection as these powerful white men misdirecting their anger towards a scandal that isn t even a scandal imagine if powerful white men were as vocally outraged about an innocent black person being shot as they are about improper use of email   ohnoshetwitnt   ohnoshetwitnt  july    do you make this point better than that  if the gop in congress were half as angry about real injustice  and real problems  as they are about hillary s emails  they might actually be able to get some real work done  if they were as angry about police shooting unarmed black men to death as they are about hillary s emails  they might call for hearings and investigations into why that keeps happening  instead of investigating hillary over and over  ad nauseam two men  two days  both black  both unarmed  one in front of his child  alton sterling and philando castile  and conservatives everywhere repeatedly question what these two along with hundreds of others are doing to provoke the police  they denigrate black lives matter  president obama s anger is correctly focused  but republicans well  they re talking about opening an investigation into whether hillary lied under oath now  because she must be a criminal in some way  shape or form  they just have to find it  four years and millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted investigating hillary for absolutely everything under the sun  but that s not enough for them  ohnoshetwitnt s point absolutely shreds the powerful  white men that run congress  and run the gop  in the most brilliant manner possible  too bad the powerful white men who most need to think about this would rather focus their time  energy and taxpayer dollars on something that really doesn t fucking matter featured image by aude guerrucci pool getty images and twitter
