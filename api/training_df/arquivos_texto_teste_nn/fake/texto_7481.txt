president barack obama took some time on tuesday to call for more civility from the republican candidates while they re on the campaign trail  as the bid for the white house becomes increasingly violent and coarse noting the increasing violence and racist language  obama scolded the candidates for setting a bad example for children and making a mockery of america s reputation to the rest of the world  speaking to his audience at a st  patrick s day luncheon on capitol hill  obama slammed the gop s  vulgar and divisive  campaign  making a noticeable jab at gop front runner donald trump s routinely violent rallies and hateful rhetoric toward women and minorities  the president said  we have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities  at americans who don t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do  we ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech  however offensive it may be  we live in a country where free speech is one of the most important rights we hold  in response to those attempts  we ve seen actual violence  and we ve heard silence from too many of our leaders too often  we ve accepted this as somehow the new normal  and it s worth asking ourselves what each of us may have done to contribute to this kind of vicious atmosphere in our politics  obama said the current presidential race wasn t an accurate depiction of america  and it has to stop  you can watch part of obama s powerful speech below  which earned him a standing ovation from lawmakers in both parties obama later urged politicians to think of america s youth and renounce the violence  stating that we should not have to explain to them this darker side  in america s politics  in america  there is no law that says we have to be nice to each other  or courteous  or treat each other with respect  but there are norms  there are customs  there are values that our parents taught us and that we try to teach to our children to try to treat others the way we want to be treated  at one point during the luncheon  obama faced house speaker paul ryan and said that the two men should be able to treat each other with respect despite their different views on policy  obama said  as ryan nodded back  i don t have a bad thing to say about you as a man  i know you want what s best for america  obama s powerful message to the gop candidates comes just as front runner donald trump is denying the worsening violence that has plagued his rallies by calling his campaign events  love fests   trump is also now lying about the fact that he has encouraged more violence by telling his supporters he will pay for any legal fees they might be faced with from attacking protesters  featured image via ben thomas   flickr
