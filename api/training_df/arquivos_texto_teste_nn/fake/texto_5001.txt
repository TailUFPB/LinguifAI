most black americans can t stand it when white people try to explain to us what is best for us   hence the term  whitesplaining   however  there are many white folks who  despite the fact that they ll never walk a mile in our shoes  still see fit to partake in this condescending and insulting narrative  once such person is fox news  bill o reilly o reilly decided to engage in this activity on the wednesday edition of his show  the o reilly factor  with two black guests  o reilly s guests were a lawyer  andell brown  and a prominent faith leader  rev  jacques degraff  the conversation was regarding the fact that  for reasons obvious to most sane people  trump is polling at an abysmal two percent with the african american electorate  o reilly  however  seems to think that  despite trump s flagrant and unapologetic racism  black people should vote for him and other republicans anyway  he opined  why isn t the african american community saying  you know what  we had a black president who didn t help us very much  the democratic party hasn t really helped us very much  maybe we go supply side economics and look for a guy who s going to stimulate the economy that perhaps would be better   why don t they do that  this was after o reilly tried to insist that trump and his racism could be ignored for what he seemed to see as some greater good  brown  however  took him down fast on that one  well you also have to look at what trump has said and done himself  not necessarily being  as you put it  demonized  she went on to remind o reilly of trump s racist tweeting of crime statistics that came from white power twitter users  saying  i mean  that was totally inaccurate  and of course o reilly did the same thing with that line that all of trump s racism apologists do  and insisted it was  foolish  but still not to be held against him because well  duh  it was only a retweet o reilly then proceeded to do what many whitesplainers do  and insisted that despite trump s obvious bigotry  we d be  quote   better off  with the gop and should just ignore their rank racism  rev  de graff had clearly had enough by that point  and said to o reilly  black americans like any other group in america are capable of determining their own best interests  and black americans don t have a relationship with the republican party because of the hostile environment they ve fostered for eight years  then again  this is to be expected from the likes of bill o reilly and fox news  after all  they sincerely don t think they are racists  just because they re not into white power and ku klux klan type activity  to them  that s enough not to be a bigot  make no mistake  though   one can be a racist and hold racist ideals without going full on white nationalist  further  whitesplaining is  in and of itself  a form of racism  then again  those who engage in that sort of thing likely don t care anyway  and will continue  sad  but true watch the exchange below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
