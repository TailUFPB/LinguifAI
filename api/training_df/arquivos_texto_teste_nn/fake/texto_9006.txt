 the nuclear deal  became a republican talking point as soon as it became inevitable that the obama administration was going to move forward and try to do what no democrat or republican could do for  years  tell the iranians to sit down and do as they re told so people can stop finding reasons to bomb each other we were told from the beginning that iran wasn t suddenly a friendly nation  we were told flat out that they support terrorism and that they have human rights issues and women s rights issues and all kinds of things to sort out  all of that being true is also the reason we couldn t just sit back and allow a potentially unpredictable rogue nuclear nation to decide to eliminate a neighbor  friend or foe you see  we can t just have people nuking each other  when the deal was made the gop immediately called it a giveaway  they rang up the total of how much the iranian economy   and therefore its people   would gain with sanctions lifted and called that number the amount obama was  giving to terrorists   the amount of enriched product iran would have left would be enough to kill israel  times  they spewed lie after lie to make people afraid   it s what they do   of the very thought of iran having anything nuclear at all within its borders the republican plan is simple  keep the sanctions on iran  making them as helpless as possible on the oil market  and then start a war  it s just the next inevitable republican war  if we elect a republican president we can pretty much bank on it  several candidates have said they would  tear up the deal  on their first day in office unfortunately for the gop  iran just surrendered its entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the russians  what little material they have left will be downgraded to fissionable reactor plates for an internationally supervised test reactor with zero capability of producing weapons grade material the transfer included tons of low grade material that could have potentially been enriched along with the entire inventory of enriched uranium the iranians possessed  at this point  the iranians are reduced to a pre nuclear industrial era where the only thing nuclear reactors do are experiments that s what the people who listen to the voices of doom on stage at gop debates don t get  there never was any way for iran to get out of the stipulations of the deal  their path to a nuclear weapon was cut off at the knees  this latest step to full implementation is yet another incredible win for a president who refuses to allow his legacy to die during his  lame duck  years featured image via instagram
