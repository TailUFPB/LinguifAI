a bigoted conservative attorney in alabama is suing the five supreme court justices who voted to legalize same sex marriage across the nation the whining lawyer  named austin burdick  is after   million in damages because he says he can no longer do his job because the constitution has been destroyed by justices anthony kennedy  stephen breyer  ruth bader ginsburg  sonia sotomayor and elena kegan  defendants goes beyond a manipulation  twist  strain  or unique perspective on the text and crosses over in to an abandonment of the constitution   burdick claims in the lawsuit  for centuries the constitution has been the instrument of protection for the rights of citizens against government intrusion  specifically  since the ratification of the  amendment in   interpreted the plain language of the constitution and that amendment to be a guarantee of freedom from government interference in individual liberty  clearly  burdick probably should not have been able to pass the bar  because his argument is ridiculous  the ruling made by the high court in obergefell v  hodges is the perfect demonstration of the supreme court ruling precisely because the constitution protects the rights of citizens  which includes the rights of gay people  but burdick claims the justices rewrote the constitution  the opinion in fact rewrites the  amendment to read   every state must make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states  further  each state shall deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law under the guise of extending tax benefits or some other license  and any person within its jurisdiction may be deprived of the equal protection of the laws when it is fashionable to do so   seriously  how did this idiot get a law license the fact is that the  amendment guarantees every american citizen equal protection and due process  something that bigots like burdick have been denying to lgbt people for decades  he is literally whining because he thinks the constitution should allow him to discriminate against gay people the constitution was not rewritten and there is no reason why burdick cannot continue to practice law  although there are reasons why he should not be allowed to do so  suing the highest ranking judges in the nation is frivolous and a waste of the judiciary s time  the supreme court has the final say on what is constitutional and what is not  it says so right in the very constitution burdick claims has been destroyed burdick has apparently felt  threatened  by same sex marriage since last may when he wrote on his website that all same sex couples are after is benefits while claiming that same sex couples haven t been denied anything at all no same sex couple is prevented from proclaiming that they are committed to each other  no same sex couple is prevented from conducting a ceremony of their own choosing or design to add dignity to their relationship  no same sex couple is prevented from exchanging rings and vows  no same sex couple is prevented from endeavoring to live happily ever after  no same sex couple is prevented from referring to their partner as their  spouse   further  no same sex couple is prevented from announcing to the world that they are married  in fact  many of the same people who have rushed to the courthouse for a license state that they have been  married  for years make no mistake  this lawsuit is just another part of burdick s temper tantrum  he claims same sex couples already have the right the get married when in reality many states  including alabama  banned same sex couples from getting married before the supreme court ruling  in fact  alabama is still trying to deny same sex couples that right any self respecting judge should laugh burdick out of court since this is clearly just another desperate ploy by conservatives to keep their anti gay hate alive  featured image from wikimedia
