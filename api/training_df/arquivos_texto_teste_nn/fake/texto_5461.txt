trump has famously said  repeatedly  that he plans to build a wall between mexico and the united states  furthermore  has been firm that mexico will pay for that wall   a claim that has been disputed by multiple former presidents and the treasury secretary of our southern neighbor  i will say it emphatically  there is no scenario in which mexico will pay for this wall that is being proposed by the united states presidential hopeful  mexican treasury secretary luis videgaray said in march  but that hasn t stopped trump and his followers from pushing the issue right into the official republican party platform  in other words  this is not just trump s dream  this is now something that every republican across the nation will attempt to accomplish  this is really happening  people but who will pay for it  the short answer is that we  the taxpayers  will  but if trump is elected and we manage to once again hand congress to the gop  and every single one of them remains as stupid as they are today  we ll have to deal with one issue  where will we get the materials trump s border wall is a goldmine for southern building materials manufacturers   a   million chunk of the more than   billion cost of the wall at the low end is some pretty sweet lucre  after all   but the sheer demand will likely outweigh the supply by far  in fact  a recent report by bloomberg notes that  one of the biggest beneficiaries  might be cemex sab  a company that is not exactly in the united states  in fact  as production progresses  they might have to figure out a way to get materials over the wall so construction can continue the largest cement maker in the americas would be  best positioned  to profit from such a large construction project  according to a report by sanford c  bernstein   co  other likely beneficiaries include another mexican company cemex owns a stake in  grupo cementos de chihuahua sab  as well as martin marietta materials inc   vulcan materials co  and calportland co the project would enrich suppliers of building materials in the border region  bernstein analysts led by phil roseberg wrote in the report  the wall proposed by the presumptive republican presidential nominee would probably emulate the design of a barrier separating israel from the west bank  much of which was built with precast concrete panels  they said  the potential cost of the wall with mexico    billion or more  as ludicrous as the trump wall project sounds  to us at least   it represents a huge opportunity for those companies involved in its construction   roseberg said in the report   despite arguments concerning which government will pay for construction  the large quantities of materials required may necessitate procurement from both sides of the border  the wall itself isn t the only challenge  roseberg says that roads would need to be built just to gain access to the more remote areas the wall would touch  but not to worry   cemex has operations on both sides of the border to satisfy all of trump s needs but why cemex  roseberg s team explains  it is not economically feasible to transport heavy building materials over large distances  as such  it is the companies with production facilities closest to the border that stand to gain the most as suppliers to the trump wall project  bloomberg notes that the wall would need  million cubic meters of concrete if it extends   miles  rises  feet and reaches  feet underground  these numbers could rise if the wall keeps  getting  feet taller  like he says seemingly every time someone irritates him  we have assumed that planning and land acquisition would take   years with a further  years for construction itself   roseberg s team says   this means that the impact on demand for materials would occur from  at the earliest  looks like those  rapists  and  murderers  in mexico will be laughing all the way to the bank if trump s wall is built watch trump talk about his stupid wall below featured image via screenshot
