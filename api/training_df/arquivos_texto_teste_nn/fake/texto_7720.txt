a student at baltimore s reach  partnership school took a cellphone video of a school resource officer brutally assaulting a high school sophomore on tuesday  and now the city s top school cop and two others have been placed on leave the sickening video shows a police officer slapping the teenager in his face three times  kicking him and cursing at him  another officer  a female  can be seen standing behind the abusive officer doing absolutely nothing to stop the attack when officials saw the video they placed the officers and baltimore school police chief marshall goodwin on paid administrative leave until the investigation into the incident can be completed  yes  that s right  the cop beat this child and he is still being paid mayor stephanie rawlings blake said she was  appalled  by the officers  behavior  as a parent of a baltimore city school student  i was appalled by what i saw  the behavior that was demonstrated   is certainly something you never want to see    certainly not a school officer acting in this way  particularly with a young person  meanwhile  the city school system is trying to blame the kid for his assault because he wasn t a student at reach  saying  his presence at the school and the series of events before and after the incident are currently under investigation  his family s attorney lauren geisse  however  is saying that is not true  the boy had a right to be at the school where he was an enrolled student  with respect to refusing to leave the school  the student didn t want to leave the school where he had a right to attend  attorney michael davey who represents the police officer who is seen hitting the student claimed his client was responding to a call of an intruder on campus and explained away the video by saying only a few seconds of the incident were captured  as if that somehow makes it perfectly okay that a grown man was hitting and kicking a teenage boy in the face the school system s ceo  gregory thornton is calling the officer s assault on the child  unacceptable   i am completely appalled and disappointed by what is depicted in the video  our school police officers are entrusted with ensuring the safety of our students and staff  and i know that most of them take this job seriously while maintaining a high level of professionalism  the behavior in the video is completely unacceptable  he is absolutely correct  frankly  there is absolutely no excuse for a police officer to his anyone that way  let alone a child  and it is appalling that he is still being paid after this  this kid suffered injuries to his face and his ribs and this guy is allowed to just collect a paycheck while hanging out at home  wtf is that about if  peace  officers do not know how to control their tempers  they have no business wearing a badge  and if they do lose their temper and hurt someone  they damn sure don t deserve to be paid while the investigation is completed  that s outrageous  featured image via video screenshot
