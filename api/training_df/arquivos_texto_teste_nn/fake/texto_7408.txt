conservatives constantly insist that there is no proof of human evolution  but after watching this video they might tear their own bodies apart just to destroy the evidence contained within in a video released by vox  a narrator clearly explains how humans have proof of evolution inside their own bodies that are leftover pieces from our past that we no longer need because we evolved  your body is a temple  but it s also a museum of natural history   the narrator says in the introduction  look closely and you ll see parts that aren t there because you need them  but because your animal ancestors did  no longer serving their previous function  but not costly enough to have disappeared  these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by natural selection  the video goes on to list several body parts that some people have that are not necessary such as a vestigial muscle in the forearm that can be seen by placing the top of your wrist on a flat surface and touching your pinky with your thumb  some people have this long tendon band that is commonly found in lemurs and monkeys that need it to grip tree limbs  approximately  percent to  percent of people are missing that tendon because we don t  scramble through trees  anymore then there are the three muscles attached to our outer ear  these muscle remnants were once a useful nocturnal tool for detecting the direction of sounds and is still found in cats and other mammals  but we have evolved from needing these muscles because we no longer need to survive in the wild forest at night goosebumps are yet another leftover vestigial group of muscles  albeit tiny ones  that activate in the effort to increase the amount of space for insulation  which is useless to humans now because we are no longer covered with fur like other mammals humans also once had tails  but they are yet another vestigial body part that has disappeared over time because we evolved to no longer need them  so the tail cells die before a full tail develops  which is why we only have tail bones while other mammals develop full tails  as it turns out  human embryos look similar to other vertebrates at  weeks in development  complete with a tail  some humans are still born with a tail that is surgically removed the video then talks about the palmar grasp reflex  which is found in human babies as well as chimps and other monkeys that allow them to grip whatever is put in their hand  incredible footage from the past shows a baby holding on tightly to a bar while hanging down  thus demonstrating our  inner monkey  here s the video via youtube this video about human evolution is similar to a video demonstrating the evolution of hippos and whales and how they are related to each other while that video also made conservative  christians  blow a gasket  this latest video featuring human evolution ought to make them absolutely explode  so it s perfect to share with any conservative you know  and then just sit back  relax  and watch the fireworks  featured image via screen capture
