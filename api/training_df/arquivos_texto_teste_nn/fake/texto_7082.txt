tennessee the state that was so concerned about the first amendment that they enacted a religious  freedom  act has just proven that the only religion they really care about is christianity and they don t care about the constitution at all the tennessean reports tennessee is poised to make history as the first state in the nation to recognize the holy bible as its official book after nearly  minutes of debate  the state senate on monday approved the measure  sponsored by sen  steve southerland  r morristown  with a   vote  sending the legislation to gov  bill haslam s desk that s right  the state s republicans passed a bill that make a religious book the state s official book  completely ignoring the constitution s separation of church and state  as a matter of fact  tennessee attorney general herbert slatery told lawmakers that the bill is unconstitutional and they still went ahead and passed it anyway the american civil liberties union released a statement condemning lawmakers for their actions  today tennessee politicians have voted to reduce what is to many a sacred religious text to a political football  lawmakers  thinly veiled effort to promote one religion over other religions clearly violates both the united states and tennessee constitutions  as our state attorney general has already pointed out  while the bible is an important book to many state residents  tennesseans come from a rich diversity of faiths  privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the constitution  it marginalizes the tens of thousands of tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all  we call on governor haslam to veto this legislation  only one positive came out of this   if you are a cup half full kinda person   is that the gop legislators proved  without a doubt  that all of their declarations of wanting to protect everyone s religious freedom was complete and utter bullshit  like national republican lawmakers  the only thing they are concerned with is protecting their religion  they do not actually believe you have the right to worship a god different from theirs  they want everyone to be indoctrinated into christianity and they don t care what they have to do to make that happen their decision to pass this bill goes against the very freedoms our country was built upon  our founding fathers never wanted one religion to be held in higher regard than another  that s why they made sure to protect all religions in the very first amendment to our constitution  perhaps these lawmakers should try picking up an actual history book before introducing any more legislation featured image via
