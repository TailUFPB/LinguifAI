republicans talk a good game about their supporters being  responsible gun owners   as a matter of fact  to listen to them you d almost believe that every gun owner in america is super responsible  only concerned about protecting themselves and their family  however  when you turn on the news it becomes very obvious that this isn t the case at all  actually  more often than not we hear stories that sound a little something like this one out of texas a  year old girl who was wounded when a  mm gun her father was showing her discharged was in critical condition friday in a temple hospital  the girl  whose name has not been released  was struck in the left shoulder in the shooting at around   p m  thursday one officer said authorities believe the shooting was accidental let me be clear  a gun does not just discharge  period this ammosexual was showing off his gun to his  year old daughter and he shot her because he is a f cking idiot who does not know how to handle a gun  he didn t look to make sure there was not a bullet in the chamber of this gun he thought was so awesome the same people who say that all of their supporters are  responsible  also say that we want to take their guns away  first of all  we don t but if we did could you blame us  according to every town  a gun control advocacy group from december  to december   at least  children were killed in unintentional shootings   almost two each week   percent higher than federal data reflect  and even this larger number reflects just a fraction of the total number of children injured or killed with guns in the u s  each year  regardless of the intent that s an astronomical amount of kids and the right wing thinks there isn t a problem in this country  when hundreds of our kids are dying and thousands of adults are meeting the same fate in what is arguably the most powerful nation on earth  we clearly have an issue  what s worse is that the vast majority of  accidental  shootings could be prevented if people  like this father  just used common sense and took a safety course  featured image from whudat
