during the  democratic presidential primaries  rev  jesse jackson emerged as an outside viable contender for the democratic party nomination against establishment backed massachusetts governor michael dukakis  an ardent supporter of rev  jesse jackson s presidential bid was bernie sanders  who was mayor of burlington  vermont at the time during a democratic caucus in burlington  sanders gave a speech in support of jackson while many democrats in the room turned their backs as he spoke  and one woman actually slapped him in the face as sanders walked off stage  sanders helped rev  jackson win vermont against dukakis by one delegate in   although dukakis would later win the democratic presidential nomination  rev  jackson made it closer than any black person before to becoming president  bernie sanders was one of the few elected officials at the time to cross the color line and openly endorse rev  jackson over mike dukakis  his speech in support of rev  jackson had many parallels to his speeches along his own campaign trail  such as one of his signature sayings   enough is enough  sanders also praised rev  jackson for bringing together disenfranchised voters  and focusing on issues such as wealth inequality and racial injustice  jackson s  campaign platform closely resembles sanders  current campaign platform  dr  cornel west  who has been campaigning on behalf of senator sanders for several months and worked for both of rev  jackson s presidential campaigns  likened sanders as an insurgent on par with jesse jackson  but even more progressive for sanders  criticisms of wall street are more direct  jesse jackson is a serious candidate for the presidency  he was always serious  it was just that the political scientists and the other politicians who belittled his campaign  trivialized his efforts  and disdained his prospects  despite the contempt and condescension of the media   or perhaps because of it jackson went to the most remote and isolated grass roots in the american social landscape to find the strength for a campaign that has already begun to transform politics  wrote the editorial board of the publication  the nation  in its  endorsement of jesse jackson for president   for five years his distance from the funders  the managers  the mediators and the consultants who manipulate the democratic party and legitimize its candidates has allowed jackson to do unimaginable things and say unspeakable words   about race  about class  about equality and  indeed  about democracy  to an extent that may be unique in presidential elections in this century  he derives his power from the people  nearly two decades later  not much has changed in that the issues brought to the national spotlight by jesse jackson have yet to be adequately addressed by the democratic party in a meaningful way  and are rarely ever mentioned in the republican party at all bernie sanders  campaign provides hope that those inadequacies may be resolved if he wins  galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice  hundreds of thousands of americans have packed his rallies  and over  million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money   wrote the editorial board of the nation in its  endorsement of sanders for president   sanders s clarion call for fundamental reform single payer healthcare  tuition free college  a   an hour minimum wage  the breaking up of the big banks  ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes has inspired working people across the country  the relationship between bernie sanders and rev  jesse jackson has started to become more public in response to criticisms from hillary clinton supporters that sanders would somehow be less effective in fighting for civil rights and racial justice  clinton s lead in south carolina is dependent on maintaining her support with the black community  who make up about half of democratic voters in the state  but that relationship was somewhat strained after her loss there in  was cited by her husband  bill clinton  as due to barack obama being another black candidate like jesse jackson  who won the state in  in an interview with the hill  rev  jesse jackson said he had no plans to endorse any democratic presidential candidate  as he has a history of working with both bernie sanders and hillary clinton  an endorsement would also likely have negative implications regarding support for his rainbow push coalition despite his neutrality  jackson did defend bernie sanders from criticism over his civil rights record recently in an interview with the daily caller  bernie was fighting back in chicago not in the deep south   in affordable housing struggles in chicago   jackson said   the movement was so broad based  there were civil rights leaders in chicago  jackson referred to a smear tactic employed by journalists and media sensationalists to skew a response from civil rights hero  congressman john lewis  d ga   rep  lewis responded to a reporter s inquiry that he never saw or met bernie sanders during the civil rights movement  but the response was taken out of context to infer lewis suggested bernie sanders was not involved in the civil rights movement or was exaggerating his involvement  having heard rep  lewis speak a few months ago and interviewing him in person afterwards  i knew an accusation or character attack of that nature from the congressman was highly unlikely  congressman lewis clarified the remarks were not meant to be taken as any sort of criticism or allegations  featured image via flickr
