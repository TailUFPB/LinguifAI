two of the men involved in the armed standoff in oregon have been caught falsely claiming to have served in the marines  an investigation shows the two have committed stolen valor  one of the men  brian cavalier  is the personal bodyguard to ammon bundy and has told reporters that he served in both iraq and afghanistan  here s the problem  the us marine corps has no record of his service  that s because he was never enlisted  the other man  blaine cooper  also claimed to be a marine  but he was only in the  delayed entry program   he dropped out before actually going to boot camp a more in depth look reveals that cavalier is just a tattoo artist  and not only that  but the only record he has is a rap sheet full of dui s and theft   nothing even affiliated with the military  that s what police records show  anyhow  it appears he faked his military credentials so he would be more credible to serve in the oregon gang and get more street cred here was the encounter brian cavalier had with reporters  who hilariously goes by the nickname  raging unicorn  i m a retired united states marine  i can rage  he also tried to sound ex military when one journalist asked to access the refuge building  stating boldly  no  that s logistical security issues that we can t have happen  head count can t be divulged for security purposes  when he was later confronted about his false claims  and that the us marine corps had confirmed that he was in fact never a marine  he reportedly got very nervous  saying  that s unfortunate that someone would say that  i m not commenting on anything  i told you what it is  pic via latest no service member who served would ever cower away like that  but  his reply wasn t needed  these guys are fakes   the evidence already proves that  while claiming to have served in the military isn t technically against the law  it s not respectful to the men and women who actually did risk their lives for their country  the  stolen valor act only makes it unlawful if someone falsely claims to have received an award or commendation to receive some form of compensation  neither of these men violated that with that said   we have a feeling stolen valor isn t going to be as much of an issue when the fbi presses federal charges against them when this is all over and done with  that much is guaranteed featured image via screen capture
