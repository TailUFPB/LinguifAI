echoing statements made by donald trump about fences and unwanted mexicans coming to america  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu wants to build a fence around israel and the occupied palestinian territories in order to protect the country  from what he says are  wild beasts   in reference to palestinians  arabs  and black african migrants  who the israelis find especially scary  during a tour of the jordan israel border in the south netanyahu said  in our neighborhood  we need to protect ourselves from wild beasts  at the end of the day as i see it  there will be a fence like this one surrounding israel in its entirety  we will surround the entire state of israel with a fence  a barrier  he said the plan will take several years to complete and israel will also look at ways to ensure that the palestinians don t find ways to escape from the walls that have been built around their cities and villages in the illegally occupied west bank and gaza strip  netanyahu said  this thing costs many billions  and we re working on a multi year plan of prioritization so it would be spread out over years in order to gradually build it  but to complete it to defend the state of israel  his assertion to defend israel is not the reason he s building a fence  about   of the wall is actually built inside the occupied palestinian west bank  effectively annexing and stealing   of the land  the wall was ruled illegal by the international court of justice in  yet israel has failed to dismantle it   trump has also pledged to build walls along the   mile border with mexico  a campaign pledge that has apparently caught on with republican voters   trump said   i would build a great wall  and nobody builds walls better than me  believe me  and i ll build them very inexpensively  i will build a great  great wall on our southern border  and i will have mexico pay for that wall  mark my words  the abrasive personality traits are striking but the plans are dangerous  we can already see what netanyahu s policies have done to the palestinians  he is a war criminal pure and simple  if trump were to become president of  the most powerful country in the history of the world  the us and the rest of the world have a very bleak future featured image via screenshot capture
