nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than sen  tom cotton  r ak   the tea party republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between president obama and iran s government  his ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves  until now on the night of the state of the union  cotton went on cnn s  situation room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about president obama  even while a difficult situation was unfolding in iran  on tuesday evening  the navy announced that two of its ships  and  u s  sailors  were being held by the iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory conservatives rapidly lost their minds  even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and  in all likelihood  harmless the americans were on a training mission in the persian gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into iranian waters  according to the pentagon  iranian coast guard boats brought the vessels to a revolutionary guard base on farsi island  officials said u s  officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided  not captured  by iranian forces  there doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side   according to a u s  official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly  no big deal  right  in fact  the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the united states and iran is cooling off  thanks to president obama s commitment to negotiations not as sen  cotton tells it  speaking straight into the camera  cotton spews lie after lie  his only agenda  to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from iran in labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage   cotton is viciously lying about the troops  they weren t taken by force  they aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory  their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by iranian ships  they never surrendered  the united states was never asked to  apologize  to the iranians but by fear mongering to score political points  cotton does risk inflaming tensions  not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep  dark cavity where cotton s brain allegedly lives  it s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of iran is too much to ask for a republican who is hell bent on painting the middle eastern country as a dangerous enemy as usual  american soldiers are being used by a republican to serve his agenda  secretary of state john kerry couldn t do an interview with cnn  even if it might have helped democrats in the polls  he was too busy talking personally with iranian officials  coordinating the release of these soldiers so going into tonight s state of the union  where rhetoric on both sides will be high  ask yourself this  which politician  supports  the troops more  the one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely feature image via youtube
