the plot thickens if you ever needed any more proof that donald trump s campaign is in bed with white supremacists look no further than the anti hillary meme trump posted on his twitter account on saturday morning trump stirred national outrage and was accused of anti semitism after posting a meme declaring that hillary clinton has made history by being the  most corrupt candidate ever  complete with a star of david though he posted the meme  donald trump isn t the one who created it  as it turns out  white supremacists are responsible for it according to mic  the image was previously featured on  pol    an internet message board for the alt right  a digital movement of neo nazis  anti semites  and white supremacists newly emboldened by the success of trump s rhetoric  as early as june   over a week before trump s team tweeted it  further research led mic directly to a twitter account that  regularly tweets violent racist memes commenting on the state of geopolitical politics  mic also notes that the file name of the meme on the message board could be a  nod to the neo nazi code for  hh   or  heilhitler   which the alt right is fond of hiding in plain sight  so trump and his campaign literally tweeted a meme that was created by nazis and white supremacists  those groups must be beaming with pride now after their leader shared their hateful work  by the time trump removed the meme and replaced the star of david with a circle the original meme had been shared   times meanwhile  former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski defended the republican nominee by calling the outrage over the meme  political correctness run amok  the bottom line is this is political correctness run amok  if this were to be a star next to hillary clinton without the cash behind it  no one would be questioning this   he claimed  he also argued that it was the same star used by sheriffs but the fact that the meme was created by neo nazis makes it clear that the star shape was meant to attack jews as much as the meme was an attack on hillary clinton  and either the trump campaign failed to do any research about where the meme came from or they knew exactly who created it and shared it anyway to appease the white supremacist supporters of his campaign featured image via twitter
