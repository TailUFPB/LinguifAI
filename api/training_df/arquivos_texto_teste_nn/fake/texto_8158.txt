something extraordinary happened that is certain to have republicans and republican voters everywhere furious   fox news just admitted that the united states deficit is at its lowest level since   that s right  since the last republican was in office  you have to admit  this must have taken a lot of courage on the behalf of fox news to admit something like this  it goes directly against their  bash president obama for everything  policy however  there it is  in bold print on foxbusiness com they even published this  which will make every republican that follows fox news as a religion and believe without question  do a double take  the u s  ran a budget surplus in january  dropping the annual deficit to its lowest level since august   the treasury department said wednesday the u s  deficit fell to   billion over the  month period ended january  or around    of gross domestic product  boosted by a   billion surplus in january  the deficit figure was down from the year earlier   billion  or    of gdp   quite a change of heart when fox news actually sees the results of obama s actions  unlike how they behaved years ago after the president first took office  which you can view here  when they completely ignored deficit reduction fox business even explained how the reduction in deficit was achieved  revenues stood around   above their year earlier levels  while outlays were around   higher  receipts of   billion collected by the treasury was a record for the month of january the latest report showed annual revenues posted their slowest rate of growth since august   corporate tax receipts for the fiscal year  which began oct     ran around   below their year earlier level  individual taxes withheld by employers and payroll tax revenues were up    while other individual taxes  such as capital gains  were   higher  funny how when you have a president that truly believes in math  they can actually achieve success in regards to deficit reduction  and understands that in order to pay for things  we need revenue coming in  republicans have yet to figure that out now  if only we could get republicans to actually look at the presidents latest budget  which as of now  they have simply refused to even entertain the gop is literally a vomit stain on the rug of america that we can t seem to remove featured image from flickr
