self proclaimed  fiscal conservative  tim allen cracked a joke about president obama at the conclusion of the show last man standing on friday  and let s just say  not only was it not funny  but it wasn t exactly substantiated in fact either here s what he had to say  so  if you re a young person not exactly sure where life is taking you  that s okay  we can t all be barack obama and have our first job be president  in case tim allen wasn t aware  here s a full list of every single job president obama has had before being elected  we can assure you  being president wasn t his first  not by a long shot tim allen may think he s funny  but unfortunately for him  his joke isn t even close to being even halfway true  but  while we re on the subject perhaps we should discuss one of tim allen s first jobs  typically  we wouldn t bring up somebody s past in such a light  but allen brought it up first  in   allen was arrested for cocaine possession and almost spent life in prison  and  it was no small amount   he had over  grams on him  that s a lot of columbian snow  does allen really want to compare his list of previous jobs with the president  we didn t think so this wasn t the first time allen has used jokes on the show to make fun of president obama  either  back in october  he blamed obama for not being able to have a pit underneath his car  we must admit  this joke  however  was kind of funny  it helped that jay leno was on the show  backing him up  you have a pit  i ve always wanted a pit  you can t have a pit these days  cause of zoning laws   because of  obama  tim allen has repeatedly gone on television and proclaimed himself to be a conservative and every single time he has showed us how little he actually knows  one of his most recent talk show appearances was when he went on sean hannity and discussed his story on why he considers himself to be a conservative  i like problem solving  and a lot of it is about how are we going to pay for this  in my neighborhood  we wanted to put in trees   but  here in communist california it s difficult because there are so many regulations  perhaps tim should do some fact checking first the next time he decides to talk about  fiscal conservativism   according to the atlantic  a conservative publication  gop presidents have been the worst contributors to the federal debt  just take a look at the chart below  the last four republican presidents all significantly contributed to the national debt numbers don t lie  but people do pic via the atlanticfeatured image via screen capture
