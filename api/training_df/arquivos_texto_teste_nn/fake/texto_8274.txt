as usual  donald trump s support only goes as far as who he thinks supports him  after a week of claiming he was rooting for peyton manning and the denver broncos in the super bowl  he shamelessly switched sides to the carolina panthers after his arch rival jeb bush claimed manning as his own during the republican debate  a smug looking jeb bush announced that  peyton manning is supporting me  and i m for denver  he wasn t kidding  manning has reportedly donated the maximum amount      to bush s campaign  that had to sting the other candidates  because manning is a well known conservative who loves throwing cash at his favorite politicians  he gave money to george w  bush during his re election campaign in   gave   to mitt romney in   and regularly gives checks to republican politicians in his home state of tennessee  his brother and fellow nfl quarterback eli manning also maxed out a contribution to jeb bush this was an embarrassing moment for trump  who up until last week was boasting about manning who is donald trump pulling for in super bowl   https   t co   face the nation   facethenation  january    i ll stick with peyton   said trump at the time  just one week before he very much didn t stick with peyton both trump and bush s other rival  marco rubio  appeared openly bitter about manning during the debate  while trump let his flip flop speak for itself  rubio noted that he  was rooting for peyton manning  but now i m rooting for carolina  as addicting info s oliver willis recently reported  it s not just peyton  the denver broncos organization  like many football teams  is itself a massive backer of the gop according to the center for responsive politics  the broncos have donated    to conservative candidates and political committees  by comparison the carolina panthers have given    to support the right  while both teams have also contributed to liberal candidates  the numbers are much smaller      for the broncos     for the panthers it s fun to watch how quickly trump will turn on a person who so recently praised just because he can t get anything from him or her  it s clear that trump s opinions about people change at the whims of his fragile ego feature image via flickr papa johns
