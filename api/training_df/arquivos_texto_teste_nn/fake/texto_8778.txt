you might ve noticed that donald trump didn t really care for president obama s final state of the union address  during the address  the billionaire twitter troll noted the following the  sotu speech is really boring  slow  lethargic   very hard to watch   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     first of all  state of the union addresses aren t supposed to be like president camacho s speech in idiocracy  in fact  they re not supposed to be like literally any of trump s nonsensical  lie filled  stream of consciousness pander shows also  trump s talking about obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history but here s another explanation for trump s ridiculous tweet  hours earlier  trump held another one of his spoken word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish  frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait  correction  he s not satirizing anyone  on purpose  during the address  trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored trump from the crowd in addition to pretending to support trump  jason selvig and davram stiefler began to get restless  eventually shouting  boring   and  we re bored  we came here to be entertained   at the presumptive republican nominee  naturally  trump can dish it out but he can t take it so  reacting to the comedians  trump gestured to his security and muttered   get  em outta here  if only we could do the same to trump so  like so many others before him  the comedians were escorted out of the room  of course  this brings up yet another example of trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like  while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to putin and isis frankly  after obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer  i m shocked trump didn t come out against curing cancer featured image via video screen grab
