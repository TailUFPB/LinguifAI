there s no doubt about it  trump and his campaign are in full meltdown mode  if he were a nuclear power plant  he d be chernobyl s number four reactor in the early stages of its spectacularly horrific failure panicked republicans are openly calling for the rnc to pull trump s funding and send it into down ticket races  trump himself  despite being a narcissistic jagoff  is starting to beg for help in places like ohio and  oddly enough  utah and time has captured everything about this in one beautifully accurate cover trump should hate this time magazine cover  but he ll probably hang it in his office https   t co  pic twitter com   chris cillizza   thefix  august    has gone into some depth on what s happened in trump s camp  they go beyond listing the obvious  like the thinly veiled threat to hillary clinton  his bizarrely ridiculous claim that obama founded isis  on which he later doubled down   his childish feud with a gold star family  and his equally childish refusal to endorse paul ryan  john mccain and kelly ayotte in their re election bids  among other things he s now anywhere from six to fifteen points behind hillary nationally in the polls  and trails her badly in several key swing states  his atrocious approach to running for president isn t just costing him deep red utah  it s also throwing other traditionally red states  like georgia  into play time points out  correctly  that trump doesn t understand that the people who attend and cheer at his rallies aren t going to be the people who decide this election  there s a solid chance that he s incapable of understanding that   his ego won t let him  in jacksonville  he actually said  i don t know why we re not leading by a lot  he could stand to look in the mirror  but he needs a magic mirror to see the truth  he still thinks he s infallible  and that the turnouts at his rallies  along with his twitter supporters  are accurate indicators of how the country as a whole sees him  so he looks at the polls and finds himself baffled at how he could possibly be losing after all  he only tells the truth  pardon us while we laugh hysterically  for hillary  this is awesome news  she needs the next  days to be all about trump and his meltdown  and that s what s happening  trump may love the spotlight  but he doesn t like the spotlight to be so negative  time has him on their cover  but in a very negative and unflattering light in short  they ve highlighted a meltdown he s only now beginning to realize  if not understand  and when he finally comes to terms with it  his ego will feel nothing but total humiliation featured image by joe raedle getty images
