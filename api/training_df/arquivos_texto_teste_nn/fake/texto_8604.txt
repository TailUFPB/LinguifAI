jeffrey cohen was a man who believed the meaning of life is  oops    according to his obituary  the  year old pennsylvania man passed away sunday morning at his childhood home in squirrel hill  a suburb of pittsburgh  he was a person who  took pride in being the only jewish cowboy that he knew of   and an accomplished chiropractor   one who treated gold medal winning olympians  members of the pittsburgh ballet  professional boxers  and many of the pittsburgh steelers throughout his career  even  weird al  yankovich stopped by to see him he is described as  compassionate and kind    someone who would  always put others before himself  happily and without hesitation   his love of dirty and  groan inducing  jokes was legendary  he also has one final request of those who love him and all who read his obituary   don t f ck up the next election  or at least do some good in the world jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers  please do not vote for donald trump   also acceptable   donations to the nimmo educational foundation   www nimmoed org   or a charity of your choice   that s right   to honor his memory  cohen asks one simple thing  don t vote for trump  don t throw away our future his obituary does not indicate whom he would choose as president  but he doesn t want people to vote for someone who would ban muslims from entering the united states  throw them into concentration camps  after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special badges  of course   or any of the multitude of horrific ideas the brain gerbils that reside beneath his hairpiece suggest  cohen doesn t want a  big beautiful wall  running the length of our  southern  border  nor does he want someone who would allow sarah palin to speak this request is the opposite of an obituary request that popped up earlier this month when a virginia man asked   in lieu of flowers please vote for donald trump   the billionaire tweeted the obituary  declaring thanking the deceased man and declaring him to be  a great person   it seems as though cohen made this request as a light hearted retort to the trump fan s suggestion that americans vote for someone who would later be endorsed by sarah palin thank you so much  earnest must have been a great person  https   t co  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    is highly doubtful that trump will say the same of cohen while no thinking individual would vote for trump anyway  if you are considering voting for trump  think about honoring this cohen s dying wish instead  we don t need to  make america great again   america is already great but we can make it better by voting blue in november featured image via legacy youtube
