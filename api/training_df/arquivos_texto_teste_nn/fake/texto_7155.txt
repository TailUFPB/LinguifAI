fortune released their  the world s  most disappointing leaders  list on march   coming in at number one on the list is michigan s republican governor rick snyder fortune gave snyder the  don t blame me  i m just the governor award  for his failures over his handling of the flint water crisis  fortune writes snyder and his team sparked national outrage after an attempt at cost savings left the impoverished city of flint  mich  with a lead tainted water supply that is being blamed for illness and brain damage  especially among its youngest residents  called to testify before congress  snyder  who touted his competence in his gubernatorial campaign  labeled the experience the  most humbling  of his life then attempted to shift blame  he described it as a  failure of government  and blasted the environmental protection agency for its  dumb and dangerous  rules on allowable amounts of lead in water systems because you don t win an award like that and not offer a response  ari adler  a spokesman for snyder  said that snyder is concerned with  fixing problems  not internet polls   the rank of each leader received was based on internet votes  though  the  leaders in the poll were chosen by fortune s editorial staff adler also said  the decision on whether to use corrosion control in the flint water supply was not about saving money  but rather was a mistake made by bureaucrats who misinterpreted a flawed federal rule  gov  snyder is the only leader at all levels of government involved in the flint water crisis who has been willing to stand up and apologize  take responsibility for what happened on his watch  and tackle the problems head on to fix what happened in flint and fix the system that caused it to happen  it s responses like this that make one wonder how much money snyder has wasted after he hired two pr firms while the nation raged against him  you can t say that you have accepted responsibility for a crisis right after you blame other people for that crisis there is also the fact that the flint water crisis did not happen in a bubble  it happened while the snyder administration worked fervently to erode democracy in michigan  it happened while detroit s and other communities school systems and critical infrastructure were left to ruin that s why snyder s sorry not sorry is even more disingenuous than it might seem at first glance  he has at no point even acknowledged that his administration s system wide dismantlement of local governments and austerity measurements that have proven to be fatal  have anything to do with the crisis  the only thing snyder kind of but not really acknowledges is that his administration is in charge and  therefore  shares some of the responsibility for the flint water crisis on the basis of snyder being michigan s figurehead so here s to snyder s latest achievement  let it be the first of many featured image    photo by brett carlsen getty images
