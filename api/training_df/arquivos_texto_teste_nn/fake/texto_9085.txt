as  comes to a close  we d like to acknowledge our gratitude to president trump  who is truly a gift to america  he came at a time when we needed him most  he came at a time when we the people were watching our freedoms and rights being stripped away by an out of control government  he came at a time when educators were teaching our youth that america was the enemy  he came at a time when american citizens were being forced to cede our country to unvetted foreign invaders and illegal aliens in exchange for democrat party votes  he came at a time when democrats  celebrities  and the media were shaming gun owners and christians for their conservative beliefs  and where daring to say  merry christmas  was a borderline punishable offense  he gave up a successful business and time spent with his close knit family to step into a hornet s nest like no one could ever have imagined  but he did it because he believed in the greatness of america  and in defending that greatness  no matter the personal cost  that s what makes his new years tweet so perfect president trump took time tonight  to wish his supporters   enemies   the very dishonest fake news media  and even his  haters  a  happy and healthy    as we say goodbye to an incredibly successful   led by an incredibly successful president  we d like to thank president trump for the incredible sacrifices he s made on behalf of every american  even those who don t yet understand  to make america great again president trump tweeted   as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter  i want to wish all of my friends  supporters  enemies  haters  and even the very dishonest fake news media  a happy and healthy new year   will be a great year for america  as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter  i want to wish all of my friends  supporters  enemies  haters  and even the very dishonest fake news media  a happy and healthy new year   will be a great year for america   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    a special tribute to president trump  as he wraps up his unbelievably successful first year  we d like to share this powerful article  written by evan sayet  the article brilliantly explains why america loves the  fighter  donald j  trump  he fightsmy leftist friends  as well as many ardent  nevertrumpers  constantly ask me if i m not bothered by donald trump s lack of decorum  they ask if i don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office   here s my answer we right thinking people have tried dignity  there could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than george w  bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency  we tried statesmanship  could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as john mccain  we tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than mitt romney  and the results were always the same this is because  while we were playing by the rules of dignity  collegiality and propriety  the left has been  for the past  years  engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of saul alinsky and the chicago mob i don t find anything  dignified    collegial  or  proper  about barack obama s lying about what went down on the streets of ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the democratic party  i don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four americans in benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks  i don t see anything  statesman like  in weaponizing the irs to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent  yes  obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified    collegial  or  proper  the left has been engaged in a war against america since the rise of the children of the    to them  it has been an all out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale  it has been a war they ve fought with violence  the threat of violence  demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take over of the universities   till today the problem is  through these years  the left has been the only side fighting this war  while the left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way  the right has continued to act with dignity  collegiality  and propriety with donald trump  this all has come to an end  donald trump is america s first wartime president in the culture war during wartime  things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors  ulysses grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the army for conduct unbecoming  had abraham lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted grant  the democrats might well still be holding their slaves today  lincoln rightly recognized that  i cannot spare this man  he fights  general george patton was a vulgar talking  son of a bitch  in peacetime  this might have seen him stripped of rank  but  had franklin roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum  then hitler and the socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand year reich trump is fighting  and what s particularly delicious is that  like patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated rommel s  he s shouting   you magnificent bastards  i read your book   that is just the icing on the cake  but it s wonderful to see that not only is trump fighting  he s defeating the left using their own tactics that book is saul alinsky s rules for radicals   a book so essential to the liberals  war against america that it is and was the playbook for the entire obama administration and the subject of hillary clinton s senior thesis  it is a book of such pure evil  that  just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted  alinsky dedicated his book to lucifer trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but  in reality  he is doing exactly what alinsky suggested his followers do  first  instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past  years not just wrong  but diametrically opposed to the truth  from the tet offensive to benghazi  to what really happened on the streets of ferguson  missouri   trump has isolated cnn  he made it personal  then  just as alinsky suggests  he employs ridicule which alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all  everyone gets that it s not just cnn   in fact  in a world where al sharpton and rachel maddow  paul krugman and nicholas kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than cnn s   cnn is just a piker most importantly  trump s tweets have put cnn in an untenable and unwinnable position  with trump s ability to go around them  they cannot simply stand pat  they need to respond  this leaves them with only two choices they can either  go high   as hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth  and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery the problem for cnn  et al   with the former is  if they were to start honestly reporting the news  that would be the end of the democratic party they serve  it is nothing but the incessant use of fake news  read  propaganda  that keeps the left alive  imagine  for example  if cnn had honestly and accurately reported then candidate barack obama s close ties to foreign terrorists  rashid khalidi   domestic terrorists  william ayers   the mafia  tony rezko  or the true evils of his spiritual mentor  jeremiah wright s  church imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the obama administration s weaponizing of the irs to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of ambassador christopher stevens and the obama administration s cover up  this makes  going high  a non starter for cnn  this leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news  conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting  hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than nixon  this  obviously  is what cnn has chosen to do  the problem is  as they become more and more hysterical  they become more and more obvious  each new effort at even faker news than before  and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that trump is and always has been right about the fake news media and  by causing their hysteria  trump has forced them into numerous  highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes  thus  in their desperation  they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that  even with the liberal  lower case  l   libel laws protecting the media  they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly their flailing at trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality  with cnn using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an internet meme  this threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him  if it were  there would have been no reason for cnn to have made their  deal  with him public instead  cnn   playing by  chicago rules    was sending a message to any and all  dissent will not be tolerated  this heavy handed and hysterical response to a joke on the internet has backfired on cnn  giving rise to only more righteous ridicule so  to my friends on the left   and the  nevertrumpers as well   do i wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper   of course  i do  these aren t those times  this is war  and it s a war that the left has been fighting without opposition for the past  years so  say anything you want about this president   i get it  he can be vulgar  he can be crude  he can be undignified at times  i don t care  i can t spare this man  he fights townhall published this brilliant article on july     it was written by conservative author and pundit evan sayet  who is the
