long story short  a republican member of the house has filed an amendment to block the united states treasury  which is responsible for monetary transactions in this country  from putting harriet tubman on the   bill but it has nothing to do with race whatsoever  the republican says  of course not rep  steve king is the one behind the amendment  you know  the guy who says mexican immigrants have calves the size of cantaloupes because they smuggle so many drugs into the country  he s totally not racist  and wants you know why  pulling a   out of his pocket  the congressman from iowa declares  it s not about harriet tubman  it s about keeping the picture on the    y know  why would you want to change that  i am a conservative  i like to keep what we have  but the congressman didn t stop while he was ahead  naturally  he went on to say something incredibly stupid  adding that putting women or people of color to our currency was actually in of itself sexist and racist  and of course blamed liberals for political correctness  here s what s really happening  this is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories  and he s divided us on the lines of groups    this is a divisive proposal on the part of the president  and mine s unifying  it says just don t change anything  dear congressman  putting a black woman  an abolitionist  on our currency isn t divisive  trying to block a federal agency by withholding money  because you oppose a black woman being on currency  is divisive king then accused president obama of  disrupting civilization  over the decision so not only is he a flaming racist  he s a total drama queen luckily the rules committee refused floor consideration of the overtly racist amendment  with trump in his back pocket  house speaker paul ryan can t afford to indulge another racist featured image via scott olson getty images
