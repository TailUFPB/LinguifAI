while there have been what seems like dozens of republican debates  one stands on its own as the one trump didn t attend  that debate happened in january  and in lieu of attending  trump held a rally that was supposed to raise money for veterans  unfortunately  though  half the   million raised never got to the veterans and no one knows where it is the trump campaign said the event raised   million for different veterans groups  with trump himself contributing   million  but details released by the campaign thursday show only about half of that money has been dispersed so far the campaign did not provide specifics earlier this week  but after a cnn report aired thursday morning questioning the contributions  a spokeswoman shared a list in the afternoon showing  veterans organizations that have received a total of    million to date the campaign promised that it was no big deal and that the veterans would get the money as soon as they figured it out  well  several months have passed  and the missing   million is still missing  all they have now is deflection  if the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated  rather than trying to disparage mr  trump s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation  we would all be better for it    campaign spokeswoman hope  hicks said thursday when asked about the money by cnn s chris cuomo  the network s drew griffin said we found the same thing that you found chris  a lot of promises and not a lot of answers and it just shouldn t be that hard  number one in the big scheme of things it s just not that much money and the accounting is not that difficult to do here s a video from cnn some experts say that this isn t that unusual  that it often takes a few months before large donations make it to their destination  but others say that the veterans organizations should have been paid by now  the bigger question  though  is where the hell is the money whether this is an innocent mistake or something much worse  it doesn t bode well for the trump campaign  but few are covering this  trump is a terrible money manager  he has filed bankruptcy a whopping four times and he promised to do the same with the united states  of course  even if every one of trump s supporters were to read this  they wouldn t care  hell  he could steal money right out of veterans  hands  and they wouldn t care  it s just like obama derangement syndrome  and clinton derangement syndrome   only the exact opposite featured image via christopher furlong getty images
