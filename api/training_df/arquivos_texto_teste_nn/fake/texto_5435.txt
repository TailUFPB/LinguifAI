on saturday  paul ryan posted a photo to his instagram  the photo was a mass selfie of a large group of capitol hill interns  it wasn t long before social media commentators noticed something very wrong with the photo in his post  ryan wrote  i think this sets a record for the most number of  capitolhill interns in a single selfie   speakerselfie  so here s the photo photo via instagramthat s a huge sea of white people  now  i am sure that the interns shown in the photo have worked very hard to get to where they are  however  it is very problematic to see that the people who aid lawmakers don t even come close to representing the united states  screenshot from instagramscreenshot from instagramthis isn t just a matter of one photo inaccurately describing the racial makeup of congressional aides  according to a report released in  by the joint center for political and economic studies  minorities are severely underrepresented on the capital hill  one of the key findings of the report is that  although people of color make up over  percent of the u s  population and over  percent of the citizen voting age population  they represent only   percent of top senate staffers   they report also says that    senate offices representing states with large hispanic and africanamerican populations hire few senior staffers of color  commentators quickly made the connection between the lack of diversity in the photo and the gop  autopsy report  that concluded that the republican party is going to go extinct if they do not reach out to minorities and try to get them to join their ranks republicans hate hiring mandates but they sure know how to make a case for them  as we can clearly see from the photo featured image from screenshot via instagram
