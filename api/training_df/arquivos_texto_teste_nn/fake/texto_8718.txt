rep  mo brooks  r al    a congressman who at one time cracked jokes about shooting undocumented immigrants   has recently called president barack obama out for being  the most racially divisive president  america s had since slavery brooks  who happens to be the chairman of gop presidential candidate ted cruz s alabama leadership team  made these comments during a radio interview on the dale jackson show on thursday  commenting on the president s state of the union speech  the alabama republican said  there probably has not been a more racially divisive  economically divisive  president in the white house since we had presidents who supported slavery  host dale jackson pressed brooks to clarify what exactly he meant   considering that obama is the nation s first black president   and brooks  explanation threw obama a bone for not being the absolute worst president in the entire history of the united states   just within the last  years  we did have presidents in the first  to  years of our country that supported slavery  you cannot say barack obama was worse than them  but he s probably the worst one since the civil war and the passages of the     and  amendments  you can listen to the recording of the show below  later in the show  jackson commented on how much racial tensions have become a focal point in the political arena  and brooks accused obama and democrats of using race and sex to divide americans  to a level of perfection not heretofore seen  in true gop fashion  brooks chose not to give specific reasons why obama was  racially divisive    but his civil war comment means that he s forgotten quite a bit about history  and how racist some of america s presidents from the last  years were  to say that obama is more racially divisive than post civil war presidents such as andrew jackson  rutherford hayes  woodrow wilson and even george w  bush is absolutely ridiculous brooks should know a bit about being racially divisive himself   he s made several racist statements in the past  for example  there was that time he said syrian refugees wanted a  paid vacation   spread lies about obama s childhood past in indonesia  blamed a measles outbreak on  illegal aliens   and stated that obama s immigration policy was based on  skin pigmentation  featured image via listerhill credit union   flickr
