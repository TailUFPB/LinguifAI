the american freedom party  afp   a third way  white nationalist fascist party  is claiming members of its organization are trump delegates  last week  william johnson  an attorney and delegate to trump  was outed as the president of the afp white nationalist and subsequently resigned his position mother jones  who broke the story on johnson  obtained a screenshot of a quickly deleted facebook post from the afp highlighting the breaking story  in which a commenter says   mother jones  this page is liberal nonsense   the afp then commented   of course they are but here is what they don t know  we have more delegates  johnson told mother jones that he himself knows of one other afp member being selected by a state party to attend the rnc  and that he is an honorary delegate but kept his identity secret johnson said there are additional white nationalist trump delegates who have been in touch with movement leaders  though  i don t actually know who they are  there are people who are surreptitious   he said  right now people are still a little bit afraid because they will have the same reaction that happened to me   johnson explained   we just have to give it a few more months before people feel comfortable  with trump garnering   delegates  so far   there s no telling how many of them are affiliated with the afp or any other white nationalist association  seeing as though one delegate has been outed as a white nationalist and another a pedophile  the public should expect more  comfortable  bigots and weirdos to be outed  so far  according to johnson  there are at least a handful or more white nationalists picking the candidate for a major party candidate after mother jones broke the story on this  rachel maddow got hold of it  further spotlighting that the trump campaign may actually be filled with even more racist bigots than previously thought more trump supporters are doing their part to  make america great again  featured image via ramin talaie getty images
