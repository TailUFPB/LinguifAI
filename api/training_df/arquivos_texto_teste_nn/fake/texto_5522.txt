there is nothing that donald trump  our resident narcissist in chief  loves more than promoting himself following a tragedy  to that end  he contacted the nypd to address a roll call following the shootings in dallas  presumably to get pictures that show just how much he supports our law enforcement officers  and garner more support and donations to send back to his own businesses  nypd commissioner bill bratton  though  said they slapped him down hard for that  we don t allow the department to be politicized  and inasmuch as he is engaged in a political campaign  that would be a politicizing of the department  but he s donald trump  the real estate magnate  he s the bestest  strongest  most leader y candidate we ve got  a photo op isn t politicizing  it s publicly showing support  he probably would want them to throw a ticker tape parade for him afterward  too  to properly display their gratitude for his amazing  ongoing support to be sure  bratton would have turned hillary clinton down  too  if she d asked for the same thing  she did call the nypd to speak to them following dallas  unlike king donnie  however  she just wanted to speak with them   she didn t also want to grandstand with them as her personal props bratton also spoke to the press on friday about the trumpeter in chief s request  our interest is staying out of the politics of the moment  and not to provide photo ops   he told reporters   if mr  trump wants to speak to me  i would be happy to brief him on what we re doing  if sen  clinton wants to speak to me  i would very happy to brief her on what we re doing  but we are not in the business of providing photo ops for our candidates  of course  king dunce s campaign is denying that they ever sent the request  probably to cover for the horrible embarrassment of being rejected  you just don t reject king dunce for anything if you want to be treated  fairly  after he becomes president dunce photo of bill bratton by kena betancur getty images  photo of donald trump by drew angerer getty images  images cropped and merged by rika christensen
