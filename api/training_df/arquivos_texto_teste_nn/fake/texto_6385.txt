tea party radio host and lieutenant governor of texas dan patrick has officially made the stupidest move yet in regards to  bathroom rules  in our schools  patrick declared that texas was prepared to forego literally billions of dollars in federal education funding rather than allow transgender children to use the bathroom  we will not be blackmailed by the president s  pieces of silver   patrick ignorantly announced  the  we  he refers to are rich elected republicans that can afford to send their kids to private schools  not mentioned by any republican is whether millions of texas parents and children that are completely dependent on the public school system are also prepared to have their entire school system essentially shut down this isn t just some minor budget readjustment and  tightening of belts  by teachers and school districts  this is totally defunding the educations of   million students who rely on federal money to attend an already desperately underfunded public school system in texas as of now  the issue of school bathroom use is inevitably headed towards our court system  the legal question is whether or not the federal government can continue using the civil rights act to force schools to allow children to use the bathroom with which they feel comfortable according to interpretation by the justice department  title  of the civil rights act does allow for the federal government to prohibit discrimination based on gender in public schools that receive federal funding if the courts find in favor of the federal government  which it is very likely they will  the president can then try to use the cutting off of federal funds in order to get state compliance on the law the white house was asked about the texas lt  governor s comments  press secretary josh earnest said   this does underscore the risk of electing a right wing radio host to a statewide elected office   truer words were never spoken featured image via brietbart
