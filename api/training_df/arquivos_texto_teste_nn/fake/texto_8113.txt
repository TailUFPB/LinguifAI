conservatives would be so pissed if this actually happened in what would perhaps be the most entertaining supreme court nominating process in american history  a petition is circulating asking president obama to nominate anita hill to replace recently deceased justice antonin scalia on the bench hill is most remembered for her courageous testimony against current supreme court justice clarence thomas during his confirmation hearings in   hill testified that thomas made unwanted sexual advances toward her during his stint as supervisor at the department of education  despite her passing a lie detector test while he refused to take one  the senate still confirmed thomas   in the narrowest margin since the  after other women were denied the chance to testify in support of hill thomas and his conservative supporters  of course  demonized hill  accusing her of being used by white liberals to cut down an  uppity black  with a  high tech lynching  but while hill may seem to be a controversial choice to fill scalia s seat on the high court  it s not out of the realm of possibility  nor does she lack the qualifications hill is an experienced attorney who also serves as university professor of social policy  law  and women s studies at brandeis university  the  year old attended oklahoma state university and yale law school  she is one of the most prominent experts in her field and certainly possesses the legal and academic chops to serve on the supreme court furthermore  there has never been an african american woman on the court  which makes this an opportunity to make history with a much needed change  what better way to replace a racist misogynist like scalia than with an educated black woman who specializes in social policy not only that  just imagine how uncomfortable her nomination would make clarence thomas feel  he d probably be sweating bullets while watching and hoping the nomination process eliminates her as the nominee  and it would be incredibly hard for conservatives to grill her without reminding the american public of how big of creep thomas is  and if republicans are too hard on her  they can be the ones accused of a  high tech lynching  of an  uppity black  woman as they let their sexism and racism fly during hearings that would would likely be nationally televised and strewn across social media and even if hill fails to be confirmed  it would make republicans look like the terrible lawmakers and human beings that they are  all while embarrassing the hell out of thomas  who may even end up feeling too exposed to remain on the court  and if she does get confirmed  he might resign anyway or at the very least be forced to watch as the woman he harassed and humiliated over  years ago puts on the same black robe to help the american people in a way he has refused to do throughout his own tenure  she could end up being the social justice crusader women and minorities have hoped for and become more revered than scalia and thomas could ever hope to be as the petition says   now that s justice  featured image from wikimedia
