since donald trump can t figure out why he s trailing hillary so badly everywhere it counts  he s decided his campaign staff is the problem  as such  he s shaking things up  reducing the role of his current campaign chairman  paul manafort  and appointing someone new to run things  the new campaign chief stephen bannon  of breitbart yes  that breitbart  the same breitbart that peddles conspiracy theories to white supremacists  the one that set out to prove the polls are all rigged only to prove that they re all correct instead  and the one the southern poverty law center says is now the news arm of the alt right  read  extreme right movement trump s thinking goes something like this  he can only win with people who share his delusional frame of mind  so that s who he ll surround himself with now  he s also got a gop pollster  kellyanne conway  as campaign manager  and he believes they ll be able to turn his campaign around for him  i have known steve and kellyanne both for many years  they are extremely capable  highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win  i believe we re adding some of the best talents in politics  with the experience and expertise needed to defeat hillary clinton in november and continue to share my message and vision to make america great again  hey  being outrageous and horrible made him win the primaries  so it should work in the general  that s the world that trump inhabits  and in that world  campaign staff that try to get him to temper himself  act more presidential  and less like a bully toddler  are the whole reason his poll numbers have crashed in fact  trump has felt  boxed in  and  controlled  by paul manafort and other staffers who  barely know him   he wants to focus hard on riling up his supporters through  rousing  rallies and media appearances  again  because that worked in the primaries and the primaries are totally like the general   manafort wanted less of that  and more real campaigning breitbart has been one of trump s champions for a while now  and one former employee says that bannon used breitbart for his own personal gain  possibly including a way to get close to trump s campaign  under bannon  breitbart has become a fantastic website for white supremacists and nativists   the very people to whom trump himself caters  employees of breitbart were afraid of bannon  and with good reason  he is a vindictive  nasty figure  infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies   is a smarter version of trump  he s an aggressive self promoter who name drops to heighten his profile and woo bigger names  and then uses those bigger names as stepping stools to his next destination  he is everything trump is  only worse some gop operatives are already saying that the choice of bannon will effect a pivot  but it won t be the one that the party is hoping for  if trump s campaign was dark  hateful  bigoted  nativist and dangerous before  it will be all that times a thousand under bannon which is exactly what trump wants  forget the fact that  if that strategy was going to work against hillary  it would have started working by now  trump wants someone who is going to help him draw huge crowds and vanquish his enemies  not run a successful campaign featured image by jeff swensen getty images
