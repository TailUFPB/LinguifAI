after beyonc  released her song  formation  and then performed it at the super bowl  it left many reactionary conservatives attacking her for being anti police  however  she s now clearing the air once and for all  and has something very important to say beyonc  told elle in a recent interview  i mean  i m an artist and i think the most powerful art is usually misunderstood  but anyone who perceives my message as anti police is completely mistaken  i have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe  although  she s not apologizing for putting the spotlight on police brutality  especially how much they ve gone after people of color  she said  but let s be clear  i am against police brutality and injustice  those are two separate things  if celebrating my roots and culture during black history month made anyone uncomfortable  those feelings were there long before a video and long before me  i m proud of what we created and i m proud to be a part of a conversation that is pushing things forward in a positive way  and she is absolutely correct  police brutality and injustice are very real  and need to be talked about as part of the national conversation  nothing is going to change if we ignore the problem and submit to the status quo  far too many people of color are being gunned down in the streets  or taken into custody for literally no good reason  but rather for just existing while black  and several people have actually died in custody  it s not okay  it s never okay  and it needs to be discussed good on beyonc  for speaking up  speaking her mind  and not backing down  she s absolutely on point and her bravery for bringing police brutality into the national spotlight in such a widespread way should be applauded  not torn down by people scared to see the truth featured photo by patrick smith getty images
