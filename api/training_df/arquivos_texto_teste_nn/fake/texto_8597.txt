a christian conservative  lawmaker in kansas has used his position as a senate committee chairman to enforce a dress code for female witnesses in courts  the rules govern skirt length and cleavage allowance  there are no equivalent rules for men sen  mitch holmes is the republican chairman of the senate ethics and elections committee in kansas  and has included his new rules in an  point code of conduct  he argues that women in court  and in the senate  dress provocatively to distract men   and he wants to bring an end to this women will not be permitted to give testimony if they do not abide by the rules he told the topeka capital journal  it s one of those things that s hard to define  put it out there and let people know we re really looking for you to be addressing the issue rather than trying to distract or bring eyes to yourself  his bizarre rules and comments have prompted withering condemnation from female members of the committee and the kansas legislature  topeka democrat senator laura kelly responded  oh  for crying out loud  what century is this  meanwhile  even republican colleagues were unwilling to defend holmes  gop senator vicki schmidt  topeka  sighed  who s going to define low cut  does it apply to senators  in total  four of holmes  female senatorial colleagues  two republicans and two democrats  have come forward to publicly condemn his comments  and stress that women should not be subjected to gender specific dress codes another republican senator  carolyn mcginn of sedgwick  spoke to the fact that men and women in the senate and our courts should be judged by their contribution  not their clothing  saying  i am more interested in what they have to say about the direction our state should go than what they re wearing that day  it is indeed hugely disappointing to see a lawmaker use his position to implement gender specific dress codes that enforce his patriarchal religious codes onto the women of the state  this is the very reason the founding fathers separated church and state in the u s  constitution   because freedom of religion is not merely about the right to practice our own religion  or none  in peace  but to avoid being forced to follow the whims of anyone else s  the women of kansas just lost that right featured image via flickr creative commons
