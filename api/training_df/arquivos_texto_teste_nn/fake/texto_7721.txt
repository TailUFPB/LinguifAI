republicans have spent the last few years in a frenzy  passing pro gun legislation at every opportunity   even while mass shootings continue to plague the country  at the moment  conservatives in almost every state are spending enormous amounts of energy passing so called  guns everywhere  bills that allow people to go to places like bars  national parks  churches  and schools strapped with a firearm  they say this will keep people safe because more guns means more  good guys with guns  but when it comes to their own events  their opinion suddenly drastically changes  thousands of tea party  patriots  and conservative fanatics crammed into a small conference center  organizers would rather they left their guns at home  after all  they may be hypocrites  but they re not suicidal republicans have flocked to the gaylord national resort and convention center in maryland to attend the conservative political action conference  one of the biggest republican events of the year  at the event  attendees will hear right wing talking points spoken by some of their favorite republican politicians and drilled into their heads over loudspeakers  without a doubt  cpac will feature lots of pro gun mania  a few years ago  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was actually given a musket on stage to the delight of the audience   yeah  cpac is really weird  but this year before they can get in  attendees are greeted with this sign at cpac there will be no good guys with guns    pic twitter com   betsy woodruff   woodruffbets  march    then must walk through a metal detector just to ensure they aren t still bearing arms why ban guns  well  because having that many gun carriers packed into a small area practically begs a tragedy to happen  whether by accident or on purpose  the chances of a shooting skyrocket  this year will be particularly tense  because the republican party is in the process of imploding  trump fans  known for roughing up their critics  and republican establishment fans  known for hating trump  will be crammed into standing room only venues  weapons are the last thing these people need inside  they ll probably feel a bit naked without their guns  but they will be covered head to toe in hypocrisy  gun free zones are for  liberal  places like churches  universities  and elementary schools  this is cpac  where conservatives can roam in the comfort of their own warped ideology  everyone should have a bible in their breastpocket and a gun on their hip  conceding that guns make a place dangerous is counter to their most sacred belief  guns keep us safe it s unclear whether the  no guns allowed  policy came from cpac organizers or the convention center they rented  either way  it looks bad  republicans want guns to be around school children   but can t tolerate them during their weekend event featured image via flickr
