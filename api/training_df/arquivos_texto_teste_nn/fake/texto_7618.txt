while one could argue that the second amendment of the united states constitution grants the ability to own firearms to every citizen  one must also remember that within that second amendment  which arms the militias as stipulated in article  section   these  militias  are to be well regulated  the second amendment is not limitless  just as the first amendment is not limitless  there are limits to speech and religion when it causes harm to others  just as it should be with the second amendment and the right to bear arms  it should also be noted that the militias were to be formed and armed to be used by the government  not against  see also  whiskey rebellion  however  the gun industry alongside the gun lobby continuously seeks to change the meaning behind the second amendment to suit their needs and desire to make more profit  in their latest scheme at lobbying congress  gun advocates are asking congress to  repeal a depression era law that requires a months long screening process for silencer buyers    you know  because people need to make their guns quieter oh  but they don t call them  silencers   they call them  suppressors   and their reasoning for the need to get them to everyone is pure gold  apparently  not only hunters need them  but so does everyone else  to protect from  hearing loss  yep  you read that correctly  the gun industry is trying to rebrand these  suppressors as  hearing protection accessories   republican congressman matt salmon  from the great state of arizona  who is clearly bought and paid for by the gun lobby  stated  if we have something that mitigates that kind of hearing loss  we ought to be encouraging it  how about less gun use  or is that too obvious salmon s law  called the  hearing protection act  seeks to  remove sound suppressors from regulation under the national firearms act  nfa   leaving them to be treated as ordinary firearms subject to the usual nics check and form  for dealer sales  common sense democratic state rep  joe mullery from minnesota  said  what legitimate reason does a person have to be wandering around the streets of a big city with a silencer  none  there is no reason anyone should have a silencer unless they are in the military and need one for a specific task and as the gun industry likes to point out that there aren t very many crimes committed with suppressors  they fail to realize that it s probably because they aren t regularly available and are harder to get  as they should be  that s the whole point  thanks for making it for us  now  if we could only do that for all guns  in augusta  maine  police chief robert gregoire said silencer equipped gunshots may sound further away than a typical gunshot  making it hard to track hunters in unauthorized areas  also  he now cannot block silencer sales for residents he suspects may not use them responsibly a hunter himself  gregoire said he saw little reason to encourage silencer use  i don t think they re necessary for home protection and i don t think they re necessary for hunting   he said  source  the guardianyet  congressman salmon  alongside  supporters of his  hearing protection act   are fighting alongside the nra and the gun lobby to make silencers readily available for all guns and gun purchasers  which isn t so much for the betterment of gun owners and society  but rather for the profit margins of the gun industry it s sick  it s sad  and it s unnecessary featured image via timothy tsul  flickr
