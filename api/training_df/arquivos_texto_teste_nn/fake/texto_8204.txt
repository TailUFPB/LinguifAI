ta nehisi coates sat down with an interview with amy goodman on democracy now  on wednesday  where he said that he  will be voting for sen  sanders   this endorsement is particularly interesting  due to some very real criticisms coates wrote about sanders earlier this month coates is a correspondent for the atlantic and won the  national award winner for his book  between the world and me  his essay  the case for reparations  is a must read  late into last january  coates wrote about some of his frustrations with sanders  lack of willingness to publicly support reparations for slavery the criticism of sanders is one that is both new and old  as coates notes  people are beginning to look at the issue of reparations from a new historical lens  that new lens is what fuels most of coates  critique of sanders  stance on reparations   that being said  there has always been tension between all the flavors of the black liberation movement  with all of the flavors of the revolutionary left coinciding with the rise of the new democrats  this is an old feud that has largely been missing from the mainstream political discussion for several decades  indeed  the fact that this debate is once again seeing the light of day is a very good thing to happen  a synthesis of diverging thoughts cannot occur if they are neglected during the interview  coates says that he is stunned by the rise of sanders  goodman asks coates why he is stunned  his response is revealing  well  i think  had you told me this like a year ago  i certainly would not have expected  you know  an avowed socialist to be putting up these sorts of numbers and actually be contending for the democratic party nomination  but i think it s awesome  you know  i think it s great  you know  like a lot of people  i m very  very concerned about senator clinton s record  i m very  very concerned about where her positions were in the   when we had some of the most disgusting legislation in terms of our criminal justice  really  in this country s history  i get really  really concerned when i see somebody taking    in speaking fees from goldman sachs  will not release what they re actually saying  that s concerning  and so  having options  not having this be a coronation  i think  is a good thing  so  i m stunned  but i m pleasantly stunned  the interview should be a treat to watch for anyone on the left you can watch the entire interview in full  below featured image video screenshot via democracy now
