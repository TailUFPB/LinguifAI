donald trump sat down for an interview with on cbs face the nation  where the republican presidential primary front runner fully embraced torture as a tool to fight terrorism  during the interview  trump repeatedly used the racist term  savages  before that  though  trump described himself as a great unifier of the people  saying  i mean  i get along with people  i m a unifier  i m very much a unifier   trump told host john dickerson   and maybe people don t see that  but they will see that  we re not playing by   we are playing by rules  but they have no rules  it s very hard to win when that s the case   trump said  isn t that what separates us from the savages   dickerson asks in response  no  we have to beat the savages   trump replied   obviously  all you have to do is take a look at what s going on  and they re getting worse  they re chopping  chopping  chopping  and we re worried about waterboarding  i just think it s   i think our priorities are mixed up  trump insisted that he would only advocate torture that is permitted under the law in the united states  then  like any good potential dictator  he said that laws regarding torture must be expanded  we have to play the game the way they re playing the game  you re not going to win if we re soft and they re  they have no rules  now  i want to stay within the laws  i want to do all of that  but i think we have to increase the laws because the laws are not working   trump said this interview shows that he is trying to appeal to the most barbaric bloc of republican voters  the type of people who would gladly have the president drop a few nuclear bombs on civilian populations in the middle east torture does not work  if trump had any actual understanding of intelligence gathering  he would know that  however  trump and his followers appear to be impervious to facts  so it isn t all too surprising that they would advocate such tactics you can watch the interview in full below featured image from video screenshot
