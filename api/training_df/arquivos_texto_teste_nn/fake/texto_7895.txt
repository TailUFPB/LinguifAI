if iowa republicans have their way  toddlers will be able to carry guns  which makes the state the scariest in the nation the iowa house literally passed a series of gun bills on tuesday  including house file   that if allowed to become law would let kids under the age of  carry a gun  because what could possibly go wrong according to iowa public radio democrat kirsten running marquardt asked what kind of gun would fit into the hands of a two or three year old  i ve got the bill right in front of me   running marquardt said   it s a valid question  you re missing the whole point of the bill   replied johnston republican jake highfill   i think this is one of the best bills we ve done for second amendment rights  current iowa law prohibits children under the age of  from possessing handguns and ammunition  which is a reasonable measure considering   kids are injured or killed every year by guns  one fifth of which are accidents and that s not even counting the accidental shootings of adults by children who handle guns democratic rep  mary mascher pointed out that a nine year old girl had parental and instructor supervision at an arizona gun range when she accidentally shot and killed the instructor because she couldn t handle the gun  unfortunately the instructor and the parents made the wrong decision and someone died   mascher said   every three hours in this country a child dies from gun violence  and that s not the only example showing why kids should not be allowed to have access to guns in january   a five year old boy killed his little brother with a gun that he found lying around the house in august of the same year  a four year old boy shot and killed his own mother after finding a gun in the car that he thought was a toy then there s the  year old boy who killed a little girl because she wouldn t let him pet her puppy or how about the three year old boy who has to live with the knowledge that he accidentally shot and killed his mom in  after finding a loaded gun under the couch and then there s the story of a five year old boy who shot and killed his little sister with a rifle he had just been given for his birthday  his parents believed that a child safety feature would be enough to keep the gun from accidentally being fired the bottom line is that toddlers have no clue what a gun is and lack the physical and mental capacity to handle a firearm responsibly  no matter what the nra says  and there are clearly many parents who are stupid when it comes to mixing guns and kids  the results of which are horrifying and heartbreaking  and you can be sure that there will be more dead kids and parents if this bill becomes law the bill now heads to the democrat controlled iowa senate  where logic and reason will hopefully prevail featured image via freakout nation
