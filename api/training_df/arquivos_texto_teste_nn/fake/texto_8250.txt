the parents at a southern california elementary school just got their minds blown when they heard that a complete stranger had decided to pay for their kindergarten age children to go to college navy vet and fullerton lawyer marty burbank and his wife were the people who selflessly decided to abandon their dreams of buying the   million boat they met and got married on to put  kindergarteners at the rio vista elementary school through college when  year old burbank told kindergarten teacher tessa ashton his plan to ensure that each one of her kindergarteners would receive a college education  she could hardly believe it  ashton said that the news forced her to give her young students a lesson about  happy tears  because they couldn t understand her powerful reaction to the news  she said  he cried and i cried  and the kids got really concerned because they ve never seen me cry  you don t walk into moments like that very often so it was kind of a magical thing  burbank had met ashton several years ago when they were both attending a service day at the placentia yorba linda unified school district campus  since then  he d donated tons of supplies to the elementary school such as a thousand notebooks and snacks for the children  burbank noticed that one of the rooms had a display of college flags  and the image stuck with him  burbank knew he could change these children s lives in a bigger way than simply donating supplies  he said  they don t come from families where anybody has had an opportunity to go to college  and college is not something that the parents talk to the kids about  burbank was inspired to forgo his plan to buy the sentimental boat after he heard a sermon about giving  burbank  who d been sailing since he was a toddler  said  sailing has been a big part of my life   but  the boat seemed like a real selfish thing to me at that point  this is something significant that i think is going to impact a lot more people than just me  burbank s wife  seon chun burbank  was more than on board with the idea  she had come from a family who could never afford a college education  and said it was only because of her aunt s financial support that she became a first generation college graduate  she explained  i like the movie  pay it forward  i got a lot of help and now i m helping others  and i hope they can do that too  you can listen to burbank talk about his amazing act of kindness below the kids are more than enthusiastic about their new future  six year old jessyca resendiz said  college is a big place and there is a fountain  it has a big cafeteria that has coffee and bread   resendiz has plans to be a doctor  and because of burbank and his wife  she ll get to fulfill that dream one of the kindergartener s parents  silvia escobar  revealed that she had only completed second grade and didn t have the opportunity that her son would have thanks to burbank s kindness  she said  may god bless him always for helping people who truly need his help  there are no words  burbank s gift is for each child to receive two years of community college  and two years at a university in california  burbank will also cover the cost of the children s books  with inflation taken into account  the lawyer estimates that it will take approximately   million to cover the kindergarteners  tuition and expenses  beginning in  on monday  the burbanks received thank you cards from the students  but the knowledge that there will be education in each child s future is enough for the couple  there s just one catch   the parents are to keep the burbanks up to date on their children s academics and the students must submit a picture or essay about what they would like to be when they grow up every year  burbanks  who has now decided to postpone his retirement  said  i d rather not have a boat and get these kids through school  maybe one day they ll buy me a boat  featured image is a screenshot
