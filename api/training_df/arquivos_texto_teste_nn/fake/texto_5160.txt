donald trump has been an absolute nightmare for the republican party establishment  the last week or so has been especially horrible  from his unbelievably despicable fight with the khans  the muslim american parents of a fallen iraq war hero  to his continuous and deliberate feuds with members of his own party  to his continued flirtations with russian dictator vladimir putin   all of it has been one big headache since trump and his trophy wife rode down that escalator and he announced his bid for the presidency well  prominent republicans all over the place have been coming out of the woodwork to say they won t support or vote for trump  and some are even saying they will vote for hillary clinton in order to put country first and save us all from the donald  that number seems to be much higher than those brave folks who are openly denouncing trump  though  politico conducted an anonymous poll of gop insiders  and a shocking   of them are not only as horrified as the rest of us are by trump  but they actually want him out of the  race and out of the republican party  a couple also went on to express their fears about trump regarding his effects on the party  i d rather take our chances with nearly anyone else than continue with this certain loser who will likely cost the senate and much more  the effect trump is having on down ballot races has the potential to be devastating in november  his negative image among hispanics  women and independents is something that could be devastating to republicans  trump s divisive rhetoric to the hispanic community at large has the potential to be devastating for years to come  while many seem to wish trump would leave the race  most       believe that he will not  one goper from new hampshire had a rather sarcastic reply regarding that subject  i also wish i could lose  pounds  cut  shots off my handicap and play the piano  it s not just the party they should be worried about  though  it s the safety of the nation  trump is dangerously unqualified  the most patriotic thing they could do would be to do all they can to undermine his candidacy  take one for the team  and try again with someone who is actually qualified in   if you cannot do that openly  at least  in the privacy of the voting booth  do what you ve done here and vote for the candidate who is actually qualified  you survived obama  you ll survive hillary  too  but the real kicker is this  none of us would survive trump featured image via spencer platt getty images
