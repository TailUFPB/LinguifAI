the new york daily news  once again  has knocked it out of the park with their wednesday cover  the cover features images of presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and house speaker paul ryan next to each other  ryan is pointing his index towards trump  with the words  i m with racist  written over the two republicans the cover photo was shared on twitter tuesday night  where it quickly went viral  here s the cover photo tomorrow s front page  i m with racist  ryan still supports trump   definition of racist  https   t co  pic twitter com   new york daily news   nydailynews  june    cover relates to ryan s recent public condemnation of trump s racist rhetoric  i disavow these comments  claiming a person can t do the job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment  i think that should be absolutely disavowed  it s absolutely unacceptable  trump s flagrantly racist comments aren t enough for ryan to rescind his endorsement of trump  ryan offered this explanation as to why he is still supporting trump  do i believe that hillary clinton is the answer  no  i do not   he said   i believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than we do with her  the actual article that the ny daily news published describes the situation with a bit of apt snark  by saying   donald trump is a racist  but he s our racist  the republican speaker of the house said  the cover is emblematic of the current situation happening in republican politics  the gop is a party divided  top republican party members have consistently refused to take a firm stance on trump s most controversial proposals  those proposals include building a wall a border wall that isn t needed between the united states and mexico and the laughable assertion that mexico will pay for this mega construction project  then there is trump s proposal to ban all muslims from entering the united states  a policy that is blatantly xenophobic  impossible to enforce  and will do absolutely nothing to prevent terrorism though  trump s economic policies  whatever they are this week  tend to follow the trickle down economic agenda of the party of big business  which is apparently good enough for ryan featured image from screenshot via twitter
