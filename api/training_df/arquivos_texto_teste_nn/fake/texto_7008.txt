in retaliation of bruce springsteen cancelling a concert over the state s anti lgbt law  a north carolina republican whined and stated that he might have to become a justin bieber fan now north carolina republicans jammed house bill  into law last month in response to a charlotte city ordinance that protected lgbt people from discrimination  but the new law overturns the ordinance  barring cities and counties from passing their own anti discrimination laws in addition  the law also prevents cities and counties from raising the minimum wage  allows employers to fire workers for any reason  and outlaws transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity  basically  the four page law makes north carolina a crappier place to live as predicted  businesses are not happy about this law and it s already hurting the state as paypal has cancelled a project in the state that would have created hundreds of jobs  and most prominently  bruce springsteen cancelled a concert in greensboro rather than perform in a state that discriminates against their own citizens  to my mind  it s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress   the legendary rocker wrote in a statement condemning the law   some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry   which is happening as i write   is one of them  it is the strongest means i have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards  and in response  north carolina gop rep  mark walker  who is also a pastor  threw a tantrum over the cancellation in an interview with the hollywood reporter claiming that the law is merely meant to catch  imposters  who would somehow take advantage of laws protecting transgender people  walker called springsteen a  bully  bruce is known to be on the radical left   walker whined   he s got every right to be so  but i consider this a bully tactic  it s like when a kid gets upset and says he s going to take his ball and go home  walker then pointed out upcoming concerts that are coming to the state  we ve got other artists coming soon   def leppard  justin bieber   walker said  i ve never been a bieber fan  but i might have to go  maybe artists who weren t  born to run  deserve a little bit more support  yeah  and now that you ve professed your support of these artists  they should probably consider running as far away from the bigoted state of north carolina as possible  because the last thing def leppard and justin bieber would want is to be endorsed by a republican who supports discriminating against people  especially since many of those people are their fans walker and his fellow republicans are the real bullies in north carolina  this bill isn t about  imposters  at all  that s merely the excuse the gop used to pass the law despite the fact that there have been zero instances of sex offenders using lgbt protection to defend predatory behavior across  states and over  cities make no mistake  republicans brought these economic consequences upon their state themselves by legalizing discrimination when they could have followed charlotte s lead and passed a similar law covering the entire state  instead  they chose hate and took the state backwards featured image via wikimedia
