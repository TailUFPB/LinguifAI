it would appear that donald trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality  so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality  and in the world of politics and mudslinging  it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes  however  these lies will get debunked  and there s nothing to stop that either it s become very clear at this point that the presumptive republican nominee has switched into attack mode against democratic front funner hillary clinton  if he s not going after her for what her husband did  he s going after her for literally being a woman now  knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the obama administration  including then secretary of state hillary clinton  did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on americans in benghazi  libya  he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway  never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe trump tweeted this out to stir the pot  yet again hillary has bad judgment  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    then leads you to this  hillary has bad judgment a video posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on may    at   pdtlet s be clear on this  there is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened  trump thought libya was a female body part  so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question  he s a bully though  and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up when every poll shows hillary clinton wiping the floor with trump among women  minorities and the youth vote  he s got to do something  he s desperate  and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the trump campaign bringing up benghazi again after clinton has been cleared again and again and again  c mon now  donald  that s just pathetic  and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world featured photo by justin sullivan getty images
