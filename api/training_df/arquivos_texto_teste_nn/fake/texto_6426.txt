being the wife of failed republican presidential candidate ted cruz is no easy task  but heidi cruz has just proven that she s a nut job in her own right  either that  or ted damaged a few brain cells when he elbowed her in the face after suspending his campaign although ted s disaster of a campaign ended a week ago  heidi s not ready to give up just yet   and why would she  considering that cruz s family spent months claiming god wanted him to run for president  and he failed   to try to save face  heidi portrayed her husband s failure as just one part of a longer  bigger journey   you know  just like the fight to end slavery  during a conference call with the cruz campaign s national prayer team  heidi made this baffling comparison between her husband s campaign and the abolition of slavery when she said  i don t want you to feel like any of this was in vain  i believe in the power of prayer  this doesn t always happen on the timing of man  and god does not work in four year segments  be full of faith and so full of joy that this team was chosen to fight a long battle  think that slavery   it took  years to defeat slavery  that is a lot longer than four years  heidi also spoke on ted s decision to end his campaign after trump crushed him in the indiana primary   a win that marked trump as the gop s presumptive nominee  heidi said  i want to assure all of you that this was not a race we gave up  this was a race that no longer had a viable path to victory  and it would ve been very demoralizing for you all and the troops to go through nine states of losses  we left on a high note  we left when there was no possible way that we were going to win  mrs  cruz also repeatedly said that this  failed  campaign was  just the beginning  for ted   although it s unclear what that actually means  completely forgetting that cruz is one of the most hated republicans by fellow republicans and many of his conservative colleagues wanted nothing to do with him  she said  we have changed the republican party  this is no longer about the establishment and the old way of doing things versus the constitution  this party is now being deceived  but the old battles are behind us  the new ones are before us  it was our first national race  but we have changed the republican party by ted being in the senate and ted running this race  heidi tried to assure callers that her husband was planning an  enormous agenda  for when he got back to the senate  we are not only keeping this band together  we have been having meetings five hours a day since the time we dropped out  every single person in our leadership team in our campaign  ted and i will probably be working with on a weekly basis in the next four years  the failed candidate himself joined the call later  expressing his disappointment that he was out of the presidential race but urged his fans to continue supporting him ted and heidi are in for a rude awakening   just like the outcome of his presidential campaign has proven  ted is too unlikeable to gain a significant following and support for his ideas  it doesn t matter that god wanted him to be the president   america s voters clearly don t  and certainly  comparing a presidential campaign to an emancipation movement probably isn t winning over anyone featured image via scott olson   getty images
