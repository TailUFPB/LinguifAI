despite some noises being made by some republican detractors  for all intents and purposes the party is stuck with donald trump as its nominee and the choice will be official at the party s upcoming convention while some major republicans like george w  bush and mitt romney have announced their opposition to trump  not as many have gone all in and endorsed hillary clinton for president  instead preferring to simply oppose trump without offering up a serious alternative former treasury secretary hank paulson has gone a step further  and in an op ed published in the washington post  is now endorsing clinton he doesn t mince his words the gop  in putting trump at the top of the ticket  is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance  prejudice  fear and isolationism  this troubles me deeply as a republican  but it troubles me even more as an american  enough is enough  it s time to put country before party and say it together  never trump paulson just absolutely blasts trump s supposed business prowess noting   he takes imprudent risks and  when his businesses fail  disavows his debts  citing his first hand experience with passing tarp after the economy began collapsing and the need to get democrats and republicans to agree on it  paulson notes   this requires a president who exhibits an ability to compromise   and basic civility   neither of which trump displays  it isn t as if paulson has become a liberal overnight  he points out that he still supports republicans at the state level  and the overall tone of his essay is that he would support a standard issue republican if trump were one but he isn t  and as a result he lays out the case for clinton as better for business even if he disagrees with some of her philosophy he concludes i ll be voting for hillary clinton  with the hope that she can bring americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy  our environment and our place in the world  to my republican friends  i know i m not alone featured image via youtube
