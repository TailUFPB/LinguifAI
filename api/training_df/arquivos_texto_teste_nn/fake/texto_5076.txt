another day  another hillary clinton scandal has died in flames  just this year alone  three scandals   benghazi  her private email  and now this   have proven to be nothing more than a vast right wing conspiracy recently  the republican party has been in an absolute tailspin as their presidential candidate  donald trump  crashes and burns in a wreckage of insanity  so what do they do  why  manufacture another hillary clinton scandal to distract from their recklessness in a recent email dump  questions were raised  which were then inflamed by donald trump  regarding the idea that clinton used her power as secretary of state to influence her foundation  one email showed the foundation s executive  doug band  requesting a meeting between a wealthy donor and an ambassador  and asking for clinton s aides to find a new job for an associate with the foundation the completely generic and minuscule emails  which were part of thousands upon thousands released  were completely innocent  but that didn t stop the republicans from labeling it as  pay for play  well the state department has shut down those asinine  distracting talking points by pointing out that there is no evidence to suggest clinton  in any way  used her power to accumulate favors for her foundation  state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau told reporters the state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the clinton foundation  the department does not believe it was inappropriate for mr  band or any other individual to recommend someone be considered for employment at the state department  we also do not believe it s inappropriate for someone recommended in this manner to be potentially hired insofar as they meet the necessary qualifications for the job the clinton foundation and the state department made it clear that the individual that band wanted hired  whose name was redacted  was not an employee of the foundation  and even if they were  trudeau pointed out  that wouldn t necessarily be harbinger for employment  should they have the qualifications to be president and the ambassador who wanted to meet with a donor  such thing is commonplace state department officials are regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organizations  including non profits  ngos  think tanks and others even though such circumstances are commonplace and have historical precedence  republicans are still hoping their phony  ill conceived  scandal  will distract from the disaster that is their presidential candidate now republicans are also toying with the idea she had a dnc staffer killed  get ready for another season of clinton  scandals   instead of focusing on the issues  which they are so good a evading  they will be doing another round of character assassination featured image via bill pugliano getty images
