canada is just fun  our great white neighbor to the north just shed a decade of hate and ignorance in favor of  prime minister centerfold  and a slew of not just leftish but downright liberal political and social reform  in other words  canada joined the rest of the civilized world in evolving faster than america ever could they ve had advantages  of course  i can t quite remember exactly who it was but back in the  some comedy news person  possibly stewart pankin  said that the first words in canada s national anthem should be changed to  oh  america thank god we re next to you  yes  you can laugh  for much of its existence and in many ways still  that is true  anything bordering something as massive and internationally strategic as the united states of america is going to benefit greatly from a relationship that is symbiotic by nature still  canada is doing ok for itself and would like to offer   million of the most polite people in the world  as candidates for president  not any one individually  all of them  they say they ll do it in shifts  canada has  run for president  before  but failed to pick up enough votes to get by the mandatory tooth brushing guy in this perfectly hilarious depiction of what canada thinks  stereotypes get hit long and hard  the friendly guy in the sweater sporting the majestic eagle and the ever noble moose is as polite as he is passively condescending  his endearing accent and inherent whiteness come through strong as he questions us about our choices and offers real world solutions  yes  the irony at the end would be just hilarious  wouldn t it  trump has said that his wall will have doors  if trump is elected president it would only be fitting for canada to build a solid wall with no doors  because we re obviously  million or so  absolutely crazy people  trump would have to pay for it by his own rules luckily for us there truly is no scenario where donald trump being president would actually be good for america  one thing is for sure  if the stars align in the manner that puts any republican in the white house with the current class of crazies  running  our congress  i m moving to canada  featured image from screen capture
