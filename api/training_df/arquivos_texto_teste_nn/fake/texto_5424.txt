donald trump is only one day into his republican national convention  and it s already not looking good for him  not only did several delegates and a fundraiser walk out or resign from his convention  but he also got dissed by house speaker paul ryan all in a matter of a few hours according to the hill  ryan didn t mince his words when discussing trump at a wall street journal lunch in cleveland  stating that the business mogul was  not my kind of conservative   ryan said  he s not my kind of conservative  but i come from a different part and wing of the party  i think he is a conservative  there are different kinds of conservatives  that s for darn sure  this is just another comment in a long list of critical remarks ryan has made about trump  ryan has made a point to distance himself from trump s hateful rhetoric as much as possible  even when trying to get the gop to stand behind the candidate  previously  ryan has slammed trump for his  textbook racist comments about judge gonzalo curiel s mexican heritage  tweeting anti semitic images and proposing an all out ban on muslims over and over  ryan has made it clear that he disagrees with trump s views so much that basically the only reason why he is  reluctantly  endorsing the disgraced candidate is that he thinks anything is better than handing the election over to a democrat  in doing so  ryan showed america that to him  furthering the republican party s intolerant values and laws were more important than saving the country from an untrustworthy  dangerously unqualified reality tv star  at the same lunch  ryan said  what i do know for sure is if we disunify  then we hand the left the country by default for another four years  i just don t want to be a party to that  i don t want to be complicit to that  so  instead  speaker ryan wants to be complicit to handing the country to an unqualified bigot  got it featured image via video screen capture
