during a panel segment on real time with bill maher on friday night  former republican national committee chairman michael steele tried to make a half hearted case for a donald trump administration  the case was shut down instantly by maher  who had initially asked steele   what is the bridge too far  what is the point at which you say my country before my nominee  steele responded by stating clearly that he is a party man by any measure  he has served as not only the rnc chairman but also as the chairman of republican committees at every level of politics  maher jumps in asking steele if that s the case  then is there really a bridge too far for him  steele insists that there is and offers this argument  there is a bridge too far  i want to see and i ve been very clear about this since the beginning  i want to see donald trump make the kinds of steps   i know he is a  year old man i know he isn t going to change  it s just not in the cards  here s the rub  i philosophically cannot sit there and go  oh well  because i m so pissed off and cannot stand donald trump that i am going to fall in love with hillary clinton   that s just not where i am  maher counters  saying   it s not about donald trump  it s about the policies he supports   maher then goes on to say that he views this election as a  referendum on decency   and calls trump an  indecent man  you can watch the segment below https   youtu be  t  is right   there is nothing decent about donald trump  and by extension  the decency of those who support him is definitely called into question featured image from video screenshot
