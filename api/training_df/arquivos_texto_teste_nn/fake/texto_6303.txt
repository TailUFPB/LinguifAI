in an effort to  get serious   donald trump unexpectedly announced a long list of federal judges he says he might pick to replace the deceased antonin scalia on the supreme court should he be elected  one of his top picks  all of whom are white  is texas supreme court justice don willett  and he s apparently as surprised as anyone justice willett has been pretty clear that he actively loathes donald trump  on twitter  a large portion of his comments are directed towards tearing apart the republican presumptive nominee  just two days before trump released his name  willett was using a muppets gif to sum up his feelings on the  election   is brought to you by the letters s  m  and h  pic twitter com   justice don willett   justicewillett  may    of his tweets attack trump specifically low energy trump university has never made it to  marchmadness  or even to the  nit  sad    pic twitter com dwcfjozkpu  justice don willett   justicewillett  march    is the trump university mascot   justice don willett   justicewillett  march    from just a month after trump announced that he would be running  and at a time when most americans figured trump s campaign would detonate upon lift off   willett was already nailing trump for his thin skin and petty insults  with malice toward none  with charity for all       except for all the losers  clowns  and dummies   president donald lincoln  justice don willett   justicewillett  august    perhaps the very best tweet   and probably the one that will cost willett the chance of ever being selected donald trump haiku who would the donaldname to  scotus  the mind reels  weeps can t finish tweet  pic twitter com   justice don willett   justicewillett  june    is certainly no liberal  he worked on george w  bush s presidential campaign and was appointed a supreme court of texas justice by then governor rick perry  white house press secretary josh earnest  for instance  scoffed at willett and his fellow selectees as being laughably right wing  instead  willett s beef with trump appears to be entirely based on the fact that  like many republicans  he can t believe a buffoon like trump managed to get the gop to actively support him neither can we trump s half baked scotus nominee selection can be added to the growing body of evidence supporting the idea that donald trump has absolutely no idea how to run a competent campaign  while the press scrutinizes every minor slip up coming from other candidates  particularly hillary clinton  trump has managed to botch his own pr efforts at every turn  on cinco de mayo  trump threw every bit of common sense to the wind and tweeted out a photo of himself eating a taco bowl with the caption  i love hispanics   he pushed an economic plan that economists said would add   trillion to the deficit and then promptly retracted it  he  accidentally  sent a white nationalist delegate to the convention  his list of gaffes grows exponentially by the week  the fact that he clearly spent all of five minutes googling his list of scotus nominees is shocking  but not surprising featured image via scott olson getty images
