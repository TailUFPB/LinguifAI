warren buffet  one of the richest men in the world and someone who actually does know a lot about money  has known this whole time what drove trump s campaign finances into the ground  he didn t say as much  because at the time buffett revealed this  it was  and he was talking about trump s bankrupt taj mahal  what he said then can apply now  though  and the state of trump s campaign finances backs it up back when trump filed for bankruptcy on the taj mahal  buffett was giving speeches to undergrad students at notre dame when someone asked him where trump went wrong  buffett said  he simply got infatuated with how much money he could borrow  and he did not give enough thought to how much money he could pay back  that s so trump  especially when faced with the possibility that he can t do what he wants because of consequences  so is this  the big problem with donald trump was he never went right  he basically overpaid for properties  but he got people to lend him the money  he was terrific at borrowing money  if you look at his assets  and what he paid for them  and what he borrowed to get them  there was never any real equity there  no  he never did go right  trump has six bankruptcies total in his history  which is a lot  even over  years  he owes at least   million to deutsche bank  one has to wonder whether he got over his infatuation with borrowing  or whether he learned anything from his bankruptcies  he certainly hasn t learned to think about the consequences of anything he does his campaign is more than   million in the hole with just over   million in the bank  and he just sent out his first desperate email begging his constituents for money  he ll need those donations to keep his campaign running  not pay off debt  perhaps he thinks the debt will walk quietly away this is significant because  if he s as in love with debt as he is with himself  he very well could make our national debt skyrocket despite his more than impossible promise to have it paid off within eight years  he s far more likely to actually bankrupt the u s  than any other candidate if he s mired in this notion that he can borrow money indiscriminately buffett and trump are polar opposites in the way they do business  and even in the way they see government  for instance  trump has bragged about the low tax rate he pays  as if that s something to be proud of when the government is talking about cutting needed services because there isn t enough money  buffett  on the other hand  has called for higher taxes on the wealthy repeatedly that makes buffett the smart one of these two  but then  we already knew that trump keeps saying he can change his tune anytime he wants  but the few paltry efforts he s made have failed spectacularly within just a few days  it s a good bet that he ll remain addicted to borrowing money  even as president  he has his eye on the prize  and the prize is a destroyed u s   and a fat wallet for himself featured image by paul morigi getty images
