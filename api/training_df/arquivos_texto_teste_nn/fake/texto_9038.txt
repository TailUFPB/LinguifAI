seconds between when jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire police have referred to this shooting as  an accident   it s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it the police knocked on her door  waited for her to open  then immediately shot her dead according to the chicago sun times larry rogers jr   an attorney for the jones family  said police need

out after cops murder sonposted by the young turks on thursday  december    the death of her son  janet cooksey  quintonio legrier s mother  asked a very important question during a december  press conference   who are we supposed to call  as cenk uygur points out in the video above  calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue  communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families  that do not involve police it seems one solution might be to organize community task forces  which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families  community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement  saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system  in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution as tyt points out  people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population it s simply not safe to call police for help in the united states  it time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis  rather than causing them irreparable harm as uygur asks in the video   what if this were your kid and not a black kid  our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings  we cannot keep blaming the victims of these gestapo style executions  while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood featured image via facebook
