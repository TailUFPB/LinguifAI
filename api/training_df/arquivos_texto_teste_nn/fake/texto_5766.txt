on wednesday  democrats took a powerful stance against the gop s refusal to vote on gun control measures by staging a sit in  while republican politicians called a recess and took a lunch break  dems stayed put on the floor and fought for the safety of america s citizens hours after the sit in  house speaker paul ryan weighed in on the event in an interview with cnn  and his comments were just as disappointing as they were disgusting  his response to a sit in  which follows the deaths of almost  innocent americans that lost their lives in a tragic mass shooting in orlando a week ago  was this brutal sentence  this is nothing more than a publicity stunt  seriously   a genuine attempt to get congress to support gun control measures that will protect american citizens from senseless gun violence like mass shootings is considered a  publicity stunt  by a leading republican  the speaker of the house added that the democrats involved in the sit in were trying to rob americans of their rights  insisting that we should not be focusing on gun control and that the real threat is terrorism  in saying this  ryan has completely ignored the fact that there have been several mass shootings in the united states that have zero connection to terrorism and were caused by individuals that never should have been able to get their hands on a gun so effortlessly to prove just how backwards ryan s  logic  is  he accused the hard working democrats fighting for gun control legislation of doing the sit in for  attention  instead of creating solutions  clearly  he forgot that his gop colleagues were eating lunch while this was happening   which definitely doesn t solve anything   when wolf blitzer asked ryan if it was the nra that was the major obstacle standing in the way of gun control legislation  ryan said  no  the constitution is  because americans have a  guaranteed  second amendment right to firearms you can watch ryan s horrific comments below the entire interview is infuriating  but truly proves that the gop cares more about guns than americans  right to safety featured image via allison shelley   getty images
