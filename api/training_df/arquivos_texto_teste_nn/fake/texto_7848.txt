in light of the flint water crisis  michigan republicans are publicly and privately acknowledging that their party s approach to governing has been a total disaster as michigan s eclectablog reports here   despite the shiny  happy face that gov  snyder is putting on and despite his continuing calls for more privatization and the success of emergency management   off the record  state republicans have been quietly admitting that the gop s plan to run government like a business  has been an utter failure  john lindstrom  of michigan s gongwer news service  detailed a string of off the record interviews with the state s republican leadership here as reported by gongwer  all of them recognized flint as a failure  a spectacular failure  of state government  they also worried that it was particularly a failure of their party  as they almost universally said   our guys  no matter the setting  or the day  or the circumstance of the conversations  or who was speaking  and not everyone speaking would have known each other   there was an almost stunning repetition to each conversation s tone  they brought up the flint situation  and they said  unprompted  it was a failure of state government and their party  even more telling  on february   dennis schornack  a former sr  policy advisor to michigan s republican governor  rick snyder  was interviewed by the detroit free press during the interview  schornack said the flint water crisis is the direct result of the republican approach to governing  which promises to run government like a business schornack  who has plenty of insight into how the snyder administration functions  told the free press  that snyder used a  single dimension for decision making   he explained that snyder uses a financial spreadsheet to make every single decision to illustrate the point  shornak confided that  in spite of all the talk about  christian values   as it turns out  snyder s decision to oppose gay marriage was never based on his christian beliefs  it was based on a financial spreadsheet as the free press reports here  schornack said another example of a snyder failure related to running government like a business was his administration s handling of gay marriage  which it opposed until it was legalized by the u s  supreme court  gay marriage must be decided in the heart  safe drinking water in the laboratory   schornack said but the snyder administration used spreadsheets to address both issues  deciding gay marriage on the basis of how much it would cost the state to provide benefits to same sex couples among state employees  he said  schornack did not hold back when discussing how the republican approach to governing created the flint water crisis  government is not a business  and it cannot be run like one   he told the free press he went on to say  the people of flint got stuck on the losing end of decisions driven by spreadsheets instead of water quality and public health   having been a snyder staffer  luckily in a spreadsheet rich area like transportation  i lived the culture amidst its faults  earlier this week a petition to recall rick snyder was approved by the michigan board of state canvassers when asked if he believes snyder will be removed from office in november  schornack said  the issue has totally spun out of the governor s control   and if a recall question makes it onto the ballot   he s dead  in light of the situation in the city of flint  the use of the phrase  he s dead   is entirely inappropriate snyder is very much alive and will continue to be alive  whether he is recalled in november or not  his political career might be dead  but he will have the luxury of living the same extravagant  greedy lifestyle he s been accustomed to  for many years to come on the other hand  at least ten people are known to have actually died because of snyder s poison policy choices  which valued the almighty dollar over all things  including their health and their lives add to that the thousands of people who will live with the consequences of snyder s irresponsible  immoral and illegal decisions for the rest of their lives  many of whom will die from complications associated with lead poisoning what s worse  as the citizens of flint struggle to cope with a crisis of monumental proportion  republican leadership continues to put the almighty dollar before their lives and their health on february   residents of flint spoke out about the many issues that have yet to be addressed by state or federal leaders  during a town hall with democratic presidential primary candidate bernie sanders months after the situation became public knowledge  flint citizens still struggle to get accurate information  they continue to lack resources for healthcare and many are still faced with the challenges of collecting water from one of the designated locations in the city  without the means to do so while state republicans whine about the financial costs of doing the right thing in lansing  in washington gop presidential candidate ted cruz is single handedly blocking federal funding from reaching the people of flint and at the front of the pack for the republican presidential nomination is donald trump  a corrupt businessman  who is way more similar to rick snyder than gop leaders would like to admit  trump wants to bring the gop s disastrous agenda for running government like a business to the entire country if trump s policies of hate and violence aren t enough to give you the chills  his agenda to run government like a business had better if we don t learn from what happened in flint  republican leaders will bring this same dangerous agenda to every city  town and state in the country  with similarly disastrous consequences image credit  gop elephant from wikimedia commons  i love spreadsheets mug via flickr
