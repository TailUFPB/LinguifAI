for the first four years of barack obama s presidency i chided him for being too nice to the stupid part of america  as they spread ridiculous conspiracy theories about him   that he s really from kenya  that he once worked as a  gay prostitute  to support his cocaine habit  that he s secretly a shapeshifting lizard person  and  yes  that he is coming for every single gun any day now   the president opted to sit back and absorb the attacks as he focused on more important issues  eventually  it seems  he realized that as long as he entertained such monumentally stupid notions without taking a few minutes of his time to obliterate them those who spend their lives spewing such nonsense will not give him the opportunity to focus on what is actually important lately  the claws have come out  the president is no longer willing to simply accept the lies spread by the nra  fox news  republican politicians  and other right wing groups without stepping in to correct the record  gun shop owner doug rhude is a product of the misinformation throws around by the right  during a q a session following pbs news hour  we were treated to the perfect example of what happens when misinformation  lies  and bigotry are allowed to bounce around a bubble for the better part of a decade knowing that we apply common sense to other issues in our society  specifically like holding irresponsible people accountable for their actions when they drink and drive and kill somebody  and we do that without restricting control of cars and cells phones to the rest of us  the good guys  why then do you and hillary want to control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers  gun owners and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us  the good guys  instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actions as is customary  rhude used chicago as his go to example of something  demanding to know why  thugs   the go to conservative replacement word for  n ggers   in the city are hell bent on murdering each other  after taking a moment to process the almost off the scale stupidity contained in rhude s statement question  obama politely yet brutally hit him with a massive truth bomb first of all  the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell bent on taking away folks  guns is just not true and i don t care how many times the nra says it  i m about to leave office  there have been more guns sold since i have been president than just about any time in u s  history  there are enough guns for every man  woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever  ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners  so it s just not true  what i have said is precisely what you suggested  which is  why don t we treat this like every other thing that we use   obama continued  pointing to another favorite right wing go to topic  auto fatality rates  previously  conservatives were able to mindlessly point out that  more people are killed by cars  than guns  unfortunately for them and fortunately for the rest of us  regulations and laws have decreased the automobile fatality rate to beneath the level of gun violence  the auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously  drastically  since i was a kid   obama said  asking rhetorically what is the cause of that  the president informed rhude that   thanks to numerous regulations  lots of studies  and a strong and continuing effort    we have been able to reduce the number of people who die in cars  no one took everyone s cars away   we simply arrived at the common sense decision to actually deal with the problem  we are not allowed  to do any of that when it comes to guns because if you propose anything  it is suggested that we re trying to take away gun rights and impose martial law   obama pointed out  adding that we can t so much as study gun violence because republicans in congress have actually passed laws preventing this public health issue from being researched  the notion is that by studying it the same way we do with traffic accidents somehow it s going to lead to everyone s guns being confiscated   obama pointed out  i just came from a meeting today in the situation room in which i got people who we know have been on isil web sites  living here in the united states  u s  citizens  and we re allowed to put them on the no fly list when it comes to airlines  but because of the national rifle association  i cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun   the president told rhude   this is somebody who is a known isil sympathizer  and if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much   as many weapons and ammo as he can  nothing s prohibiting him from doing that  even though the fbi knows who that person is  then he dropped the hammer so  sir  i just have to say  respectfully  that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws  there is a way for us to make sure that lawful  responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting  hunting  protecting yourself  but the only way we re going to do that is if we don t have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the second amendment  and that s how the issue too often gets framed while it is unlikely that rhude  or any other right wingers who heard the president s words  learned a single thing  one thing is for certain  it s nice to see barack obama standing up for himself watch it yourself below  featured image via video screen captures
