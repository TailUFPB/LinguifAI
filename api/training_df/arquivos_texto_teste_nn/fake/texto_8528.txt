the rachel maddow show attempted to reach out to maine governor paul lepage s office to see if he would be delivering his annual state of the state speech this year  after threatening he wouldn t do it   instead of getting a response to that simple question  the governor s office decided to make things really weird  not only did the governor and his aides not answer the question  but they made complete fools of themselves in the process  it was a war of words  to say the least here is the question they thought was so horrible  hi  wanted to see if the governor has made a decision about whether or not he will give the state of the state address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter  do you have any information on that decision yet  thanks  the very first message maddow got back was  why does rachel maddow have such an unnatural obsession with governor lepage  her neurotic fixation on his is kind of bizarre  what happened after that is just a back and forth of sheer awkwardness while it is true that maddow has reported on governor lepage  and probably not in the most favorable light  that is the job of a national reporter after all  and   he s made a lot of stupid statements  of course  a liberal show is going to laugh at someone like lepage for those comments  she reports on the news  it would have been very easy for lepage s office to say  we re not sure yet   leaving maddow almost nowhere to go with the exchange  even if she was trying to troll him surely the governor and his aides must have known that this is precisely the last thing they would want to do to someone who commands an audience of millions  not very smart  then again  tea party republicans aren t the brightest  either featured image via screen capture
