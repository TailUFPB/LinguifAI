it s been more than three weeks since a group of terrorists  led by ammon bundy  took over oregon s malheur wildlife sanctuary  over that relatively short period of time  it appears the militia members have gone from mentally unbalanced to certifiably insane over the course of the terrorist occupation  various members of the group have posted various videos of themselves  including one that shows them taking down  hidden cameras  that are in plain site the militants recently posted a video of themselves angrily  discovering  boxes of native american artifacts in the basement of the wildlife refuge  which is exactly where they were left by the burns pauite tribe that helped categorize them before that there was the video of militia member jon ritzheimer flipping his shit over an assortment of dildos and dicks that he got in the mail but the most recent video to be published by a member of the group is the most insane yet it shows a militia member named kelly gneiting challenging new jersey governor chris christie to some kind of sumo duel  gneiting is dressed in what appears to be nothing but his underwear the video appears to be the group s attempt at a response to statements made by christie earlier this month  christie said  laws matter   and  laws have to be enforced   which in right wing crazy language clearly means  kill them all  in the video  gneiting invites christie to  put on a diaper  and  slap bellies  with him there s been a lot of speculation about how the militia men have been spending their time over the past few weeks  isolated from society  with no one to turn to for comfort but each other  the terrorists have spawned more than a few brokeback mountain spoofs there s even a twitter based homoerotic fiction story  thanks to colin meloy of the decemberists gneiting no doubt thought that inviting the governor of new jersey to  slap bellies  with him  while  wearing a diaper   would be a good way to make people stop questioning his sexuality on twitter watch the video below  via kelly gneiting on youtube featured image via video screen capture
