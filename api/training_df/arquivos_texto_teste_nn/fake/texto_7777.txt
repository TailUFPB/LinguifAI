fox news host bill o reilly finally lost a years long battle with his own children over his right to have custody of them  a new york appeals court put an end to the protracted family battle by affirming a lower court s decision that o reilly s teenage children don t have to see him if they don t want to and that they can live full time with their mother  maureen mcphilmy this is quite a slap in the face for o reilly  a man who never hestitated to lecture  mostly african american  parents on how to raise their families  even while privately fighting his ex wife and his own children  the pundit felt brazenly self assured in telling his viewers that letting their children listen to beyonce causes teen pregnancy  in   he wrote an op ed suggesting liberal parents being too gentle with their kids has led to almost all of society s ills  he used miley cyrus twerking at the mtv music awards as an example of course  this being fox  poor parents were an even more frequent target  here is a typically shameful exchange o reilly had with a guest in  o reilly  ok  let s take your situation  all right  from what i understand from our research of you  in san diego  when you were growing up  there was a six month period in   where you were hungry  is that correct  as a child johnson huston  i was homeless o reilly  you were homeless and hungry johnson huston  yes o reilly  and that is because your mother   no father  right johnson huston  father wasn t around o reilly  ok  your mother was an alcoholic  is that true johnson huston  she had alcohol and drug issues  yes o reilly  ok  and drugs issues  now  my point is  i feel terrible for you that you had to go through that  i really do  and i give literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities to help kids who are in your circumstance  you should know that johnson huston  thank you and i appreciate it o reilly  but that s not society s fault that your mother was a drug addict and alcoholic and you didn t have a father  that s not my fault  but that was my point and it was clearly made but while o reilly loves to take the moral high ground when lecturing his guests and audience  at home there is reason to believe he is an unequivocal monster  the  angry  persona he plays for his fox news crowd apparently doesn t go away when the cameras stop rolling  during the legal battle  all of o reilly s skeletons came out of his closet and the picture was disturbing  in one example  leaked to the press  o reilly s young daughter told a forensic examiner that she had watched o reilly brutally assault her mom in a fit of rage according to a source familiar with the facts of the case  a court appointed forensic examiner testified at a closed hearing that o reilly s daughter claimed to have witnessed her father dragging mcphilmy down a staircase by her neck  apparently unaware that the daughter was watching later  o reilly attempted to destroy his ex wife s reputation  going so far as to attempt to use his clout as a republican celebrity to get her excommunicated from the roman catholic church the new york appeals court seems to have taken this pattern of abuse into account when they issued their ruling viewing the totality of the circumstances  there is a sound and substantial basis for the supreme court s determination that it is in the best interests of the children for the mother to be awarded primary residential custody  particularly relevant in this case are the clearly stated preferences of the children  especially considering their age and maturity  and the quality of the home environment provided by the mother o reilly denies any and all of the allegations levied against him  but even if only some of them were true  it s probably a very good thing that his children are allowed to stay away from his influence featured image via fox news
