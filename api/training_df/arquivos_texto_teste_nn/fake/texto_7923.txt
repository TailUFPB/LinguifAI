it can likely be said that iowa is one of the whitest states in the entire nation  so white  in fact  that it seems many of the people in the state haven t come into too much contact with any people of color to notice that  no  they don t all look the same  proof of this can be found in  triumph the insult comic dog s ben carson social experiment  according to hulu  triumph goes to iowa to discover if white people tell the difference between snl comic tim meadows and presidential candidate ben carson  spoiler alert  not so much  in fact  the people who meadows came into contact with while dressed as carson really didn t seem to notice the difference between the men whatsoever  he spoke with several people at a local diner  some who even seemed very excited to finally be meeting who they though was carson meadows was so convincing that he was able to persuade one of the folks at the diner to  stab  him in the belt buckle  just like from the infamous fable carson had told time and time again from his childhood  however  this time   meadows made it seem like he was actually stabbed and left the diner in a hurry to  go to the hospital  by the end of the segment  the snl alum even had an entire arena full of people fooled as he sang the star spangled banner before a basketball game all in all  it seems as though far too many people in iowa can t tell the difference between carson and just any random black man  which is sad  yet somehow not at all surprising  featured image  youtube
