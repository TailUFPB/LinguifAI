appearing on abc s this week with host jonathan karl  donald trump was asked about if he would  categorically rule out the idea of internment camps for american muslims  let s just start out by saying that the fact that the front runner for the republican nomination for president of the united states is actually being asked this question is beyond terrifying  the reality of a trump presidency is very real  and we need to make sure we are listening to him very carefully  this includes  but is not limited to  reading between the lines of his very calculated language to dodge questions and pivot to more optically friendly topics that will put him in a more positive light amongst his rabid followers karl asked  so let me ask you  you said that islam is at war with us  a lot of people wonder  given some of your proposals  whether or not you would go the next step towards internment camps  and i know you ve never proposed that  but let me just ask you here now  would you categorically rule out the idea of internment camps for american muslims  this is when trump pulled the classic non answer of  no  but  which insinuates full well  he s not ruling anything out  and he still puts the sole blame on all muslims for not reporting things they don t see  assuming all muslims are in the know of terrorist plots being made  trump told karl  rule it out but we would have to be very vigilant  we re going to have to be very smart  we re going to have to be very rigid and very vigilant  and if we re not very  very strong and very  very smart  we have a big  big problem coming up  we ve already had the problem  check out the world trade center  ok  check out the pentagon  we ve already had the problem  but i would   i would say you have to be extremely strong  you have to keep your eyes open and by the way  muslims in our country have to report bad acts  ok  when you look at what happened in europe  in brussels  where many  many people knew this thug from last week  was living right in the midst of them  right only a few doors down from where he was living previously  they knew he was there  nobody reported him  when you hear someone say   no  but  that s like hearing someone say   i m not racist  but  and they go on to say something ridiculously racist  trump is saying he d rule out internment camps in a very quick response to then fully pivot away to blaming all muslims  keep in mind  he s already insinuated in the past that he would have  had to be there  to decide if japanese internment camps were a good idea or not during world war ii  he keeps saying no  but then always leaves open the possibility  it doesn t take much to read between the lines  unless  of course  you refuse to even look you can t blame the entirety of everyone who follows a religion for the outrageous and horrific acts of a radical few who pervert the religion to suit their own morbid desires of sadistic control over a populace  you just can t    billion people worldwide follow the religion of islam  that s  percent of the global population trump is blaming for the acts of the radical few  his simplistic and naive world view is not only extraordinarily narrow minded and stupid  but extremely dangerous we simply cannot allow trump to become president  if you re still treating his candidacy like a joke   stop  this is very scary  and will have very real consequences featured photo by john sommers ii getty images
