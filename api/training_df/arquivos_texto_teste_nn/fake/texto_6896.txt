trump made a visit to the keystone state in an effort to bolster his numbers for the upcoming pennsylvania republican primary election  while there  he managed to prove just how utterly clueless he is about literally anything that happens in the state in two very huge ways  which you will see below first came trump s incredibly outdated remark about bringing back the steel industry s lost jobs to the state  pennsylvania had a long history of major steel manufacturing  but the majority of it was lost decades ago  the jobs literally have been gone in many areas of the state for more than  years  and trump thinks that him arguing with china will bring them back as a pennsylvanian myself  i can tell you it s really something that blue collar and middle class people do not forgive easily  making what amounts to an ignorant mockery of an issue that many in the state still feel betrayed over due to massive outsourcing of industry from america  will hit trump badly   especially among his somewhat aged voter demographics that lived through those days of economic collapse if you thought that was bad  you haven t seen anything yet  trump then went on to say something even more offensive about penn state football trump asked people at the gathering   how s joe paterno  are we gonna bring that back  how about that whole deal  the silence afterwards could have been cut with a hatchet here is just a short list of what s wrong with trump s statement  joe paterno died in   we won t be bringing him back  that  whole deal  trump is talking about is a child sex scandal that was covered up within the penn state football program  where a member of the staff was literally having sex with children on campus property  joe paterno was forced out over it literally everyone in pa knows this  penn state football is like a religion to many in the state  and for trump to say what he did shows how ignorant he is about pennsylvania  insulting penn state football is something literally nobody ever did in order to win an election in the state  i can t wait to see how this turns out for him on primary day  what a joke watch trump suggest he wants to bring back a child sex scandal below featured image via video screen capture
