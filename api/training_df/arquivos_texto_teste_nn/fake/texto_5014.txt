when you think of civil rights activists  it s not likely that glenn beck will ever enter your conscious  except perhaps as a cautionary tale  it does seem  though  that he s had a moment of clarity  even an epiphany  the man who has played a large part in demonizing black lives matter finally gets it  at least he gets part of it  he gets why  all lives matter  is a really bad response in the past  beck has been especially critical of black lives matter  who he accused of inciting  terrorism  beck s comments were sparked by discussion over black lives matter protesters  recent invasion of a dartmouth college library  where the activists harassed white students  calling one girl a  filthy white bitch  they are terrorizing you   beck said of the incident   what do you think that is when   when one of the girls  who supported black lives matter at dartmouth  and she was in the library  and she was studying  and they pulled her out of her seat    she started crying  beck said filling people with  fear  is the  first step to terrorism  i think we need to start calling it that   beck concluded   we need to start being very  very clear  in the past  he even led a march for  all lives matter   things have changed somewhat  though  at least for beck  while he s still not officially a black lives matter supporter  he understands why all lives matter is stupid  in a news conference covered by the washington post  beck relayed this analogy  all of us are sitting around a table  and we re all friends   he said   it s time for dessert  and everybody gets pie except for me and you  and you say   i didn t get any pie   everybody at the table looks at you and says  i know  all pie matters   you say   but i don t have any pie  what about my pie   beck still says that the leaders of black lives matter are  communists and anti capitalists   but he says that most supporters are not and that we really need to learn to speak to each other for that  some conservatives are throwing beck under the bus  blue lives matter accused beck of pandering to black lives matter breitbart com  whose ceo was just named trump s campaign ceo  didn t like beck s analogy either  while glenn beck would like people to believe he s insightful  critics of black lives matter don t need his hectoring   wrote breitbart s lee stranahan  who is also based in dallas   the reason many people   including black critics of black lives matter like  sheriff david clarke   say  all lives matter  in response to  black lives matter  is to reject the underlying notion of identity politics  beck is not a supporter of trump  is this a sign that the  nevertrump movement can bring out a more rational right wing  conservatives are certainly in the midst of an existential crisis and many of them appear to be soul searching  whether beck has dug deep enough to find his soul or whether he happened to get his meds right that day will be sorted out over time  but for now  it s refreshing to hear someone on the right  sort of  get it featured image via j  pat carter with getty images
