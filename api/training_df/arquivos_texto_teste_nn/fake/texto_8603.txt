ted cruz is fast approaching donald trump as the most hated man in america  as gop insiders and long time public figures denounce cruz as someone nobody in congress would work with  he continues to take his campaign in directions that guarantee that democrats and independents will despise him even more  apparently  cruz thinks he can get elected with the votes of the extreme right only  which is where his platform is and will always be directed in what may be the worst case of discrimination and idiocy ever by a presidential campaign  ted cruz  donated an undisclosed amount of bottled water to residents of flint  restricting their  generosity  to people with the  right  frame of mind  cruz s campaign staff took to the streets to get much needed water to those working and visiting the fraudulent  pregnancy crisis centers  that dupe women into believing they re going to receive medical advice and treatment but are instead cornered and fed anti abortion rhetoric and religious indoctrination cruz s michigan state campaign director  wendy lynn day  announced in a facebook post begging for donations that the campaign had worked with anti abortion group flint right to life to coordinate this absolutely idiotic and ridiculously ignorant plan   the water is for  expecting moms and moms of little ones  cruz state director  wendylynnday  donating water to  flint babies both supports the city and shows  the pro life values of senator cruz    chad livengood   chadlivengood  january     pro life values  of senator cruz apparently include denying children who have already been exposed to massive amounts of lead from republican incompetence water they so desperately need because their parents aren t currently seeking anti choice counseling from a place where zealots wear lab coats to make people think they re physicians the malfunctioning moral platitudes of these people are astounding  while most of the gop field feigns ignorance to an issue they want nothing to do with  cruz  has taken a proactive role in alienating an entire city in the middle of a crisis unless they conform to the beliefs of ted cruz  pro life  ted cruz  who thinks carpet bombing whole villages full of innocent people is ok as long as you kill some terrorists along the way  hasn t personally commented on the issue  but his campaign works directly on his behalf certainly the several people who work at these madhouses are appreciative of the clean water donations while tens of thousands of others line up to receive actual charity from people who care about the already born featured image via tedcruz org  altered
