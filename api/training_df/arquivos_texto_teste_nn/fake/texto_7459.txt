we definitely live in a rape culture  and one of the most infuriating parts of that is the huge backlog of untested rape kits around the country  for instance  after detroit finally was taken to task regarding rape kits that sat for years in an old warehouse  more than  serial rapists were identified now  the state of idaho is advancing a bill that is designed to force crime labs and law enforcement to clear the backlog and stop shifting rape kits to the back burner  however  there is one sheriff in that state who is not at all happy about that  in fact  bingham county sheriff craig rowland s comments on the matter are downright infuriating  he said  i really believe the legislature needs to take a strong look at allowing law enforcement to do their job and not try to dictate what we need to do  i think they re trying to help  i really do  they need to let us decide if we re going to send the kit and when we send the kits in  because the majority of our rapes  not to say that we don t have rapes  we do  but the majority of our rapes that are called in  are actually consensual sex  this is reminiscent of old todd akin s  legitimate rape  comments  what these idiots need to realize is that if anything sexual transpires that a partner wasn t okay with  and  s he said to stop  that is the definition of rape luckily  pressure was put on rowland for his comments  and he at least attempted to apologize  however  the apology is now deleted from his facebook page  so he likely didn t mean it anyway  it can be read at jezebel rep  melissa wintrow took rowland to task for his reckless remarks  saying  many times people are focused on a woman s behavior  and the victim s response  when we should be thinking about what are we teaching men in this society  what are we teaching young boys and men about how we should not initiate or cross any physical boundary without consent  that s right  stop blaming and not believing the victim  this is why so many victims suffer in silence and don t report watch the video news report below  via local station kidk video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo playerfeatured image via video screen capture
