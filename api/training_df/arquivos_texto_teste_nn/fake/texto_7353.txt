right wing christian extremism is a cancer that is infecting american society at all levels  and the worst of it is that it has infected our school systems at an alarming level  case in point   a school board member in omaha  nebraska  who literally told atheists to  crawl back in their hellhole    all over changing the school calendar to read  winter break  instead of  christmas break  paul meyer  who sits on the millard public school board  is your typical christian extremist  hellbent on injecting his personal religious beliefs into government and ignoring the united states constitution  meyer insists that he is a little bit tired of a minute minority in this country that keeps pushing christmas out  keep pushing god out  keep pushing christ out  when the majority is still a judeo christian country   meyer went on to say  i would like to make a motion that we rename this period christmas break  and those atheists who don t like it can crawl back into their hellhole  because i  for one  will not put my lord  my god  aside for a few atheists  and if they don t like it  the aclu doesn t like it  the heck with them  aside for this  another example is the fact that meyer was on the wrong side when a state board of education member pat macpherson wrote racist opinions about president obama  regarding the school calendar issue  no one seconded meyer s move to rename the winter break  christmas break   and now his religious intolerance has rendered the break nameless  meyer went on to say  the responsibility of this board is to set a good example for the kids of this state  but what you show these kids is that the first amendment is null and void  and does not apply to anyone if the speech nazis disagree  so in other words  this guy sincerely believes that a  good example  is the idea that america is a christian nation and no one else should get a voice  that christian values should be everywhere  the constitution be damned this man needs to be kicked off the school board  as he has no business having any influence whatsoever over school children featured image via omaha com
