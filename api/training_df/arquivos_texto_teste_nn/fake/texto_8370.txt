the republican party has spent more than seven years pushing anti government ideas  after president obama was elected in   there was an explosion of right wing domestic terror organizations in the usa  the southern poverty law center released a study that found these organizations experienced an eightfold growth from    groups  to  s   radical militias  a young man in tampa  florida belonged to one of these  patriotic  militias and now he is in jail   for making bombs a potential right wing terrorist was arrested this week after his business partner reported that he d seen bombs inside his house  kenneth ray o neill recently went to his partner michael ramos  home and saw a crate with about half a dozen pipe bombs in it  ramos  who s a member of the united states patriot army   told o neill that he made the bombs from materials purchased on amazon with his girlfriend s credit card  according to fox  news ramos said he made the  black powder  filler with supplies and chemicals purchased from amazon com  then added  bird shot  to the powder  written in the affidavit  ramos said  it would kill the neighbors if one of the bombs went off  o neill told police that he warned ramos that if he did not get rid of the bombs  he was going to go to the police  ramos became hostile when his partner and his brother  ryan o neill  issued the ultimatum  according to kenneth  ramos was standing next to an ak  assault rifle when the conversation took place  ryan calmed ramos down and the brothers left   that s when the authorities were informed on monday search warrants were executed on the  patriot s  home and agents found eight pipe bombs  tear gas and smoke grenades  they also found the ak   a pistol and a large quantity of ammo after his arrest ramos told police that he had the bombs for preparedness protective  reasons a look at ramos  facebook and you can see that he is clearly a nutjob  i m sure he s totally harmless and just needs security  right this is a common excuse among the insane right  they claim that they stockpile weapons because they need to protect themselves  but it s not exactly clear who they are protecting themselves from  if it s from obama you have to wonder why  it s been seven years since he was elected to office and he has tried exactly zero times to take over the world and confiscate their guns i imagine it is really hard to walk through life with so much fear  and stupidity  thankfully  ramos  business partner did the right thing and contacted police before someone was hurt  featured image from facebook
