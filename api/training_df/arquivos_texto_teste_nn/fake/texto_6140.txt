like a stubborn cold that just doesn t seem to go away  sarah palin  for some reason or another  is still around and apparently relevant in our media  you know  the same  lame stream media  that she likes to claim silences her or mixes up what she says when they just quote her verbatim  the same media that asks her  gotcha questions   which are really just questions she doesn t know the answer to and caught her looking like an idiot now  while appearing with donald trump at a rally in san diego  california  palin told the crowd that despite the media treating trump like a joke at the beginning  he s still here  and not only is he here  he s going to be the republican nominee for president of the united states honestly  i don t know why she s complaining about the media and trump considering it s been a non stop trump show media circus since he announced his candidacy last summer however  it was what palin told the media  and everyone else who thought trump was a joke  to do with trump s nomination that was utterly nauseating   to say the least she said of her  and apparently our  golden wrecking ball  after trashing the media  weeelll  he is now though  he is now we the people s nominee  so  suck it up  cupcake  okay  first of all  he is not  we the people s nominee   he is the republican nominee  not representative of all of the nation s people  secondly  telling us to suck up anything in regards to trump will have most of the nation reaching for a barf bag oh  and palin also said trump  wrecked what needed to be wrecked in order to shine light on the shenanigans   well  he certainly wrecked the republican party and any hope of ever respecting them again  so sure  he wrecked what needed to be wrecked  however  he s not at all what the country needs  and he needs to stay as far away from the oval office as possible  it s up to us to make sure he s stays out of the white house watch her words in no particular order here https   www facebook com politico videos  featured image via video screen capture
