released in september   this short video about the power of giving instantly went viral  once you ve seen it  you ll understand why produced by truemove h in thailand  the three minute video reminds us of how taking care of others comes full circle  touching our own lives in ways that we cannot begin to foresee it s especially relevant in today s political climate  where the conversation is too often dominated by ayn rand worshiping right wing politicians  accompanied by a choir of religious leaders who feed the masses a poison concoction of fear and hate  served up in a glittering bowl of egotism and self righteousness at the beginning of the video  a young boy has been caught stealing  an outraged  unmerciful shopkeeper is in the process of shoving him around in the street  screaming and ranting as she does so but the owner of a nearby cafe intervenes  he gives the shopkeeper money out of his own pocket to cover what the boy stole  he then sends his young daughter into his own store for vegetable soup  after learning the boy s mother is sick for those who haven t seen how the video ends  watch it below  courtesy of elon iva on youtube   you may want to have a box of tissues nearby  in a larger context  the story told on this video is one of social responsibility for those on the right who are constantly asking  why should i have to whether we re talking about giving to the poor or investing in public education  there s a message in this video that we all should pay attention to the right promotes the false idea that a society full of ayn rand individualists can be healthy and functional  according to that way of thinking  other people s lives aren t our responsibility  we don t need to invest healthcare or support programs that  enable the freeloading poor   the only person that matters is  me  myself and i  what the right consistently fails to understand is that when you live in a society  every person is connected in some way or another the video especially speaks to the need to invest in public education  while it was once seen as a  christian mission  to make sure that every child has equal access to education  today s right wing christians view education as an  evil   yet  just a few decades ago the christian church believed that every child should learn to read and write  how else can a child read the bible but the church is now a corporation  and as we can clearly see by examining  christian corporations  involved in things like educaas the video shows  investing in a child s future is anything but a  waste   it s an investment in our own future  and in the future of our society the school to prison pipeline that we ve set up in the united states is costing our society hundreds of billions of dollars every single year  instead of investing in the future of our country s most vulnerable citizens  we cut funding for the programs that benefit kids the most at the same time we create more and more laws  with harsher and harsher punishments  pouring more and more of our tax dollars into the prison industrial complex  while taking more and more away from public education what we see in our society today is the result of our decade s long experiment with right wing  tough on crime  policies and ayn randian ideals of individualism  it doesn t work we have fewer and fewer students graduating with the skills needed to become doctors or scientists or mathematicians  the number of students enrolling in college is also consistently declining  at the same time  every year in the u s  more than two million young people enter into the juvenile justice system  the majority of these  criminals    percent  are not arrested for violent crimes last week teachers working for the detroit public school system released shocking pictures of the deplorable conditions inside the city s schools  if we need a vision of america under the influence of right wing ideology  we can look to detroit to see the future educating and caring for children used to be a priority to americans  but that system has been replaced with a new system which prefers mass incarceration this video is an important reminder that when we invest in our society s children  somewhere down the road we will reap the benefits  on the other hand  when we throw children away because of petty crimes  we re throwing away possibilities that we may not even be able to imagine  featured image credit  video scree capture truemove h via youtube
