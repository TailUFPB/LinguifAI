you know what would be really stupid  if a group of legislators got together and said   hey  you know what would be a good idea  allowing violent people who beat their wives and children to openly carry firearms   this idea seems so ridiculous that even the most die hard second amendment cheerleaders could not stand behind it   but that s exactly what happened in the oklahoma house of representatives thursday house bill   authored by state rep  jeff coody  r insane   that carrying a firearm is a right guaranteed by both the constitution and god  according to coody and the bill s co authors  bible believing christians have a right to defend themselves  coody says that the second amendment is the most important thin in the bill of rights  which can not be infringed upon   even  of course  if someone beats his entire family with a crowbar  it s the ultimate freedom bill regarding open carry   coody said of his bill  with rep jeff bennett adding that it s our god given right to defend ourself  is it a good idea to let anyone carry a gun  even if they don t know how to use it or even where the safety is   democratic rep  emily virgin asked during debate on the bill   but coody shut her down with a burst of stupidity  the key word is  let   somehow we ve gotten the idea that the government has to give us permission to exercise our freedoms  that is totally antithetical to me  the bill precludes felons from open carry  but does not prevent those under domestic violence protective orders from waving their firearms around  in addition  it does not require safety course  training  or anything that a reasonable person would consider necessary for responsible firearm use  asked why gun owners are not required to receive training  coody explained  because driving is privilege  the second amendment is a constitutional right  but what about my safety   rep  mike brown asked   doesn t the government have a responsibility to protect me  no   coody said  asserting that more guns make people safer even though rapes in oklahoma are at a  year high since the state passed a concealed carry law  coody might be interested to know that regularions in the automobile industry drastically reduced deaths by car between  and   proving that reasonable safety regulations can have a very positive effect  interestingly  the government did not enact a massive car grab  and people are still able to drive if they receive the proper training and licensing   just as it should be with guns while we might expect that republicans could compromise  they have already done so  the bill originally removed licensing and training requirements for concealed carry  as well  the bill passed with an astounding   vote  with  abstaining coody s legislation will now go to the state senate  where hopefully it will be modified to include training requirement  or at least prevent domestic abusers from marching with their gun on display  feet from their victims  houses  or killed altogether  if that doesn t happen  rep  virgin has a sobering prediction  guns and domestic violence are main problems  women die of it every day  increasing access to guns without training  without background checks  women will die because of that  watch a report on this dangerous bill below featured image via thinkprogress shouse law group
