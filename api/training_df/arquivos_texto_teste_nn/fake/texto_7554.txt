first off  if you re reading this and have never been wrong  look in the mirror and repeat   i m full of myself   truth is  we all make mistakes  some bigger than others  but owning up to those mistakes shows a bigger strength of character  to be blunt  admitting you re wrong is far better than insisting you re right so  when hillary clinton appeared on msnbc and praised former president reagan alongside nancy reagan for their help in starting a  national conversation  about hiv and aids  you can only imagine people angrily took to their social media accounts to call her out  hell  as a gay woman  i did too  hillary clinton  the reagans  particularly nancy  helped start  a national conversation  about hiv and aids  https   t co   msnbc   msnbc  march    as most of us know  reagan wasn t just awful regarding hiv and aids  he was outright horrific  with his white house even calling aids the  gay plague   clearly  hillary was incorrect in her assessment of the reagans regarding aids  there s no doubt about that and about an hour later  hillary acknowledged that she was wrong  noting how utterly incorrect she was in her original statement  she wrote  while the reagans were strong advocates for stem cell research and finding a cure for alzheimer s disease  i misspoke about their record on hiv and aids  for that  i m sorry  hillary clinton s statement on her comments about the reagans  record on hiv and aids  pic twitter com   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  march    many  this apology hasn t been enough and have been using this mistake as a tool to attack her  however  let s think about that  here s a woman who  quite honestly  cannot afford to make a mistake in speaking pretty much at any time  and she s completely owning her mistake  she doesn t double down on it  like many politicians  even recently  have done  she doesn t say it was a  gotcha question  that forced her to say the wrong thing  she owned it  and owning a mistake  no matter the size  is actually a quality you want in a leader  to be frank  you don t want someone who can t recognize their blunders  you don t want someone who s going to hold their ego above what is right  you want someone who is accountable for their actions  which is exactly what hillary just did   she owned her mistake  and on top of it  apologized  when was the last time you heard a politician apologize for something that they did wrong she fucked up   owned it  i guess  it s the ones who will never apologize  trump  dubya  that are dangerous  https   t co   patton oswalt   pattonoswalt  march    s the thing  if you want to be the sort of person with the maturity of a schoolyard bully and use this to throw hillary under the bus  it only serves to make you look like the jerk  and i know a good portion of people reading this will call me hillary apologist  do what you will  however  what happened  happened  she owned it  she apologized  still waiting for an apology from several others  why not focus your efforts there featured image  twitter
