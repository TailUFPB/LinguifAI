the democratic party has descended into madness  democratic voters are split  the convention is going to be a disaster  bernie sanders may take his supporters and walk away  thus handing trump the presidency these are the headlines the mainstream media has been peddling now for months  as the omega primary creeps up  with california and new jersey up for grabs   it s becoming evident that one candidate will walk away the nominee this  of course  has incensed members of the opposite candidate   and naturally so  and of course the media has pounced on these feelings  and has ran nonstop coverage in an effort to tear the party apart no matter how loud the pundits scream  and no matter how blistering the op eds are  don t buy into the hype  because there is one truth that the media doesn t want to report on the democratic party is more united now than it was in    and obama won in a landslide  the one outlet that seems to have the guts to report on it is vox  not surprisingly in fact  what the mainstream media doesn t want to remind you is that in may    percent of democrats overall said they wouldn t vote for obama  today  may   only  percent of democrats say they won t support clinton when clinton dropped out in    percent of her supporters said they would not vote for then candidate barack obama  today  as it becomes increasingly likelier than clinton will become the nominee  only  percent of sanders supporters claim they will not support her candidacy should she win  a number that is shrinking  as vox puts it   obama needed  in other words  to overcome a hurdle that was twice as big as the one facing clinton  and they also noted last but by no means least  mccain was a broadly popular figure with considerable cross party appeal  he wound up losing pretty badly in the end due to a very unfavorable economic situation and a campaign that saw him abandoning most of his crossover positions  but as of late may it really wasn t totally crazy to imagine a hawkish  domestically moderate white democrat feeling that he had a lot in common with mccain  especially if there was a little covert racial bias in the mix and for democrats freaking out over trump overcoming clinton in a handful of polls  at this time in  and   mccain and romney respectively overtook president obama in the polls multiple times the explanation for that is  presently  the republican party is more  united  now than the democrats  considering they have one candidate while the democrats have two still running bottom line  democrats are smarter than the media conglomerates think  and they see firsthand the risk of a trump presidency  they aren t going to blow it featured image via joe readle getty images
