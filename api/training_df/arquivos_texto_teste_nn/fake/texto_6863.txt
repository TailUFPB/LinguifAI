an unfortunate part of modern day politics is the fact that money is far too involved in our elections  yet  until citizens united and big money is no longer allowed in elections  it s a necessary evil  even president obama held    and still holds   fundraisers  another such fundraiser was thrown for hillary clinton by george clooney and his wife amal  and even clooney himself said the price of attending  alongside the practice itself  is  obscene  clinton s rival in the democratic race  sen  bernie sanders  has definitely shown that it may not be necessary to hold such big money fundraisers so long as you have enough grassroots support behind you  so  whether or not he wins the nomination  his legacy will be an example of things to come in the future  and how elections should be conducted as far as raising funds  but until citizens united is overturned  and until we can get big money out of elections  there will be fundraisers  it is what it is  it s the nature of the beast however  with this latest fundraiser thrown by the clooneys came a counter fundraiser thrown by clooney s neighbor howard gold  whose family founded the  cents only chain of stores  part of the fundraiser protest was a moment when the crowd threw money at hillary s motorcade as it passed by and it was very real money that  according to dan merica of cnn  was   withdrawn by howard gold himself the money was real  and was withdrawn from a bank today by howard gold  the sanders counter fundraiser host  https   t co   dan merica   danmericacnn  april    seems  however  that these protesters didn t throw the money on clinton  but rather her secret service agents funny part about this  the car that was showered the most was full of secret service agents  not clinton  https   t co   dan merica   danmericacnn  april     the point was still clearly made the clooneys have every right to hold fundraisers for their candidate of choice  just as the protesters have every right to speak up in dissent of big money fundraisers  and as so long as they are invited  as they were by gold  and not trespassing on private property  more of these protests are bound to pop up as the election heats up towards a potential democratic nominee this has definitely been an entertaining election cycle to say the least  watch the video here of the money being thrown sanders supporters outside clinton s clooney fundraiser in la shower her motorcade in     pic twitter com   dan merica   danmericacnn  april    image via video screen capture
