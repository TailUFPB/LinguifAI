on february   fox news business brought on the president and founder of the human rights foundation  thor halvorssen  to discuss democratic socialism fox news  clear intention was to provide supportive evidence to the pejorative narrative that bernie sanders is a socialist  and that socialism is similar to communism  in order to scare naive viewers into not supporting bernie sanders  senator sanders wants america to be a socialist country and even liberals are blasting his agenda   said host of fox business network s intelligence report  trish regan  in her introduction of halvorssen halvorssen begins by discussing some of the various definitions of socialism  describing the academic socialism as nearly synonymous with communism  and the differences between countries with socialist governments  like sweden and denmark  and socialist authoritarian governments  like venezuela then thor halvorssen drops a bomb on fox news   i actually made the largest contribution allowable to the campaign of bernie sanders   he said  halvorssen then cited the millions of dollars in donations hillary clinton received from countries who notoriously violate human rights  such as saudi arabia  oman  algeria  bahrain  and qatar  before getting cut off by ragan  halvorssen slammed trump for his embrace of russia s dictator like president  vladimir putin  i d rather have a democratic socialist than a supporter of dictators in the white house   halvorssen concluded halvorssen s interview helped dispel some myths surrounding bernie sanders candidacy  sanders  biggest obstacle to the white house  then  is the lack of public understanding of what  democratic socialist  means  you can be sure that the big money forces he attacks will do their best to sow confusion over that term  especially by only using the word  socialist    wrote pulitzer prize winning journalist  david cay johnston  in a recent article for the new york daily news   if sanders wins the democratic party nomination  we can expect all sorts of television commercials wrongly describing him  as trump has done  as a communist it s unlikely we will ever get to test that proposition  hillary clinton remains the heavy favorite in the primary  for a host of reasons  but what we do  know for sure is that our current elected federal leaders are not pursuing the economic policies that most americans  including most republicans  favor  and those are the policies of the sanders campaign  halvorssen later tweeted in celebration his successful trolling of fox news  foxnews probably expected me to condemn  berniesanders  i reveal largest contribution allowable https   t co   feelthebern  thor halvorssen   thorhalvorssen  march    featured image courtesy of addicting info
