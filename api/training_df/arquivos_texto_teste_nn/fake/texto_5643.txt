bill maher finished friday s episode of real time by absolutely destroying the always failed experiment that is republican economics  it wasn t that hard  really  all he did was compare kansas  a state controlled by far right lunatics  to california  a state that purged the republican politicians that were strangling it california raised taxes on the wealthy  a lot  and our economy is booming  we just passed france and india to become  all by ourselves  the world s  largest economy how did california get its act together  simple  they put democrats in charge of everything  democrats  from governor on down  control every office and voting body in this state  so we can really study what happens when liberal policies are tried unimpeded  and the only thing i have to say to republicans about that is  scoreboard  bitches  meanwhile  deep red states like kansas and louisiana are doing great  if you re a billionaire whereas states like kansas and louisiana that went back to the ol  trickle down theory of  cut taxes on the rich and they ll always do the right  are a financial catastrophe here s the deliciously mean segment of real time featured image via screencap
