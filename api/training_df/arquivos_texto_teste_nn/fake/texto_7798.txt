over the course of this latest presidential campaign there has been a lot said about both sides by both sides of the democratic primary  both hillary clinton and bernie sanders are formidable candidates and stand heads above any republican candidate running  supporters on both sides are very passionate about their candidate  and for the most part  when it comes down to it  agree on what needs to be done  just differing on how to go about implementing those changes in another great example of both sides agreeing on something very important  bernie sanders tweeted out   america s first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the kkk   a statement that is absolutely true  and retweeting in agreement was none other than hillary clinton herself via twittersanders is exactly right  we cannot have a candidate like donald trump  who retweets mussolini quotes  and doesn t condemn the kkk  anywhere near the oval office  it s not only a horrible prospect  but outright terrifying  it would set the progress made by the u s  back over half a century clinton is right to back up this statement  because this is something  no matter which candidate you support  you should be able to easily and fervently agree with  it s good to see the candidates standing with one another on this subject  because it is so utterly important  either candidate would be a great president  and we need to remember to vote blue in november to keep trump out of the white house featured image  instagram instagram twitter
