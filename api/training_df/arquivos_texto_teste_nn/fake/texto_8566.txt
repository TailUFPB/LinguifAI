ammosexuals also tend to be anti gay bigots  so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a chik fil a location while most of us boycott the christian chicken chain out of sheer principle  but not the  year old victim of his own hubris  he was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations  hey  even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then  right   when the glock pistol went off  luckily for the unnamed miscreant  the bullet only grazed his leg  hardly a fatal injury  of course  but still quite unfortunate and dangerous local station whoh tweeted the story  but  at this time  there is not much information  the victim was able walk out of the chik fil a location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care  the injury is not serious  and  of course  no charges will be filed breaking  fairfield twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the chick fil a  pic twitter com   wmoh newswire   wmohnewswire  april    s the real rub  though  this guy luckily only shot himself  however  how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident  too many to count  really  this is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership  not everyone who is eligible to buy  own  and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so this guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded  even in a public restroom in a self proclaimed family restaurant  and he was injured as a result  what about next time  though  and  believe me  there will be a next time  no one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one off shooter  in fact  if  he were any sort of normal  responsible gun owner  he d have never been pulling his pants up in a chik fil a bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place featured image via video screen capture from ny daily news
