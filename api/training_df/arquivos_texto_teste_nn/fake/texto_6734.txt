if i were to tell you that republicans simply hate regular american citizens  that wouldn t be news  to suggest that they just wish the poor  criminals  and other less advantaged segments of society would do them a favor and just die already  wouldn t come as a shock either however  what is a bit shocking is to hear a republican say it so boldly and in such a smug and self righteous manner maine s republican governor  paul lepage  just vetoed a bill that would allow pharmacists to provide anti overdose drugs for use on victims without a prescription  if that isn t  bad enough  wait till you read his reason why pro life  yeah right lepage proudly announced his support of increased overdose deaths  saying that using anti overdose drugs  serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction  lepage said that the drug  naxolone  doesn t  save lives    it only extends them until the next overdose a governor of a u s  state just literally said that he would rather his own citizens die than be able to get assistance with a drug that could prevent death long enough to get them to a hospital  how the hell is he still in office why stop there  why not just say all medical treatment or medicine should be made unavailable because it only extends life  got meningitis  tough luck  you will only grow old and die anyway some day  cancer  screw you  go die in the corner it s important to remember too  that there is currently a serious heroin use epidemic going on in northeastern states  maine in particular  having this drug available without a prescription  to be kept in the case of an emergency  could mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people who struggle with addiction paul lepage is the perfect personification of all the hate  contempt  greed  and joy in the harm of others that is at the rotten heart of modern american conservatism  pro life  my ass watch rachel rip the hell out of a genuinely terrible republican below featured image via video screen capture
