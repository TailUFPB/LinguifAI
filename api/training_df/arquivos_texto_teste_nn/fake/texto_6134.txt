earlier this week  donald trump made a speech in bismarck  north dakota to talk about his energy policy  while it might have been refreshing for the business mogul to actually talk about a policy instead of attacking his democratic rivals  saying offensive things about women and minorities or retweeting white supremacists  it s safe to say trump s supporters should hold off on getting too excited over anything he says   because it s all false promises during trump s speech  trump promised american voters that he would cancel the crucial  paris agreement that binds all nations to the common goal of tackling climate change  and that he d  rescind  the epa rules that president barack obama set up to decrease emissions from coal fired power plants  if it sounds improbable  that s because it pretty much is   and no one was faster to point this out that cnn s chris cuomo on friday  in speaking with trump s campaign senior advisor sarah huckabee sanders  cuomo criticized the gop candidate for his sloppy ideas  he said  donald trump put out a big speech about his energy policy  about coal  about oil  about regulation  and the criticism of it is that he proposed a lot of things that can t be done  you can t get rid of all of the epa regulations  you can t just make coal as huge as it once was  there are good and bad reasons for that  fair criticisms that the proposal can t do what donald trump says it will do  huckabee sanders argued that the environmental protection agency has to be  reined in and brought back down   she said  i think there are some big things you can do  and exactly what donald trump said is we need to move to an all of the above approach  the obama administration and his energy policy has been job killing   raised energy costs across america  has been horrible for our country  so we ve got to go back to where we put all options on the table  huckabee sanders continued to diss obama and added that  we ve got to absolutely reverse what has taken place over the last eight years under the obama administration by taking away the energy independence that americans have enjoyed and making us more dependent on foreign energy and go back to where we can energize our own country on our own  cuomo fired back  stating that the epa wasn t perfect  just like  every government agency   he continued  but reducing fossil fuel dependence is a very popular thing in america  and that s a big part of the regulations  and in terms of energy independence  the united states right now puts out  percent of its oil needs  i mean  i guess you could go to  percent  but the idea that we re somehow  you know  really deficient in terms of how much of our own needs we provide for  it s just not true   huckabee sanders continued to try and counter attack  but cuomo shut her down every time with realistic scenarios and facts  you can watch cuomo blast trump s policies below  trump s energy policy speech came just a day before trump told drought stricken californians that the extreme water shortage they ve been experiencing doesn t really exist  and offered a conspiracy theory as an alternative explanation  clearly  trump isn t someone that we can trust for environmental or energy issues featured image is a screenshot
