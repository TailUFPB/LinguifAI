is it utter contempt  or incredible stupidity  actually  it s probably both  republicans are well known for their utter contempt of every other person that exists who doesn t give them tons of money  the latest example of this phenomenon is just impossibly stupid as you will read below idaho s republican governor  butch otter  said something so stupid that i think it means he s too stupid to be able to understand just how ridiculous it sounds  the statement came in response to the republican controlled state legislature not being able to figure out if it s a good idea to expand medicaid  it would help   idahoans to not be forced to make the choice between medical bill induced bankruptcy or death  somehow this is a difficult choice governor otter  re asserting his dominant position as the alpha stupid person of the state s right wing clown show  said this  i see plenty of people that die every day in hospitals and they have insurance  and they re in the hospital  but they still die  source  boise state public radiootter then went on to contradict his own republican speaker of the state house  the governor said that there would be no special legislative sessions to address the severe coverage gap for the people of idaho  implying that he doesn t feel its worth considering  the speaker  though  had promised there was a  firm commitment  by the idaho house to do something about the severe lack of medical coverage for so many in the state  so  which is it going to be conflicting statements aside  what the governor said was just amazingly stupid  he literally is saying that it s pointless to help people afford to see a doctor because of the fact that some people who have seen a doctor at some point still die just what the hell can you possibly say to something like this this is one of the reasons we can t get anything done in this country  republicans make it completely impossible to have any form of factual conversation about anything because they adopt a position completely devoid of all logic  you can t argue with stupid featured image via youtube screen capture
