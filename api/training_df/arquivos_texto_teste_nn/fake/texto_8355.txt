former president jimmy carter denounced what he called the  legal bribery afflicting our political system  turning the presidential race into one that is influenced by a few billionaires  lobby groups  and corporate oligarchs who sponsor candidates by giving billions in exchange for influencing the candidates  policy platform  in an interview with the bbc  carter said  the erroneous ruling of the supreme court  where millionaires and billionaires can put in unlimited amounts of money in to the campaign  it gives legal bribery a chance to prevail  because almost all the candidates  whether they are honest or not  democrat or republican  rely on these massive amounts of money in order to campaign   president carter has a very important point and one that should be taken into account  the democracy of the country is threatened and eroded when an elected official  especially a president  owes a handful of individuals who finance his her presidential campaign favors take for example  the nra  the nra is a very well funded and organized lobby group that lobbies washington officials in favor of lax guns laws  that  in turn  means easier access to guns  which translates into sales  some people get rich as a result of gun sales  but the country collectively suffers  as has been documented  with record numbers of shootings around the country another example is individual donations  republican candidate marco rubio s sponsor  the billionaire norman braman  has donated    million to rubio s campaign  braman is staunchly pro israel and has financed the building of settlements in the palestinian west bank  israeli settlements are illegal under international law  and us policy condemns settlement building in the west bank  yet  you can bet that if rubio should become president  braman will cash in his chips by ensuring that rubio goes along with israel s illegal activities  in the end  we will continue to have a mess in the middle eat  which hurts the region and the united states the bottom line is that billions of dollars are being spent by candidates to win the presidency and much of that money comes from a few individuals  the only way to change that is to create a constitutional amendment that overturns the citizens united supreme court ruling that allows individuals and corporations to contribute unlimited sums to political races  until we do this  a small number of individuals and corporations will continue to exert undemocratic influence over our country  featured image from youtube via screenshot
