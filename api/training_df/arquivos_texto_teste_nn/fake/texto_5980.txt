cnn has been heavily criticized for its coverage of donald trump s rise and rightfully so  for months  one of the most watched news networks in america deferred to the  both sides  model of false equivalency that had been standard practice for years  recently  as trump clinched the republican nomination and it became clear that he has no intention of being  more presidential   something in the minds of the network s reporters and hosts  clicked   they finally seem to get it  donald trump is a despicable person and no amount of  he said  she said  is going to blunt that fact so they ve changed  and in doing so have absolutely upped their game on a recent episode of at this hour  hosts john berman and kate bolduan put on a masterclass on how to press a trump supporter to get right down to the uncomfortable truth at the very root of trump s campaign  they invited on freshman congressman lee zeldin  r n y   and slowly demolished his talking points  watching a human being get so thoroughly decimated is never easy  but given zeldin s baffling support for trump it s hard to say he didn t have it coming  he knows trump is a racist   just ask him after zeldin tried to dismiss trump s comments about his hispanic judge as a  regrettable mistake   the pair of hosts didn t let him off the hook  if donald trump is engaging in racism  are you still comfortable supporting him  zeldin tried to change the subject  as he no doubt was trained to do  but bolduan and berman weren t buying it  after trying to use the opportunity to pivot to bashing hillary clinton  bolduan interrupts  i m not saying are you now voting for hillary clinton    but are you still endorsing donald trump if you think he s engaging in racism  well  yes  it s donald trump vs  hillary clinton and it s a no brainer between the two of them are you essentially saying  yes he s a racist  but he s our racist   boom zeldin has to admit that while trump s comments are indeed racist  he thinks in trump s  heart  that he isn t a white supremacist   a tip for any aspiring politicians  if you have to go on national television to tepidly argue that deep inside your candidate isn t as racist as he looks  you ve already lost  again berman holds his feet to the fire  sorry but what would you call someone who makes racist statements  everyone calls them a racist  so if donald trump is making racist statements  you re saying he s a racist  hahaha the exchange ends with zeldin throwing up the last  most desperate argument he and his party has in their playbook  trump may be a racist  but obama is a bigger racist  the look on the hosts  faces is absolutely priceless watch the full  cringeworthy exchange below featured image via cnn
