ever since he began his run for president  donald trump and his  poorly educated   his words  not mine  followers have boasted that the  gop nominee has  self funded  and will continue to  self fund  his campaign  though he has accepted donations the entire time  and has in actuality been loaning his campaign money   i don t think it is fair to say that a person is self funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate   rick hasen  an expert in election and campaign finance law at the university of california irvine  said of trump s claims that he is self funding his efforts   nor do i think a candidate who loans money to his campaign  but who expects to be paid back by the campaign  is fairly characterized as self funding  while it may not have been fair before  new developments reveal it to be an outright lie  not that trump supporters will care  on saturday morning  the trump campaign sent out an  emergency  email begging his vapid followers to give him a whopping    by the end of the day  right now we re facing an emergency goal of    to help get our ads on the air  we need your contribution by   p m  tonight   the email reads    crooked hillary is about to invade your tv with ads attacking mr  trump  but we re preparing to fight back  trump is desperate  with his poll numbers in a free fall  with a civil war brewing in the gop  and with trump finally facing the reality that he will lose in november if he makes it to november  the facade is falling away  all that is left is the truth   that donald trump is a conman whose worth as a candidate matches his worth as a human being  both  of course  are severely lacking featured image via getty images branden camp
