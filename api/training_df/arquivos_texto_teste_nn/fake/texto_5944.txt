it s no secret that president obama has a quick wit and a great sense of humor  both were on full display on thursday s edition of jimmy fallon s the tonight show  and the target of said wit and humor was gop presumptive presidential nominee donald trump  first  fallon asked obama his opinion on how the gop felt about trump being their nominee  and he said that the democrats are happy about it  for sure  then on a more serious note  the president went on to say  the truth is  actually i am worried about the republican party  i know that sounds   you know what it sounds like the main role i m going to be playing in this process is to remind the american people that this is a serious job  this is not reality tv  then the mockery resumed  this time aimed at the astoundingly stupid republicans sitting in congress who have made trump their standard bearer  obama said  thank you  congress  for spending eight years wishing you could replace me with a republican  or  to put it another way  how do you like me now  after that  the president reminded america just how much he has managed to do  how far he has pushed america in all the right directions  despite constant gop obstruction during the entire tenure of his presidency  i m proud of the many progressive steps our country has taken in recent years  both socially and environmentally  the united states has been a leader in developing clean energy to ensure the health of our planet for future generations  thanks to the affordable care act  an additional  million americans now have access to quality health care  and same sex couples across the country now have a constitutional right to marry  in short  climate change is real  health care is affordable and love is love  after that  the president got serious again for a second  and reminded us all what is at stake should donald trump take the white house  the american people face an important decision this fall  the entire world is watching  and they look to us for stability and leadership  i know some of the candidates have been critical of my foreign policy  i don t want to name any names  but i believe it is of the utmost importance to work alongside other world leaders  that s why i signed the iran nuclear deal  that s why we reopened diplomatic ties with cuba  and that s why i negotiated the new trade deal called the trans pacific partnership  or tpp  that is when jimmy fallon asked president obama his feelings on tpp  and the commander in chief did not mince words  yeah  you know me  look  jimmy  the tpp allows american businesses to sell their products both at home and abroad  the more we sell abroad  the more higher paying jobs we have here at home  it s that simple  after that  things got funny again as the segment drew to a close  where fallon asked what obama thought of the trump media circus  the president took a real shot at the gop s incessant racist attacks against him  and  of course  trump s own racism  when asked if he had been tuning in  no  but i have been watching my new favorite show   orange is not the new black  once again  president obama shows himself to be a warm  down to earth  classy and adorably hilarious human being  despite being near the end of what is arguably the most difficult presidency in the history of america  he is right about trump  and he is right to endorse hillary clinton in an effort to stop trump  most of all  though  he has not allowed anything that has been slung his way to make him lose his humanity and his sense of humor well done  mr  president  we re sure gonna miss you watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
