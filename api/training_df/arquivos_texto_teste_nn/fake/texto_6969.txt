republican frontrunner donald trump does not lose gracefully  in the past  he s threatened riots and violence if he were to lose the gop nomination  but now that ted cruz is starting to close in on him  the business mogul is upping the ante after a humiliating loss in colorado  where cruz took every last one of the state s  delegates  trump is whining about the  crooked  and  corrupt  way america chooses party nominees  ever the sore loser  trump cried foul because cruz was able to get all of the delegates  support  even though residents couldn t vote  calling this perceived injustice  the biggest story in politics   trump complained that the  people of colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians   and of course  he made all of these accusations over his favorite news platform   twitter  this unusual nomination process in colorado state was explained by the denver post last year  colorado will not vote for a republican candidate for president at its  caucus after party leaders approved a little noticed shift that may diminish the state s clout in the most open nomination contest in the modern era the gop executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party changed its rules to require a state s delegates to support the candidate who wins the caucus vote the move makes colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process  according to political experts  but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule  but trump really can t get over it  trump complained even more while speaking to thousands at a rally in new york yesterday  insisting that the gop nominee should be whoever wins the most votes  not delegates  trump said  what they re trying to do is subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans  we should have won it a long time ago  but  you know  we keep losing where we re winning  this morning  trump continued to b tch and moan on fox   friends  he said  i ve gotten millions   of more votes than  cruz  and i ve gotten hundreds of delegates more  and we keep fighting  fighting  fighting  and then you have a colorado where they just get all of these delegates  and it s not  a system  there was no voting  i didn t go out there to make a speech or anything  there s no voting  he also called some of the ways candidates try to win delegates  crooked   they offer them trips   they offer them all sorts of things  and you re allowed to do that  i mean  you re allowed to offer trips  and you can buy all these votes  what kind of a system is this  now  i m an outsider  and i came into the system and i m winning the votes by millions of votes  but the system is rigged  it s crooked  clearly  trump has forgotten all about that time he bribed former candidate ben carson with a job so the retired neurosurgeon would endorse him  talk about  crooked  whether trump likes it or not  he s going to have to play by the rules and if he doesn t the nomination is going to keep slipping away from him  he s going to have to appeal to delegates instead of people like his easily influenced racist  misogynistic supporters  trump delegate chief paul manafort reports that trump is going to implement a strategy similar to what cruz has been doing  manafort said  a more traditional approach is needed and donald trump recognizes that  in order for trump to get enough delegates to get the republican nomination by june   he will still need to win   of the remaining delegates  right now  trump is winning    according to the associated press  trump has  delegates compared to cruz s  featured image via gage skidmore
