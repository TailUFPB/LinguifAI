christian fundamentalism is putting american children in danger  as ever greater numbers of parents are refusing to seek medical treatment for their children  believing only in the power of prayer the most high profile case in recent times was that of herbert and catherine schaible  the pennsylvanian were jailed in  for allowing their  month old son brandon to die a slow and painful death from diarrhea  rather than seek medical attention  they argued their religious beliefs stipulate that illness is a sign of  spiritual lack   and only prayer can cure it the father  herbert schaible  defending their decision  said  we believe in divine healing  the jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil s power  what makes the case all the more shocking  is that the couple were already on probation for the involuntary manslaughter of another child  their two year old child died of pneumonia in  after they refused to seek medical help the couple were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the  death  and sentenced to  years probation  a condition of their probation was that they sought medical attention if any of their surviving children became sick  yet  within that probationary period  the couple allowed another child to die from a treatable illness  this time  their eight month old son brandon addressing the couple of court  philadelphia common pleas judge benjamin lerner said  you ve killed two of your children   not god  not your church  not religious devotion   you  the couple has seven further surviving children the schaibles are part of a small pentecostal community which  similar to the quiverfull christian conservative approach to family planning   leaves the treatment of illness in what they believe to be god s hands in    month old hope delozier died of a treatable ear infection because her parents  were against antibiotics and other chemicals associated with modern medicine  a further  child deaths have been linked to the pentecostal church  just in idaho alone yet idaho  and  other states  have built in legal protections for parents who allow their children to die this way  these states have religious exemptions to felony or misdemeanor charges involving children the schaibles and their peers seek to protect themselves from the consequences of their actions by hiding behind this bogus freedom of religion  argument  which is why we need to strike down these exemptions to support a common principle no one s freedom of religion should be honored to the extent that a helpless and vulnerable child is left to die of neglect  let alone two yet republicans lawmakers are failing to back the repeal of these exemptions  with arguments epitomized by idaho state rep  christy perry  who said  this is about religious beliefs  the belief god is in charge of whether they live  and god is in charge of whether they die  this is about where they go for eternity  this has nothing to do with freedom of religion  when people become parents  they accept the responsibility to ensure the health and safety of that child through to adulthood  the schaibles and those who think like them  choose to put their personal interpretation of their faith above their duty of care as parents  in doing so  they are turning their own children into human sacrifices  that has no place this century  let alone this country  featured image via flickr creative commons
