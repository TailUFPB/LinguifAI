when jared yates sexton  a professor of creative writing at georgia southern university  decided to attend a trump rally in north carolina  he probably wasn t expecting a drunken free for all more appropriate to an out of control frat party than a presidential rally  yet  that s what he saw  and he live tweeted the entire event  giving the world a chilling look at what trump supporters are really like when they think they re just among  friends  upon trying to get in  sexton saw how security treated people trump event like a security state  just watched a girl get denied for being  too alternative   jared sexton sexton   jysexton  june    himself also got told something strange  just got told i don t  look right   jared sexton sexton   jysexton  june    these two tweets just barely scratch the surface  after trump took the stage  people shouting the word  bitch   was common whenever hillary clinton s name came up  homophobic hate speech ran rampant as trump spoke about the orlando massacre  a protester cowered in fear after another was escorted out  with the crowd chanting  hurt him  hurt him   even as king donald told security not to hurt him lots of people yelling bitch at clinton s mention  jared sexton sexton   jysexton  june    crowd member just shouted  gays had it coming  jared sexton sexton   jysexton  june    says not to hurt protestor  several chant hurt him hurt him  jared sexton sexton   jysexton  june    there s a protestor next to me and he s scared to death  jared yates sexton   jysexton  june    you thought trump himself was scary  he s nothing compared to his fans  sexton s full account of that night included horrors such as this  the gays had it coming    a man shouted and gazed back at the guy who d called hillary a bitch  they met eyes  shared a smile  a look of recognition as if it were some kind of joke as if  of his fellow americans  living  breathing human beings hadn t just been mowed down  elsewhere  a father was telling his son all about bill clinton s presidency  i walked behind a father explaining the shirt to his ten year old son by saying the former secretary of the state  the first female presidential nominee of a major political party  had  let her husband have all kinds of oral sex in the white house   awhile back  trump said that hillary had enabled her husband s adultery while he was president  as if that somehow makes her both less of a woman  and unqualified to be president  trump doesn t go after anyone s policy positions the way a presidential candidate should  he attacks his opponents personally  like the schoolyard bully he is  and his fans are doing the same that a father thinks it s okay teach his  year old how to be the same childish bully as trump is just sick but the worst is yet to come  trump rallies are full of drunken  brawling racists who say things like  you can t trust latinos  some maybe  but not most  immigrants aren t people  honey  you know them crazy black girls  how they are  sexton s twitter feed is full of sarcastic humor  but what he live tweeted from that rally in greensboro  nc  was devoid of his sharp wit  and it s no wonder  because he also wrote this in his recount of the event  if it can even be called an  event    sickened  i got in my car and watched in the rearview as a group of college boys tailgated out of their pickup  that s when i realized what had been there all along  this campaign  whose success has long been attributed to the forgotten working and middle classes  the so called silent majority  has been  and always will be  an unholy alliance between the hateful and the privileged  the former always on a never ending search for new venues for their poison and the latter enjoying  for the first time since reagan s    an opportunity to get out and step on some necks in public  any reasonable person would find themselves sickened at a trump rally if this is normal  and given what s happened to protesters  members of the press  and others  this is normal  it s clear that the only thing donald trump is truly capable of is bringing out the worst of humanity  which isn t surprising considering he himself embodies the worst of humanity featured image by gerardo mora getty images
