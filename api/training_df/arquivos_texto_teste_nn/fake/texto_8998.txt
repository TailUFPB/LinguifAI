president barack obama has recently announced that he will be issuing executive orders on guns after a series of horrific attacks involving firearms  predictably  the nra and republicans are absolutely freaking out over this  and one of the outspoken gopers whining about this just happens to be republican presidential candidate and new jersey governor chris christie during an interview with fox news on sunday  christie criticized obama for trying to improve gun control laws  calling him a  boy  for trying to keep the american people safe from terrorism and violence within the home when fox moderator chris wallace asked christie what he thought about obama s intention to expand background checks and prevent guns from getting into the hands of accused domestic abusers and terrorists  christie went off on a rant  this president is a petulant child  whenever he can t get what he wants  because frankly  the american people have rejected his agenda by turning over the house and the senate to republicans  going from  republican governors when he came into office  now   now he wants to act as a king  the fact is if he wants to make changes to these laws  go to congress and convince congress they re necessary  but this is going to be another illegal executive action which i m sure will be rejected by the courts  when i become president  they will be stricken from executive action by executive action i will take  you can watch christie go off on obama below  christie had no issue criticizing obama  even though he is unaware of what obama will actually do  or the potential legality of those actions  the crazy thing is  christie later said that he is for the restriction on guns to terror watch suspects  but isn t comfortable with obama taking immediate  responsible action  wallace pointed out that christie had previously been supportive of gun control measures  and asked him if he d changed his stance  christie said  i haven t changed my tune  i signed the bill that banned guns for people on the terror watch list  as president  i would make sure that terror watch list was actually accurate  interestingly enough  republicans are fine when obama takes executive action for things like bombing syria   however when it comes to protecting women from their abusers or stopping terrorists from getting guns  they ve proven time after time that it s just not a priority tomorrow  obama will see attorney general loretta lynch to finalize his proposal  a town hall will be held on thursday  and the new executive actions on background checks are expected in the next few days  featured image via marc nozell   flickr
