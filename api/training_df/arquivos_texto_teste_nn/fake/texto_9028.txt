if someone were to ask regular people on the street how they would wake up a sleeping person  they would probably shake them or possibly yell   wake up   normal stuff  right  however  there is nothing normal about your average second amendment enthusiast a man in chandler  arizona has been arrested after he allegedly lied to police about fatally shooting an  intruder  on new year s eve it seems like it was your average night  young people were having a get together of some kind on new year s eve  we have all been to one of these and there is always that one person that falls asleep early  this seems to be exactly what happened in this case gage bodenheimer was at his friend nathaniel thomas  apartment  while there  gage fell asleep on the floor  not a huge surprise so far  because it gets late and not everyone is a night owl  it was supposed to be a nice night with friends   but someone invited the second amendment and he ruined the party while gage was sleeping on the floor  his friend nathaniel decided he should be awake  instead of nudging him or speaking loudly  nathaniel decided to point a gun at his friend and pull the trigger   in an effort to make repeated trigger clicks to awaken gage moments later  gage was dead as nathaniel   thinking the gun was unloaded   ended up blowing his friend away with the obviously loaded gun nathaniel must have heard from the nra that he was not responsible for his own firearm irresponsibility because he called  and reported that he shot an intruder in his home  there were a couple problems with that  one is that the cops could tell immediately that something was amiss due to the nature of the scene  second  there were witnesses there in the apartment the whole time  all the police had to do  even if they were so inept at investigating the scene  was to ask any person present what happened the whole affair was infinitely dumb on nathaniel s part  then again  your average person who uses a gun as an alarm clock is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier nathaniel was promptly arrested after witnesses informed the police of what happened featured image via photobucket
