chris christie just had yet another terrible day at the hands of his new boss  donald trump  in what is becoming a trend  trump once again used christie as his personal punching bag  while the humiliated governor was forced to stand close by and grovel at a campaign stop in ohio  trump took a dig at the state s governor john kasich by noting that he was such a bad governor  that he may have even been worse than christie  christie was standing off to trump s side  forced to pretend to like it as he was mocked by the man he endorsed for president  it was surreal  your governor  kasich  if you look at him  and i m being totally impartial   he goes to new hampshire  he s living in new hampshire  living  where s chris  is chris around  even more than chris christie he was there   right   ouch  the dig is particularly bad because christie has often been accused of abandoning his state to promote himself  but don t worry  chris  trump felt awfully bad about telling a crowd that you are terrible  i hated to do that   trump said with a smile   but i had to make my point  the scorching by his new best friend comes at a very awkward time for christie  the new jersey governor has been getting hammered by critics in his state for abandoning his job to run a failed campaign for president and then immediately jump on the trump bandwagon  and avoid his job again  already  many are calling for christie to resign or face impeachment on the very same day that he was being shamed by trump  christie set off a firestorm of outrage when he announced he would be in ohio rather than attend the funeral of a police officer who had been killed in the line of duty local media outlets reported that  hundreds of police officers  family members and friends  attended cullen s funeral in washington township  n j christie  however  was not one of them instead  the former  white house hopeful hosted a town hall forum with trump at noon on monday  the same time cullen s funeral was scheduled for  at rhyne university in hickory  n c he then joined trump for his ohio event this isn t the first time christie has had to stand with a grin while trump brought him to heel in front of thousands of people and dozens of news cameras  earlier this year  a hot mic captured trump telling christie to get off the stage they were sharing and get on the plane  the incident quickly went viral  confirming many of the rumors swirling about trump s campaign and his obsession with not letting anyone share his spotlight why does christie suffer through this level of disrespect  that s easy  his career as governor is doomed  and he s shooting for attorney general in trump s administration  who needs self respect when you have a job lined up from your new boss who hates you featured image via youtube
