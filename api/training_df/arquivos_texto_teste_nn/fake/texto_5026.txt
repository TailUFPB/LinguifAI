after a decade and a half of peppering nearly every political conversation with   as joe biden famously said   a noun  a verb and    the mayor who was in charge of new york city during   appeared to forget it ever happened when he said that terrorism didn t hit our country until president obama took office after taking a day of brutal media and twitter mockery  giuliani offered an explanation  he just didn t have enough time to form the couple of extra words  like  since    i m not there to give a major  minute policy address   he said of his trump introduction monday in youngstown  ohio  where he said plainly that  under those eight years  before obama came along  we didn t have any successful radical islamic terrorist attack inside the united states  you speak in somewhat abbreviated language   giuliani told the news tuesday   all human beings speak in abbreviated language at times  source  new york daily newseven this short video clip is a minute and  seconds long  he had plenty of time to talk about everything but   the idea that  all  terrorist attacks  started once clinton and obama came to office  is both false and offensive  the deadliest terrorist attack happened when giuliani was in office  and many speculate that things would not have been so bad  especially for the first responders  under a different mayor more than that  this is a dangerous lie  as of     people have died from terrorist attacks within the united states  over   of those people died during the attacks of    even with the addition of the san bernardino shooting  far fewer than  people have died from terrorist attacks on u s  soil  at least since obama took office whether or not giuliani actually forgot   is irrelevant  donald trump is trying to create an environment in which no one is held accountable for their words  and giuliani is no exception  the new way of campaigning  at least for trump s team  is to spit out ridiculous accusations and assertions and then blame the media for directly quoting them  giuliani says he will slip up again  as we all will  but since he s on the trump team  don t look for any sort of contrition  look for doubling down and more lies featured image via jeff swensen at getty images
