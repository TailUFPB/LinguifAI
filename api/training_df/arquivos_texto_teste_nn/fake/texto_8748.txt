if a debate is won according to who generates the most buzz  bernie sanders has once again kicked republican ass on twitter  according the hill   sanders had two of the most retweeted tweets during the debate with a pair touting his position in polls and going after gop front runner donald trump s proposal to ban muslims from the u s  both got more than   retweets  the republicans seem to think they could beat our campaign  they haven t seen the polls   gopdebatepic twitter com   bernie sanders   berniesanders  january    love the little frowning republican faces  they so perfectly capture the frustration they must be feeling at losing in the polls  badly  to a  gasp  socialist  republicans are  of course  all for socialism but only as long as it s the rich that benefit and not all of the dirty lower classes that bernie represents  privatize the rewards  socialize the cost  it s the american way sanders also hit trump over his naked appeals to racism and bigotry i have a message for donald trump  no  we re not going to hate latinos or muslims  we are going to stand together   gopdebate  bernie sanders   berniesanders  january    problem with running on hate is that it only gets you so far  once you get past the angry white old person demographic  no one else is interested but what makes it even more remarkable that sanders continues to outshine republicans on twitter during their own debate is that sanders only has   million followers compared to trump s   million  although if we follow trump s track record  there s a good chance a lot of those are paid for followers  i have a hard time believing that the average trump supporter is smart enough to turn on a computer  much less use social media while trump did pick up more new followers than sanders during the debate  that s of little comfort to the republican party  they may fear a sanders presidency  but they fear a trump presidency even more  sanders will move the country to a place where the rich won t be as rich and everyone else will get richer  trump will turn america into the laughingstock of the world and cost corporate america far more money than that dastardly socialist sanders ever could faced with that kind of choice  republicans may not have a choice but to go all in for bernie featured image via twitter
