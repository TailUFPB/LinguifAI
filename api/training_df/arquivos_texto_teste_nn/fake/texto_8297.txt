conservative lawmakers are far too obsessed with how people have sex in defiance of the supreme court  michigan republicans have passed a bill that makes oral and anal sex felonies punishable by up to  years in prison state senator rick jones  an old white right wing guy who is apparently angry about all the sex he s not having  added the anti sex language to sb   which is supposed to be an animal protection bill  included in a larger package of bills known as logan s law logan s law is designed to block convicted animal abusers from owning any pets for five years  but jones couldn t wait to use the bill to push his own belief that consenting adults who have oral and anal sex should be left to rot in a jail cell  he slipped in language revising the unconstitutional anti sodomy law near the very end of the bill in a move that jones probably hoped would go unnoticed here s a screenshot of section  of senate bill  despite calls for jones to remove the section  he claims that to do so would hurt the animal protection bill as a whole  the minute i cross that line and i start talking about the other stuff  i won t even get another hearing  it ll be done   jones said   nobody wants to touch it  i would rather not even bring up the topic  because i know what would happen  you d get both sides screaming and you end up with a big fight that s not needed because it s unconstitutional  but jones is the one who crossed the line in the first place by sneaking in his dream of outlawing oral and anal sex between humans into an animal protection bill  he s the one who willingly put the overall bill in jeopardy jones went on to claim that he believes the only way to repeal the sodomy ban is if the state passes a bill to do so  which he says he could  probably  vote for the supreme court struck down anti sodomy laws in   but conservatives across the country have been fighting to keep the laws on the books ever since  that includes ken cuccinelli in virginia who tried to outlaw  carnal knowledge  between married couples in  as he failed to become the state s governor and just like cuccinelli  it appears jones is trying to insert christian fundamentalist law into the civil law  which would create a legal clusterf ck in this country since it would destroy privacy  in order to enforce such a law  it would take millions upon millions of dollars  a spying program  and a cop in every household to make sure women and men are only doing it missionary style and that their reproductive organs are in the place where they believe god intended them to be in short  whenever republicans say they support smaller government  they are full of shit  and so is rick jones  but i bet justice scalia is totally behind him all the way  featured image from facebook
