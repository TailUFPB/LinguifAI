the prospect of donald trump becoming president just got a whole lot scarier the republican nominee has been receiving foreign policy briefings  which almost certainly include information on the places in the world that are hostile towards the united states but the only solution trump cares about pursuing is one that would unleash nuclear war upon the globe according to trump s once upon a time bff joe scarborough  the republican nominee repeatedly asked the foreign policy expert briefing him why america just doesn t use nukes to wipe out our enemies or anyone else who disagrees with us  three times he asked about the use of nuclear weapons   scarborough reported on msnbc on wednesday morning   three times he asked  at one point   if we have them  why can t we use them   that s one of the reasons he doesn t have foreign policy experts around  and even more frightening is that if trump happened to somehow become president  he could order a strike as soon as he is inaugurated without debate or approval from congress  the system is designed for speed and decisiveness  it s not designed to debate the decision   former cia director michael hayden informed scarborough when asked if trump could be stopped from starting a nuclear apocalypse  hayden also said that trump being so erratic is also of great concern to national security here s the video via twitter this seems big  from  morningjoe   times during a natsec briefing trump asked  why can t we use nuclear weapons   https   t co   glenn thrush   glennthrush  august    proves that donald trump is the greatest threat to our country right now  he is in position right now to destroy america from within by starting world war iii with nuclear bombs and this isn t the first time trump has talked about using nuclear weapons  during an interview with chris matthews trump refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in europe and the middle east  the fact that he is now seriously asking about using nuclear weapons should frighten every american and the entire world let s not forget that the republican party is responsible for making trump the leader of their party  they built this  so they should be horrifyingly reminded that if we fire nukes at a country  someone is likely going to fire them back at us featured image  cnn
