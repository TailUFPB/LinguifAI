presidential candidate bernie sanders  who faces an uphill battle with democratic frontrunner hillary clinton in new york s primary  may get a significant boost of confidence as he s scheduled to visit vatican city to deliver a speech on the  moral economy  on april  more specifically  according to the sanders campaign  he will be attending a conference hosted by the pontifical academy of social sciences  on social  economic  and environmental issues   which falls on the  anniversary of the church s centesimus annus   an encyclical from pope john paul ii aimed at addressing the rights of workers around the world and fair economic treatment on the same day pope francis issued a paper urging priests and leaders to be more accepting of gay men  divorcees and lesbians  the vatican released their own statement  singling out sanders  we re delighted to host this conference to celebrate the  anniversary of centesimus annus  bringing together world leaders  including u s  senator sanders  bernie sanders praised his holiness pope francis and the vatican for the invitation on msnbc s morning joe  saying i was very moved by the invitation  which just was made public today  i am a big  big fan of the pope  obviously  there are areas where we disagree  on women s rights and gay rights  but he has played an unbelievable role  an unbelievable role  of injecting a moral consequence into the economy whereas the honor of attending the vatican may be huge for sanders  the time he ll have to take off from campaigning in new york  four days before the primary  may be detrimental to overtaking clinton  who is slated to win with a comfortable margin bernie sanders has lauded pope francis in the past  calling him  brave    compassionate    a very smart man   and a  leader  on the issues which sanders has similarly adopted in his presidential campaign  it should come as no surprise the vatican saw it fit to invite him  francis  focus on climate change and environmental issues have ignited positive attitudes in weary catholics and non catholics who have grown dismayed with the church s seemingly obsessive attitudes towards abortion and homosexuality  and embracing the sanders rhetoric literally and figuratively will only continue to ignite more passion  photo by william thomas cain getty images
