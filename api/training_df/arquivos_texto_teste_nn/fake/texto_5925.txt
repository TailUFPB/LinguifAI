despite the racial outbursts  the insistence that he keep attacking his former primary rivals even though the primaries are over  and the overall haphazard way he is campaigning  republican chairman reince priebus insists that all is well between him and nominee donald trump of course  like so much in this campaign  that isn t the truth  behind the scenes  trump is making a critical error that could doom his attempt to win the presidency more than a simple racist comment  and it is driving the party chairman nuts meanwhile  the trump high dollar fund raising operation is showing signs of duress  people here say  a joint fund raising agreement was hatched last month to split proceeds between the rnc and the trump campaign  and while the first joint fund raisers have gone well  rnc chair reince priebus has phoned some associates expressing frustration that trump wants to direct dollars to his own ambitious plans  according to a person who has spoken directly with priebus  which includes quixotic bids to win deep blue states like california and new york the rnc did not respond to a request for comment there isn t any data to indicate that a win in traditionally blue states is remotely possible for trump to pull off  most polling has shown that his best shot would come with a winning streak in so called  purple  states  the same states that both john mccain and mitt romney tried to target against president obama that have swung between both parties with a difference of one percentage point or less by comparison  no republican has won california and new york since ronald reagan s epic landslide victory in   which was  years ago  both states have delivered huge  lopsided victories to democratic presidential candidates for decades  and both also consist of the diverse electorates   latino  black   that are the most opposed to trump republican insiders know and understand this  trump s ego insists that he should contend in the blue states  especially his home state of new york  but using any money to campaign there is a fool s errand for the republican party  made even worse since the gop is so far behind the democrats and secretary clinton on raising money it has all the ingredients for an election disaster featured image via youtube
