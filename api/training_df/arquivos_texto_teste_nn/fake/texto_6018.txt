beebe  arkansas mayor  mike robertson  loves jesus  he loves jesus so much that he s using public dollars to fund a gospel band for beebe s  of july celebration  and he knows what he s doing  too  otherwise  he wouldn t have said this in his letter urging residents to come out  i am pleased to announce that this year s live music will be provided by grammy nominated  multiple award winning gospel artists  the bowling family the bowling family combines talent  sincerity and experience to create a memorable concert experience  their goal for the evening is to usher in the presence of god and to celebrate the christian message  they feel privileged and honored to enjoy the freedom to honor christ with any and all of their abilities   you can read the letter in its entirety here it s ironic that he d knowingly pick a gospel band to help his town celebrate a day on which our founders declared their independence from the british crown  and sought things like religious freedom for the colonies  it s sad  too  robertson clearly practices the religious right s warped and twisted view of american history david niose  the legal director of the american humanist association  sent a stern letter of warning to robertson s office  saying that a concerned citizen had contacted him about usurping our independence day  along with public dollars  to endorse a religion not everyone in beebe practices  the american humanist association has successfully sued other government entities for promoting religion in the past  and niose makes a point of mentioning that  he also said  you should not be surprised that some of your constituents object to your use of the apparatus of government  which of course is funded by citizens of various religious backgrounds  to endorse and promote your personal religion  indeed  beebe was also the center of controversy in  when a family there opened a small  pagan temple in their garage  robertson was initially behind that  thinking it was a little christian church  but when he found out it was pagan  he changed his mind and claimed that zoning laws forbade a place of worship on that property in fact  zoning laws actually allowed it  robertson just doesn t like the idea that there are people in his town that practice a different religion than he does  worse  he believes that public officials should be praying to his god  as the true leader of the nation   this is christian zealotry at its finest  freedom for christianity and christians  but not for anyone else roberston told onenewsnow that the city is acting fairly  and he s prepared to defend having this gospel group at their  of july event  we ve had all different types of entertainment  and we try each year to change it to do something for everybody s desire and liking  and so we chose a gospel group  he went on to say that people could just stay home if they don t like it  wow  just wow  perhaps he s the one who should stay home  and let people who actually understand freedom of religion  along with the whole reason we even celebrate that day  plan this event featured image via beebe  ark  official website
