perhaps it s time to build a wall around texas and let it fail as a country separate from the united states  because the republican party platform in the state is by far one of the most hateful and anti american platforms ever produced in this country the main theme of the texas republican platform this year is nullification and destruction of everything they oppose  including women s rights  ethnic diversity  comprehensive sex education  lgbt rights  the separation of church and state  voting rights  and the federal government right off the bat  texas republicans began their platform document with a preamble pledging their belief in god and and went on to list adherence to  the laws of nature  as a principle   even though the constitution makes no such references but it only got worse from there texas republicans openly called for nullifying federal laws and ignoring the rulings of federal courts federally mandated legislation  which infringes upon the  amendment rights of texas  should be ignored  opposed  refused  and nullified  regulation of commerce in article i  section  of the constitution has exceeded the original intent  all attempts by the federal judiciary to rule in areas not expressly enumerated by the untied states constitution should be likewise nullified  any federal enforcement activities that do occur in texas should be conducted under the authority of the county sheriff they openly called for eliminating several critical federal agencies which handle labor unions  healthcare  tax revenue collection  and illegal drugs and firearms we oppose the appointment of unelected bureaucrats and we support defunding and abolishing the departments or agencies of the internal revenue service  education  energy  housing and urban development  commerce  health and human services  labor  and interior  specifically  the bureau of land management   transportation security administration  alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives and national labor relations board they also rejected environmental protection and called climate change a scam we oppose environmentalism that obstructs legitimate business interests and private property use  including the regulatory taking of property by governmental agencies  we oppose the abuse of the endangered species act to confiscate and limit the use of personal property and infringement on property owner s livelihood   climate change  is a political agenda promoted to control every aspect of our lives  we support the defunding of  climate justice  initiatives and the abolition of the environmental protection agency and repeal of the endangered species act they then called on congress to repeal the voting rights act we urge that the voter rights act of   codified and updated in   be repealed and not reauthorized in addition  texas republicans included opposition to same sex marriage in their platform by calling for the supreme court ruling in obergefell v  hodges to be overturned while also declaring the definition of marriage  as a god ordained  legal and moral commitment only between one natural man and one natural woman  the platform condemned homosexuality by claiming that it goes against  god s law  and the constitution and also declared support of controversial ex gay therapy texas republicans were especially hostile toward a woman s right to choose  calling on the texas state government to ignore roe v  wade and any federal laws and regulations making abortion legal and accessible  in short  texas republicans want to outlaw abortion even if it s constitutionally protected the texas gop also expressed opposition to social security  which it called for  phasing out   and called for making medicaid a temporary program only education wasn t left untouched either  texas republicans not only called for teaching creationism in school  they condemned comprehensive sex education that could actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies that result in abortions in the first place texas republicans are also all about forcing minorities to  assimilate  into their version of american culture and forcing immigrants to learn and speak english so that they can  quickly assimilate  you can read the full platform here it s time for texas to be thrown out of the united states  the state no longer shares the values america has held dear for so long  because of republican majorities  the state has become an embarrassment that will likely continue as long as the gop continues to strip away voting rights from people they see as a threat to their power and it would only be a matter of time before texas comes crawling back as they realize there is more to becoming an independent nation than simply seceding  if texas really wants to nullify federal law and go it alone  i say let them go  at least that would deprive republicans of the  electoral votes texas holds in presidential elections  and it would save the federal government billions of dollars while sparing the rest of the nation from dealing with texas  stupidity featured image via wikimedia
