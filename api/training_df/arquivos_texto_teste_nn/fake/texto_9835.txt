this heartfelt facebook comment by a detroit lion s fan speaks for so many americans   i have been a die hard detroit lions fan since i first remember listening on the radio  all the way back to   since tobin rote  yale lary  gail cogdill  lem barney i don t ever remember missing a game on tv when i could watch  i support equality for everyone who couldn t  i understand there are issues and it s their right to protest and peacefully at that just wrong place time  mrs ford had an opportunity to support those who gave their lives to allow her to live a life that most could only dream of living  she didn t  so today i break my streak i would rather work on my wife s  honey do  list than support mrs ford s position  maybe i feel so strongly about this because i never served and it s one of my life s great regrets ask yourself who is making this political  the left is making this about politics but it s about respecting our flag and anthem for all americans periodmartha ford spoke out against president trump s announcement that nfl players should be  fired  if they refuse to stand for our anthem  our game has long provided a powerful platform for dialogue and positive change in many communities throughout our nation  thanks primarily to our players  the nfl also has been a unifying force in our country and impactful change has and hopefully will continue to be the result of peaceful expression  done so in order to highlight social injustices of all kind  negative and disrespectful comments suggesting otherwise are contrary to the founding principles of our country  and we do not support those comments or opinions  prior to the lions  game against the atlanta falcons  ford was seen linking arms with the team on the sidelines during the national anthem at ford field  some falcons players also knelt or locked arms with team members unreal president trump is   right on this  boycott the nfl
