iiiiiitttt ssssssss a wonderful day in the  white  neighborhood  it s a wonderful day in the  white  neighborhood  won t you be my  white  neighbor donald trump came to south carolina and summoned the darkness at the heart of conservative politics like the pied piper incarnate  no amount of bible thumping  gun toting or terrorist fear mongering could draw the crowds away  they wanted one thing and one thing only  someone to tell them that not only was their hate of those people permissible  it was proper and necessary to  make america great again  with  percent of precincts reporting  mr  trump had won  percent of the vote and led his nearest rivals by about  percentage points  he was likely to capture all  delegates at stake in the state  mr  trump s victory here was not as sweeping as the one in new hampshire  and there were warning signs as he showed weakness among women and younger voters  but he still won among both independents and republicans  and among self described evangelical christians  he also seemed to have built a coalition that will remain with him through adversity  more than half of voters who made their decisions over a month ago picked mr  trump  exit polls showed that is exciting news  trump simply has no chance in the general election where his obnoxious racism would turn off much of the country and his general incompetence would lead many conservative voters to not vote  but more importantly  as i ve said many times  trump has destroyed the illusion that the right wing cares about religion  morals or fetuses  they care about hating those people and maintaining white supremacy  it s been their motivation for much of this country s history and that s why trump is their man once rubio or cruz drop out of the race  the other might consolidate the remaining voters and pass trump but there s little reason for either of them to do so  cruz is in it for himself and rubio is the pick of the establishment  trump  of course  is running on pure ego at this point  if this dynamic continues  all signs point to trump as the nominee and that s the best news possible for sanders and clinton featured via ai archives
