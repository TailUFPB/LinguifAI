fox news has declared war on the merriam webster dictionary for defining a hot dog as a sandwich america s most embarrassing  news  network literally incited anger over the classification when fox   friends reported on it on saturday to celebrate memorial day  the merriam webster dictionary posted a tweet reminding everyone that a hot dog is a sandwich because the definition of a sandwich is  two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between  while many people have differing opinions on the topic  the dictionary definition certainly makes it sound like a hot dog is  indeed  a sandwich  look at subway for instance when subway slices their bread open  they normally do not cut it open all the way through  if one were to turn the bread on its side it would look just like a hot dog bun  except stuffed with meat  cheese  and veggies so it makes sense that a hot dog can be classified as a type of sandwich but fox news viewers lashed out and host anna kooiman read out an angry viewer s comment calling the definition  an act of terrorism  tucker carlson then chimed in by calling it un american  it sounds like overstatement but when you attack a hot dog you attack america   carlson said the pair then threw the segment to clayton morris  who was out and about in times square desperately looking for hot dog vendors to weigh in on the  controversy  when morris finally found one  the vendor wanted nothing to do with him or fox news and actually ended up closing down his hot dog stand rather than talk to him  when morris attempted to serve himself  which most people would call stealing  the vendor returned and apparently brought police with him here s the video via youtube is there anything fox news won t try to stoke anger over  because trying to make americans freak out over the dictionary definition of a hot dog is pretty damn petty and ridiculous  fox clearly will do anything to keep their viewers angry featured image  pixabay
