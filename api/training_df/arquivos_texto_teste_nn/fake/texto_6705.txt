when choosing a candidate for president it s probably a smart idea to choose someone who will best have your back on any number of issues  what s not smart is supporting a candidate who calls you names  tells you how disgusting you are  and publicly humiliates you  yet  caitlyn jenner still seems to want to support republican presidential candidate ted cruz despite the fact that he is so utterly outspoken against the transgender community jenner has been a republican for a very long time and still hasn t been able to wrap her head around the fact that she is supporting not only the worst party for her own cause  but also the absolute worst candidate within that party in regards to transgender rights and protections in the latest episode of her reality show i am cait  jenner s friends called out this blinding hypocrisy to her face  during the show  they showed the women sitting around listening to the fact that ted cruz is asking for the houston  texas hero act  which guarantees rights to the lgbt community  to be repealed  and while jenner brushed it off as cruz just being  totally misinformed   her friends told her  in so many words  that you can t be a supporter of lgbt rights and a supporter of ted cruz at the same time a cruz presidency would be devastating to the lgbt community on so many levels  and could turn back the clock on all the progress that has been made over the past decade  we cannot allow that to happen  we ve come so far  and we have so much further to go  no matter who  vote blue watch the clip here featured image via video screen capture
