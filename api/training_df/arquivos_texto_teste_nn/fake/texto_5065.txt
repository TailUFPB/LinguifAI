want to take part in an opinion poll on the presidential election  but the pollsters never call you  there s an app for that  it s called zip  and its developer claims its data is more accurate than that of any poll because it s not a poll  it s a conversation  it s also  percent anonymous so people feel more like telling the truth zip has trump leading  percent to hillary s  percent  most of the traditional polls have hillary leading trump by anywhere from four to ten points right now  why the difference ric milliti  zip s developer  says his app poses questions on a daily basis and then averages the answers of   users  he believes that the nature of his app means he gets a far purer result than the traditional polls  we re not a poll  we re a conversation  and   anonymous  people feel comfortable answering questions without fear of being bullied or being called a racist  people can express themselves safely  and you get a pure answer  look at some of the questions  though  new polls suggest trump is getting crushed by clinton  do they reflect how you are going to vote  that s the question that puts trump ahead of hillary by a full  points  california  who you voting for  for this one  trump got    compared to   for hillary  the latest poll from public policy polling has hillary leading trump by  percent in that state   what do you honestly think trump meant by saying  the  amendment people can do something about hillary    percent said trump simply meant  vote against her   while  percent said he meant   assassinate her  this is only slightly more sophisticated than taking a poll from your own social media account  milliti knows very little about the people who are answering these questions  but thinks this is the wave of the future for accurate polling according to an article on windows central  the results of all the polls that take place within the app  may not be the most scientific   well  duh  milliti simply takes a cross section of users by age  gender  and geographical location to get his results  which is nothing like enough to make a poll scientific  that s something milliti would know if he knew anything about polling  he might be great at developing apps  but his skill ends there for right now despite that  trump supporters will still glom onto this the way they re glomming onto a poll published by the arizona freedom alliance that claims that its poll is far more accurate than the traditional polls  after all  trump has squillions of twitter followers and draws thousands to his rallies  so there s no way he s actually trailing hillary  right the funny thing about the poll that the afa republished  though  is that the  pollsters  merely called   people in each state  and never published their questions or the methodology they used to try and ensure they had representative samples of residents in each state  they seem to think   it s   people  how can it possibly be less accurate than polls that only question  to   people  milliti insists that most media polls are wildly inaccurate  and his polls are not  his polls  however  could easily be getting flooded with trump fans who are desperate to see trump ahead somewhere  whether milliti himself is a trump supporter or not  he clearly lives in the same bubble that everyone else who claims the scientific polls are dishonest and inaccurate live in photo of donald trump by bill pugliano getty images  photo of hillary clinton by chip somodevilla getty images  photos merged by rika christensen
