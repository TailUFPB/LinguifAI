senator elizabeth warren is pissed and she is letting the securities and exchange commission  s e c   know it in no uncertain terms her anger stems from s e c  regulators   i use that term loosely  decision to allow billionaire steve cohen to form a new hedge fund firm even though he is not supposed to have anything to do with the industry for two years  the wall street mogul was punished after he failed to properly supervise one of his employees who is now in federal prison for insider trading  cohen s firm pleaded guilty to securities fraud and paid a    billion fine cohen managed to escape criminal charges  shocking   by agreeing to return all of the firm s outside money  renaming it  capital and signing an agreement vowing not to manage anyone s money or employees who are managing other people s money until  unfortunately  the agreement did not prevent him from owning a firm that profits off of other people  so  he waited a mere months before forming a new firm  stamford harbor capital  to do just that  this enraged senator warren and she sent a letter to the s e c  on thursday morning ripping them apart for allowing cohen s new firm to register with them  the senator said that in doing so they are allowing the firm to make  a mockery of the s e c  s core mission to  protect investors   the commission has permitted a recidivist hedge fund manager  well known for his former company s willingness to evade and ignore federal law  to once again profit from and potentially exploit investors  this is an unacceptable outcome from the nation s primary enforcer of securities laws the latest example of an s e c  action that fails to appropriately punish guilty parties  deter future wrongdoing  and protect investors  it is absolutely infuriating that the s e c   who is supposed to be protecting us from predators on wall street  has allowed this criminal to open another firm  make no mistake  just because he wasn t charged doesn t make him any less of a criminal  for far too long hedge fund managers have been allowed to get away with robbing the rest of us blind  cohen just spit on the s e c  and they are standing by and taking it so  in other words  it is business as usual on wall street  featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
