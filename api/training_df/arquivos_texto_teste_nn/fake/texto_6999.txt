one of the biggest mysteries in constitutional law is what the framers meant when they said  natural born citizen   section  of article two of the united states constitution states the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the united states  and under clause  one would find the  natural born  requirement no person except a natural born citizen  or a citizen of the united states  at the time of the adoption of this constitution  shall be eligible to the office of president  neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years  and been fourteen years a resident within the united states the supreme court will have the option to take up the case  if it so chooses  now that the lawsuit challenging ted cruz s eligibility to be president has been filed retired utah lawyer walter wagner has led the  birther  movement against ted cruz  filing multiple lawsuits in federal court to block the texas republican from seeking the nomination  wagner lost his case in utah district court  with judge jill parrish writing nowhere does mr  wagner allege how he will be injured in a personal and individual way all cases must show that the individual bringing the lawsuit has suffered  is suffering  or will suffer an injury personal to them  and that their rights have been violated  wagner contends that he does have a vested interest  saying it s his job at  insuring that all candidates for the position of president are legally qualified   basically  he s a taxpayer and an american citizen  so he has a particular interest in who the president is after being smacked down in utah  wagner appealed to the tenth circuit court of appeals in denver and subsequently the u s   supreme court hopefully the justices see fit to end this ridiculous talking point  seeing as though trump will most likely emerge as the nominee  also  establishing sound constitutional decision to this long mysterious issue  featured image via mark wilson getty
