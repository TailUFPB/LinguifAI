the los angeles county school board has caused an uproar with their right wing residents because they do not want federal immigration officers inside of schools  the board voted unanimously on tuesday to direct staff members at any school not to allow ice agents inside of schools or provide federal authorities with student data without clearance  this move has prompted anti immigration conservatives to lash out because  apparently  they believe children should be hauled out of their classrooms and arrested here are some of the comments under the article on the la times facebook page    and the comments under the article on the site were not much better well  aren t they just chock full of  family values   what s even funnier is that these imbeciles obviously have not ever bothered to look into our countries immigration policies because if they had  this isn t new  traditionally immigration officials have not raided places they have deemed  sensitive  like churches and schools  in   they made this very clear in a memo that stated this memorandum sets forth immigration and customs enforcement  ice  policy regarding certain enforcement actions by ice officers and agents at or focused on sensitive locations  this policy is designed to ensure that these enforcement actions do not occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as schools and churches the only reason the school board voted on this was to reassure parents  who do not trust the government  that school was safe for their kids  ever since nationwide immigration sweeps netted more than a hundred undocumented people last month  parents have been even more frightened  according to the la times although there were no raids in l a  last month  residents are concerned because the city has a large central american immigrant population so to rodriguez  the resolution is  in part  a symbolic gesture to tell families that  we stand for the safety of our children   he said   these are safe spaces  it s sad that the right wing is so full of hate  that they want kids to be afraid to go to school  and if these kids overcome their fear  they want law enforcement agents with guns to rip these children away from their families because they had the audacity to try to receive an education  how sick is that  featured image from left wing nation
