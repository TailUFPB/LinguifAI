house speaker paul ryan was put on the spot last night during cnn s town hall  when a republican attendee asked him a question that most of us would love to know   how can anyone  republican or not  justify standing by donald trump after all the horrible things he s said and done student zachary marcone  who stressed that he himself was a republican but would not be voting for trump  confronted ryan by pointing out trump s bigotry  marcone said  it concerns me when the republican leadership is supporting somebody who s blatantly racist and has said islamophobic statements  wants to shut down our borders  can you tell me  how can you morally justify your support for this kind of candidate  somebody who could be very destructive to our country  ryan couldn t actually give marcone a moral justification for why he continued to support trump even though he d condemned several of the islamophobic things trump has said in the past  basically accepting marcone s description of trump as a racist islamophobic candidate  ryan s only response was that carrying out the republican party s agenda was more important to him than protecting america  ryan fired back with notable irritation in his voice  that basically means you re going to help elect hillary clinton  and i don t think hillary clinton s going to support any of the things that you stand for  if you re a republican   so according to the speaker of the house  subjecting america to a blatantly racist and islamophobic idiot isn t as bad as having clinton leading the country   even though she is far more qualified to do so and ryan admitted that several of trump s proposals were  wrong  and  don t reflect the view of fellow conservatives and republicans   ryan said  she represents a third obama term  i don t think that s good for america  i think that s the wrong direction  so  yes  things have been said that i  too  disagree with  then i ll make that point  then  but i m going to go fight for the principles and these solutions that i believe in  and the candidate that i think is so much more likely to put those into law  because i know hillary clinton won t do that  it is a binary choice  it is either donald trump or hillary clinton  you don t get a third option  it s one or the other and i know where i want to go  you can watch ryan expose how much the gop doesn t give a damn about america below featured image via screenshot
