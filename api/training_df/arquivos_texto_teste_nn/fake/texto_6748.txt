this week jimmy john s sandwiches offered   subs as a promotion for  customer appreciation day   hoping to revamp their image after the public caught wind of owner  jimmy john liautaud s disgusting business practices and hunting fetishes the company started posted their   sandwich day on facebook and instagram earlier this week and people immediately called them out  according to raw story  the admin on the business  official facebook page began deleting comments from posters who pointed out just how shady their ceo is  specifically  anyone who reminded potential customer s about liautaud s history as a big game hunter  had their comments immediately deleted in   the ceo admitted to the chicago tribune that he had killed a rhinoceros  elephants  and a leopard in the past  but claimed he doesn t hunt there anymore  i choose to hunt and i choose to fish   he said   everything i ve done has been totally legal  and the meat has been eaten  if not by me than by someone i m with  i don t hunt big african game anymore  he claimed that it had been ten years since his last hunt in africa  even though the pictures that outed him were from  in addition to killing innocent elephants  liautaud has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the republican party  in   chicago business reported he s faced down a union organizing drive and boycott in minnesota  his arizona franchisees have been picketed over his contributions to candidates who back that state s year old anti illegal immigration law  and he s stepped up his support of republican candidates and causes  giving    to sen  bill brady in the last few days of his losing gubernatorial bid and prominently co hosting a big fundraiser downstate last month for gop presidential front runner mitt romney  to name just two he is also one of the disgusting ceos who protested being forced to provide his employees with healthcare when the affordable care act took effect  in fact  he hated it so much that he made an appearance on fox news and said that he would begin cutting his workers  hours in an attempt to avoid it as if all of that wasn t reason enough to avoid his company  in  democrats in the house of representatives sent a letter to the labor department and federal trade commission asking for them to investigate jimmy john s after the company forced employees to sign non compete agreements  the letter stated  there is no justifiable business interest in imposing such a restriction on restaurant employees that are not privy to any of the company s proprietary information  furthermore  we believe this practice can intimidate working individuals  many of whom are struggling to support themselves and their families while earning barely above the minimum wage  with all of these unsavory facts out there  it s not surprising that jimmy john s would try to woo people with   sandwiches  unfortunately for them  there are thousands of people like me who want everyone to know how horrible the company and its ceo really are  it is going to take a helluva lot more than cheap sandwiches to make us forget all of this featured image instagram
