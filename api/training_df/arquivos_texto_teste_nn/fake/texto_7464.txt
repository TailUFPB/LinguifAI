everyone knows that republican front runner donald trump s twitter account is filled with nonsense and an absolute nightmare for any level headed american  trump has successfully funneled all of that bigotry and offensive rhetoric to his instagram account  as the business mogul has just posted a completely baffling ad meant to insult hillary clinton while nearly destroying his friendly relationship with russian president vladimir putin trump has previously spoken positively about putin and defended the russian leader several times  which won him putin s support for presidency  but in the ad  it doesn t seem like trump likes putin at all   it even seems like he s trying to destroy their mutually respectful bond  in the video  putin performs mma style combat moves for a few seconds before a clip of an isis soldier pointing a gun at the camera is shown  the text reads  when it comes to facing our toughest opponents  the democrats have the perfect answer and right as the text disappears  trump goes after democratic opponent hillary clinton by showing a clip where clinton is  barking    which is ironic since clinton was actually doing this to mock republicans for not being able to fight  our toughest opponents   this footage of clinton is from a campaign rally in february  and happened after telling a story about an old campaign ad that made a dog bark whenever someone lied  clinton was implying that the gop candidates were lying through their teeth about several of their claims  having this clip in trump s ad is completely out of context  and makes it even more confusing after the footage of clinton barking  the video cuts to some really uncomfortable footage of putin giggling creepily  the last line in the ad reads  we don t need to be a punch line  the ad is about  long seconds that make absolutely no sense   just like trump himself is this what we want for a president a video posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on mar    at   pdtfor someone who doesn t want america to become a punchline  trump has done an amazing job making our politics look like a joke  unfortunately  this video is getting tons of positive attention from trump s   million instagram followers  since being posted this afternoon  it has already received over   likes and thousands of comments trump has previously railed against clinton for imitating a dog  during a south carolina rally  trump criticized the former secretary of state  stating that the press would bury him if he acted the same way  he said  if i ever did that  i would be ridiculed all over the place  i won t do it  i m not going to imitate her   however  we all know that trump has done far worse given that trump has a history of misogyny and attacks on women  this strange anti clinton ad is nothing new  and it makes about just as much sense as he does  featured image via evan guest   flickr
