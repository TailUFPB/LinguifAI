what s the most anti american thing someone can do besides vote for donald trump in november  apparently  right wing freak ted nugent has the answer to that question  and it s something every american should hear  speaking with conservative radio host joe pags  he tells us  there is nothing more anti american than the freaks that hate me  and when moveon org  media matters  southern poverty law center  rachel maddow and msnbc lie and spew their hate towards me  it s because i stand with the best families in america  the man certainly thinks a lot of himself  doesn t he  one might have thought there was no more room in this country for egos  what with donald trump s ego growing miles by the minute after officially locking up the gop nomination  but one would be wrong  it takes a lot of ego and chutzpah for ted nugent to say that the most anti american thing imaginable is hating him he says that the nra is not a gun lobby during this interview  too  what is it  then  nugent says it s  mom and pop family america  and is standing up for the most fundamental instinct and god given individual right  that self defense  i e  owning guns  is good  har de har har  only nugent can fit this much nonsense into one interview he also rages against hillary clinton and bernie  mao tse tung  sanders about wanting to push gun owners down  and he talks about how he s right all the time if so many people have to hate on him so much  listen to him toss a major word salad below let s look at nugent for a moment  he s incredibly ammosexual   in fact  he was just re elected as a board member of the nra  despite the fact that many of the nra s members aren t nearly as crazy as nugent is  nugent thinks that anybody who even criticizes the nra just wants to help criminals before president obama was elected  he said that he would either be dead or imprisoned within two weeks of winning the election  that hasn t happened yet  but the secret service took it as a threat against obama and investigated it  he also referred to a lawmaker of mixed race heritage as a  subhuman mongrel  we must acknowledge  however  that ted nugent is a patriot among patriots   a word that s been usurped and twisted by the far right to only apply to white supremacists who love guns  fetuses and the bible  they hate the poor  along with starving children and anyone who thinks helping others is a good thing  he s a true patriot  except for that time he dodged the vietnam draft by pooping in his pants every day  or so he said but to say that the most anti american thing out there is to hate ted nugent is over the top  even for him  this man suffers from delusions of grandeur that we don t even see in donald trump for the most part featured image by jeff swensen stringer getty images
