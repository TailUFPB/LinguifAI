these republican politicians should be in jail right next to the bundys as it turns out  there is more to the armed standoff that took place at the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon  and americans should be outraged according to oregon public radio  opb  several republican lawmakers  including nevada state rep  michele fiore  oregon state rep  dallas heard  idaho state rep  judy boyle  washington state rep  matt shea and others  knew ammon and ryan bundy were planning to illegally lead an armed takeover of federal property in oregon before it happened  and they chose not to warn law enforcement fiore  shea  and other gop lawmakers are part of a group known as the coalition of western states which seeks to force the federal government to surrender federally protected lands to the states greenlee county  arizona  commissioner robert corbell  who went to nevada to support cliven bundy s standoff with the bureau of land management in   admitted to opb that after being a largely ignored group after that confrontation ended  the coalition of western states caught wind of another standoff that would be going down in oregon and kept quite about it so that their group could get more attention for their illegal cause corbell told opb that coalition leadership knew ammon bundy planned to take over u s  government property in harney county before it happened  but were unsure which federal outpost it would be we knew he was going to do something   corbell said cows believes it is unconstitutional for the federal government to own land even though the constitution specifically gives the federal government the power to own and regulate lands through what is known as the property clause article   section   clause  states the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states  and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the united states  or of any particular state yet  fiore and her fellow gop lawmakers actively conspired to spark a land war with federal authorities in an effort to force the government to comply with their demands and give up their constitutional powers opb reports that despite being warned by judge steve grasty during a meeting to stay away from the militants so as not to  embolden  them and cause the occupation to last weeks or months  fiore and her little band did so anyway the lawmakers acknowledge they fed the militants information gathered from that meeting  and militant leaders talked openly about what they learned from those disclosures these republicans literally presented themselves as negotiators with the intention to end the standoff so that they could enter the seized compound and help the armed militants extend the hostilities the lawmakers wanted information from law enforcement  including what tactics the fbi anticipated taking against the militants  they wondered aloud  for example  whether refuge power would be cut  law enforcement personnel repeatedly declined answering  the lawmakers continued to ask they also wanted to know what criminal charges the occupiers might face  after getting nowhere with that line of inquiry  coalition members asked with whom they could negotiate on behalf of the ammon bundy led militants former washington gop state rep  graham hunt also participated in the meeting and actually attempted to persuade the fbi into agreeing with militant s demand for a transfer of federal lands  would it be possible for somebody  whether it s the u s  attorney s office  to say that  we agree that there needs to be a conversation at another level   hunt asked but wait  there s more fiore and the coalition aided and abetted the militants in more ways than just feeding them information and trying to coerce the fbi from doing their job  they also helped organize press events and enlisted anthony bosworth  a failed candidate for sheriff  to act as a  security specialist  at the compound  bosworth even helped militants flee the occupation when it became clear that the fbi wasn t messing around in the end  fiore and her group decided that since the jig was up  they might as well look like the heroes  so they reluctantly convinced the last of the militants to surrender and now they have another goal  they want to keep the bundys and their fellow terrorists from facing significant criminal punishment for their crimes  they re even going so far as to tell the arrested militants to learn the names of the judges and prosecutors  perhaps as some sort of way to intimidate them into dropping the charges or going easy on them here s the report via opb the fact is that republican lawmakers knew this standoff was going to happen and did nothing to prevent it  one person was actually killed and many more could have died on both sides because these sorry excuses for politicians chose to pursue their agenda rather than keep the public safe add in the fact that these lawmakers basically acted as spies against the united states by gathering and passing information to the militants as well as egging them on to keep the standoff going longer than it would have and it s clear the fbi needs to arrest and jail a few more people these republicans conspired against the united states by aiding the militants and warning them about what law enforcement was doing to end the standoff  they don t belong in places of political power  they belong in prison awaiting sentencing for treason  featured image via twitter
