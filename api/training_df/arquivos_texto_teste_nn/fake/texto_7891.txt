while meeting with the press in the oval office on wednesday  president obama clearly had enough of republican obstructionism and party politics holding the nation back from having a full supreme court  the gop has made it clear that they won t even entertain the possibility of a new justice until there s a new president  however  that s not going to prevent obama from doing his job  and he really hopes these  sheepish  republicans step up and do their job as well obama said  i m going to do my job  i recognize the politics are hard for them  because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing  but that s not our job  our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties  obama knows that once a nominee is chosen  and the american public sees this republican obstructionism for all that it is  chances are  they won t be so quick to dismiss them  the president continued  i think it will be very difficult for mr  mcconnell to explain how  if the public concludes that this person is well qualified  that the senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons  we ll see what happens and i think the situation may evolve over time  i don t expect mitch mcconnell to say that is the case today  president obama then goes on to lay all the cards on the table and simply show the republicans for what they are  unconstitutional fools  the gop is trying so hard to prevent obama that they are going against their supposed values of being  strict constitutionalists   and obama shows them as the hypocrites that they truly are obama said  it s not in the text of the constitution  ironically  these are republicans who say they believe in reading the text of the constitution and focusing on the intent of the constitution  none of the founding fathers thought that  when it comes to the president carrying out his duties  he should do it for three years and on the last year stop doing it  also saying that these republicans  take a posture that defies the constitution  defies logic  and is not supported by tradition  and really not holding back  the president states  there s not a lot of vigor when they defend the position they re taking when they defend their point  they re pretty sheepish about it when they make those comments  which is exactly what they are  these republicans are choosing party politics over what s best for the nation  they want to obstruct any choice the president makes while vilifying a hypothetical appointee before they even know who it s going to be  they aren t even hiding their blatant politicking anymore  to be honest  these republicans should all find a new job if they don t want to do the one they ve been elected to do featured image  pete souza instagram
