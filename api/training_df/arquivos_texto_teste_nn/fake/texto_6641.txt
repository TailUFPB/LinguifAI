in case you haven t heard yet  creepy gop presidential candidate ted cruz has somehow decided that math doesn t matter and that he will win the republican party s nomination for president anyway  to that end  he has picked an equally creepy running mate in failed candidate carly fiorina  it seems that fiorina wanted to make sure that she was just as creepy as cruz  so during her speech when her status as running mate was announced  she chose to  for some bizarre reason  start singing to the crowd it was seriously the worst thing ever for those listening  and the best thing ever for late night comedians  late show host stephen colbert wasted absolutely no time in ripping fiorina for that ridiculous display  first  colbert roasted cruz himself for thinking he actually needed a running mate  since it s clear he won t be winning  the host began  that is bold  after tuesday s huge wins by clinton and trump  bernie sanders saw the writing on the wall and laid off hundreds of staffers  meanwhile  ted cruz saw the writing and covered it up with a  hang in there  baby  poster  he then pivoted to fiorina  who he said was clearly honored to accept this important job that will never exist   after that  things got really good  colbert ran tape of fiorina s creepy singing about ted cruz s daughters  the whole thing was just downright weird  colbert said of fiorina s bizarre and creepy attempt at spontaneous singing  it s like disney gave the wicked stepmother her own song  colbert is right  of course  carly fiorina doesn t need to be singing to anyone  much less two little girls who are probably just as creeped out by her as america is by their own father  but hey  at least it s good for a joke or two  hopefully both ted cruz and carly fiorina disappear into the dustins of history where they belong when this primary is finally over watch colbert s brilliance below featured image via video screen capture
