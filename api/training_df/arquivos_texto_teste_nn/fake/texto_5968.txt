while donald trump is undeniably very wealthy  but he was apparently never taught the responsibilities that go with wealth   to give back to the community  first  we learn that trump gives virtually none of his own money to charity  then we learn that  tagged for veterans never got there  now  we re learning that he s ripping charities off with his vodka the very fact that trump is marketing vodka under his name shows a serious lack of conviction and character  he doesn t drink and his brother died from what trump attributes to alcohol  i sort of hated doing it   trump said at the time of his vodka licensing deal   my brother  fred  who was the best  ended up being an alcoholic  and i learned a lot about alcohol and alcoholism from fred  source  huffington postso  trump said he d give the money  all the money  to mothers against drunk driving  i m going to give  percent of that money to them in honor of my late brother  fred trump   trump wrote in december    i guarantee you that fred is looking down now and saying   that s really the best thing to do  mothers against drunk driving didn t receive the money  to be fair  trump said they refused it because the money would have been ill gotten gains  at least from their perspective  they didn t want to profit from the sale of alcohol still  trump has a terrible charitable record  during the last two decades  trump  the alleged billionaire  has given only    million to charity  he s not even the largest contributor to his very own foundation  that s the world wrestling foundation  even evil leona hensley was more charitable than trump as for trump vodka  that s no more  the company  like so many of trump s companies  went belly up and the distillery moved to  surprise  mexico is this the most pressing issue facing trump s campaign  perhaps not  but it could help wake people up to the fact that he is no more than an every day conman  he has no intention of living up to any of his shallow promises featured image via john moore at getty images
