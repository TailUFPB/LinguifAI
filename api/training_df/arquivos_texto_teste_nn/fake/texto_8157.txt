here s a nice little factoid for you  out of all the candidates running for president this year  only one actually pays their interns  can you take a guess as to who that one person might be  it s none other than your favorite democratic socialist  senator bernie sanders you heard that right  no one else  not donald trump  not even hillary clinton  pay their interns  not in a house  not in a tree  not anywhere  to borrow a line from dr  suess  the washington post ran an unofficial investigation from the angle of how  presidential candidates ignore the costs of unpaid internships  despite their rhetoric to the contrary  it s particularly fitting considering they talk a big game about the  eroding middle class and rising social inequality   yet they treat their own workers like slaves even the leading republican candidates talk about income inequality openly  even though they may not get as much press coverage on the topic  yet still  somehow jeb bush  marco rubio  ben carson  ted cruz  and donald trump don t care enough to pay their interns  not bernie sanders  though  he pays his interns    an hour  not too shabby while we will admit this is nowhere close to the    an hour bernie advocates for on the campaign trail  it s far and above anything else the other candidates are offering if you believe in a higher minimum wage  this should be important to you  if you think workers need to be treated with respect  this difference between the candidates should be important to you  what better predictor is there for how a candidate is going to conduct themselves in office than how they conduct their own campaign featured image via flickr
