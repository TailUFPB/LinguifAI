after the release of making a murderer by netflix  people have been utterly mortified by the giant spotlight that s been shown on our criminal justice system  in this particular case  the criminal justice system in wisconsin after steven avery was cleared of any wrong doing after a conviction of rape in   he attempted to file a lawsuit against those who wrongfully accused him and purposefully put him into prison  however  the tables were turned once again when instead of getting the justice he deserved  he  alongside young brendan dassey  were accused and convicted for their alleged involvement in the murder of teresa halbach  the documentary series on netflix is horrifying to watch  because it shows how vindictive the officers and lawyers involved in the case were to make sure avery was put back into prison a  we the people  petition was created on the white house website to ask the obama administration to pardon steven avery and brendan dassey  the petition read steven avery and brendan dassey should be given a full pardon by president obama for their wrongful conviction in the connection to the murder of teresa halbach based on the evidence in the netflix documentary series  making a murderer   the justice system embarrassingly failed both men  completely ruining their entire lives there is clear evidence that the manitowoc county sheriff s department used improper methods to convict both steven avery and brendan dassey this is a black mark on the justice system as a whole  and should be recognized as such  while also giving these men the ability to live as normal a life as possible and because of the clear outpouring of support in favor of this petition  an official response has been given by the white house thank you for signing a we the people petition on the teresa halbach murder case  currently featured on the  making a murderer  documentary series  we appreciate your interest in this case to best respond to your petition  we should go over what exactly presidential pardoning power entails the u s  constitution grants the power of clemency to the president  the president   shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states  this clemency authority empowers the president to exercise leniency towards persons who have committed federal crimes  under the constitution  only federal criminal convictions  such as those adjudicated in the united states district courts  may be pardoned by the president  in addition  the president s pardon power extends to convictions adjudicated in the superior court of the district of columbia and military court martial proceedings  however  the president cannot pardon a state criminal offense since steven avery and brendan dassey are both state prisoners  the president cannot pardon them  a pardon in this case would need to be issued at the state level by the appropriate authorities while this case is out of the administration s purview  president obama is committed to restoring the sense of fairness at the heart of our justice system  that s why he has granted  commutations total   more than the last five presidents combined   and has issued  pardons over his time in office  they also exhibited how many sentences have been commuted by president obama   far more than any president in recent history  they added this administration has taken a number of important actions to reduce the federal prison population in keeping with the president s continuing efforts to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system at all phases and to better address the vicious cycle of poverty  criminality and incarceration that traps too many americans and weakens too many communities  these include in   president obama also issued an executive order creating a task force on  century policing that produced a concrete blueprint for cities and towns seeking to put in place new strategies to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve while enhancing public safety   the task force s final report is available here  and he has met with americans across the country who are working to improve the criminal justice system  from law enforcement officials working to lower crime and incarceration rates  to former prisoners who are earning their second chance  last summer  he became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison  and he continues to work with congress to pass meaningful criminal justice reform that makes the system more cost effective  fairer  and smarter  while enhancing the ability of law enforcement to keep our communities safe thanks again for raising your voices  we hope you ll continue to participate on the platform it s unfortunate that because avery and dassey are state prisoners they cannot be pardoned by the president  it s also unfortunate that they are in wisconsin with the equally as corrupt gov  scott walker who refuses to pardon the men  walker s press secretary issued the cop out response  stating those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court it s not looking likely for justice to be served for avery and dassey  but one can still hold out hope that their convictions for their alleged involvement will be overturned featured image via netflix
