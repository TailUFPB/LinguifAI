last saturday  a bunch of well armed  militiamen  decided to protest the extended sentence of two oregon ranchers  dwight and steven hammond  who started fires on federal land near their property  the federal law they broke has a minimum five year sentence  and according to rolling stone  the first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences  which they served  but the u s  attorney in the case called foul  the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence  in october   the ninth circuit imposed the mandatory minimum  ruling that   given the seriousness of arson  a five year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense   the ranchers are due back in federal prison monday to serve out their five years each  well  not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long  ammon bundy  son of the infamous anti government imbecile cliven bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the bureau of land management  blm  not too long ago  decided he would involve himself in the fight against  tyranny  of government against these law breaking ranchers  bundy  and his band of merry morons  decided to take over the malheur wildlife refuge in burns  oregon  he posted a video to facebook where he declared  we have basically taken over the malheur wildlife refuge  and this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here  and we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms  maybe they don t need their legs well  needless to say  the government isn t being  tyrannical   but rather following the laws as they are written  these  militiamen  may not like the laws  but that s what elections are for   you vote in the people who make the laws  you don t hold armed protests  or rather hissy fits  in an empty wildlife refuge nonetheless  in no particular order  here are the five stupidest things done by these make believe  patriots  in oregon if there s a protest by ultra right wing morons to be had somewhere  you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled  and not disappointing us in the slightest  the bundy  militia   made sure to offer some doozies  looks like maybe they could have used some of that  tyranical goverment   to help them get a better education via littlegreenfootballs comone of the  patriots   jon ritzenheimer  even made a goodbye video for his family  occupying a bird refuge is dangerous  and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them after this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of  soldiers  apparently forgot the boy scout motto  be prepared         if  d getelementbyid

by setting up camp on federal land  the government can t be too tyrannical if they are allowed to stay as long as they have now  one may have seen a lot of weird  strange  and or pathetic things in their lifetime  but this may have to take the cake  one of these  patriots  armed himself and took shelter under a blue tarp and was ready to fight at a moments notice  and yes  this is as weird and stupid as it sounds  so leave it to twitter to take over the well deserved mockery is that a militiaman under your tarp or are you just happy to see me pic twitter com vrkstngyyr  kstreethipster

seeing more about the blue tarp man  i suggest visiting the  tarpman hashtag on twitter this protest  that could actually be labeled treason  if we look at how the founding fathers would ve viewed this lame attempt in overturning a federal sentence  could also clearly be called a seditious conspiracy  furthermore  insurrection is explicitly written against in the constitution while we watch these idiots get away with treason for now  we can at least have entertainment from their utter stupidity featured image  twitter
