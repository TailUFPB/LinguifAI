leading presidential candidate and former reality tv star donald trump gets angry any time reporters or his political rivals bring up trump university and the legal problems associated with the enterprise that made him a significant amount of money  already republican super pacs are attacking trump on the issue  but here are  secrets about trump university that democrats are sure to use against him in the fall election  which could quickly deny him the white house trump university was actually a series of seminars often organized and held in the lobbies of hotels across the country  preying on people who hoped to duplicate the success donald trump claims he has had in the real estate industry  the  school  promised regular joes and jills they would have access to trump s unique insights and techniques in an email to prospective clients  trump bragged   seventy six percent of the world s millionaires made their fortunes in real estate  and told people   my father did it  i did it  and now i m ready to teach you how to do it  of course  trump s father  did it  by reportedly engaging in racist practices while a landlord  and trump himself started out with a million dollar loan from his dad and a series of shaky deals built on other people s money  sometimes resulting in bankruptcies less than a year after the business launched in   the new york state department of education said it was operating an unlicensed educational institution  a violation a state law  so by   the name was changed to  trump entrepreneur initiative  trump university is being sued in new york by attorney general eric t  schneiderman and in two class action lawsuits in california in the new york lawsuit  the school has been accused of being a  bait and switch  operation that relied on totally false advertising one ad published at least  times across the country in   according to mr  schneiderman s office  promised that students would  learn from donald trump s handpicked instructors  and that participants would have access to trump s real estate  secrets    but an investigation by mr  schneiderman s office found that mr  trump had little to do with picking instructors or developing the curriculums for the seminars  which were run largely by people with motivational speaking backgrounds who were compensated based on how many people they persuaded to buy additional seminars  one of them was a manager at a buffalo wild wings here s one of the adskathleen meese of schoharie  n y  was caring for her son with down syndrome attended a trump university three day conference at a hotel in malta  n y  and was then hit with a hard sell in which she was told she could make money faster if she signed up for the  gold elite  program which cost     she said a trump university trainer pressured her into putting the costs on her credit card that only had a    limit who told her  i had to find the resources to invest in my future  in an affidavit in the new york lawsuit against trump  meese testified that all that money bought her was a few visits to some rental properties  noting   i was unable to get my refund and am still paying off debts from my trump tuition  trump university students say they were led to believe that at the seminar they would get the opportunity to take a photo with trump himself  which of course is something a wannabe real estate mogul would love to get a shot at instead of a photo with the real live trump  they were instead directed to stand next to a cardboard cutout of trump for a picture here is an example of one such photo i don t know why people say trump university was a scam  a photo with my cardboard cutout is totally worth     pic twitter com   donald j  trump   candidatetrump  february    image via sf gate
