this story is about more than a massive cover up for an elected officials who sexually assaulted innocent women  it s also about the media s lack of desire to report about crimes that have obviously been covered up in dc for a very long time  perhaps the media s reluctance to report about the sexual abuse taking place in washington dc  is because most  if not all  of the elected officials whose crimes are now being uncovered  are democrats  so far  two of the most rabid anti trump democrats in washington  senator al franken  d mi  and now representative john conyers  d mi  have been outed is it a coincidence  or could it be that one of the reasons democrats are so adamantly opposed to trump s presidency is because he is shaking things up in washington  and in doing so  he s breaking up the good ole  boys network buzzfeed   michigan rep  john conyers  a democrat and the longest serving member of the house of representatives  settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in  with a former employee who alleged she was fired because she would not  succumb to  sexual advances  documents from the complaint obtained by buzzfeed news from mike cernovich  include four signed affidavits  three of which are notarized  from former staff members who allege that conyers  the ranking democrat on the powerful house judiciary committee  repeatedly made sexual advances to female staff that included requests for sexual favors  contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed conyers was having affairs  caressing their hands sexually  and rubbing their legs and backs in public  four people involved with the case verified the documents are authentic and the documents also reveal the secret mechanism by which congress has kept an unknown number of sexual harassment allegations secret  a grinding  closely held process that left the alleged victim feeling  she told buzzfeed news  that she had no option other than to stay quiet and accept a settlement offered to her  i was basically blackballed  there was nowhere i could go   she said in a phone interview  buzzfeed news is withholding the woman s name at her request because she said she fears retribution last week the washington post reported that congress s office of compliance paid out   million for  settlements with federal employees over  years for various violations  including sexual harassment  the conyers documents  however  give a glimpse into the inner workings of the office  which has for decades concealed episodes of sexual abuse by powerful political figures the woman who settled with conyers launched the complaint with the office of compliance in   alleging she was fired for refusing his sexual advances  and ended up facing a daunting process that ended with a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a settlement of more than     her settlement  however  came from conyers  office budget rather than the designated fund for settlements congress has no human resources department  instead  congressional employees have  days to report a sexual harassment incident to the office of compliance  which then leads to a lengthy process that involves counseling and mediation  and requires the signing of a confidentiality agreement before a complaint can go forward after this an employee can choose to take the matter to federal district court  but another avenue is available  an administrative hearing  after which a negotiation and settlement may follow in this case  one of conyers  former employees was offered a settlement  in exchange for her silence  that would be paid out of conyers  taxpayer funded office budget  his office would  rehire  the woman as a  temporary employee  despite her being directed not to come into the office or do any actual work  according to the document  the complainant would receive a total payment of     over the three months  after which point she would be removed from the payroll  according to the document the draft agreement viewed by buzzfeed news was unsigned  but congressional employment records match the timing and amounts outlined in the document  the woman left the office and never went public with her story the process was  disgusting   said matthew peterson  who worked as a law clerk representing the complainant  and who listed as a signatory to some of the documents hillary clinton and john conyers have been longtime friends  what is it about hillary that sexual predators find so endearing   it is a designed cover up   said peterson  who declined to discuss details of the case but agreed to characterize it in general terms   you feel like they were betrayed by their government just for coming forward  it s like being abused twice  two staffers alleged in their signed affidavits that conyers used congressional resources to fly in women they believed he was having affairs with  another said she was tasked with driving women to and from conyers  apartment and hotel rooms rep  conyers did not admit fault as part of the settlement  his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on monday citizen journalist mike cernovich admonishes  journalists  who are tasked with reporting the news for a living for ignoring how massive this cover up really is the conyers settlement was  out of  how about you  journalists  stop hating on me and go find those other    mike cernovich     cernovich  november    documents were first provided to buzzfeed news by mike cernovich  the men s rights figure turned pro trump media activist who propagated a number of false conspiracy theories including the  pizzagate  conspiracy  cernovich said he gave the documents to buzzfeed news for vetting and further reporting  and because he said if he published them himself  democrats and congressional leaders would  try to discredit the story by attacking the messenger   he provided them without conditions  buzzfeed news independently confirmed the authenticity of the documents with four people directly involved with the case  including the accuser here s citizen journalist mike cernovich telling his massive twitter audience that speaker of the house paul ryan helped to cover up john conyers disgusting sexual assaults congressman john conyers is a sexual predator  and paul ryan covered it all up https   t co   mike cernovich     cernovich  november    her complaint  the former employee said conyers repeatedly asked her for sexual favors and often asked her to join him in a hotel room  on one occasion  she alleges that conyers asked her to work out of his room for the evening  but when she arrived the congressman started talking about his sexual desires  she alleged he then told her she needed to  touch it   in reference to his penis  or find him a woman who would meet his sexual demands she alleged conyers made her work nights  evenings  and holidays to keep him company in another incident  the former employee alleged the congressman insisted she stay in his room while they traveled together for a fundraising event  when she told him that she would not stay with him  she alleged he told her to  just cuddle up with me and caress me before you go  rep  conyers strongly postulated that the performing of personal service or favors would be looked upon favorably and lead to salary increases or promotions   the former employee said in the documents three other staff members provided affidavits submitted to the office of compliance that outlined a pattern of behavior from conyers that included touching the woman in a sexual manner and growing angry when she brought her husband around one affidavit from a former female employee states that she was tasked with flying in women for the congressman   one of my duties while working for rep  conyers was to keep a list of women that i assumed he was having affairs with and call them at his request and  if necessary  have them flown in using congressional resources   said her affidavit   a second staffer alleged in an interview that conyers used taxpayer resources to fly women to him  the employee said in her affidavit that conyers also made sexual advances toward her   i was driving the congressman in my personal car and was resting my hand on the stick shift  rep  conyers reached over and began to caress my hand in a sexual manner  the woman said she told conyers she was married and not interested in pursuing a sexual relationship  according to the affidavit  she said she was told many times by constituents that it was well known that conyers had sexual relationships with his staff  and said she and other female staffers felt this undermined their credibility  i am personally aware of several women who have experienced the same or similar sexual advances made towards them by rep john conyers   she said in her affidavit a male employee wrote that he witnessed rep  conyers rub the legs and other body parts of the complainant  in what appeared to be a sexual manner  and saw the congressman rub and touch other women  in an inappropriate manner   the employee said he confronted conyers about this behavior  rep  conyers said he needed to be  more careful  because bad publicity would not be helpful as he runs for re election  he ended the conversation with me by saying he would  work on  his behavior   the male staffer said in his affidavit
