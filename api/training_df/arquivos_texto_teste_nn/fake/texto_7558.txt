failed former presidential candidate ben carson is back   and crazier than ever  the retired neurosurgeon who was once leading the republican party before a severe case of dishonesty and ridiculous nonsense spewing habit ruined his campaign is once again making headlines  for an even more awful reason than before on friday  carson announced his endorsement of republican front runner donald trump at a press conference  saying that the two men had  buried the hatchet  and that trump was  the voice of the people to be heard  almost as ridiculous as that endorsement is carson s inspiration for such a horrible decision   he says he was encouraged to support the disgraced candidate after a so called vision from god during the press conference  a reporter made the mistake of asking carson just how much god played a part in his choice to stand behind trump  the reporter asked   you said throughout your life god has led you to your most important decisions  this truly is an important decision  did god lead you to donald trump  carson said that god had given him several signs   once of which included a vision from an unnamed friend  i prayed about it a lot  and i got a lot of indications  people calling me that i haven t talked to for a long time saying  i had this dream about you and donald trump   i mean  just amazing things as if carson couldn t make himself seem any crazier  he dialed things up when he started speaking about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  stating that she is of the devil  hillary clinton was a great friend of saul alinsky  on a first name basis with him as a student  he wrote the book  rules for radicals  and if you haven t read it  i recommend that you read it  and see the kinds of things that are recommended to change  fundamentally change  this nation from the great success we have to a socialist country  and the dedication page of that book says  dedicated to lucifer  the original radical who gained his own kingdom  i don t want anything to do with anything like that  you can watch this outrageous part of the conference unfold below carson also said that he was afraid hillary clinton  would destroy america    a hilarious statement considering that most of the gop is currently freaking out because trump is leading the party and threatening to do just that  this endorsement from carson is even more puzzling because just two weeks ago  carson said that super tuesday voters were not  quite that dense  to help trump become the nominee  the former candidate also said that voting for trump was  a very very bad mistake   divine intervention is apparently a powerful thing   and we now have carson s  visions  to thank for the   person donor list that trump just inherited with this endorsement featured image via ben carson facebook page
