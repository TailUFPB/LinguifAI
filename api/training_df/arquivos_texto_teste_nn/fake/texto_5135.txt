the  nevertrump gop delegates are a determined bunch  they tried tirelessly to change the rules of the republican national convention to keep donald trump from officially becoming their standard bearer  when the rule change was shot down  chaos ensued on the convention floor in cleveland s quicken loans arena as they demanded a roll call vote  which was also denied  this resulted in a walkout by the colorado delegation  and  of course  the great orange one was officially given the banner of the party to carry that thursday night  most people assumed that the  free the delegates  group was done after this  nothing could be further from the truth  though this same group of people is now calling for an emergency meeting of the republican national committee as they launch yet another sure to fail effort to dump trump  it bears noting that this likely is mostly an effort to continue making noise  to show the rnc and the american public that the entire gop is not like donald trump  the proposed purpose for the meeting is to lay out the law about how the rnc could go about defying the will of the republican primary voters and get rid of trump  they will be particularly interested in rule   which is a provision specifically created to facilitate the replacing of an official nominee because of death  declination  or otherwise   since trump isn t dead and likely won t be dropping out   otherwise  is the vague word these never trumpers will be looking to find their loophole in it probably won t happen  but seeing as how trump is falling further and further behind democratic nominee hillary clinton in the polls  they have reason to believe that he simply isn t a viable candidate  further  the sea of controversy in which trump has engaged since being formally nominated  from his ongoing feud with the family of a fallen muslim american soldier to his initial refusal to endorse house speaker paul ryan and arizona senator john mccain  means that trump clearly has zero capability or intention of becoming presidential  if all else fails  the  nevertrump people could always support the new independent bid by conservative intelligence official evan mcmullin all of that being said  though  these folks may as well hang it up  the gop is no longer the party of lincoln  it is the party of trump featured image via spencer platt getty images
