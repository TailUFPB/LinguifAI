after witnessing disgraceful debate after disgraceful debate  former secretary of state colin powell decided he couldn t stay silent any longer and shared a harsh message to the republican candidates  stop it we all know that this particular election has deteriorated any and all respect the republican party had left  but not many of us could say it as eloquently as powell did in an interview on npr s all things considered  while expressing his sentiments for the late first lady nancy reagan  powell mentioned that he felt she would be  disturbed  by the way the current gop candidates claim to keep her husband s legacy alive powell should know   he was reagan s national security adviser   and recalled that the former president acted with the utmost  civility  and lacked any of the  nastiness  the party s current presidential candidates possess  he called out the childish behavior and bickering that accompanies every single republican debate  comparing them to the jerry springer show  to stand there and do junior high school tricks on one another i think is belittling the country and belittling the office to which they are striving to gain  and i hope they start realizing as amusing as it might be  and this is realty television  even jerry springer thinks it s gone too far  and when jerry springer thinks you ve gone too far  my friends  you have gone too far  powell was referencing the fact that jerry springer  who was the democratic mayor of cincinnati in the  before hosting his drama filled talk show  had recently decried the gop debates and said that  our show is a circus  but the presidency of the united states is not supposed to be a circus  powell s words of wisdom to the gop    we have to become more respectful of each other    a message that the candidates are probably not mature enough to internalize  you can listen to the npr interview below but powell s message doesn t stop with the npr interview  he also shared a similar message monday morning with cbs  saying that the republican  campaign has gone into the mud   he said  the comments that they re making toward each other  the nastiness  it s running us into the ground  the foreigners of the world  looking at this  are distressed  you can watch that interview below while powell has supported president barack obama for both of his terms  powell insisted that he is still a republican but that he will  always vote for the person who i think is best for america at that time  powell has criticized the gop before  during obama s first term  the former secretary of state said  in   i spoke out against calling the president a muslim as if that was a curse  i don t know anything in the constitution that says muslims are bad   in   powell once again opposed a level of intolerance in some parts of the party   and there was  and i think there still is  powell has not said that he is endorsing any specific republican candidate at this time  or that he is criticizing any particular candidate with his remarks  either way  his message certainly applies to every single one of them
