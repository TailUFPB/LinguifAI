as donald trump makes the downhill run to cleveland this july  those loyal to the republican party who see it as a viable political entity for the next century rather than the cesspool of racism  hypocrisy and hate run by the wealthy that it is are trying desperately to save their beloved sham  america is divided  politically we are either in favor of progress and societal evolution or we re with the rich guys who couldn t care less  but all life matters and poor people are stealing your paycheck it really is that simple  you don t hear about plans to save and revive the democratic party  our numbers grow as people learn to read and use google  how many times can a person with any intelligence land back on a  pants on fire  designation for yet another conservative  news  crock of sh t before they figure out the gop is a scam   anyway  those people who are tried and true republicans who know that donald trump is about to be the laughing stock of the nation when actual debate issues come up and the republican party will pay dearly as he alienates more and more groups of people  trying desperately to get elected exclusively by angry white males  the establishment republicans charged with seeing their party into the future can t endorse it  mitt romney and ben sasse are kicking around the idea of a third party run  not by them of course  but the inevitable result of splitting the conservative vote is a clinton win  it looks like the inevitable result of a straight trump versus clinton matchup ends with a clinton win as well  so those still interested in seeing anyone but donald trump represent the republican party in november are beginning to think of longshot last plays  the  nevertrump movement has come up with one  and if properly put into place  it could change electoral history in order for someone to win the white house  they must receive  electoral votes  democrats have a distinct lead in electoral votes before polling begins  so the gop always faces an uphill battle to begin with  if you want to see a third party candidate in the white house you don t have to run one in the election  you just have to make sure neither of the candidates from the major party gets to   what happens then  according to the constitution  the house of representatives will then appoint paul ryan or mittens or jeb bush or whoever else they feel works best for their political agenda  by a simple majority vote so how do you keep the candidates from getting enough electoral votes  the idea from  nevertrump is simple enough in theory  run an influential person in each state and only in that state  take enough electoral votes that way and nobody gets to   think about it what if enough people in florida decided that they would vote for jeb bush because neither of the major party candidates appealed to them  they know jeb  they trust him  if he s on the ticket there s a darned good reason  in  that by itself would have sent the presidential election to a vote  not restricted to the candidates on the ballot  in the congressional lower chamber  if that happens this year  speaker ryan will get to appoint his first president the  nevertrump movement is more than likely futile because in the end the republicans are gonna batten down the hatches and ride the trump wave all the way to historical comedy featured image by matt mills mcknight getty images
