there are many important issues in the world  racism  discrimination  poverty  police brutality  unfortunately  republicans   issue of the week   while it touches on one of those in all the worst ways  is something so unimportant  so petty  that americans are actually paying attention to the plight of transgender individuals for once all across the nation  the gop is focused on making sure that no one with a penis enters a women s restroom  even if they identify as a woman  kansas  for example  literally wants to place a bounty on transgender individuals with its  spot a penis  win a prize bill  which provides financial incentives for people who simply share a bathroom with a transgender individual to childishly scream  eek  a penis  republicans in other states   massachusetts  michigan  missouri  and south carolina  and others  are attempting to punish transgender people simply for using the correct restroom while north carolina and mississippi  for example  have already passed legislation that punish women who happen to have a penis  let s face it  they aren t concerned with trans men  for going pee not to be outdone by the other bigots in our country  one texas city has thrown itself into the fray with a  bathroom bill  that would levy huge fines against transgender people   though they are attempting a new approach to the matter by claiming that it doesn t target transgender individuals now  you may be shaking your head at his point and asking   f cking seriously   but we assure you it s true the new civil rights movement reports transgender people could face fines of up to   for using restrooms according to their gender identity under an ordinance to be considered by the city council in rockwall  texas  on monday the ordinance  submitted by rockwall mayor jim pruitt  photo   would require people to use restrooms according to their  biological sex   as shown on their birth certificates  it would also bar businesses from allowing trans people to use restrooms according to their gender identity  i just think that it s insanity not to have those protections in place   pruitt  a republican  told wfaa tv   these folks aren t transgender that this is targeting  this is targeting folks of the opposite sex that are going into those restrooms under the guise of being transgender and having access   this is not about sexual orientation or anything of that nature  it is about privacy and the protection of our children  republicans love to claim that they are protecting women and children with these obviously discriminatory pieces of legislation but the truth is that there isn t a single verifiable instance of a transgender individual so much as harassing a non transgender person in a bathroom  none  nada  zilch  in fact  if they truly wanted to protect women and children in bathrooms  republican lawmakers would ban republican lawmakers from entering bathrooms at all at this point  everyone needs to recognize these bills for what they are  they keep no one safe  they do not prevent crime  they do not protect women or children  they do not make sense when one looks at crime statistics  what they do is perpetuate a culture of hate and fear among the poorly educated and bigoted in society  they increase the chance that women   cisgender or trans   will be harassed by stupid people who think they don t look feminine enough  they do nothing but promote exactly the sort of mentality that reasonable people have been trying to eliminate every single time conservatives find a new group of people at whom they can level their irrational hatred but they do accomplish one positive thing  they bring attention to the plight of a group of people who regularly face discrimination  yet whose cries for help are ignored watch one example of the sort of nonsense this legislation encourages below   featured image via tumblr
