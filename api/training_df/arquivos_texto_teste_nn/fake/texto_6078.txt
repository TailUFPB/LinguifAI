when listening to donald trump one really can t believe anything he actually says without tangible proof  let s just say he s not the most honest fellow  and he s a guy who really likes to talk himself up  regardless of facts one of the biggest falsifications of actual events that trump has gotten caught doing is with his supposed donations to veteran groups  then when called out on these pretty blatant falsehoods by reporters  he verbally assaults them because he doesn t like people calling him out on his lies noticing these lies and misrepresentations of actualities is democratic front runner hillary clinton  just imagine if it were her greatly exaggerating claims of raising money for veterans and donations made by herself to organizations  she would get eaten alive by the press and it would likely be a major game changer clinton called in live to cnn regarding trump  and said  well  i think the problem here is the difference between what donald trump says and what donald trump does  he s bragged for months about raising six million dollars for veterans and donating a million dollars himself  but it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to veterans  so  look  i m glad he finally did  but i don t know that he should get much credit for that  and she s absolutely correct  and it s likely very true that if trump hadn t been called out then those donations probably still would not have been made donald trump loves donald trump more than anyone else on this planet  and like everyone else  when someone goes after the one you love you may get brutally defensive  as we ve witnessed with the media scrutinization of trump s supposed donations  and if he can t handle the scutinization from the press  how the hell is he going to handle being leader of the free world listen here  hillary clinton  donald trump was shamed into  actually making his contribution  to veterans https   t co  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  may    image via video screen capture
