north carolina republicans just got slam dunked by the greatest nba player of all time their bigotry has cost the state many economic opportunities since  was signed into law  corporations are cancelling projects  entertainers are cancelling performances  the federal government is looking into stopping the flow of federal cash into the state  the nba has threatened to pull the all star game out of the state  yet republicans are refusing to repeal the law that literally allows business owners to discriminate against lgbt people it s all because republicans are obsessed with transgender people using the bathroom according to conservatives  the law is necessary to protect women and children from sexual predators whom they claim will use transgender protections as a shield to defend going into women s restrooms and locker rooms to commit sexual assault  but that claim has been debunked  even by fox news  because there has not been a single instance of that scenario occurring in the  states and over  cities that have transgender protections in place now nba legend michael jordan has spoken out against the law  declaring in a statement that the charlotte hornets organization does not support discrimination and that the time warner cable arena will continue to be a safe and inclusive place for everyone jordan issued the following statement through the charlotte observer on april   as my organization has stated previously  the charlotte hornets and hornets sports   entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form  and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment  as has been the case since the building opened  we will continue to ensure that all fans  players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending nba games and events in time warner cable arena  this should be considered a strong statement by his airness considering his history of declining to get involved in politics jordan was raised in north carolina  he went to high school there and attended college at the university of north carolina where he played basketball for the tar heels before being drafted by the chicago bulls in   he would go on to win six championships with the bulls and is widely regarded as the best player in the history of the game he is now the owner of the charlotte hornets and is considered one of the most influential and powerful figures in the state  so this statement carries a lot of weight  now one just has to wonder how long it will be before republicans pass a bill specifically banning transgender people from using the bathroom at the time warner cable arena featured image via youtube
