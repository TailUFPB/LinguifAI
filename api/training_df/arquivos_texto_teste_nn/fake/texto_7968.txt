anyone who has read the bible knows that that jesus feller is quite fond of helping the poor  unfortunately  either one san fransisco catholic church mistook homeless people for plants that need regular watering  or they didn t get the memo  jesus made himself very clear in the sermon on the mount that the both the poor and those who show them mercy are  blessed   but saint mary s cathedral in san fransisco  california  has decided that those dirty poors don t really need help  anyway the area s homeless  until recently  were able to take shelter from harsh weather in sheltered alcoves that mark the cathedral s four side doors  not only did st  mary s put up multiple  no trespassing  signs  but they also installed a watering system with a single purpose  to prevent the homeless from seeking shelter there a san fransisco cbs station reports  they actually have signs in there that say   no trespassing   said a homeless man named robert but there are no signs warning the homeless about what happens in these doorways  at various times  all through the night  water pours from a hole in the ceiling  about  feet above  drenching the alcove and anyone in it the shower ran for about  seconds  every  to  minutes while we were there  starting before sunset  simultaneously in all four doorways  kcbs witnessed it soak homeless people  and their belongings one could argue that the watering system might be intended to keep everything clean  but the news station points out that this is not the case  in fact  it serves mainly as a waste of water in the midst of a drought the water doesn t really clean the area  there are syringes  cigarette butts  soggy clothing and cardboard  there is no drainage system  the water pools on the steps and sidewalks a neighbor who witnessed the drenching told kcbs   i was just shocked  one because it s inhumane to treat people that way  the second thing is that we are in this terrible drought kcbs reports that in addition to being inhumane  the system was installed illegally and may violate water use regulations  iframe width    height    src  https   www youtube com embed qknms ufsi rel  amp showinfo   frameborder    allowfullscreen   iframe  it s very shocking  and very inhumane  there s not really another way to describe it   said jennifer friedenbach  executive director of the coalition on homeless   certainly not formed on the basis of catholic teachings  the cathedral confirmed that the watering system was  indeed  installed to keep the homeless from sleeping there but argued that  while the church refuses to allow the homeless to sleep in the doorways of a building that is only used a few times a week  a completely cost free effort   they really do try to help them  we refer them  mostly to catholic charities  for example for housing   spokesman chris lyford said   to saint anthony s soup kitchen for food  if they want food on that day  saint vincent de paul if they need clothes  we do the best we can  and supporting the dignity of each person   said lyford  who apparently considers dumping water on the homeless to be dignified   but there is only so much you can do  many of the homeless bring waterproof gear and umbrelas to protect themselves from the church s misguided and cruel efforts to keep them from taking shelter  proving the system to be an ineffective deterrant  but the horrible treatment has done nothing but diminish the cathedral in the eyes of its neighbors the archdioces of san fransisco said in a statement that the system would be addressed quickly  catholic organizations in san francisco serve thousands of homeless people every year  providing shelter  food  and critical services   the statement says  defending the church   that is the true picture of compassionate catholic care  unfortunately  it s what happened before they got caught that matters watch a report on this horrible treatment of the homeless below featured image via cbs san fransisco
