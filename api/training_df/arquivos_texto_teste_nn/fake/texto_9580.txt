it s not at all surprising that at least   of democrats consider themselves to be atheists  fascinating this has to be embarrassing       if you re an atheist  a new study performed at the university of york used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain  the result  belief in god disappeared among more than  percent of participants that in itself may not seem so embarrassing  but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex the part associated with detecting and solving problems  i e   reasoning and logic in other words  when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning  greater levels of atheism result you ve heard the phrase   i don t have enough faith to be an atheist   apparently  we can now also say   i have too many brains to be an atheist    the american visiondaily mail  the study was carried out by dr keise izuma from the university of york and colin holbrook from the university of california  los angeles  ucla  they recruited  participants with an average age of   to take part in the study each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs  and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low level  sham  procedure that did not affect their brains the other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation  tms  to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex  pmfc  this part of the brain  located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead  is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them following the treatment  all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants the death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death to address their levels of prejudice  participants were asked to read two essays   one critical and one positive   written by an immigrant from latin america about the us after reading each essay  participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views religious belief was measured using a version of the supernatural belief scale items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings questions included   there exists an all powerful  all knowing  loving god    there exist good personal spiritual beings  whom we might call angels  and  there exists an evil personal spiritual being  whom we might call the devil  circa   so how do democrats and republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs  athesists according to the pew research center   nones    people who don t identify with any religion   make up  percent of american adults in the democratic party  that number is even bigger   percent of democrats are non religious  pew s research shows conversely  people who identify as non religious are much more likely to vote democratic   percent of self identifying atheists  for example  voted for president obama in   according to pew one of those atheists is james white  a texas delegate for hillary clinton at this year s dnc  at the convention on monday  white was wearing a shirt that read   i m actually an atheist  white said he still feels it s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party  when we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly  year old texas middle aged white guy is an atheist and a democrat  those things make it easier for others to come forward too   he said  there has been some progress  white said  earlier this year  the texas democratic party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform the investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test  we think that hearing criticisms of your group s values  perhaps especially from a person you perceive as an outsider  is processed as an ideological sort of threat   said dr izuma  one way to respond to such threats is to  double down  on your group values  increasing your investment in them  and reacting more negatively to the critic   he continued  when we disrupted the brain region that usually helps detect and respond to threats  we saw a less negative  less ideologically motivated reaction to the critical author and his opinions    daily mail
