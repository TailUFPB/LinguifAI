they threw everything but the kitchen sink at judge roy moore  democrats outspent moore    and more importantly  the democrat party unified  like they always do  to get behind their candidate  think hillary clinton   no matter their flaws  or how weak of a candidate he or she may be  meanwhile  the republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered  they argued amongst themselves  and they waited until the  hour to get behind roy moore  the republican candidate who was accused  without evidence  by several women  one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him  of sexual misconduct several decades ago  the media will try to blame this loss on president trump  but the truth of the matter is  that the republican party came late to the game with funding and with support for roy moore  while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate  the spineless republican party can take credit for the historic loss tonight in alabama ap   in a stunning victory aided by scandal  democrat doug jones won alabama s special senate election on tuesday  beating back history  an embattled republican opponent and president donald trump  who urgently endorsed gop rebel roy moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations it was the first democratic senate victory in a quarter century in alabama  one of the reddest of red states  and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of trump  it was a major embarrassment for the president and a fresh wound for the nation s already divided republican party a number of republicans declined to support him  including alabama s long serving sen  richard shelby  but trump lent his name and the national gop s resources to moore s campaign in recent days
