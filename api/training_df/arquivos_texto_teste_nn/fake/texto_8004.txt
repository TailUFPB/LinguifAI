if you ever want to know how stupid republicans are when it comes to economics  you don t need to look back over the decades of republican presidents and their associated financial disasters  all you need to do is find any potential republican presidential candidate  and examine their tax plan  s crop of candidates does not fail in this  every single one of them that has come out with a plan has been universally mocked by legitimate economic scholars that use real math because their plans are more unrealistic than a stop motion monster movie the latest member of the idiot village to have his tax fantasy completely trashed is ted cruz  his  plan  reads like something a failed james bond villain would try to do in order to destroy the u s  economy here are some of the features included in cruz s plan a  percent flat income tax rate ted wants to replace our seven different tax brackets with one single tax rate of  percent  a flat tax always favors the wealthy while hurting the poor  to put it simply  the poor can t afford to have taxes deducted from their income like the rich can  when you pay  percent of  million dollars you have   remaining and you aren t starving  when you pay  percent of   you re left with    and you are starving worse because you were already starving at    don t forget  we would probably have to cut food stamps and other social safety nets because there is no money for them  add into that the fact you are paying in taxes equal to about what a single individual would get in food stamps per year  while not actually getting food stamps elimination of many major taxes cruz wants to remove the estate tax  misclassified as a  death tax  by republicans   alternative minimum tax  payroll tax  corporate taxes  and the medicare surtax imposed by the affordable care act  if you want a way to underfund the u s  government to where it could cause a global financial crisis  this would be one of the ways to do it impose a vat tax on businesses despite cruz denying strongly that he is not in favor of a vat tax  his business tax proposal is exactly that  the tax policy center calls it that  so that s what we are calling it as well and the fact he is afraid to call it what it is shows the absurdity of his plan  a vat tax will likely reduce wages because employers will no longer be able to deduct the cost of wages from their taxes  this will force employers to pay even less than they are currently  a good way to crush an economy is to hurt the buying power of the consumer base and this would be one of the most efficient ways to do it virtually nothing in this plan seems to be realistically paid for another very standard feature of cruz s plan is that it would explode our federal deficit and debt by amazing levels  estimates put it at over   trillion in  decades    in the first decade   in the second   republicans can t stop complaining about how president obama has exploded our debt since he had to have the bush years  numbers on his books  however  he hasn t even come close to the costs cruz would impose on the nation  it would make us unable to afford functional government most tax savings would go to the top   percent of filers  top money looters  i refuse to call them  earners   would get a post tax income boost of   million   approximately a  percent increase  middle income people would get an average of about      coming in at around a   percent increase  and lowest income filers would get an average of   percent of their income  or around    to put it more simply  if you are ultra wealthy  you could buy several extra middle class homes per year just to pass the time  if you are poor you could buy about  percent of one mcdonald s cheeseburger per week  per year with your savings there s no other word to describe this besides insane  because it s the same thing from every republican candidate every year  with them expecting different results every time  democrats must vote in large numbers in november  we literally can t afford not to featured image from flickr
