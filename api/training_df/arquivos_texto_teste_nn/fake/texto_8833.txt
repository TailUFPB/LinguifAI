if the current national republican presidential front runner donald trump wins the iowa caucuses  he may have to send a thank you card to a group of white supremacists a super pac set up by white nationalists  thanks to the conservative majority on the supreme court for that  by the way  is now doing robocalls on behalf of the trump campaign to iowa voters https   www facebook com david dwyer  videos   i urge you to vote for donald trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for america   jared taylor said on the robocall  paid for by the american national super pac   we don t need muslims  we need smart  well educated white people who will assimilate to our culture  vote trump  taylor is the founder of the white supremacist magazine american renaissance  the robocall included two more endorsements from a conservative christian talk show host and the head of the white nationalist american freedom party since he launched his presidential campaign by blaming mexicans for rape and murder and encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters for the black lives matter movement  trump has attracted growing support from the white nationalist movement  they view his candidacy with its explicit appeal to white power enthusiasts as the first such outwardly racially bigoted campaign within the two major parties in u s  history trump has also  of course  signaled that a presidency underneath his control would operate in a fascistic manner  banning travel to the united states by muslims and also creating a national database of muslims similar to the types of records created by hitler s nazi regime in germany despite the outward support for trump with figures like former klansman david duke and those otherwise aligned with the movement in favor of white supremacy  the mainstream media has largely shied away from labeling trump supporters as bigots  instead multiple mainstream articles and news reports insist that trump s base of support comes from those concerned about  economic inequality   of course  senator bernie sanders has made the fight to rectify that inequality as the centerpiece of his campaign  explicitly rejecting the racial and religious hatred embraced by trump and so far not condemned by the party itself featured image via flickr
