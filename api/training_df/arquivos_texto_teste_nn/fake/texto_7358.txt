if ever there was a reminder that sen  ted cruz is not the republican party s reasonable  alternative to donald trump  it s in his response to the brussels terror attacks  losing badly to trump  cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes   so he s gone all in on xenophobia  totalitarianism  and religious persecution  a hate cocktail sure to fire up his base in a statement he released on facebook  cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where america s muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them  if that sounds a little to  nazi esque  for you  cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too  politically correct  to agree with him here s cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency we need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al qaida or isis presence we need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized we need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration and we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy isis in other words  cruz is plagiarizing trump s  ban all muslims  position  but adding that the muslims already in the country should be  secured  in specific neighborhoods  before they become radicalized   he doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this  nor does he mention how he could legally target muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day being  lying ted  cruz  he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about president obama as well  using the president s historic trip to cuba as a strawman  cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while brussels was attacked  adding that obama never visited paris after the terror attacks there  it was an egregious lie  so shameless that a simple picture could debunk it   paying respect   president obama   french president hollande lay flowers at bataclan concert hall in paris  pic twitter com   catherine field   catherinefield  november    to say  muslim activist groups  who have watched in horror as hate crimes directed at muslim americans has steadily grown thanks to people like cruz  were not amused by this latest call to trounce the constitution based on hate and fear  it s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith   cair spokesman ibrahim hooper said by phone   in normal times  this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher  much less president of the united states  we call on voters to reject this undoubtedly  terrorism is a serious problem  but the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the republicans seem to want to believe  totalitarianism doesn t work   and never has  discriminating against innocent muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the middle east is not only doomed to fail  but could backfire in ways that cruz and trump can t fathom from their  build a wall  childish ideology between ted cruz and donald trump  it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is  both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them  at this point in the race  the two republican frontrunners aren t just mirroring each other s disgusting policies  but actually driving one another to make them more abhorrent  a nuclear arms race of bigotry in a crucial moment in america s history featured image via screenshot
