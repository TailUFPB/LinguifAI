starting an entire year ago in january of    long before the flint water crisis broke into mainstream public awareness   the michigan department of technology  management   budget determined that state employees needed an alternate source of clean drinking water  they began stocking water coolers on each floor of their offices for employee use flint residents were sent a notice that the level of trihalomethanes  which can cause liver and kidney problems  were exceeding federal limits   yet the city insisted the water was still fine and no actions needed to be taken to correct it  the notice followed two separate boil advisories in august and september of   despite assuring the citizens of the city that the water was safe  officials at the capitol gave state employees clean water to drink from coolers  instead of municipal sources like fountains and faucetsaccording to documentation  the coolers were to remain for employees to use  as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements  via progress michiganthe residents of flint  as you know by now  did not deserve such consideration  it took nearly an entire year for them to start being taken seriously by the state government  this came only after the story finally broke loose in the national media in a huge and embarrassing spectacle for state republicans  if the media had not forced state republicans  hands on this issue  people would still be drinking poison today  water only started being distributed in january of  in any kind of substantial way in the city  by the national guard even the excuse of  saving money  which was given by the governor has been called into doubt  recent emails which were released by governor rick snyder under intense pressure by the media show that if flint had simply stayed with detroit water the city would have saved as much  if not more money  anyway featured image via pixabay
