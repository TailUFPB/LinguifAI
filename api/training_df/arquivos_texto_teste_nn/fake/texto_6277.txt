chris christie s strange loyalty to presumptive republican nominee donald trump has been questioned since the day he pledged his unwavering support to the business mogul  however  every time trump insults or embarrasses the new jersey governor  christie loses even more of the public s respect  this most recent incident further proves that not even trump has an ounce of respect for christie  and is really just using him as a prop to make his campaign events more entertaining for his audience previously  trump has humiliated christie by basically holding him hostage on stage after the nj governor endorsed him  and dismissing him like an unwanted child during a tennessee rally by telling him to  get on that plane and go home   this latest incident just adds even more insult to injury  at a campaign event specifically aimed to help christie get out of his    debt from his failed campaign   which is embarrassing enough to admit   trump decided to make matters worse by teasing christie about something he s always been sensitive about   his weight trump had gone on a rant about nabisco moving factories to mexico  and mentioned that he was done eating oreos  desperately searching for a punchline  trump looked at christie  pointed his little index finger at him and said  neither is chris  you re not eating oreos anymore  the crowd erupted into awkward laughter and trump tried to  soften the blow  by repeating the joke and bringing himself into the equation  no more oreos  for either of us  chris  don t feel bad  for either of us  you can watch this embarrassing moment unfold moment below to make matters even worse  trump also announced   so you know chris paid off his entire campaign debt tonight  at the rally  clearly rubbing salt in the wound he continually keeps opening  if christie had any self respect after the massive failure of his own presidential campaign  you can be sure that it ll be demolished by the time trump s campaign is over featured image via spencer platt   getty images
