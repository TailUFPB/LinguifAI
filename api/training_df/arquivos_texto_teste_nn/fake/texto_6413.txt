on thursday  while republican leadership was meeting with donald trump  senate minority leader harry reid unleashed on the gop for pandering to their atrocious nominee  the first thing reid did when he spoke was to make sure that every american who watched his speech knows that the right wing is  marching lock step with donald trump  and their policies are perfectly aligned  so  mcconnell has fully embraced donald trump  as he said last week when trump secured the republican nomination  i quote  i have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by republican voters   closed quote  while speaking with reporters earlier this week the republican leader sounded enthusiastic about trump s chances in the general election  i guess he should be giddy about a trump presidency  donald trump is everything that the republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination  that is absolutely   percent spot on  we have been saying the same thing since the beginning  the republican base is filled with racist  misogynistic  islamaphobic xenophobes who hate everyone who isn t a straight  white  christian male  after explaining how much the gop loves trump  he hit them about their supreme court obstruction  then senator reid pointed out how much the gop hates women  let s talk about trump and women  when they get together  they can talk about their policies about being anti woman  since sen  mcconnell has so enthusiastically embraced trump  we can only assume he agrees with trump s view that women are dogs and pigs  we can only assume that the republican leader is not repulsed by donald trump s vulgar behavior towards women  look at his new york times story yesterday on his cavorting with howard stern and how they talked about women  after all  the republican party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for american women  equal pay for equal work  the senator has tried to undermine women s health at every turn  trying to turn planned parenthood into a punching bag  even though millions and millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood  the minority leader went on to say that mcconnell must also agree with trump s views on immigrants  after all  the gop has been saying the same thing about them for years  he hit republicans for claiming they care about immigration control  but came within hours of shutting down the department of homeland security  the senator said that he  can only assume  that mitch mcconnell and the leadership are okay with trump s  shady business practices  and  ripping off  hardworking americans reid slammed the gop for trump s bankruptcies  their climate change bullshit  their horrible fiscal policies  trump wanting to default on america s debt and a number of other things  he spent more than eight minutes ripping republican leadership and it was amazing  it was also terrifying  if donald trump is elected in november  this country is screwed  our children will be left with a mess of epic proportions and our older kids will probably be sent to war  there is literally nothing good that could come with putting a member of the gop in the white house  so  remember to vote blue  no matter who watch reid rip the gop apart featured image via video screenshot
