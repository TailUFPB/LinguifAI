because the rabidly insane american right wing is no stranger to hyperbole and nonsense comparisons  fr  frank pavone  an anti choice fanatic  has compared cecile richards  the president of planned parenthood to terrorists  mobsters and drug lords  why  because she was invited to speak at georgetown university by some of the students and letting planned parenthood speak is just plain crazy while on an am hate radio show  pavone let loose with this gem he said he didn t buy the argument that inviting someone like richards to speak was allowing  inquiry into all different positions  i mean  do we inquire  do we try to understand terrorism by inviting representatives of isis to come and speak   he asked   or let s get some of the biggest drug dealers in the country to come and talk about their business because  after all  we have to understand both sides of the issue of drug abuse  why don t we invite the biggest mobsters to come in because we have to understand both sides of the debate about organized crime  are they doing that  maybe i m missing it  but do these universities invite these kinds of people too  what pavone is actually saying is that the only side we should be listening to is the one that says a fertilized egg is a person and that baby jesus cries whenever a hell bound baby killer abortion doctor performs an abortion  also  that abortion is the moral equivalent of terrorism  that would be a perfectly reasonable argument to make except for the fact that it s pure bullshit the burning desire for conservative christians to impose their religious doctrine on the entire country is never more clear than in the abortion  debate   i say  debate  because there really isn t one  the  pro life  movement is all about control and  for the most part  completely unconcerned with what happens to the  precious life  they re willing to murder to defend  the pro choice movement  on the other hand  is perfectly fine with common sense restrictions placed on late term abortions  a fact that theocratic monsters refuse to acknowledge normally  what pavone said would be just the ravings of a madman  but these are not normal times  the right has whipped up such a storm of hate and rage against planned parenthood that violence is both inevitable and ongoing  this kind of rhetoric only increases the chances that someone will declare themselves a  soldier of god  and lash out  shootings  arson  death threats and all other manner of terrorism have been a common occurance in a country that s supposedly at  war  with terrorism  but i guess as long as the terrorism is white and christian  it s acceptable  murika featured image via getty
