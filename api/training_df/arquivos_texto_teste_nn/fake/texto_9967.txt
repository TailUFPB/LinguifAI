wfb  north korea for the first time this week revealed plans for using its nuclear arms for space based electronics disrupting emp attacks  in addition to direct warhead ground blasts the official communist party newspaper  rodong sinmun  published a report monday on  the emp might of nuclear weapons   outlining an electromagnetic pulse  emp  attack produced by detonating a nuclear warhead in space  in general  the strong electromagnetic pulse generated from nuclear bomb explosions between  kilometers and  kilometers  above the ground can severely impair electronic devices  electric machines  and electromagnetic grids  or destroy electric cables and safety devices   said the article authored by kim songwon  dean of kim chaek university of technology in pyongyang  the discovery of the electromagnetic pulse as a source of high yield in the high altitude nuclear explosion test process has given it recognition as an important strike method   he stated the official discussion by north korea of plans to conduct emp strikes will likely fuel debate over the threat  former cia director james woolsey has said north korea is capable of orbiting an emp nuclear weapon in a satellite some liberal arms control advocates have dismissed the emp threat from pyongyang as far fetched  such as arms control advocate jeffrey lewis  who in april dismissed the threat of an emp attack by laughing at a reporter s question   this is the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people   he told npr disclosure of north korea s intention to use its nuclear force for emp attacks comes as u s  intelligence agencies are continuing to analyze the latest underground nuclear test by north korea on sept   that the regime said was its first hydrogen bomb explosion senior administration officials said initial assessments of the nuclear blast in northeastern north korea indicate it was the largest test detonation so far  and much larger than an underground test carried out last year  it was the regime s sixth nuclear test u s  nuclear technicians have not made a definitive conclusion about the specifics of the device  specialists are trying to determine if the test involved a hydrogen bomb  as pyongyang asserted  or a device designed for emp attack  they are also assessing whether the test used boosted fission technology hydrogen bombs are advanced devices that use a two stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion  boosted fission devices are less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel  we re highly confident this was a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve seen so far is not inconsistent with north korea s claims   a u s  intelligence official said however  a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast is not expected for several days  data from the test is being analyzed by nuclear weapons experts at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico also  the large explosion perhaps more than  kilotons  or the equivalent of  tons of tn likely produced significant venting of radioactive particles into the air special u s  intelligence aircraft  including the wc  nuclear  sniffer  jets  are conducting flights near the test zone to gather samples of particles from the test experts are saying an emp attack by n korea is a very real and dark possibilityaccording to the business insider  some experts believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time is an emp attack  to make that happen  all north korea has to do is launch a low yield nuclear missile from a submarine  ship  or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude  above the atmosphere the potential result  a blackout of the eastern grid that supplies   of power to the united states if an emp attack did take place  it would be beyond anything we have seen before  the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack  which was established by congress in   estimates that within  months following a nationwide blackout   up to   of the us population could perish from starvation  disease  and societal breakdown  electronic armageddonin practical terms  a catastrophic blackout would be worst in cities  because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water  refrigeration  heat  air conditioning  and telecommunication  food stores would be looted within a matter of days  and gas stations would cease to function without electricity without internet access and power  all commerce and advanced methods of communication would stop  there would be no tv  radio  phones  credit card transactions and cash withdrawals at banks would be impossible  paper money would become worthless  and bitcoin would cease to exist  along with the stock market newt gingrich  speaking at the senate committee on energy and natural resources earlier this month  said an emp attack  would send us back to the  century  but that s not the only problem  if no outside help arrives  within days  chaos begins to reign  civilization is a rather thin veneer that humans have acquired over centuries  a mask covering our hard wired survival instincts  once the mask slips  it could mean the end of the world as we know it we are ill prepared for an emp attackus politicians and major utilities have kicked the can down the road when it comes to emp preparation  edison electric estimates that shielding transformers for the us grid system could cost   billion granted  american power companies have been studying ways to protect our electronic grids against attack  but tangible results are slow in coming the only current option after an emp attack would be to replace damaged or destroyed transformers  however  says scott aaronson  managing director for cyber and infrastructure security at edison electric  replacements for those transformers must be procured from foreign suppliers  which could take up to  months peter vincent pry  leader of the task force on national and homeland security  believes north korea is closer to launching an emp attack than many analysts believe  he wants congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat in pry s opinion  an emp attack would ultimately kill more americans than a direct nuclear blast could  his book  the long sunday  describes several plausible emp attack scenarios pry thinks that  the first nation to use nuclear weapons today even a rogue state like north korea or iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world  a formidable force to be reckoned with  and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order  is there a sensible way to prepare for an emp attack maybe not  but stocking some food  water  fuel  and batteries for emergencies is always a good idea as well as owning a stash of gold coins as hard assets while  you can t eat gold   as some preppers say  it is the only kind of money that has prevailed over the millennia  kim  the north korean technical university dean  stated that high altitude explosions can be conducted in the stratosphere or in space where the blast wave is limited by the lack of air or the thinness of air  in explosions occurring at such altitudes  large amounts of electrons are released as a result of ionization reactions of high energy instant gamma rays and other radioactive rays   he said   these electrons form a strong electromagnetic pulse  emp  through interaction with the geomagnetic field  the detonation would create a strong electric field of   volts per meter when it approaches the ground and  that is how it destroys communications facilities and electricity grids   the report said the emp report was published monday  a day after the same state run outlet reported on a visit by north korean leader kim jong un to a nuclear weapons facility that also mentioned plans for using nuclear weapons in emp attacks  our hydrogen bomb whose power as a nuclear bomb can be adjusted at will from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons according to the targets of strike is a multifunctional thermonuclear warhead which not only has enormous lethality and destructibility  but also can even carry out super powerful emp attack over an expansive area through detonation at high altitudes according to strategic goals   the report said
