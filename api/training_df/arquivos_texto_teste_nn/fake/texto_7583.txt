while most republicans spend their time taking verbal jabs at  mainstream  reporters  read  not fox news pundits  who dare to ask them tough questions  donald trump s campaign has taken to physically assaulting them  and it s getting worse by the day in a glimpse of what trump s presidency may look like should he win  his entourage refused to take responsibility for violently shoving a female reporter at a campaign rally because they thought she was part of the liberal media  they did  however  express remorse after learning she was from conservative website breitbart  apparently  violence against reporters is okay  but only if they aren t well known trump cheerleaders reporters identified trump s campaign manager corey lewandowski after he grabbed breitbart journalist michelle fields  arm and tried to throw her to the ground  according to her boyfriend and colleague jamie weinstein from the daily caller  trump s  thugs  retaliated after fields tried to ask trump a  tough question  trump always surrounds himself w thugs  tonight thug corey lewandowski tried to pull my gf  michellefields to ground when she asked tough q  jamie weinstein   jamieweinstein  march    of apologizing  or better yet  resigning  lewandowski excused his actions by saying he simply used violence against the wrong person lewandowski s explanation to boyle  said these sources  was that he and fields had never met before and that he didn t recognize her as a breitbart reporter  instead mistaking her for an adversarial member of the mainstream media the admission confirms what many on lookers have known for quite some time  it s open season on people who speak out against trump or his campaign  recently  trump s secret service detail  nicknamed by appalled critics as  trump s ss   choke slammed a time magazine photographer when he stepped outside of the  pen  trump keeps journalists in at his rally   yes  he really does this   trump has also made comments about opening up libel laws to go destroy journalists who write things that are negative about him adding some bitter irony to all of this is the fact that breitbart has been a shameless promoter of trump since the word  go   at times there homepage is devoted solely to singing trump s praises  so the question became  how would they respond to this flagrant act of violence towards one of their journalists   the answer was  throw fields under the bus rather than stand up for one of their employees  the staff at breitbart have at various times called into question the veracity of her claims  breitbart writers went full false flag on their own reporter  here s fields  colleague explicitly calling her a liar on twitter indeed  breitbart s ceo hinted that fields was not telling the truth about their beloved candidate as well  saying only that  if  someone did grab her  then they should apologize  so much for standing up for your employees  huh   update  after wide spread condemnation from journalists standing in solidarity with fields  breitbart reportedly suspended patrick howley  breitbart readers  naturally  weren t much more sympathetic  after fields penned a  very careful  essay on what happened to her  this sexist screed became the number one comment breitbart has made a name for itself for its use of bullying and mudslinging as a business model  they frequently post stories targeting non public figures and use their frenzied hate mob readers as a personal army to attack liberals or critics  fields certainly doesn t deserve the violence she experienced from trump s staff  nor the ugly backlash she s getting from her own readers  but it s not surprising  she works for a company that routinely attacks female journalists  anti trump conservatives  and liberals of all stripes  her audience is primed for this sort of hate filled dog piling  the fact that breitbart can t even stand up for one of their own speaks volumes featured image via gage skidmore flickr
