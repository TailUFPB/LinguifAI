after the passing of conservative supreme court justice antonin scalia  republicans have been refusing to even welcome any possibility of a replacement  they don t seem to care that president obama is bound by the constitution to nominate someone  and considering obama istill is  and will be the president for almost another whole year  republicans are also bound by the constitution to consider the nominee throwing this very obvious fact back in their republican faces is none other than senator elizabeth warren from the great state of massachusetts  she said it is  shocking  that they are unwilling to entertain the idea of a new justice clearly caving to those on the extreme right  however  also noting that this refusal to do their job  is not new  warren stated in a scathing rebuke of their incompetence  the message from senate republicans is crystal clear  forget the constitution  their response to one of the most solemn and consequential tasks that our government performs  the confirmation of a supreme court justice  will be to pretend that that nominee and president obama himself simply do not exist  cannot see them  cannot hear them  then pointing out how it has been the goal of republicans to block pretty much everything president obama has want to accomplish since his first day in office  warren says  since the first day of the obama presidency  republican senators have bowed to extremists who reject his legitimacy and abuse the rules of the senate in an all out effort to cripple his administration and to paralyze the federal courts  warren slams them for going against the oath they swore to uphold the constitution of the united states  she goes on to say  republican extremists aren t voting against individuals based on a good faith judgment about a specific person  no  they are blocking votes wholesale in order to keep those jobs vacant and undermine the government itself  driving the point home  she says no matter how much it damages the nation  no matter how much it undermines the courts  no matter whether it cripples the government or lays waste to our constitution  senate republicans do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging the legitimacy of our democratically elected president for too long  the republicans in the senate have wanted to have it both ways  they want to feed the ugly lies and nullify the obama presidency while also claiming that they can govern responsibly candidates motivated by bigotry and resentment  candidates unable to govern  candidates reflecting the same extremism that has been nursed along for seven years right here in the united states senate  are on the verge of winning the republican party s nomination for president if it is true that some republican senators are finally ready to stand up to the extremism that denies the legitimacy of this president and of the constitution  i say to you  do your job vote for a supreme court nominee  warren also made sure all those unconstitutional republicans sitting in front of her new that president obama was elected in  and  by an overwhelming democratically elected majority  and by nominating someone for the supreme court  he is fulfilling the will of the people however  here s the nail in the coffin  if you want to stop extremism in your party  you can start by showing the american people that you respect the president of the united states and the constitution enough to do your job  bravo  senator warren  bravo    featured image via video screen capture
