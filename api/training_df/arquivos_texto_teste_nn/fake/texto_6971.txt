everything he does is definitely not for hateful republicans  as rock singer bryan adams just cancelled an upcoming concert in mississippi rather than perform in a state where discrimination is legal mississippi republicans passed a bigoted law earlier this month giving business owners and religious organizations the ability to fire employees and refuse service to customers who don t meet their extreme religious standards so if you are gay or have pre marital sex or are involved in an interracial relationship  businesses can discriminate against you and hide behind their bibles to do so because of the law they passed  mississippi republicans may have cost their state billions of federal dollars  which they desperately need considering mississippi is the top state in the nation when it comes to getting more money from the government than it pays in taxes corporations have also condemned the law and are threatening to no longer do business with or in the state as long as the law remains on the books  and now concerts are being cancelled just as bruce springsteen cancelled a concert in north carolina over a similar law passed by republicans there  bryan adams has cancelled his concert in mississippi for the same reasons  mississippi has passed anti lgbt  religious liberty  bill    adams wrote in a statement on his website  i find it incomprehensible that lgbt citizens are being discriminated against in the state of mississippi  i cannot in good conscience perform in a state where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation  therefore i m cancelling my  april show at the mississippi coast coliseum  using my voice i stand in solidarity with all my lgbt friends to repeal this extremely discriminatory bill  hopefully mississippi will right itself and i can come back and perform for all of my many fans  i look forward to that day  if any bryan adams fans are angry about the singer s stand against discrimination and bigotry  they only have mississippi republicans to blame for legalizing hate in their hate in the first place featured image via wikimedia
