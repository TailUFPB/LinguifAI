rasmussen polling wrote a commentary last year outlining ten factors that will determine who the next president will be  among those was  of course  the candidates themselves and their rung mates  the state of the economy  the ongoing culture wars  and how vigorously the candidates fight in swing states  but one factor  which seems to have an influential and historical trend in elections  is the current president s approval rating  as rasmussen found postwar history suggests that when a president has weak approval  his party pays a price in the next election  harry truman     lyndon johnson     gerald ford     jimmy carter     george h w  bush     and george w  bush    all had mediocre to poor approval ratings  and the opposing party won all of those elections  defeating incumbents ford  carter  and h w  bush  and winning open seat races in the others  when president obama was elected in november   george w  bush s approval rating was a dismal  percent  in july   when george h w bush was campaigning against bill clinton  his approval rating fell to a record low  percent well if this is a precedential factor that helps determine who the president will be  democrats should be breathing a sigh of relief a new nbc news wall street journal poll shows president obama s approval rating is  percent  while his disapproval rating is  percent  the last time president obama had the majority of approval from the country  in this poll   was during his second inauguration in january  the numbers  nbc shows  could be beneficial to hillary clinton the president s relative political strength could be a significant boon for hillary clinton  whose  candidacy is largely focused on preserving key aspects of his democratic policy making the poll shows that clinton  despite her own high negative ratings as an individual candidate  could enjoy some other structural advantages as well in the  contestastoundingly   percent of independents  remember  president obama lost independents in   approve of the job he s doing that s good news for democrats  who are relying on a large turnout of independent voters to counter donald trump s right wing populism similarly  gallup polling shows the president s approval rating stands at  percent  up two points from the previous week  the last time president obama had an approval rating of  percent  according to their polling   was in february  this is good news for democrats  clinton  who is well on the way of becoming the nominee  has made continuing the obama legacy a staple in her campaign  that resounds well with democrats and apparently should with independents featured image via drew angerer getty images
