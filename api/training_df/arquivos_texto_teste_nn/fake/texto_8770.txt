we ve never passed racist laws in this country  says the woman who is the governor of a former slave state where jim crow laws flourished and the confederate flag flew until july  it s most definitely the most ridiculous thing nikki haley has ever said  and it comes just a day after she delivered the republican response to the state of the union address only six months have gone by since haley called for removing the confederate flag off statehouse grounds after a racist gunman murdered nine african american parishioners at a black church in charleston the flag has been a symbol of white supremacy and slavery since the civil war and actually flew on the statehouse itself after a law was passed mandating it  that s why it took a vote of the south carolina house and senate to remove it for good so  it s pretty damn mind boggling to hear haley claim that we ve never passed racist laws in this country according to talking points memo  haley responded to criticism of her speech by donald trump  who called her weak on immigration  and let s just say it didn t go well  when you ve got immigrants who are coming here legally  we ve never in the history of this country passed any laws or done anything based on race or religion  let s not start that now  we ve gone too far than to go back into a race and religion issue  i ve been through those fights  that s not worth it  yes  she really claimed that there have never been racist laws in the history of this nation  even though haley lives and works in a state that seceded from the union because they feared their pro slavery laws would be abolished by president lincoln as gawker points out  south carolina also had many jim crow laws on the books  including making it  illegal for  any white man to intermarry with any woman of either the indian or negro races  until    and banning restaurants from serving  white and colored passengers in the same room  or at the same table  or at the same counter  until  racism is even present in our own constitution as the founding fathers made it the law that african americans could only count as three fifths of a person when determining the number of congressional seats each state has every ten years in addition  there s the indian removal act of   the fugitive slave act of   the chinese exclusion act of   literacy tests for voting  operation  wetback  of   and the internment of japanese americans during world war ii  just to name a few  to see more  click here either nikki haley doesn t know the history of america and our legal system  or she is whitewashing it  conservatives must be proud featured image  flickr and flickr
