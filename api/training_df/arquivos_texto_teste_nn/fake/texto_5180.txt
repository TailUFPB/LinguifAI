the clusterfuck that is donald trump s campaign is manifesting itself in the polls  as hillary first opens up a ten point lead nationally  and now  gains huge leads in three major battleground states  new hampshire  pennsylvania and michigan have all pivoted solidly toward hillary  at least for now  when she and trump were virtually deadlocked before the trump train went off the tracks perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of these polls is that western michigan  which tends to be very republican  has turned blue because of trump s downward spiral  hillary now has a nine point lead in that state  along with an  point lead in pennsylvania and a whopping  point lead in new hampshire past polls showed hillary within just a few points of trump in all three states  setting the stage for a major showdown in the battlegrounds  normally  that would likely continue   there s a reason these states are battlegrounds the trump train is anything but a normal campaign  though  richard czuba  president of the glengariff group  inc   says  he s sitting in the cellar right now  and they re going to have to do something to dramatically turn this around if i were a republican running on this ticket right now  i d be beyond nervous  some of them are  there are republicans running for re election to congress who have said that they can t support him  a republican strategist actually said that not endorsing trump is a badge of honor  instead of the horrible betrayal and kiss of death it would ordinarily be  billionaire meg whitman  who votes for republicans in presidential elections  has formally endorsed hillary clinton perhaps even more damning for trump are conflicting reports about the state of his campaign  his campaign manager  paul manafort  and his spokespeople say that everything is fine  one of his spokespeople even said that trump s success is evident in the crowds he draws  the ratings he garners  and his fundraising  all of that implies that he thinks the polls are badly biased  isn t everything biased in trumpland   but an ally to manafort said that even manafort is ready to give up  and staff morale is virtually nil  that conflict further damages trump as he struggles to convince america that he hasn t completely lost it speaking to that  gop strategist greg mcneilly says  i know that there s a lot of numbers that matter in politics  but twitter followers still don t trump poll numbers  he said that trump should stick to his  make america great again  messaging  trump doesn t know how  though  because he s donald trump and donald trump knows best  including when it comes to vanquishing his enemies  real and imagined  john harwood  of cnbc  confirmed that when he said that trump s campaign is unique because candidates don t usually have a stranglehold on their campaign s daily messaging  trump  as a thin skinned control freak  does and that s how trump likes it  so the gop better get used to it  they nominated this train wreck  they get to handle the fallout right up until we go to the polls in november featured image by joe raedle getty images
