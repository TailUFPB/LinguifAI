elizabeth warren is one of the most popular liberals in the country  she brought us the consumer financial protection bureau  has savagely attacked wall street at every opportunity  and her name is floated for vp more than anyone else by liberals desperate to see her in the oval office but now she is an enemy of the revolution because she didn t endorse bernie sanders which  according to the true believers  cost sanders the hotly contested massachusetts primary  to forestall the usual whining  bernie true believers  are not every bernie supporter  most of them are normal  rational people that want bernie but will vote blue no matter who wins because a republican president is unthinkable right now  on the other hand  true believers are all about purity and would happily watch the country burn so they can sit on their high horse  sneering at the millions of people that dared to not back their perfect candidate  that their high horse would be burning along with everyone else never seems to occur to them  but at least their soul is unsullied so who cares  got it   notallberniesupporters  now get over it and move on after pleas from bernie supporters for warren to endorse sanders went unanswered  angry true believers swarmed her facebook pages to denounce her dennis flannigan  i m losing all respect for you you re showing yourself to be just another wave riding professional politician that means you re part of the problem endorse bernie now or go away joanne tyler  i am done with you  u s  senator elizabeth warren  bernie was our best chance to change things  and you turned your back on him  i  for one  won t forget  if you really cared about the values you espouse  you d have endorsed bernie long ago  go to hell ricky cox  i am taking my like back from this page  it s easy to talk tough on wanting to fix the problems in this country but when it was time to back the guy trying to do it you stayed quiet before your home state s primary  pathetic  from now on when you give your little talks about fixing the broken system we will all know it is for show john michael sandernista  i m done with u s  senator elizabeth warren for not endorsing bernie  none of her rhetoric means anything if she won t stand up to clinton and the dnc  done  unfollow here s a good one that shows just how unhinged the true believers are drew phillips  so it turns out you re just like all the other politicians bought off by wall street  you could ve endorsed bernie before today and made an actual difference in this election but you were too scared  all that tough talk is nothing without action  taking my money and endorsements elsewhere elizabeth warren is possibly the most hated person on wall street  so of course she s been bought off by the banksters because she didn t endorse sanders  makes perfect sense every time i post about the true believers and how very much like the tea party sounded as they were getting started  i get chastised for cherry picking just a few random malcontents  but guess what  there are literally hundreds upon hundreds of these posts and stop by any pro bernie group and you ll find an unending stream of the same vitriol  it s even worse on the pro bernie pages because there s so little push back inside their little bubble  if they were such a tiny minority  they would be shouted down  buuuuuuuuut they re not the worst part about all of this is that bernie himself has made it absolutely clear that he d vote for clinton in a heartbeat before allowing any republican in the white house  but that s the problem with true believers  they stop hearing what the object of their devotion says and instead chase the idealized fantasy while constantly looking for heretics to burn a the stake  featured image via video screen capture
