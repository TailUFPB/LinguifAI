for a time  it seemed that house speaker paul ryan was no fan of the now presumptive gop  presidential nominee donald trump  after all  ryan has largely kept his opinions on the gop primary to himself  but some of trump s statements and actions were outrageous enough for ryan to speak out  when trump refused to out and out disavow an endorsement from infamous ku klux klan leader david duke  ryan spoke up and condemned the idea that the republican party could have a presidential nominee who flirted with the endorsements of white supremacist groups  the same thing happened when trump came out and said that he wanted to ban all muslims from entering the united states one would think that these positions would mean that ryan could not support trump s nomination  in fact  he recently said that he was  not ready  to go all in for trump  all of that changed on thursday morning  though  when ryan held a closed meeting with donald trump  afterwards  ryan made a statement to the media that seemed designed to walk back his earlier condemnations of the the donald  he s talking about  party unity   and says that he is  very encouraged  by trump s remarks in their meeting  ryan would not  however  speak on specifics of what he talked about with trump  instead  ryan and trump gave the media a joint statement that said that they want gop leaders to   unite around our shared principles  advance a conservative agenda and do all we can to win this fall   the statement went on to say  with that focus  we had a great conversation this morning  while we were honest about our few differences  we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground  we will be having additional discussions  but remain confident there s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall  and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal  while speaking to the press after the meeting  ryan said  this was our first meeting  but it was a very positive step toward unification  it s very important that we don t fake unifying  we don t pretend unification  that we truly and actually unify so we are full strength in the fall  i don t want us to have a fake unification process here  while ryan didn t flat out endorse trump  it seems that he is preparing to do just that in the not too distant future  while just a short while ago  we saw him show a bit of common sense and call trump out for his bigoted rhetoric  but  once a republican  always a republican  no scruples whatsoever  so nobody should be surprised at this at all  it seems that speaker ryan is just another  party first  gop shill who doesn t give a damn how absolutely dangerous a donald trump presidency would be for this nation and he is clearly preparing to stand behind this narcissistic blowhard as he aims to become america s next dictator president featured image via gage skidmore flickr
