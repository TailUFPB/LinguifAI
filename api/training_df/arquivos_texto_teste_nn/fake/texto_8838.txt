donald trump has helped america s racists feel good about showing their true colors in all their bigoted glory  furthermore  amazingly  the more racist trump s remarks get  the higher he goes in the polls  things that would be political suicide for almost anyone else seem to work wonders for trump s numbers  well  there is yet another person who is calling trump out  former adviser to president obama  van jones what has jones so upset is most ominous indeed  it seems that a  think tank  of white power types that go by the name american renaissance is so impressed with trump s racism that they are now making robocalls on behalf of his bid for the presidency  the calls focus specifically on trump s  ban all muslims  plan  the horrible message says  we don t need muslims  we need smart well educated white people who can assimilate to our culture  van jones appeared on face the nation on sunday  and he blasted the dangerous  bigoted rhetoric that has made trump so popular with racists  this is troubling  if i were  trump  this is a time to look in the mirror  who am i inspiring  who am i attracting  why will horrible racist groups say i m the only candidate that speaks for them  this is what is   my deep concern is that donald trump is beginning to legitimate some of the dark things that have been in our country for a long time  and now starting to let them elevate  let them rise  jones is right  of course  but  unfortunately  trump doesn t care  all he cares about is numbers  and if it takes being bald faced racist to get them  then  by god  that s what he ll do  the gop s base is full of ignorant bigots  and donald trump has done a perfect job of courting them  help us all if he actually gets anywhere near the oval office watch the interview with van jones below featured image via video screen capture from raw story
