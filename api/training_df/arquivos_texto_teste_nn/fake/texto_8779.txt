jacksonville  florida police are investigating a man after he stood in front of the city council and told them he spent most of his life molesting children and getting away with it the comments came during a tuesday night debate over jacksonville s human rights ordinance  which would further protect the lgbt community in the city  roy bay    stood up during the public comment part of the council meeting and said  i lived most of my life sexually assaulting kids and never went to jail  because why  kids believed me that hey this is  you re alright son  this is not a problem  okay  this happens in homosexual lifestyle  bay claims that the reason he started molesting children was because he was  sexually assaulted by the homosexual community  from the age of ten to twelve the whole homosexual community  really  wow he said that he  entered into the life of homosexuality  afterwards and that is when he started molesting kids  he then claimed that in  he became a  born again child of god  and  god set him free  from his lifestyle of raping innocent children  when he mentioned  god  some members of the crowd began to clap and say  amen   reports that the sheriff s department was informed of bay s criminal confession and they said that there will be an investigation into his alleged crimes  there is no statute of limitations for child molestation in the state of florida if the victims are under the age of twelve  so  it is entirely possible that his lgbt bashing confession might land him in prison bay s assertions that the gay community is filled with predators like himself is completely unfounded  uc davis published a  study by dr  a  nicholas groth that found that children are not in greater danger of being molested by homosexuals than heterosexuals are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults  there is no reason to believe so  the research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation  there appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults  and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual this is because  contrary to what bay says  rape is never about sexuality  it is about power  the desire to have complete control over somebody is what fuels rapists and if bay is the predator he claims to be  that is likely the reason he was raping children  the crowd members who shouted  amen  and clapped are probably the same imbeciles who support known child molester josh duggar  people like duggar and bay hide behind their bible and commit atrocious crimes all while pushing disgusting stereotypes about the lgbt community to hide their own crimes hopefully  the police will find some evidence about this guy s crimes and put him in prison where he belongs watch featured image via video screenshot
