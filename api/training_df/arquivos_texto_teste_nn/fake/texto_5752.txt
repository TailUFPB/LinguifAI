in a twist of fate  donald trump happened to be in scotland on the day the world woke up to learn that in a xenophobic ferver the united kingdom had voted to disembowel itself by leaving the european union  within minutes of votes being counted  global financial markets were sent into complete and total disarray  the pound sterling dropped to its lowest value in a century  the uk s prime minister david cameron announced he would be resigning  countries around the world stopped accepting british monetary exchanges because the markets were too unstable what did donald trump  who hopes to someday soon lead the united states  have to say about this unfolding disaster  he was stoked  he reasoned that his turnberry golf resort was going to make a killing  i think it s a great thing that happened   trump told reporters shortly after his helicopter landed at trump turnberry   people are angry  all over the world  people  they re angry  when the pound goes down  more people are coming to turnberry  frankly   trump added during an afternoon news conference   for traveling and for other things  i think it very well could turn out to be a positive  to be clear  the pound didn t just go  down    it collapsed chart via the washington posttrump was not in scotland for the so called  brexit  vote  he was there to oversee the opening of a new hotel and golf course  having unofficially suspended his campaign for the weekend to worry about his golf course profits  trump was notably over the moon about the uk s self induced financial collapse  but trump also seemed irritated that what might be one of the most consequential votes in modern history was ruining his publicity stunt  when reporters pressed him about his feelings towards brexit  trump started ignoring the questions entirely and focused on how great the  suites  were at his hotel but on twitter  trump also took the opportunity to prove that he has absolutely no understanding of what the vote was all about anyway  in an effort to  prove  that the world was ripe for right wing nationalistic takeovers  he tweeted a comment so oblivious that it made international headlines just arrived in scotland  place is going wild over the vote  they took their country back  just like we will take america back  no games   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     it was pointed out  uniformly voted to stay in the european union  the fact that british right wing nationalists chose to leave is already kickstarting a scottish independence movement  very soon  the  united  kingdom will be neither united nor a kingdom  but at least trump thinks his golf course will do well  true leadership indeed featured image via jeff j mitchell getty images
