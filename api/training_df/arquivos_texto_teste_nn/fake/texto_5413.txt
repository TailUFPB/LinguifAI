it s still a few months before the election  so the media has to keep us interested by telling us it s an up and down horse race  recent polls show donald trump neck and neck with hillary clinton  okay  done with the horse metaphors   but reality paints a much different picture  recent models show that clinton has a  to  chance of winning for example  the most recent nbc poll shows that clinton and trump are virtually tied the new york times  upshot examines state by state polling  rather than overall polling  they also take past results into account  with our electoral college  polling a national sampling can be wildly inaccurate  yet that s what most pollsters do their prediction  it s not a lock for clinton  but they say her chances of winning are  percent to  percent for trump  read their article  there are a lot of fascinating interactive charts  in essence  though  clinton has  ways to win  trump has  the always sane nate silver at fivethirtyeight com agrees  kind of  silver acknowledges that clinton s lead is now down to just  or  points  which is kind of frightening  but according to silver  there s a  to  percent chance that trump can pull it out  what s particularly disconcerting about that  though  is that clinton has about the same lead in the polls that john kerry did in   and we all know how that election turned out one big unknown is whether the spate of violence by and toward the police will continue  right now  the republican party is waging an effective campaign of telling americans that we are in a race war and the only way for the majority  white people  to win  is by voting for donald trump  then again  there are those of us who believe that the way to start a race war is to elect trump featured image of hillary clinton by alex wong at getty images   featured image of donald trump by will mcnamee at getty images
