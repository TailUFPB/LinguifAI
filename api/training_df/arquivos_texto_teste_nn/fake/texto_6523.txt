new footage from a hidden camera reveals that this country greatly needs to embrace gun reform  despite what the national rifle association and right wing gun nuts would like to have the rest of america believe just this year alone  toddlers have shot  people  when small children stumble upon a gun  accidental shootings can easily happen  and have become far too common because part of this country is severely underestimating just how ineffective current gun safety measures are the nra has insisted that its eddie eagle program  which attempts to educate children about firearms  satisfies gun safety requirements for children   but that couldn t be further from the truth  many parents also believe that while it s unfortunate that some kids get a hold of guns  it couldn t possibly be  their  child to investigate this  local charlotte station  set up a scenario that gave a group of children the opportunity to pick up a gun  with the help of mecklenburg county sheriff irwin carmichael  several unsupervised toddlers were placed in a playroom with a realistic looking bb gun and several other toys and games  the only thing carmichael told the children before he left them alone to play was  so if you find a gun do you touch it  no  no  what should you do  tell and adult go tell an adult   simple enough  right some of the children s parents who d volunteered their kids for the experiment were very confident that their child would be smart enough to follow instructions or leave the gun alone  some parents admitted that they d never even had a conversation with their child about gun safety  what happened next shocked them  basically proving that guns can be dangerous no matter how clearly you warn a child  the footage showed that a toddler s short attention span and desire to play will often override the safety measures adults try to teach them   especially if they know they re not being watched  while not every child engaged with the fake firearm  it only took  seconds of unsupervised playtime before a little boy discovered the bb gun  just a few minutes later  many of the children were firing the gun at each other unfortunately  this is exactly how so many accidental gun deaths happen  and it s time that the nra and gun loving conservatives that are against gun safety measures embrace this reality featured image via video screen capture
