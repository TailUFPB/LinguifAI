trump s team is taking historical revisionism to a whole new level during an appearance on cnn with victor blackwell  donald trump s mouthpiece katrina pierson claimed that president obama is responsible for creating isis because he invaded afghanistan  if you want to go way back  we can look at the troop surge   pierson said   and after   al qaeda was essentially in ashes  it was barack obama and hillary clinton who then destroyed the entire rollout by wanting to pull out early  announcing their plans  ignoring intelligence and that s the reason why isis is a global issue and not a  a confused blackwell interrupted   barack obama in   is that what you said   he asked and pierson s rant just got even more confusing  no   pierson responded   i said afterwards  after the surge when al qaeda was in ashes  barack obama and hillary clinton   remember we weren t even in afghanistan by this time  barack obama went into afghanistan creating another problem  it was hillary clinton and her incidents in libya  they armed the rebels and funded them  blackwell gave pierson another chance to get her facts straight but she only continued trying to rewrite american history blackwell   you re saying barack obama took the country into afghanistan post   is that what you re saying  pierson   barack obama and hillary clinton   that was obama s war  yes  here s the video via youtube of course  pierson is absolutely wrong the united states invaded afghanistan in  during george w  bush s first year as president  president obama took office in  and inherited the war in afghanistan so if we go by pierson s logic  that means george w  bush and republicans are responsible for the rise of isis because they were the ones who took america into afghanistan this isn t the first time pierson has blamed president obama for a war started by bush earlier this month  pierson falsely claimed that president obama is responsible for the death of captain humayun khan  who sacrificed his life in iraq to save his fellow american soldiers in   it was under barack obama and hillary clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost  khan s  life   she said but again  george w  bush was president when the united states invaded iraq in   obama was a senator at the time and he voted against the invasion  the iraq war created a power vacuum that strengthened iran s power in the region and allowed isis to rise and blackwell thoroughly fact checked pierson after the commercial break by giving her a history lesson  the origin of isis began in iraq in  and morphed into the organization we know today in  here s the video via twitter  bigcmurr here is the follow up where victor blackwell fact checks katrina pierson and her isis history   pic twitter com   richard w    icemannyr  august    it should be noted that president bush signed the status of forces agreement that led to the withdrawal of all american troops from iraq  thus giving isis the opportunity to take over large swaths of the country nevertheless  the tradition of republicans blaming president obama for everything that happened under george w  bush s watch continues featured image  screenshot
