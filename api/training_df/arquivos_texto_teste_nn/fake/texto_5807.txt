another conservative  christian  pastor is praising the killing of  people who were shot at an orlando gay nightclub last weekend in response to sacramento pastor roger jimenez lamenting that the orlando shooter didn t kill every last person in the club that night and calling for the government to line every gay person in america against a wall and execute them via firing squad  fort worth pastor donnie romero of the stedfast baptist church applauded the hateful sermon and added his sickening two cents romero claimed that all gay people are pedophiles even though that s a complete and utter lie  and he asked god to  finish the job  and kill any of the wounded victims who are still in the hospital  these  sodomites were all perverts and pedophiles and they are the scum of the earth and the earth is a little bit better place now  and i ll even take it a little further i heard on the news today that there are still several dozen of these q    s in icu and i will pray that god will finish the job that that man started  that he will end their lives and by tomorrow morning they will all be burning in hell so that they don t get any more opportunities to go out and hurt little children  here s the video of the full sermon via youtube if you can stomach it  the remarks above are at the beginning of the video romero was also echoing arizona pastor steven anderson  who also had no sympathy or compassion for his fellow human beings and also called for all gays people to be executed in an interview with fox  about his hateful remarks  romero showed no regret whatsoever  the bible teaches they are predators  and i believe that every sodomite is a pedophile and is a predator   romero said but fox  also consulted a bible scholar  who made it clear that romero knows nothing about the book or christianity  no christian who has any formal understanding of the interaction between the old and the new testament would say such a thing   said theologian steve kellmeyer   he s just one more in a long list of people who don t get what it means to be christian  it s disgusting how so called  men of god  have been reacting to this tragedy all week long since it happened  the way they are cheering this loss of life makes them no better than isis  whose leaders we all know must be praising this attack just as fervently  these people who dare to call themselves  christians  have thrown in with the terrorists against american citizens and that should not go unpunished  each of these  churches should lose their tax exemptions and be shut down for inciting hate crimes against the lgbt community and if conservatives are still wondering why more people are rejecting religion today  they should look no further than these fundamentalist pastors they have allowed to lace christianity with hate and violence featured image via screen capture
