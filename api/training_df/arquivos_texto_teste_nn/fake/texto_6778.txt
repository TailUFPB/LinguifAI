in a display of olympic level mental gymnastics  a south carolina sheriff said  and actually meant  that the naacp is pretty much just like the kkk  his reasoning  they promote and support african americans during the talk  wright addressed several topics  the sheriff  who is known for being outspoken  said  among other things   i think the most racist people in america right now sometimes are minorities  small group minorities  i ve got a chaplain who works for me  he s an african american  he is my brother and i love him more than anything   he doesn t buy into that mess  a bunch of his friends don t either  they don t do the naacp because  i feel like that is a racist group as well as the kkk  i don t care about them either  i don t want to be a part of no group that s got something to do just because of your color  i don t think they re right in case you missed it  yes  he played the  i have a black friend  card there s an argument to be made that black people can t be  racists  because they re not in positions of power to systematically oppress white people  but semantics aside  sheriff redneck is right that some black people don t like white people  in fact  they re downright bigoted  i suppose that if i were black and white people constantly treated me like a criminal or mentally inferior  i might start to resent the hell out of white people  maybe i d even learn to hate them  this doesn t excuse bigotry but it puts it into perspective on the other hand  the kkk hates black people just for being black  it s a not subtle difference  bigoted black people are  by and large  responding to how they re treated  the kkk thinks blacks are innately inferior  if not  in fact  sub human but even putting aside of all that  the naacp exists to help the black community stand on equal footing with white people  national association for the advancement of colored people  it s right there in the name  black people have been systemically kept from getting the same educational and economic opportunities as white people  the law treats them differently on every level and always for the worse  our popular media has spent decades  centuries   depicting black people as lazy  criminally inclined and stupid  so  yes  sheriff good ol  boy  the naacp has got to do with skin color because america keeps treating that skin color poorly meanwhile  the kkk exists to maintain white supremacy  using violence and terrorism to keep the black community from freeing itself from the legacy of american slavery  but  you know  that s just like what the naacp does because sheriff inbred s  black friend  told him so and just to top it all off  sheriff boss hog feels persecuted  because of course he does   this is a political bashing  that s all it is  to try to stir up controversy to draw some attention   wright said yes  why would anyone want to draw attention to the fact that the sheriff thinks black people are just as racist as the kkk  i just can t figure it out featured image via the houston chronicle
