it was an epic shaming they all deserved when democrats introduced a bill to increase the age limit on exotic dancers from  to  in an effort to curb sex trafficking  a republican proposed a sexist amendment that would regulate stripping so that only women  between twenty one and twenty eight years of age and no more than one hundred sixty pounds in weight  would be able to work as an exotic dancer democratic state rep  walt leger introduced house bill  and it didn t take long for a republican colleague to demonstrate that lawmakers aren t taking the issue seriously gop state rep  sam jones responded by asking if leger wants to institute a maximum age as well as the house broke into laughter  leger responded that he s  open to suggestions  but doesn t want to  comment on anybody s tastes  that s when gop state rep kenneth havard chimed in by offering his amendment complete with an offensive sexist remark  in the spirit of this legislative session  i will offer up this amendment as a part of keeping the spirit alive of trimming the fat   he said  again  the male gop lawmakers thought this was hilarious and an appropriate way for a government body to act not everyone in the chamber was amused  however  as their female colleagues were quick to shame them and forced havard to withdraw his amendment in humiliation  i ve got to say  looking out over this body  i ve never been more repulsed to be part of it   gop state rep  julie stokes said during her condemnation of her sexist colleagues   i m going to tell you one thing  the disrespect   and i saw it in  in committee  and i ve never been so disgusted to be part of a committee as i was in   somebody made comments  like   what if it s a classy strip club like cheetah s in atlanta   that s not the way we behave in this body  becoming visibly more upset as she continued  stokes slammed havard for his amendment and told her colleagues to consider their own daughters  i don t even know what representative havard was thinking  that s a dangerous thing to do politically  it was a bad idea  i suggest that everybody in here look at their own bodies and their own daughters stokes pointed out that these lawmakers are somehow completely fine with barring women under  from drinking and buying a lottery ticket but have no problem with  year olds stripping in a men s club by the time stokes reached the end of her remarks  the floor was dead silent and she finished by expressing her disgust over their comments and expressed her wish that they show respect to leger s effort and to all the women present in the chamber  i refuse the spirit of everything that i heard  and i can t even believe the behavior in here  i think we need to call an end to this  i hear derogatory comments about women in this place regularly  i hear and i see women get treated differently than men  and i m going to tell you what  you gave me a perfect forum to talk about it right now  because it has got to stop  that was utterly disrespectful and disgusting  i really don t have anything left to say  here s the video house bill  came about as leger explained because  back in october alcohol tobacco control did a sting where they found prostitution and drug dealing in at least  strip clubs  in the state leger went on to explain that strip clubs become havens for trafficking where teen girls are preyed upon because many of them are stripping because they are desperate to earn a living  that s why leger and democrats are trying to raise the age limit and that makes hb  a legitimate piece of legislation that is not a joking matter the sexist pigs of the louisiana republican party should be ashamed of themselves featured image via screencapture
