when a celebrity is given a star on the hollywood walk of fame  it stays there forever  so  it was surprising to hear that donald trump s star may be removed  but the reason why is absolutely hilarious over the weekend  there were reports that the hollywood historic trust is weighing whether or not to remove trump s star because people won t stop vandalizing it here are a few of the things tourists have done to it a picture i took of donald trump s star on the walk of fame in la a few months ago pic twitter com   khalid   worldofk  march    somebody has defaced donald trump s hollywood star and people aren t sure whether it was a supporter or a protester  pic twitter com   rhoda sharp     march    friend s service dog accidentally took a shit on donald trump s hollywood star  best thing i ve seen all day  pic twitter com   taylor mccollum   taybuggxoxo  march     the likelihood of trump s star actually being removed is pretty low because the hollywood chamber of commerce believes that once a star is added it becomes part of history  as a matter of fact  when they were asked if they planned on removing bill cosby s star  president leron gubler said  the answer is no  once a star has been added to the walk  it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the hollywood walk of fame  trump is an absolutely vile human being  he has made a name for himself in politics on the backs of others  he incites violence  treats women like garbage  promotes xenophobic and islamophobic hate and feels no remorse for any of it  while i understand that the chamber of commerce s point of view  i disagree with it   hopefully  the rumors are true and the hollywood trust is actually considering the possibility of removing it and can put pressure on the chamber  we should not honor the trumps and cosbys of the world  they certainly do not deserve it featured image via twitter
