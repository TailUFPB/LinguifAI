don christy  who claims he s neither a republican nor a democrat  but rather  a  patriot  in the most vile sense of the word  had a float in the town of sheridan  indiana s  of july parade  it wasn t all stars and stripes  though  no  he decided to go way too far with it  and constructed a likeness of president obama in a toilet  with the words  lying african  on it while sane and reasonable people are questioning the town for even allowing that float  christy is busy waving his flag and claiming that he tries to do something outrageous every year for that parade  because that makes it totally okay  last year  he made fun of marriage equality by  dressing gay  and  marrying a guy  in the parade  this year  he did that horribly disrespectful and bigoted display as a statement against what he sees as rampant dishonesty in the white house  along with political correctness  it s time to start changing our country back a little bit  christy is  years old  so he remembers well what life was like before african americans could even dream of seeing a black man elected president  that was a great time for white people   no minorities  with their irrelevant  irrational  feelings  were ruining the country for white people with their political correctness take a look at the float in all its hateful glory so   today in sheridan indiana   somehow this  float  was approved for their parade    yea wtf sheridan  classy  pic twitter com   ashley s mething   ashleysmething  july    from another angle  man drives  lying african  obama float in fourth of july parade  sheridan  ind    sheridan  indiana is a small  https   t co   ogden daily news   ogdendailynews  july    thinks portraying obama in one of the most racist and disrespectful lights imaginable is just fun and games  but others aren t laughing at all  another sheridan resident  rebekah sanders  said  too many people die fighting for our freedom  i don t think that display is the type of freedom they are out there fighting for  she added  i do not want my child to think that racism is ok  unfortunately  christy doesn t care about that kind of thing  he s a trumper  so he probably wants children to grow up in the supremely white environment he grew up in  he s on king donald s bandwagon regarding political correctness  and totally missing the point that people always found racism offensive and saw it everywhere  the only difference is that now they re speaking up about it because they can not to worry  though  christy issued a totally insincere and backhanded apology for this travesty of a float  i apologize to anyone i offended  which would be a total liberal  here s hoping the sheridan lions club bans this small  disgusting excuse of a human being from all future parades featured image via embedded tweets
