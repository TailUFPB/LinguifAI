georgia conservatives really wanted to enshrine their hate and bigotry into law under the guise of religious liberty  and because their governor refused to do so they are punishing him unlike the republican governors of north carolina and mississippi  georgia governor nathan deal refused to sign the anti lgbt bill passed by the gop controlled legislature  deal mulled over the bill while witnessing the economic backlash similar bills are causing other states in north carolina alone  corporations are threatening to leave or have cancelled plans to expand into the state  resulting in the loss of hundreds of jobs and money that could have sparked economic growth  furthermore  the state also faces the loss of federal dollars  mississippi is facing the same backlash and south carolina has also suffered the loss of a corporate headquarters for just introducing the bill georgia certainly faced the same consequences  disney and marvel threatened to stop filming movies in the state and other corporations and businesses urged the governor to veto the bill realizing that the economic backlash was not worth it  governor deal vetoed hb   he angered conservatives but saved the economy of his state from ruin but those conservatives were looking forward to being able to use their bibles as a shield so they can discriminate against anyone they please and so  they decided to send a message to republicans and any republican who sits in the governor s mansion in the future that not doing what they want is unacceptable and will be punished despite being urged not to do so  conservatives of the georgia third district voted overwhelmingly to censure deal  according to the atlanta journal constitution  though it is purely symbolic  it s a startling sign of the conservative backlash to deal s decision to reject the legislation   and another reminder that the debate over the measure never really ended  a censure is a formal statement of severe disapproval  which means republicans literally just punished deal publicly for refusing to support a bigoted policy supported by conservatives in his state it s basically a warning shot to other republicans that they better not veto future efforts to legalize discrimination in georgia or they too could be censured or worse this is why republicans made a huge mistake by letting extremists have a mainstream seat at the party table  because now they are beholden to do as the extremists desire or else featured image via  youtube
