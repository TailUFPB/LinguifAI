massachusetts senator elizabeth warren continued to throw haymakers at donald trump on wednesday in response to her relentless slams against him on twitter  the only counter punch trump could muster was to refer to warren as  goofy  i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate   trump tweeted   i will defeat them both  he also demanded to see proof of her native american heritage  let s properly check goofy elizabeth warren s records to see if she is native american   he wrote   i say she s a fraud  and he used  goofy  a third time in yet another tweet  goofy elizabeth warren  hillary clinton s flunky  has a career that is totally based on a lie   he continued   she is not native american  that little twitter tantrum came three days after warren called out the presumptive republican presidential nominee on tuesday trump literally waited until friday to respond and warren noticed  i called out  realdonaldtrump on tuesday   million saw it  he s so confident about his  counter punch  he waited until friday night  lame  i called out  realdonaldtrump on tuesday   million saw it  he s so confident about his  counter punch  he waited until friday night  lame   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  may    absolutely buried trump on twitter and she continued piling it on during an interview with policy mic on wednesday when she was asked about trump calling her  goofy  really  that s the best you could come up with   warren quipped   i thought donald trump said he was a guy who was good with words  she then went on to describe what the economy would be like under a trump presidency  i think it will be more of a government that works for a thin slice at the top  and a government that leaves everyone else behind  and the problem with that is it s not just government  government becomes the tool then to have the economy work that way  so increasingly we live in a world where the economy works for a narrower and narrower slice of america  here s the video via youtube warren is right to laugh at trump  after all  he s the biggest joke in american politics right now  but  he s also dangerous as warren pointed out  and not just to the economy  trump has no foreign policy experience and has indicated that he would use the military and torture rather than diplomacy to achieve american goals overseas furthermore  trump is also a threat to civil rights and a free press and brings no real substantive ideas to the table  he is nothing more than hateful warmonger who would create an economy to help himself and his wealthy friends at the expense of the rest of us that s why we need people like elizabeth warren in the senate and on the presidential ticket to offer americans a real choice featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
