florida republican senator and presidential hopeful marco rubio has spent much of his political life and campaign making life harder for lgbt people  so what happened when he was confronted by a real life gay man in new hampshire on monday  nothing good on monday february   openly gay  year old timothy kierstead was enjoying a drink with his mother and his husband in the wonderfully appropriately named puritan backroom diner  when he was approached by marco rubio during a campaign event  he asked the candidate a very simple question  why do you want to put me back in the closet  the color leeched from rubio s face as he realized he d definitely come to the wrong table the new york times reports that the candidate  when face to face with kierstead  responded  i don t you can live any way you want  but it did not end there  as the times continues  mr  rubio  who is seeking to win over conservatives  is seldom asked about gay rights at his campaign stops during a brief conversation  mr  kierstead    told mr  rubio that he was married but complained that the senator s position amounted to him declaring that  we don t matter  mr  rubio  who was standing with his youngest son  dominick    by his side  gently disagreed   no  i just believe marriage is between one man and one woman  well   replied mr  kierstead   that s your belief  mr  rubio continued   i think that s what the law should be  and if you don t agree you should have the law changed by a legislature  rubio was reminded by mr  keirstad that this is exactly what the lgbt community had done  and that the senator and his party were seeking to have their religious prejudices supersede the law of the land  in fact  just last december  rubio told chuck todd  it is the current law  i don t believe any case law is settled law  any future supreme court can change it  i don t think the current constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate marriage  what is wrong is that the supreme court has found this hidden constitutional right that  years of jurisprudence had not discovered and basically overturned the will of the voters in florida  where over  percent passed a constitutional amendment that defined marriage in the state constitution as the union of one man and one woman  in short  rubio doesn t believe that the constitution gives federal government the right to regulate marriage  unless it is regulating against the rights of same sex couples  rubio doesn t want the government regulating his access to guns  yet he is totally in favor of the government regulating the access of same sex couples to marriage  this hypocrisy reveals that for rubio and his fellow republicans  the government can never be too big  so long it is enforcing their prejudices rubio  suddenly lost the courage of his convictions  tried to remove himself from the situation at the soonest opportunity  the campaign also did it s best to pretend the incident never even happened enjoyed meeting voters at the puritan backroom in manchester  nh today   fitn pic twitter com   marco rubio   marcorubio  february    his campaign polls going into free fall  his robotic performances being heavily criticized  and his failure to win round the puritan backroom   isn t it time rubio slipped quietly into the night and declared what we all know to be true  it s game over for marco rubio  featured image from twitter
