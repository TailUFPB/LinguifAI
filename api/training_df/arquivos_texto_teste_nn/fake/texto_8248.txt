just when you think donald trump can t get any more grotesque he proves us all wrong  it s as though he s trying to see how awful he can get and still get away with it the real estate mogul has been racist  misogynistic  homophobic  dropped the f bomb  amongst other several other things  now  hearing an audience member from his latest rally in manchester  nh  yell out  ted cruz is a pu y   he encouraged them to say it again  he jokingly said   i never expect to hear that from you again   then he said it himself while laughing and barely containing his glee from the moment  he even had to turn away watch the moment here trump  of course  is trying to belittle his competition  and seeing that cruz is the guy who beat in him in iowa  he ll encourage any and all insults thrown at the texas senator  is this juvenile  sure  is it outrageous that a candidate for president of the united states will use the word  pu y  on a national stage  of course  would you expect anything less from trump  of course not let it be known  that the audience member who shouted this could have been a plant  so it would make it more acceptable for trump to say this remark  as was pointed out by  well  himself shortly before the outburst  when he said  they re getting rid of some protesters  look  are the police the greatest  i like protesters  because that s the only way the camera shows how big the crowd is  sometimes we even stage protesters  and if they re openly admitting to staging protesters  they re probably also planting outbursts from supporters   probably note  shortly before that audience member s cruz outburst  trump said this  https   t co   angelo carusone   goangelo  february    least now we know why some protesters aren t beaten while others are let s be real  trump is a walking and talking joke of a candidate  he has no political experience  no policy experience  no diplomatic experience  and as a businessman had to file for bankruptcy multiple times  what is he good at  bullshitting  which is how he s gotten as far as he has not only in this election  but also in life  and people  really imbecilic people  are falling for it now  if people insist on having a president who will openly use the word  pu y  on a national stage  well  then  trump is your guy  however  let s hope he s not video featured image  youtube
