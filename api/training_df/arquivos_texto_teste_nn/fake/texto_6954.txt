on monday night s daily show  host trevor noah wrestled with the problem facing americans in any election cycle  we want both a president and a drinking buddy  someone who can get the job done  but someone to whom we can relate  but it s ok now  because noah solved it noah s sensible and hilarious conclusion is that america  must elect both a president and a mascot  think how much time and embarrassment candidates would save if they didn t have to run around pretending to be normal people  noah runs through the shambles of hillary clinton s subway ride  bernie sanders singing along to hamilton  and john kasich stuffing his face like an idiot  a focus group must have discovered gluttony is now an attractive trait in a candidate   voters need a brilliant policy mind  but at the same time  americans want a leader who s just a fun best friend and i get that  but maybe  we shouldn t demand that these two be the same person  isn t it a stroke of genius  someone with capability  intellect and knowledge   who can devise and execute smart and effective policy  and someone to wave their arms about  shouts encouraging cheers  kisses babies and generally just pump everybody the hell up but where  noah wonders  would we find a  brightly colored cartoon character  with  a giant head and weird sized hands  then he lands on it  we already found him  he s the current gop frontrunner while donald trump may not be fit to be american president  he would make a damn fine american mascot even better  we would never have to watch hillary clinton attempt to whip or nae nae ever again  there is literally no downside to this plan  so come election   vote trump  for american mascot  do your part  to  make america great again  featured image via screengrab
