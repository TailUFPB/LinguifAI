the media has been telling us for months now that the republican party is in a civil war  it is  the war  though  is not between those who care and those who want to take food from the mouths of babies  no  they all want to take food from the mouths of babies  it s not a war between those who want the world to treat those who aren t white  male  christian and cis equally  none of them want that  the war is between those who pretend to be good people and those who let their anti intellectual a  hole flag fly sarah palin is the queen of the a  hole flag branch of the gop  she wears that flag proudly and with all the maturity of a bully who s flunking out of fifth grade  before palin hit the stage  we suspected  but we never knew for sure  that the base of the republican party was bigoted macho mouth breathers  imagine our feigned surprise when palin came out in support of this macho mouth breather in wisconsin  who is hoping to replace paul ryan in the house  watch to the end of the video  when he challenges ryan to a debate  but if ryan refuses to debate  he d be happy to arm wrestle the congressman here s the video well  paul ryan does do   so it could be an interesting match the man who wants to arm wrestle ryan  presumably from the backs of harleys  is wisconsin businessman paul nehlen  whose main issue is the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade agreement  there s just one problem with his entire beef with ryan  ryan didn t endorse the agreement the video is titled  truth resurrection   but its portrayal of ryan as a supporter of the trade deal is false  ryan s been critical of the actual deal  but helped pass a separate measure called trade promotion authority  tpa   a pro forma congressional action that makes it easier for the executive branch to negotiate a proposed treaty that must still be ratified by congress  lawmakers have granted presidents that authority as a routine matter of course going back decades and across party lines  ryan even hammered some unusual concessions to gop ideology into this edition of tpa source  think progressthe real issue  though  at least for palin  is that ryan  at least so far  has refused to endorse her candidate  donald trump  now  she has set her sights on replacing the speaker  i think paul ryan is soon to be  cantored   as in eric cantor   palin said  referring to the former republican house majority leader who was ousted in a shocking upset in  when challenger dave brat ran to his right in a virginia primary  his political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people  and as the leader of the gop  the convention  certainly he is to remain neutral  and for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his   palin continued source  cnnnaturally  palin didn t consult policy experts before landing on a candidate  she saw a tattooed  muscled man s man on a harley and her little squirrel brain said   that s the man   that  and nehlen endorsed trump palin told tapper that although she hasn t yet informed nehlen that she s endorsing him   i will do whatever i can for paul nehlen  this man is a hard working guy  so in touch with the people   palin said   paul ryan and his ilk  their problem is they have become so disconnected by the people whom they are elected to represent  she added   they feel so threatened at this point that their power  their prestige  their purse will be adversely affected by the change that is coming with trump and with someone like paul nehlen  that they re not thinking straight right now  it appears that this is a year in which palin is ready to let her social conservatism take a backseat to her xenophobia  both nehlen and trump are anti immigration  but their stances on reproductive rights and lgbt rights are tough to pin down  of course  you could also say that this proves that palin has no principles  other than somehow staying relevant with the ignorant masses  or  maybe she likes the harley and the tats featured image via youtube video screen capture
