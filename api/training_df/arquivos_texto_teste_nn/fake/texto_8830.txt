almost  years ago  david bowie released a music video in conjunction with trent reznor of nine inch nails that was disturbingly prophetic  the song  i m afraid of americans  was heavily critical of the accelerating dumbing down of american culture  the video took a slightly different tack and was heavily critical of america s increasingly out of control obsession with guns  together  they gave us a painfully accurate glimpse of america two decades later  loudly belligerent  proudly ignorant and dangerously violent and this video was released back in   well before america declared war on the middle east and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of revenge  racism and religion  when bowie sings the lyric   god is an american   he wasn t commenting on religion so much as commenting on america s theocratic tendencies and what they mean for the rest of the world   i m afraid of americans  might as well be the national anthem of any country with a sizable muslim population  or oil  and allah help you if your country has both but the predictions didn t stop there  with a few simple lyrics like  johnny wants a brain  johnny wants to suck on a coke   bowie accidentally summed up the entire career of sarah palin the video is just as prescient  showing several scenes of americans pantomiming gun violence  it turns out that david bowie s character in the video is being delusional  no one had a gun  but it s an accurate reflection of how the world saw the united states back then  even more so now than in   not for nothing  in   we averaged more than one mass shooting a day  what s horrors await us in  here s  i m afraid of americans  on sunday  january     david bowie died of liver cancer after an  month fight  his musical legacy stretches decades and for anyone over the age of   he was an integral part of their childhood dreams and nightmares  long live jareth the goblin king featured image via screencap
