there are a lot of things people can forgive in life  but utter stupidity for lack of even remotely trying to comprehend a subject isn t one of those things  when information is readily available to learn about something  but you simply ignore the reality of that information to go with your own moronic viewpoint because it makes more sense to you  well  you deserve to be ridiculed global warming  or rather climate change  is very real  and there are unending facts to prove it  yet  there are still those who choose to ignore   of scientists  decades of research  and a quite visible increase in abnormal weather patterns  one of those people is donald trump supporter scott baio  the happy days star may have literally just put one of the most moronic tweets to ever exist up on his feed sunday night he said  dear global warming  funny  i spent  days in palm desert playing golf  getting a tan while looking at the snow on the mountains  dear global warming  funny  i spent  days in palm desert playing golf  getting a tan while looking at the snow on the mountains   scott baio   scottbaio  april     first of all  he clearly doesn t understand local weather patterns involving altitude and moisture let alone the ongoing climate change crisis  yes  when it s hot in the dry california valleys and deserts it can still be cold in the mountain regions which get more moisture and are much higher in altitude  yet still visible from the valleys and deserts rarely would i dub someone so clearly and utterly moronic  but this seems to be well worthy of the condemnation  we already knew he was pretty dumb for supporting trump  but this takes the cake featured photo by jesse grant getty images for clear channel
