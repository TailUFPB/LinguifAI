fox news commentator charles krauthammer wrote a column discussing donald trump s mental health on thursday and he did not hold back krauthammer  who happens to be a board certified psychiatrist  strongly rebuked the republican nominee for viciously attacking khizr khan and his wife ghazala  who lost their son humayun when he sacrificed his life to save his fellow american soldiers in iraq  it reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency and of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows   parental grief   krauthammer wrote   it wasn t a mistake  it was a revelation  krauthammer then put his psychiatry skills to work  slamming trump s narcissism and thin skin  trump s hypersensitivity and unedited  untempered pavlovian responses are  shall we say  unusual in both ferocity and predictability this is beyond narcissism  i used to think trump was an  year old  an undeveloped schoolyard bully  i was off by about  years  his needs are more primitive  an infantile hunger for approval and praise  a craving that can never be satisfied  he lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him  krauthammer went on to say that trump is struggling to  pass the threshold test for acceptability   comparing this year s election to the  election in which reagan defeated incumbent president jimmy carter   trump badly needs to pass that threshold   he wrote   if character is destiny  he won t  indeed  trump is definitely no ronald reagan  reagan spoke positively about america and the future while trump is all gloom and doom and doesn t know when to keep his mouth shut krauthammer is not the only mental health professional who has talked about trump s mental health status either dr  drew pinsky appeared on cnn earlier this week and expressed concern about trump s temperament and impulsiveness  the question  though  is  are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected  that s a pretty hard thing to predict  i don t know if this is just somebody playing politics  or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses  when i hear people that are impulsive with their speech  i worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions  pinsky went on to question the mental stability of trump s supporters clearly  there is something wrong with donald trump and he is not fit to be president of the united states at a time when there is so much conflict and upheaval in the world  we need a steady hand at the helm  not a hand that lashes out over every little slight and criticism  especially when that hand belongs to a man who is obsessed with using nuclear weapons  mental instability and access to the nuclear codes would be a dangerous combination featured image  john moore getty images
