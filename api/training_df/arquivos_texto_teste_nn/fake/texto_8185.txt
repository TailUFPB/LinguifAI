it s about damn time it s been two years since nevada rancher cliven bundy engaged in an illegal armed standoff with federal authorities with the help of right wing gun nuts as you ll recall  bundy threw a temper tantrum after the government began rounding up his cattle because he refused to pay the   million in grazing fees and penalties owed to the bureau of land management even after a judge ordered him to do so anti government gun nuts rushed to bundy s side to prevent him from being arrested and interfered with federal agents who were doing their job not only did bundy and his band of armed militants use women and children as shields  they also used a highway to aim their guns at federal officials and set up unauthorized checkpoints to question and search people and after two years of seemingly getting away with his illegal rebellion against the government  it appears bundy is finally going to see the inside of a prison cell for his actions bundy was arrested by the fbi on wednesday at portland international airport as he tried to make his way to the malheur national wildlife refuge in support of the remaining armed thugs who have refused to surrender since bundy s sons ammon and ryan were arrested at the end of january according to the oregonian  bundy  was booked into the downtown multnomah county jail  and faces the charge of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer in relation to his little standoff in  in fact  here is bundy s mugshot courtesy of the oregonian perhaps this will serve as a lesson to other anti government gun nuts that the long arm of the law will come for them if they pull more stunts like the one bundy and his boys have pulled over the years  and maybe the prison time they serve will give them the opportunity to actually read the constitution they claim to love so much and realize that their claim that the government is violating it is pure bullshit  featured image from multnomah county records
