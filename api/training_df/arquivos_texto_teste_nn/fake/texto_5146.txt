donald trump claims the election is rigged and fox host sean hannity irresponsibly does not challenge him  so cnn s brian stelter blasted him the republican nominee is already making excuses in preparation for when he loses the election in november by claiming without any proof that the election is somehow rigged in favor of hillary clinton  and hannity has been only too happy to let trump make his unsubstantiated claims on his show  which will likely anger fox viewers and make them even more paranoid than they already are so brian stelter used the end of his show on sunday to teach hannity how real journalists interview candidates   let me show you how not to interview a candidate about something as serious as this   he began before slamming hannity for  failing  his audience  hannity s not a journalist  but he has a megaphone  and he s using his megaphone irresponsibly  if a democratic candidate were saying this stuff saying the election could be rigged then every word of this essay would apply to him or her  but right now  it s the republican candidate for president who s trying to delegitimize our democratic process without proof  it is unpatriotic for any interviewer or any journalist to help him  indeed  if the shoe were on the other foot hannity wouldn t give a damn at all  he would call any democratic claims of a rigged election absurd  you know  because only republicans win elections fairly  if they lose it must be because the election was  rigged  here s the video via youtube and of course  being as thin skinned as trump  hannity lashed out on twitter hey brian check philly enquirer after   how many districts not a single romney vote  check cleveland  do u prep  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    philly inquirer  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august      https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    calling us unpatriotic   districts not one romney vote  so you are voting for the liar hrc  did dnc hurt bernie  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    unreliable liberal sources   brian  answer a simple question  is hrc a liar  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    you can see  hannity is citing a single newspaper report in order to claim that the election is rigged because not a single person voted for romney in  districts in philadelphia in  but the philadelphia inquirer itself conceded that  such results may not be so startling after all  considering philadelphia has a majority african american population especially in these urban districts  in fact  when the inquirer attempted to find the few republicans listed in the voter registry they had either moved away or had voted for obama after being mistakenly identified as republicans they also noted that john mccain didn t receive a single vote in  of the districts in  the inquirer also pointed out the factors that led to such a lopsided result first  president obama is the first african american president  so black voters were especially supportive of him  obama won  percent of the black vote nationwide second  republicans have largely abandoned fighting for things african americans care about like affirmative action and urban development third   many parts of philadelphia and other big cities simply lack republican voters  and it has been this way for decades going all the way back to franklin d  roosevelt s presidency and finally  romney said a lot of stupid things  including commenting about people  wanting free stuff from the government  after visiting the naacp  such comments did not go down well with the black community who felt romney was talking about them factcheck org even pointed out that  the  that went  percent for obama in  constitute   votes  just  percent of the total votes cast in the city  of course  if hannity really wants to bring up philadelphia as some kind of proof that democrats rig elections  we could similarly point out that some precincts in utah voted unanimously for romney  does that mean republicans rigged the election there  or does hannity just deal in double standards featured image  screenshot
