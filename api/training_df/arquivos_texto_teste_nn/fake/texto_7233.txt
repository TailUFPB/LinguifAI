when donald trump stood at his podium at a rally and declared   i have no friends you re my friends   he apparently wasn t kidding  a scathing new report from the new york times tells the sad story of a donald trump who at nearly  years old has no real friends one of trump s favorite things to talk about are his celebrity friends  in the past he s been chummy with the likes of oprah winfrey  regis philbin  howard stern and he loves playing golf with athletes like tom brady  but the reality is  none of those people are what you and i would classify as friends  richard leflak  a real estate tycoon who has known the donald for four decades  told the times that trump is  very gregarious and has lots of acquaintances  but people he s close to  not so many  leflak isn t alone in his analysis of trump s personal life   he doesn t really have a lot of friends   said billy procida  a financier and business confidant of trump s   pretty much all he does is work and play golf   reverend al sharpton  who knew trump before he decided to become a republican all of a sudden  said  out of all the political and business and entertainment circles that we ve moved in together over the years  i never really met anyone who was trump s good friend  in fact  i ve never even met anyone who claimed to be his good friend  it may seem harsh  but that s just how trump operates  he s an introverted narcissist who spends his time with family  presumably because he doesn t have anything to prove  that analysis fits with a statement from trump s longtime coworker and head of acquisitions  abe wallach  who told the times that trump would practically beg coworkers to hang out with him after work  donald would call and say   abe  what are you doing  marla and i are flying down to atlantic city  you and david want to come   wallach said   i always thought   why me  i work with him all week  isn t there someone else  apparently not  there is very little that suggests that trump is capable of forming and maintaining personal relationships with people who aren t related to him  wallach gave the times the reason why  deep down  he s a very nice guy   wallach said   but he can t let go and just be nice because he fears that people will take advantage of him  donald is actually the most insecure man i ve ever met  he has this constant need to fill a void inside  he used to do it with deals and sex  now he does it with publicity  ouch  obviously  if a man who has known trump most of his professional career and spent time with him and his family can spout off like that and trash the donald s social skills so easily  there must be something to it  it could be that wallach is right  that trump lacks the confidence and self respect to trust that not everyone is out to screw him  or it could be far simpler  he might just be an insufferable douchebag whatever the issue  what we have here is just another reason donald trump is unfit to hold the highest office in the land  personal relationships are certainly important in trade  foreign policy and relations across the aisle  trump s failures as a human being will easily translate to failures as a diplomat and commander in chief featured image by jeff mitchell  getty images
