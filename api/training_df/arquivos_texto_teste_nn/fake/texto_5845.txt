senator john mccain is in damage control mode after he openly accused president obama of being  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in orlando  thus going even further than donald trump s attacks of the president in the wake of the attack that left  people dead and  wounded  trump responded by suggesting that president obama is somehow helping isis carry out their attacks on our shores  he doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands  it s one or the other   trump said   and either one is unacceptable  we re led by a man who is a very   look  we re led by a man that either is  is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind  and the something else in mind  you know  people can t believe it  people cannot   they cannot believe that president obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical islamic terrorism  there s something going on  it s inconceivable  but mccain  who is facing one of the toughest re election campaigns of his political career  went even further than that  barack obama is directly responsible for it  because when he pulled everybody out of iraq  al qaeda went to syria  became isis  and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama s failures   mccain said after being given a chance to clarify his remarks  mccain repeated his claim  he pulled everybody out of iraq  and i predicted at the time that isis would go unchecked  and there would be attacks on the united states of america  it s a matter of record  so he is directly responsible  here s the audio via the washington post of course  trump s campaign manager quickly tweeted what mccain said  most likely thinking they had found an ally for their own attacks against president obama john mccain  obama is  directly responsible  for orlando attack   the washington post https   t co   corey lewandowski   clewandowski  june    are many problems with mccain s claims  first of all  the shooter is the one who is  directly responsible  for the mass killing  second  president obama followed the order signed by president george w  bush in  agreeing to pull all us military personnel out of iraq in  after several attempts to keep troops there were rejected by the iraqi parliament therefore  not only is president obama not responsible for withdrawing our military forces out of iraq  isis wouldn t have been able to rise if president bush has not pushed to invade iraq in the first place  the war in iraq destabilized the region  thus allowing a terrorist organization like isis to form to fill the power vacuum after much criticism  mccain has been scrambling to spin his remarks ever since  i misspoke  i did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible  i was referring to president obama s national security decisions  not the president himself  as i have said  president obama s decision to completely withdraw u s  troops from iraq in  led to the rise of isil  i and others have long warned that the failure of the president s policy to deny isil safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire  plan  direct or conduct attacks on the united states and europe as they have done in paris  brussels  san bernardino and now orlando  again  it is an established fact that president obama did not invade iraq and did not sign the withdrawal order  both of those actions occurred before he ever stepped foot in the white house but mccain was given a chance to clarify his usage of  directly responsible  and said it again instead so it s hard to believe him when he claims to have  misspoke  also  as a so called  leader  of his party  one would think that john mccain would be able to at least try and persuade the republican controlled congress to declare war on isis so that president obama can wage a full war with full resources to fight terrorism  but so far  republicans would rather criticize president obama for not going to war against isis even though the constitution clearly states that only congress has the power to declare a war clearly  john mccain has served long enough in the senate  it s time for a new senator from arizona  perhaps a real maverick who knows how to be respectful of their commander in chief and knows when to keep their mouth shut instead of spewing lies and false accusations featured image  gage skidmore
