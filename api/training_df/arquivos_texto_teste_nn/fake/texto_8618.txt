republican presidential candidate senator ted cruz  r tx  said it was terrible that the sailors detained by iran were videotaped putting their hands up and surrendering  but now cruz is using that same footage shot by iran in a new campaign ad the ad   have your back   uses the footage of u s  navy sailors created by the iranian regime as a backdrop for a promise from cruz to stand up for them if he is elected president but if cruz believes the video is enemy propaganda  why use it in a crass television commercial it once again hollows out the conservative message that they are the one  true  source of support for the military between the democratic and republican parties the ad also reminds voters just how wrong cruz was about the initial capture of the sailors  as the situation unfolded  cruz ran to conservative radio host hugh hewitt to complain that the incident showed weakness on behalf of the obama administration  our prayers right now are with the sailors and with the families of the sailors   cruz told conservative radio host hugh hewitt on tuesday night   i think what the president should say is that the sailors are coming home and they re coming home right now   cruz continued  now  i don t know that he will say that  and the fact that iran feels emboldened enough to capture two u s  navy ships and to take  sailors into custody is really a demonstration of the unbelievable weakness of the obama clinton foreign policy  we have a commander in chief where the bad actors of the world have learned that he will not stand up to them  remember this is the same barack obama who is trying to send iran  billion dollars  a few hours after cruz stamped and whined his rhetorical feet  the sailors were free  not because obama followed  the lead of cruz and other republicans with a bellicose posture towards iran  but because the obama administration has opened up lines of diplomacy between the two countries   lines needed in order to avoid conflict  the sailors were home without a single shot fired  without an american put in harms way or an innocent iranian civilian having to suffer while obama was bringing the soldiers home safely  ted cruz s ad men were analyzing the situation and looking at the optics for the best way to position their right wing candidate featured image via youtube
