the keepers of the written word in america are so abhorred by the prospect of donald trump becoming president that they penned a letter to the country declaring their opposition hundreds of writers and authors  many of whom are world renowned  wrote and signed a letter listing the many reasons why they refuse to support the presumptive republican nominee among those who signed the letter include horror author stephen king  author of the joy luck club amy tan  and novelist daniel handler  better known to audiences as lemony snicket the letter condemns trump for abusing language to advocate for violence  bigotry  sexism  and division all in the pursuit of power  which the authors point out has created many a dictatorship  they also declare that wealth and celebrity do not qualify anyone to speak for all americans  much less lead the military and in a final flourish  the writers declare that they  unequivocally  oppose trump s candidacy as a  matter of conscience  here s the full letter via lit hub because  as writers  we are particularly aware of the many ways that language can be abused in the name of power because we believe that any democracy worthy of the name rests on pluralism  welcomes principled disagreement  and achieves consensus through reasoned debate because american history  despite periods of nativism and bigotry  has from the first been a grand experiment in bringing people of different backgrounds together  not pitting them against one another because the history of dictatorship is the history of manipulation and division  demagoguery and lies because the search for justice is predicated on a respect for the truth because we believe that knowledge  experience  flexibility  and historical awareness are indispensable in a leader because neither wealth nor celebrity qualifies anyone to speak for the united states  to lead its military  to maintain its alliances  or to represent its people because the rise of a political candidate who deliberately appeals to the basest and most violent elements in society  who encourages aggression among his followers  shouts down opponents  intimidates dissenters  and denigrates women and minorities  demands  from each of us  an immediate and forceful response for all these reasons  we  the undersigned  as a matter of conscience  oppose  unequivocally  the candidacy of donald j  trump for the presidency of the united states  writers and authors signed the letter  and a petition has been included so that other americans can their own names in opposition to trump you can add your name by clicking here what began as a joke has grown to become a threat to our nation and our democratic values  donald trump is a disgrace who never should have been allowed to get this far  but he has by appealing to the worst that the conservative base has to offer  including racist white supremacists  misogynists  and gullible evangelicals who think trump is the new jesus as the authors wrote  this is not the time to stay at home while the rest of the country votes  this is the time for  an immediate and forceful response  that makes it clear that any political party who puts the country in this kind of danger will be deprived of capturing political power  that means we all need to use our right to vote while we still have it and overwhelmingly reject trump and republicans in november featured image  getty isaac brekken
