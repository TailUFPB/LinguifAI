the tried and true donald trump supporter doesn t care what the fuhrer does as long as he keeps saying catch phrase like  we re gonna make america great again  and  we re gonna build a wall   as long as they can feel superior to mexicans  muslims and anyone with an education as they join in beating them up for wearing an offensive shirt that claims science is real to a trump rally  no matter how much of a bump he gets afterwards and no matter how many times he declares himself victorious  the one thing ted cruz has on the donald are his debating skills cruz isn t exactly a master  his shrill voice and the condescending look he gets on his face are enough for almost anyone to be willing to risk a night in jail for hauling off and punching him  at the end of the gop debates  however  cruz always got himself a nice little push in the polls  it s amazing that the smartest guy in the republican room ended up being the least likeable guy in washington  to call ted cruz smart in any other context is an insult to smart people cruz s big plan  then  is to challenge donald trump to another debate  he doesn t seem to be getting the memos  trump is the only candidate with a mathematical chance of a secure nomination  he s polling high in every major contest left  his worst case scenario seems to be if the rnc screws him from his nomination with a contested convention  in which case the republican party implodes anyway  the whole thing really has been glorious to watch the one thing cruz has going for him is the donald s over inflated ego  it may not allow trump to simply back down from a senseless debate that can serve no purpose to trump other than the loss of even more supporters  it s a noble move on cruz s part  bold even to suggest another debate this late in the game  unfortunately for him  his opponent has already kicked his political teeth down his throat and stands to gain nothing by accepting that  of course  won t stop ted cruz from trying  so hopefully there are a few days of good twitter name calling  that s far more interesting to cover than anything the gop buffoons are still yammering about featured image via joe raidle getty images
