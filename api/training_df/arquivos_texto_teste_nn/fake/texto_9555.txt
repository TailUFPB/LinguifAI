this summarization by peter flaherty  president of the national legal and policy center  of why the indictment of paul manafort actually exposes the truth about the dirty dealings of special prosecutor robert mueller  is brilliant and is a must read for anyone who cares to see what s really going on behind the curtain daily caller   more than anything else  the indictments of paul manafort and his partner rick gates demonstrate the fraudulent nature of special counsel robert mueller s investigation  the probe has little to do with russian interference in last year s election  instead  it is calculated to protect mueller and a cabal within the fbi and justice department who covered up crimes by hillary clinton because they believed it was likely that she would be elected president and once mueller and then his friend and successor james comey covered for hillary  they had to keep covering  there was a reason that mueller was so available when he was so swiftly appointed special counsel in may by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  the comey firing threatened to expose all that these same officials had swept under the rug  yes  rosenstein bit the bullet and drafted the memo that was the legal basis for firing comey  but it would be followed by appointing mueller in july  comey preemptively exonerated hillary despite her maintenance of a private email server and mishandling of classified material  by accusing her of being  extremely careless   he purposely distracted attention from the context of the emails  hillary and bill clinton operated an aggressive shakedown operation of domestic and foreign interests  many of which are unsavory and criminal  concealing the true nature of the operation was at least part of the clintons  motivation for the private server the outlines of the uranium one deal were not a secret  media outlets like the new york times reported on the u s  government approval of a partial sale of the canadian mining company to rosatom  a russian firm  while those who benefitted donated to the clinton foundation and paid bill clinton    for a single speech in moscow then came more detailed reports about how the fbi cracked the case of a major russian effort to penetrate the north american uranium industry through a host of illegal activities  but somehow the whole matter was slow walked and kept from u s  government officials who had to approve the uranium one deal  mueller and comey ultimately supervised the probe meanwhile  the fbi s email investigation was supervised by now fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  who has significant connections to the clintons through his wife jill mccabe  hillary headlined a fundraiser for a group supporting jill mccabe s campaign for the virginia state senate  as first reported in the wall street journal  the national legal and policy center subsequently exposed more clintonista support  including from then clinton foundation operative doug band who wrote a personal check for    the plot thickened last week when the bombshell hit that it was hillary s campaign and the democratic national committee that paid for the fusion gps dossier  reporters were chagrined to realize that they had been lied to repeatedly for months and months  hillary now claims that the first she heard of it was when the dossier memo was printed by buzzfeed in january  a likely lie  as long as this  what did hillary know and when did hillary know it  question is of no interest to mueller  his investigation has no credibility whatsoever  but therein lies the dilemma for mueller  a real probe of hillary would mean a review of his own actions and those of his colleagues  he s cornered mueller s strategy is clear  he has to rescue himself  comey  mccabe  rosenstein and others from their complicity in hillary s dealings with the russians  mueller is creating a diversion by going after manafort  the lowest of low hanging fruit  just about any inquiry into manafort s dealings over the years was sure to yield results the left and the leftist media are apoplectic over the possibility that they finally have trump in their crosshairs  the problem is after the media smoke has cleared  the truth is revealed about the manafort indictment  and the facts point to president trump having nothing to do with it  democrats would love nothing more than to see president trump fire special prosecutor robert mueller  as it would prove that he was guilty of the trump russian narrative the democrats and their allies in the media have been pushing since the night he soundly defeated hillary clinton in the election upset of the century  watch jay sekulow explain to rabid cnn host wolf blitzer that trump has nothing to do with either the announcement of the  indictments of paul manafort or campaign volunteer george papadopoulos
