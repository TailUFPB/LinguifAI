arizona speaker of the house david gowan  r  enacted a new policy to punish members of the press for the fact one of them published a story that exposed him for repeatedly violating state law the new rule states that any member of the press who wants to cover the legislature from the house floor has to undergo draconian background checks  including examinations of their criminal  civil  and even their driving records  it s absolutely insane that driving records  or other unimportant misdemeanors  can automatically disqualify a member of the press from being on the house floor for up to  years press members  so far  have refused to consent to these background checks  as a result  they have to now cover the proceedings from the balcony my view from the house today  floor privileges revoked after reporters declined to sign background check form  pic twitter com   alia beard rau   aliarau  april    usual  republicans want you to think that their use of the government to attack its own citizens is a good thing  gowan has tried to say that it s  all about safety  when justifying his childish actions   despite that there have been zero incidents in  at the arizona state house that would suggest a policy like this is necessary gowan actually invoked   to justify this garbage  there had never been an attack on   either  like that occurred either  before on our shore  but it did  source  arizona daily starright  we can t be too careful these days because they surprised us on    i m not sure you can make a more offensive comparison here is what caused all this ruckus  hank stephenson of the arizona capitol times ran a piece about gowan s use of a state vehicle during approximately a  day period  where he traveled   miles  some of the locations he traveled to were related to gowan s campaign for his election to congress  after the story ran  gowan was forced to reimburse the state    dollars and now he s currently under investigation for further misuse of public resources by the arizona attorney general it s been suggested that this entire charade was done just to get back at stephenson personally  who was convicted of trespassing after a bar fight a few years ago  the rule immediately screwed over this reporter in a very personal and retaliatory way  along with every other person who might have some issue with which the new rule is at odds the constitutionality of the new rule is to be determined  a statement by aclu of arizona said that the new rule might not be unlawful because it doesn t fully ban the press from the house  it only prevents them from being on the floor  it s a skirting of the constitution that might allow gowan to get his way  unfortunately featured image via flickr
