in the spirit of remaining at a middle school maturity level  marco rubio bit back at donald trump insulting him by  well  trying to insult him right back  however  his attempt at doing this was pretty damn pathetic rubio  while speaking at a campaign event in kennesaw  georgia  asked the crowd   you guys want to have a little fun today   rubio then pulls out his phone and begins to go after trump  he said  last night he was actually pretty calm after i punched him around a little bit  sure  if that s what you want to call that dismal debate performance  but please  go on  he s learning how to spell  i guess  but he s flying around on hair force one and tweeting  so here s the one tweet he put out  he put out a picture of me having makeup put on me at the debate  which is amazing me to me  that the guy with the worst spray tan in america is attacking me for putting on makeup  okay  here it comes  the line we ve all been waiting for  the best comeback in the history of comebacks  donald trump likes to sue people  he should sue whoever did that to his face  or not   marcorubio slams  realdonaldtrump   he s flying around on hair force one and tweeting  https   t co  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  february    comeback is very reminiscent of that seinfeld episode when george was trying to come up with a comeback to someone saying to him   the ocean called  and they re running out of shrimp   george s comeback was   well  the jerk store called  they re running out of you     it just doesn t quite work  and neither does the comeback by rubio  i mean  he tried  really hard  and it might even work since the average republican has the maturity level of a  year old  but no  rubio should really try harder  or be an adult and ignore trump s juvenile attacks  one thing is for sure  as scary as the republican race is  it sure is entertaining https   www youtube com watch v  image  twitter
