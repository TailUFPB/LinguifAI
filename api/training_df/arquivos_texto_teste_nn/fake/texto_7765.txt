as donald trump continues to hold steady at number one and win primary after primary  the gop establishment is getting really nervous that he may actually be their  candidate  they are so scared that a group of high ranking republican governors held an emergency conference call to discuss it on monday politico reported  trump s march to the nomination has set off a wave of anxiety across the republican party establishment as top officials weigh whether to endorse him   or denounce him as anathema to the party s values  reflecting that angst  on monday morning  new mexico gov  susana martinez and wisconsin gov  scott walker  the heads of the republican governors association  convened fellow governors for an unusual conference call to discuss how the primary was unfolding   and trump was a central topic of conversation  apparently during the conference call  kentucky gov  matt bevin asked new jersey gov  chris christie why he was supporting trump  christie  who has a long history of slamming trump  claimed that he know believes donald is the best man for the job  this is nonsense  of course  he just wanted to share some of trump s limelight because like trump  he is an opportunist and a liar the real estate mogul has been wreaking havoc on the gop since he entered the race  the party  which after the  presidential race  decided that they needed an image makeover saw trump destroy any chances of ever winning over minority voters  and in addition to his hatred for everyone who is not white  rich  or poorly educated  he has thumbed his nose at the establishment over and over  the reason many people think he has such an appeal with the gop base  other than their insane racism and bigotry  is because he is not  a real politician  this belief that he is not a politician is more proof of how ignorant the republican voter base really is  trump says whatever he thinks will make people vote for him and has a long record of flip flopping   like mitt romney in   but on steroids former republican national committee chairman and former florida senator  mel martinez has said that trump is  increasingly unpalatable   and said a majority of the party would resist him as the  presidential candidate  how that manifests itself i don t know  but i believe there is a sense by many  myself included  that he just cannot be the nominee   he said   so a convention scenario could begin to develop  while the gop isn t sure trump should be their candidate  americans have made it very clear that they have no interest in seeing him in the white house  even the conservative site red state recently published an article titled  a vote for trump is a vote for hillary clinton  why trump is a sure loser  get your popcorn ready  folks  this infighting is going to make the republican national convention very interesting this summer  and it s looking better and better for democrats in the fall  featured image via addicting info archives
