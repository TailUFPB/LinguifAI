bernie sanders has done plenty of things in his life  from civil rights activist to u s  senator and now to presidential candidate  bernie has always figured out a way to create a platform that allows him to advocate for issues that are important to america  what many of us didn t know was that while mayor of burlington  vermont  sanders was also a host of a cable access show nbc s late night host seth meyers reminded bernie of those days when he showed a reel of the former mayor out and about talking to constituents  meyers said  i want to ask you one last thing  if you were elected president  would you do what you did when you were mayor of burlington  vermont  and would you host a public access show  before you answer  we actually have footage of a show you hosted as mayor in burlington  watch video here of course  sanders couldn t keep a straight face and it was hilarious watching bernie introduce himself as dan rather in one of the clips or have an awkward but funny moment with one interviewee it would be great to see sanders go out into the public once in a while and do similar interviews with constituents if he becomes president of the united states  a proposition that is becoming more likely as of late as sanders has surged in the polls  winning many states to date featured image via video screenshot
