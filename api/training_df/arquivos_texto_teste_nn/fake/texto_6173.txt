democratic frontrunner hillary clinton had a couple of really enthusiastic supporters show up at her buena park  california rally on wednesday  in fact  they were so enthusiastic she had to stop her security team from throwing them out of the event because they decided to remove their shirts as security moved to escort the shirtless men out of her rally  one of them yelled   hillary  they re kicking us out because we don t have our shirts on  they re making us leave because we don t have shirts on   a laughing clinton responded by asking security to stop and saying  well  you know what  as long as they don t take anything else off  you know  you gotta make split decisions that s what leadership is all about  we are a big diverse country  ok  where was i  i gotta admit  it is a little distracting standing up here looking at them  so i m gonna look over this way  and i m gonna look over that way  i m gonna look back there  it was a great moment for clinton to show off the sense of humor a lot of people do not realize she has  the right wing often accuses her of being an ice queen  but she is actually very funny  her response also highlighted the vast differences between her campaign and that of republican nominee donald trump  the gop candidate s rallies are filled with violence and hate  while clinton s is filled with positivity  it s like night and day watch featured image via video screenshot
