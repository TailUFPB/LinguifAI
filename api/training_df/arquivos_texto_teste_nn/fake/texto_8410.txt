is it really possible to describe donald trump with just one word  certainly a few come to mind  try and pick just one  though  which one comes to mind first the conservative media outlet the blaze trolled a bernie sanders event recently and posted a video of bernie supporters describing both bernie and donald trump with just one word  it wasn t exactly a hit piece  all of sanders supporters responding enthusiastically for their candidate while completely lambasting trump  not much news there  all it did was tell us what we already know  bernie supporters don t exactly think trump is all that amazing first  here are the words most commonly used to depict bernie sanders  inspirational  consistent  amazing  awesome  equality  honest  logical  compare that to what they think of trump  disgusting  dishonest    shole  racist  bigot  evil   insane  sounds about right it really just looks like the blaze likes bernie sanders events  maybe they re  feelingthebern  too  they seem to go there a lot  although  they didn t particularly like a video of sanders mocking republicans  family values  during a speech he gave in iowa on friday here s what bernie had to say about republican s so called values  they love families  can t stop talking about families  when republicans talk about family values what they are saying is that no woman in this room in this country  should have the right to control their own body  i disagree  the race is tight and it s anybody s guess as to who will win iowa  bernie s campaign is counting on younger voters to help win the day for him   he does have far more of them than any other candidate from either party  after all  when these very same voters get older there will be a dramatic paradigm shift to the left on issues   but as of right now it s not clear if the younger vote will help bernie defeat hillary  perhaps it s fitting that we get more of their opinions to see where this country is heading  though  it certainly isn t in the way of donald trump featured image from screen capture
