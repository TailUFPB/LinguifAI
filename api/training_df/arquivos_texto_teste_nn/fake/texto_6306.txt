president obama is currently in his final year as commander in chief while donald trump is the presumptive nominee of the republican party   percent of women hold an unfavorable view of donald trump while  percent of women voted for president obama in   and it s not hard to see why an incredible video by buzzfeed compares how president obama has treated women versus how donald trump has treated women while president obama has focused on making sure women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys and appreciates the role that women have played in making this nation strong  donald trump objectifies women  judges them based on their looks  and considers them to be baby makers who can be cast aside for a different woman the video begins with trump telling celebrity apprentice contestant brande roderick that she  must be a pretty picture  you dropping to your knees  president obama is then shown talking about his objection to his daughters not being able to have the same opportunities as somebody s sons   that s unacceptable   he tells the audience then trump is shown telling a female reporter that she wouldn t have a job if she wasn t beautiful at the congressional black caucus foundation  president obama spoke of how that we have to speak louder than the  voices telling our girls that they re not good enough  that they ve got to look a certain way  or they gotta act a certain way  it continues this way throughout the video  trump makes a negative remark about women while president obama praises women and fights for their future here s the video via facebook that s really the choice we face in   do we want to elect a president who will fight for women or do we want trump  a man who has shown utter contempt for women and only notices them if they look like a super model  because if we want a president who respects and fights for women like president obama  the logical choice this november would be whichever democrat ends up on the ticket opposite trump hillary clinton is taking aim at history as she seeks to become the first female president of the united states   human rights are women s rights  and women s rights are human rights   she said at the u n   world conference on women plenary session in    let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely   and the right to be heard  we need to understand that there is no formula for how women should lead their lives   she continued   that is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family  every woman deserves the chance to realize her god given potential  here s the video of her full speech via youtube bernie sanders is also pursuing the presidency  his chances at capturing the nomination are waning but should he win the nomination he would also be a good choice for women in november like clinton  sanders has fought for women s rights throughout his career  as the longtime senator from vermont  sanders has made women s issues a major part of his policy agenda sanders explained his efforts to elevate women to the washington post in september  you re looking at somebody who s made a cornerstone  a key part of my campaign  the need for at least three months of family and medical leave  somebody who is fighting to raise the minimum wage over a two year period to   an hour  which will benefit everybody  but women actually more than men  somebody who regards it as enormously important that we fight for pay equity for women  somebody who believes that our child care system is a disaster today and that we need to have the best childcare pre k system in the world  making it universal and affordable so i think if people look at my record  i think they will see somebody who has had a lifelong record of support for the women s movement and women s rights  like clinton  sanders also supports a woman s right to choose  when you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body  that s extremism   he wrote on twitter   let s say it loud and clear  women control their bodies  not the government  in short  the contrast between trump and the democratic party couldn t be more clear  trump is a serial womanizer who constantly spews despicable sexist remarks that should automatically disqualify him from running for president  but so far  conservatives seem to have no problem with trump s anti women beliefs and that is why ads like the one below will continue to haunt trump s campaign democratic candidates  meanwhile  want women to be equal and be treated with respect and dignity just like president obama has been pushing for over the last eight years  and that s why we need another eight years or more of a democrat in the white house featured image via screenshot
