sorry republicans  but your newest vast right wing conspiracy against democratic frontrunner hillary clinton has officially fallen flat  the newest rounds of interrogations began in the fruitless  email gate  against the former secretary of state  and as expected  she has not been found to have engaged in any criminal wrongdoing or willful violation of the law according to cnn the interviews  we re told  are focused on whether classified information was mishandled  and the security of the server  so far officials tell us  no  there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing at this point in the investigation  but  again  the investigation is not over yes  the investigation is not over  but it certainly isn t going anywhere  after poring though thousands of documents  countless interviews with aides including clinton s personal assistant huma abedin  and immunity offers on the table cnn has previously reported that another former clinton employee  bryan pagliano  who helped set up the server has provided documents and other materials as well as interviews to the fbi  under an immunity agreement  fbi officials overseeing the probe now expect to complete their work in the next few weeks and then turn over the findings to the justice department  which will make a final decision on whether to bring charges against anyone there still has not been a smoking gun  and like every other  scandal  in clinton s life  there won t be  and considering that the justice department has been aiding the fbi in the investigation  and the fbi has turned up nothing  it s highly improbable the doj will even though it isn t over  cnn s pamela brown has word that it will be wrapping up soon  once a date to interview hillary clinton is scheduled and done in secret  as to not attract any unnecessary media scrutiny  however  due to clinton s crunched campaign schedule  the fbi is having a hard time sitting the frontrunner down for said interview donald trump and other republicans  and even some left wing voters  are anxious to see clinton go down for something as silly as emails  however  it isn t going  happen  time to focus on the issues featured image joe readle getty images
