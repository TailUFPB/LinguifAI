throughout his entire presidential campaign  donald trump has whined about the media  he calls reporters  dishonest   tells the thousands of low information voters who flock to his rallies that the press hates him and therefore they should hate the press  he points to the press pit at these events and tells his supporters to yell at them and every single time he does an interview he complains that someone somewhere in the world of media  even right wing media  is treating him  unfairly   on tuesday  cnn s s e  cupp slammed the presidential candidate for his treatment of the media and said that he is  fundamentally confused about the roll of free press  during a press conference about his  support  of veteran s groups on tuesday  trump threw another hissy fit about reporters and said that they are being  nasty  and not giving him credit for giving money to vets  cupp responded to his whining  saying  when you re talking about suing journalists for doing their job  he s not saying that we re getting the story wrong  we re actually doing our job asking questions about where this money went that s the job of the press  he actually said in this press conference today  i wish you d just say thank you  thank me for   that s not the role of the media  to thank the presidential nominee for raising money  it s not the job of the media to heap praise upon him  so i just think that he s fundamentally very confused about the role of free press     secupp  trump says he wished the press would just say thank you  that s not the role of the media  https   t co   the situation room   cnnsitroom  may    disagree  i think trump is very aware of the role of the free press  but he doesn t want his supporters to be aware of it  it is no secret that the people who support the billionaire are not the brightest crayons in the box  trump has even talked about how much he loves his  poorly educated voters   he needs to convince these people to distrust the press because then they will just tune out the stories that would sink his candidacy  he needs them to ignore the shadiness around the money he supposedly raised for veterans  he needs them to ignore the trump university story and how he swindled people out of their money  he needs them to ignore every single bad report that they may see on the news in the coming months  it is the easiest way to lead his sheep to slaughter trump may be a bombastic  racist  lying asshole  but he isn t stupid   and he is playing his supporters like a fiddle featured image via video screenshot
