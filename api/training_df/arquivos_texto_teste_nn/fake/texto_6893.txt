recently  north carolina passed dangerous legislation that blocked anti discrimination ordinances  many have expressed fears that the new legislation  which arose in response to the city of charlotte taking steps to ensure that the lgbt community would enjoy equal protection under the law  would embolden the more extreme segments of the alleged  christian  population to act out their hateful fantasies  unfortunately  any who feared this may be the case were correct on tuesday  one group of christian bigots proved the need to establish anti discrimination laws when they left a chilling note for a lesbian waitress at a charlotte restaurant   a death threat in the form of a bible verse alexandra judd  a waitress at zada janes  says that the group of stand up  god fearing individuals showed their christian love by leaving the disturbing note in lieu of a tip  instead of     the customary   tip on a   order  they simply wrote  lev     this verse is special among religious bigots  and it is often used to allow them to express their hatred and even threaten people while  excusing their actions by claiming they are simply exercising their first amendment right to religious expression  if a man also lie with mankind  as he lieth with a woman  both of them have committed an abomination   the verse reads   they shall surely be put to death  their blood shall be upon them  in other words  the group of loving  christians  told the waitress she should be executed   something that might land anyone else in jail if they said that sort of thing to a random person on the street  but  since they were just expressing their  religious freedom   this sort of horrific statement typically gets a pass in our society  praying for you   the christians added at the bottom   a statement that often accompanies this sort of violent and hateful expression  i never expected a hateful gesture like this   judd said   i ve had a guest leave me a pamphlet to their church as a tip one time  but i didn t feel as if they were being hateful towards me  the ladies that came in were very rude  and would hardly talk to me   but i never expected this  i ve heard of people leaving fake money  or writing funny stuff in the tip spot of a check but never believed it would happen to me  in the way that it did   she added christians often leave fake   bills  and other denominations  to trick servers into thinking they have received a great tip  when the server unfolds the bill  he or she discovers a bible verse  this is horrible  especially given the low wages in the service industry and the unfortunate fact that waitstaff often depend on tips to survive  but nor nearly as bad as a thinly veiled death threat despite what could easily be called a hate crime if north carolina did not enact legislation to protect the faithful who choose to do this sort of thing  judd remains resilient  i don t care what anyone says  this is the most disrespectful thing you can do   she wrote on facebook   don t pray for me darling  i have everything i could possibly want and need in my life  unfortunately  the bigot who left that note is severely lacking something in her life   love for her fellow humans  it is unclear if this  christian  will act on her threat  but we hope not featured image via screengrab
