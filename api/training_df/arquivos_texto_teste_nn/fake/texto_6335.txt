in response to the department of justice s guidelines preventing school officials from demanding that students prove their gender identity to use a restroom  franklin graham took to facebook to whine and call upon christians to die fighting transgender protections and president obama graham  also known as billy graham s demon spawn  posted a lengthy message on his facebook page on sunday night asking conservative christians to  take a bullet  for their beliefs instead of following the law  what would you take a bullet for   graham asked   what are the principles and beliefs that you would not compromise under any circumstances  even if it meant putting your life on the line  and of course  that led into a bible story featuring christians martyring themselves king nebuchadnezzar who reigned over babylon issued a decree that everyone worship the golden image he had made  three men who knew the one true and living god  refused to worship the king s idol their names were shadrach  meshach  and abednego  the king told them   but if you do not worship  you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace   here is their bold reply  o nebuchadnezzar  we have no need to answer you in this matter  if that is the case  our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace  and he will deliver us from your hand  o king  but if not  let it be known to you  o king  that we do not serve your gods  nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up   daniel     shadrach  meshach  and abednego stood firm in obedience and faithfulness  they stood up for god s truth  they stood up for their faith  and they didn t waiver  even when it meant putting their very lives at risk and finally  graham concluded by asking christians to martyr themselves now i want to call on every christian and every pastor to stand firm like these patriarchs of old and not bow to the secular  increasingly godless culture in which we live even when  not if  we re criticized  mocked  and labeled intolerant  the god of the old testament that delivered shadrach  meshach  and abednego from their fiery execution is the same god today and he is still more than able to save  will you stand against ungodliness  what are you willing to take a bullet for here s the full post via facebook this kind of rhetoric sounds awfully familiar  doesn t it  oh yeah  it s what islamic extremists tell their followers right before they strap bombs to their bodies and blow themselves up in the name of allah  except this time  it s an old white male  christian  leader saying it to christians in america  proving once again that fundamentalist christians are exactly the same as their islamic counterparts featured image youtube
