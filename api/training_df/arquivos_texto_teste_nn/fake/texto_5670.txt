members of the federal elections commission  fec  determined that fox news channel violated the law when they put together the republican presidential debates earlier in the year due to the ridiculous number of candidates in the race    at one point   fox decided to alter the debate that had been scheduled for august  of last year  breaking it up into two tiers with the higher polling candidates featured in prime time while the remaining seven relegated to the lesser watched  kiddie table  debate it was at that debate where donald trump began to decimate the republican field and received hundreds of hours of free advertising from fox during the debate and in the follow up coverage pointing out the disparity  a complaint was filed with the fec and several of the members of the board determined fox had actually broken the law a complaint subsequently was filed with the fec claiming those changes were tantamount to an illegal corporate contribution to the candidates on stage foxnews com is told that after consideration  three commissioners   ellen weintraub  ann ravel  and steven walther   determined the network had made such an illegal contribution to the seven candidates invited to the first debate the case ended on a split   vote  resulting in no action  three commissioners concluded fox news violated election law  two of the democratic commissioners went a step further and voted to penalize the network  but because any enforcement action requires four votes  the case was dismissed fox escaped penalty because of the partisan gridlock on the commission but their boost to trump during the primaries  he was the most featured candidate on the network by a wide margin  shows what it takes to win the race on the right while fox has been able to capitalize on trump thanks to the boost to the network s ratings  the same is true at cnn   the strategy may backfire for the republican party  unlike other candidates who might be performing better in head to head matchups against hillary clinton at this point in the campaign  trump is losing by double digits in some polls  while poll aggregates also show him losing by a larger margin than mitt romney did in  featured image via flickr
