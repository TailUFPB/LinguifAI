there are times i want to just get up from my computer  walk out of my apartment  find a cave in the woods and live there until the human race inevitably wipes itself out  after reading about this creation scientist  expert s  scientific bat shit insane  theory  about how stonehenge was built  i was two miles down the road before deciding it would just be easier to sit at home and wait for the end to come in the meantime  i will torment you with the following televangelist jim bakker invited dr  dennis lindsay on to his program on wednesday to discuss lindsay s latest discovery in the realm of creation science  the truth behind stonehenge hold on to your hats  stonehenge  it turns out  was built by giants who were created by satan lindsay told bakker that these giants were tools of the devil  who seeks to destroy israel because  he s out to destroy god s creation and his whole plan of redemption and contaminate the human race  yes  i just deliberately inflicted permanent brain damage on you  no  you will never get those brain cells back  they re gone  dead  burned out for all time after making my eyes bleed with this  it occurs to me that creationists hate human achievement  the very idea that primitive humans could accomplish the wonders of stonehenge or the pyramids of egypt infuriates them  especially if they occurred before or independent of christianity  these bible humping freaks have a startlingly low opinion of humanity and would prefer to believe that giants and demons were responsible instead of human ingenuity and genius oh  and just to get in a bit of muslim bashing  because of course   he referred to the mosque on the temple mount  one of the most holy sites in islam  as a  squatter s hut  because why stop at being a douche when you can go all the way to  raging dickhead  here s the imbecilic video via right wing watch the only upside to this entire story is that it made me want to listen to they might be giants so there s that featured image via screen capture
