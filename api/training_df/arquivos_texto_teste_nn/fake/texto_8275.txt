one of the most critical issues facing the united states is the role that big money plays in financing elections  this has been a major issue that has been discussed by all democratic primary candidates so far in the election  during an interview with cnn s jake tapper on the state of the union  bernie sanders clarified some of the language he has used during his campaign so far bernie sanders has made campaign finance reform a major part of his platform  in fact  he has even eschewed financial support from super pacs  this has led to some very weak criticisms from the right wing  who say that he has taken money from groups like the national nurses union  which has endorsed him  those criticisms are absurd  and only seem to show that they do not understand the issue  nor the type of support that sanders is receiving from the union during the interview  sanders says that money is controlling washington  studies suggest that this is partly true  a well known study done by princeton showed that the united states  to a large degree is a no longer a democracy  but rather an oligarchy  they note that the whittling away of democracy in the united states has been going on since the  s  the rise of the super pac  plus the citizen s united supreme court decision that has lead to the flooding of money into elections  is simply the next stage of cancer that is the collusion between government and corporation the united states has a long history of money  big and small  creeping into elections  once people decide that they have had enough  they send that corrupting influence into remission  it just so happens that this issue is reaching a boiling point right now  as are so many other issues you can watch the interview  below  featured image from video screenshot via youtube
