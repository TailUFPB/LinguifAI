is this just one more case of an activist judge too blinded by his hate for trump to deliver the justice he took an oath to uphold  it was announced yesterday that army sgt  bowe bergdahl  who walked away from his post in afghanistan and triggered a search that left some of his comrades severely wounded  was spared a prison sentence by a military judge friday in what president donald trump blasted as a  complete and total disgrace  the judge gave no explanation of how he arrived at his decision  but he reviewed evidence that included the five years bergdahl was held captive by the taliban and the wounds suffered by troops who searched for him  including one who now uses a wheelchair and cannot speak   chicago tribunewhen candidate donald trump told a crowd that army sgt  bowe bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in afghanistan  the crowd cheered we re tired of sgt  bergdahl  who s a traitor  a no good traitor  who should have been executed   trump said to cheers at a rowdy rally inside a packed las vegas theater at the casino hotel treasure island  thirty years ago   trump added   he would have been shot  before everyone starts calling trump  heartless  or an  idiot   perhaps they should first familiarize themselves with our laws about americans who commit treason whoever  owing allegiance to the united states  levies war against them or adheres to their enemies  giving them aid and comfort within the united states or elsewhere  is guilty of treason and shall suffer death  or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but

criticism of sgt  bowe bergdahl  who walked off his army post in afghanistan in  and was captured by the taliban  will weigh in favor of a lighter sentence for the sergeant  a military judge said on monday  i will consider the president s comments as mitigation evidence as i arrive at an appropriate sentence   the judge  col  jeffery r  nance of the army  said during a hearing at fort bragg  the judge is expected to sentence sergeant bergdahl in the next few weeks the judge rejected a request that he dismiss the case or cap the length of the sentence on the grounds that the president s comments had precluded a fair hearing  the judge said he had not been influenced by the remarks and that the public s confidence in the military justice system had not been undermined sergeant bergdahl faces up to life imprisonment  he pleaded guilty on oct   to desertion and endangering the troops who were sent to search for him he testified on monday that he deeply regretted that people  suffered because of my bad choices  colonel nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution  including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for sergeant bergdahl  as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military s overall war effort in afghanistan anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so

in minutes  half the team had been wounded  sergeant walters turned to see  a cloud of blood  spraying from the head of sergeant allen  i started treating his wounds  talking to him  telling him to hang on   sergeant walters said the battle subsided only after f  fighter jets and apache helicopters arrived overhead only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that  taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire  my words can t take away what people have been through   sergeant bergdahl told the
