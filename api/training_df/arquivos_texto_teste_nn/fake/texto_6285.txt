when you live in a state that thinks the worst things about their school system is open bathrooms and the fact that textbooks fail to show jesus riding a dinosaur  it s not surprising that that state s republican party platform would fail to pass a  grade grammar test well  it wasn t a test  so to speak  but when the republican party released their platform  along with its official stance against all things gay  the tiniest of grammar fails seemed to indicate that most texans are gay  grammar nerds  judge for yourselves homosexuality   homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by god in the bible  recognized by our nations founders  and shared by the majority of texans we ll get to the fact that this is a reprehensible and probably unconstitutional platform in a moment  but for now  let s laugh the controversy is over the very last comma  there s a grammatical argument going on   said rudy oeftering  vice president of the lgbt republican group metroplex republicans  who brought the issue to my attention   some are insisting the use of commas in the  homosexuality  plank in the platform could be interpreted as saying that the founders and the majority of texans are gay  source  the new civil rights movementeven if we let that slide  texans should be embarrassed at how poorly written the sentence is to begin with needless to say  it s a poorly written sentence in general  either  truths  should be singular or  has  should be  have   and  nations  lacks a possessive apostrophe they should be  but anyone who s ever been subjected to republicans on social media knows that things can get so much worse twitter had fun with the texas gop  though also  the texas gop platform would require caitlyn jenner and laura jane grace to use men s restrooms  which seems  problematic   daveweigel   daveweigel  may    the truth is revealed by the texas gop committee  texasgop  the majority of texans are homosexuals  https   t co   pc godless liberal   theanticruz  may      gregabbotttx if mike smith is the face of the  texasgop then they are in trouble  grammar  spelling  stopsayingthug  john   johnspolitics  july    only this was the worst thing about the texas gop platform  they want to abolish the  amendment of the constitution  which allows citizens to vote for their senators  the legislature wants to do it instead they want to nullify any laws that they think are unconstitutional  this amounts to succession  they also want to defund and abolish the majority of government agencies and anything that might have a chance of saving the environment  but they do want a strong military to kill all the mooslims  oh  and they want the gold standard back by now  we re used to that anti government stuff from petulant texans  but the plank on homosexuality is the only one that addresses people directly  here s the entire paragraph  see if it doesn t make you throw up in your mouth a little  homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by god in the bible  recognized by our nation s founders  and shared by the majority of texans  homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable alternative lifestyle  in public policy  nor should family be redefined to include homosexual couples  we oppose the granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior  regardless of state of origin  we oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith  conviction  or belief in traditional values  source  esquireit doesn t take a deep reading between the lines to see that this platform is a warning to all lgbt people to stay in the closet or risk harassment and bullying  without penalty  from anyone who hides behind the bible featured image via david mcnew getty images
