trump s latest fiasco is so bad that it s bleeding over into other gop presidential campaigns  not only that  but there s every reason to think this could land on house and senate republicans in  as well  you can see the perfect example of it already happening in the videos below it all started with trump saying  during a town hall interview with chris matthews  that he feels there should be a punishment for women who get abortions  this is how he suggests you enforce a theoretical law that would either ban abortion altogether or punish certain abortions that happen outside of limitations like rape and incest the backlash to this came swiftly from pro and anti abortion advocates alike  despite both sides disavowing it  though  the damage to republicans has already been done  now  republicans other than trump   ones who bragged hugely about how they would do everything they can to ban abortion in an effort to out pro life each other   are being asked a very uncomfortable question while the cameras are rolling   what kind of punishments would you seek for women who get abortions  here is the first of two reasons why this might be the worst thing to happen to the republican party since trump   johnkasich reacts to trump s abortion comments   of course  women shouldn t be punished  for having an abortion https   t co blyanpvgoe  msnbc   msnbc  march     john kasich is the  grown up  in the room and he can t even answer the freakin  question properly   how would you punish women  is not answered by  there s exceptions for rape   unless you think literally every pregnancy is caused by rape in america  which i doubt he does  and  admitting you wouldn t punish them is going to political suicide but wait  it gets even worse here is how it will go down  republican voters finally heard a republican presidential candidate say they would actually go after women who get abortions with criminal penalties   this is the answer to their prayers   literally  now the smell of blood is in the air and republicans will not take no for an answer to the question of  will you punish women who get abortions  below is the second reason and a perfect example of the sh tstorm that trump has started trump may have single handedly taken the entire pro life movement to a place from where it won t easily be able to recover  logically speaking  it s difficult to ban a thing without criminal penalties associated with violating the ban  republican voters want sooooo badly for there to be criminal penalties for women who  murder babies  along with the doctors and whoever else they can blame for it  the logical outcome of this is obvious in the space of one day being  pro life  was made uncool for republicans  now you need to be  pro punishment  to satisfy your rabid voter base  bravo donald  you just helped democrats more than you will ever know featured image via youtube screen capture featured image via video screen capture
