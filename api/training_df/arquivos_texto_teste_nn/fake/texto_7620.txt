when thinking about who you d likely want as the next president of the united states  one would probably think of someone who is well versed in policy and leadership  someone with a proven record of legislative success  someone who you wouldn t be embarrassed of representing you and your interests around the globe  unfortunately  when watching the gop debates  you re not going to find any of those qualities  at least amongst the front runners at the most recent debate  the subject of  hand  size was literally brought up  and of course   hand size  is actually the size of their dicks  because of course that s what these guys would be talking about  noticing how utterly ridiculous not only bringing this subject up is  but also finding it humorous that donald trump in particular took such offense in what appears to be major overcompensation  ellen degeneres of the ellen show showed us a better interpretation of what his  hand size  actually may be in a modified clip of the most recent debate  ellen had trump s hands photoshopped into tiny little baby hands  he still waved them around like he has something to prove  but this time  it was seemingly far more accurate truth be told  we don t need a person obsessed with proving how  large  or  great  they personally are  we don t need someone who uses  i    me   or  my  every other sentence  running for president is running to serve the citizens of the united states  not yourself  it s not about  being the best   it s about making sure the nation works well for all we need someone who can lead the nation  donald trump is not that person watch the hilarity from the ellen show here featured image via image screen capture
