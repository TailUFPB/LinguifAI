the more a trump run for the white house as a major party candidate sinks in  the more his blatant incompetence stands out  in this recent interview with greta van susteren  trump is discussing possibilities for the vice presidency  which trump has announced will be unveiled at the gop convention  the convention  already guaranteed to be the circus the sideshows have been building up to  will definitely have the highest viewer ratings of all time  trump then hints that his vp pick will most likely be a person with a political background because he believes passing legislation is more important than using executive orders to get things done then it happened  the thing that will bring donald trump to his knees  he pretended to know what he was talking about and said something incredibly stupid  as the race goes on  more people with a little bit of knowledge about something are going to hear something like this and realize immediately that it s amazing that donald trump ever graduated high school  he s a showman who built a movement of stupidity on social media and reality television  his remarks to van susteren about executive orders prove that he is completely incompetent to hold the office that issues them   we re not gonna do the executive order thing like obama  he couldn t get anything passed you re not gonna do executive orders   asked van stern   no executive orders  well  we ll see   says trump    it depends on what  but president obama has been signing a lot of executive orders nobody s ever heard of an executive order before  i mean  i know bush signed them and other people have signed them  but all of a sudden it s like this major event to get things done  it would be nice to go back to the old fashioned way   it s called passing legislation  having people get together to pass legislation  you can just hear joe pesci doing a scene from goodfellas   hey  yo what the hell is dis  zecutive order bullsh t  at ain t the way we do things in hell s kitchen   it s ridiculous  president obama and a team of lawyers combed the laws and precedents of our country  being fully qualified and empowered to do so  and imposed directives to the agencies under the purview of the executive branch  like the ins  as any chief executive of any company would do to those under him  when the president signs an executive order it doesn t become a law  it becomes the current policy of the federal government in its own dealings that certainly can have a profound effect on shaping federal law  as it sends a profound statement  but as for the bulk of executive orders  they cover the mundane to the ridiculous and have been signed by every single united states president  president obama has signed fewer than either of the bush buffoons or uncle ronny reagan  donald trump doesn t even need to be prompted to palin himself  he just does it by complete instinct at this point
