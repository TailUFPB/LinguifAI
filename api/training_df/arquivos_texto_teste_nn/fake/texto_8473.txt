fox news went completely predictable in opening tonight s republican debate  megyn kelly addressed  the elephant not in the room   asking ted cruz to comment on donald trump s absence  after some sleazy pandering to the people of iowa  cruz slung some mud at trump with the kind of swagger and confidence of a boxer talking about his opponent at a press conference in his absence cruz got a nice chuckle from the crowd  and while his comments were witty  they were delivered by that screeching  whiny little voice through those annoying pursed lips  his egotistical little moment would probably have been smacked down with  you re not going to make america great  or something equally as clever juvenile had trump been there it was a fitting opening for the circus that was sure to come as another  hours of hate and fear was sold to the republican base  bravo  senator  you managed to be responsible for the only  seconds of the debacle worth watching watch ted cruz take down donald trump below feature image via file photo
