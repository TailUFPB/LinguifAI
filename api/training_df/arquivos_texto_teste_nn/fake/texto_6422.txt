brian cornell  the ceo of the target chain of stores  is not backing down to the demands of the religious right  the chain prompted backlash from the far right after it said it would allow people to use whichever bathroom in its stores that correspond to their gender identity conservatives  including national figures like senator ted cruz  insisted that somehow sexual predators would take the store s policy to be a green light for assaults on women and young girls  the idea that this would happen is a complete myth  but has been used to pass anti transgender laws in states like north carolina and mississippi when target announced their policy  some figures on the religious right called for the store to be boycotted until they changed their minds  while others have engaged in weird protests  blocking access to target bathrooms in an interview with cnbc  cornell stood his ground  we took a stance  and were going to continue to embrace our belief of diversity and inclusion and just how important that is to our company   cornell said he also pointed out that much of the anti transgender sentiment on the right is similar to racist claims from the recent past cornell said target is familiar with choosing to stand on the right side of social issues  decades ago  target was one of the first major companies to cast black models in its ads  provoking similar backlash  he said  we had a lot of tough feedback   cornell said   but sitting here today  i know we made the right decision  recent polls have shown that the rabid anti transgender sentiment is a minority of people  most americans are open and welcoming  and believe that the government really shouldn t have a role in policing which restroom people go to  some might call that big government  as a sign of just how out of touch the  religious  right is here  several mega corporations have pulled their money from states with anti transgender laws  echoing the boycotts that rose up after some states passed anti gay  religious freedom  laws  it doesn t pay to be a bigot in america anymore  at least not like it used to featured image via youtube
