donald trump lost his temper on cnn when jake tapper asked him to be a leader and tone down the violent rhetoric of his campaign on sunday  trump appeared on cnn and was immediately confronted by tapper about how the republican front runner has incited violence during his rallies that have led to his supporters carrying out vicious attacks against non white protesters last week  an old white trump supporter sucker punched a young black man during a rally in north carolina and suggested he and friends would kill him if he shows up to another rally during the same rally  yet another white trump supporter yelled obscenities at a black man and slapped him both incidents were caught on video and neither of the white men were arrested or kicked out of the rally at the time and since then  trump rallies have only gotten worse as rallies in st  louis and chicago nearly turned into race wars but trump refused to tone his rhetoric down on sunday  insisting that he was the victim and that his supporters are peaceful people who love america  he also accused bernie sanders of sending his supporters to disrupt the rallies and claimed that he hasn t incited violence at all even though he has been caught on tape doing exactly that when tapper tried to convince trump to be a real leader and stop inciting violence  trump became snippy tapper   people are getting hurt and people are actually concerned that somebody might get seriously  seriously injured  you are not taking down the temperature  you are  in the views of many of your fellow republicans  making things worse  inciting  encouraging violence  and you re a leader  sir  you re the front runner in the republican party  trump   excuse me  excuse me  my fellow republicans are running against me  they are losing bigly  the donald then proceeded to lose his temper by nastily attacking his opponents and accusing tapper of not covering his campaign rallies truthfully  yelling over tapper and interrupting him while bashing cnn and claiming that  zero  people have been injured at his rallies when tapper could actually get a word in  he once again asked trump to dial back his rhetoric for the sake of the country  trump responded that tapper should be more accurate in his reporting tapper   i would just ask as a fellow american if you could consider whether or not dialing down the temperature  might be a healthier thing  both for your campaign and for the nation the nation at large  trump   well  you should report it right because we ve had no injuries at my events  so  you know  do what you have to do  here s the video via youtube clearly  trump is lying when he says nobody has been injured at his rallies  there are countless videos of protesters being roughed up or flat out assaulted by his supporters as trump eggs them on  as we get closer and closer to the nomination  trump has become more and more dangerous as his rallies have basically become full blown klan and neo nazi rallies where white racists feel right at home  what once sounded like a joke campaign has now become america s worst nightmare and it isn t over yet featured image via screen capture
