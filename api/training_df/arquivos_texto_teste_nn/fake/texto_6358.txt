if donald trump becomes president  you better prepare for world war iii  because if republicans have their way  their presumptive nominee will have unprecedented power to wage war across the globe without restrictions from congress throughout his campaign for the presidency  donald trump has bragged that he  wants to have a much stronger military  so strong that nobody is going to mess with us   of course  that means increased military spending that is completely unnecessary because we already have the top military in the world and we spend more on our military than china  russia  saudi arabia  france  england  india  and germany combined  in fact  we could slash our military spending in half and would still spend more than any other nation graph courtesy of peter g  peterson foundationbut republicans are gunning to keep military spending at monstrous levels and they are willing to give trump unprecedented and unlimited war power earlier this year  senate republicans introduced a new authorization for use of military force that would authorize presidents to wage war anywhere anytime without having to ask congress for a declaration of war as the constitution requires according to huffington post  would give the president new authority to take action against the militant group also known as isis or isil  it wouldn t put any limits on the duration  geography or use of u s  ground combat troops in the war  or on the means by which the u s  military could act  it also would keep in place a broad aumf from  that never expired and that allows the president to take military action against anyone  anywhere  connected to the terrorists behind the   attacks in other words  donald trump would have complete power to go to war whenever he wants against whomever he wants and republican lawmakers are just fine with that because they don t want the responsibility of making war decisions  i don t like the idea of telling a commander in chief they can t go where isil goes  they re limited by time  geography and means   south carolina senator lindsey graham said   if i don t like the time  geography or means  i can cut off funding  alabama gop rep  mike rogers thinks donald trump would  be an improvement  over president obama  who has used diplomacy effectively in his foreign policy agenda while limiting his own war strategy to air strikes and predator drone strikes rather than sending thousands of american troops to war south carolina gop rep  joe wilson thinks  we need to finish what we started   and he is totally okay with donald trump controlling the military because he suggested trump will also try to work with the terrorists  too senator chuck grassley said he would comfortable with trump as long as he  has a plan   and arizona gop rep  trent franks wants trump to  advocate the maintenance and strength of a military capable of dealing with the growing threats to freedom this world faces  and  dismiss the practice of mr  obama of emboldening our enemies and disheartening our friends  that s basically code meaning that trump should rip up the nuclear deal with iran to reduce their nuclear material and attack them instead even though the deal is working trump has already declared his disapproval of the deal  he also said in  that america should use  any and all means necessary  to stop iran s nuclear program  which includes military force republicans are already itching for a war against iran  a president trump could give them one unilaterally trump has also suggested in his book the america we deserve that he would use force against north korea  which would guarantee a new korean war   north korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice  i would let pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one ronald reagan delivered to ghadhafi in   i don t think anybody is going to accuse me of tiptoeing through the issues or tap dancing around them either  who else in public life has called for a pre emptive strike on north korea trump has also not been secretive about the fact that he wants to bring back the use of torture and commit war crimes against civilian populations in the effort to defeat terrorists that s scary enough  but consider this as president  donald trump would also have control over the nation s nuclear arsenal  and he has already refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in europe and the middle east in short  a president trump could usher in a nuclear armageddon and congress has absolutely no problem with this if trump somehow defeats hillary clinton in november and republicans retain control of the senate and the house  we could see world war iii as the thin skinned businessman in the white house responds to the smallest of slights or republican prodding with military strikes that could spill the blood of thousands of american soldiers and put the country further into debt that is what is at stake in this election so let s hope people start taking this seriously featured image via flickr
