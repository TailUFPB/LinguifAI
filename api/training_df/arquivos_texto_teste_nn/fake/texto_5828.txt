donald trump s response to the horrific massacre in orlando   the worst in american history   was nothing short of disgraceful  instead of expressing condolences  he instead congratulated himself on being right about muslims and used the tragedy as an opportunity to double down on his bigoted plan to ban muslims from the united states  hbo s host of real time  bill maher  wasted no time in ripping trump a new one on that  and took it a step further and told his viewers what we all already know  donald trump is not just an offensive blowhard  he s also an amazing narcissist  maher began with trump s racist attacks on judge gonzalo curiel  who is  presiding over his trump university case  the judge thing looked selfish  there is no constituency for trump university except for donald trump  and then the first thing out of his mouth after orlando was   i was right   he looks like what he is   a narcissist  one of maher s panel members  business insider senior editor josh barro  pointed out that the american people have shown better sense than we realize  when it comes to trump s ridiculously offensive twitter brag regarding orlando  he continued  it turns out americans don t like blatantly racist attacks on the judiciary that also signal that a president might use his own power to support his businesses and defeat his political opponents through untoward things  and then the response to the shooting  i think there had been this idea that if there was terrorism that it would be good for trump  bill maher went so far as to say that this week ended trump s white house ambitions  i see it as  this was the week it ended  i don t think i m the only one  because most of the republicans who were caught on camera this week basically said   i don t want to talk about it  of course they don t want to talk about it  what the hell can they say to what trump gets up to at his rallies and on national television on an almost daily basis  hell  the man even celebrated his  birthday this week by accusing the sitting president of treason  the republicans who do speak out are the brave ones  such as the former bush adviser who called him out for what he is   ignorant   after those remarks that suggest that president obama was a terrorist sympathizer hopefully  maher is right  and this particularly horrible week in trump land has effectively squashed any chance he has at ruining america as president trump watch the clip below  via raw story https   youtu be  image via video screen capture
