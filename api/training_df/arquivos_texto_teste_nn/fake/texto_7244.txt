a canadian tech company is capitalizing on donald trump s scary rise to the top by offering refuge to american workers in the field of technology sortable  based out of kitchener  ontario  has started as a brand new automated ad company that aims to make  ads suck less   i first ran across sortable while scrolling down my facebook newsfeed  the business is paying for advertising on the social media network and their ad made me laugh out loud sortable says they want to offer people in the tech industry a safe place to live and work if donald trump is elected president  now  while we don t think americans will actually move en masse to canada if the election doesn t go their way  we do want to extend an offer  because it s the polite  canadian thing to do over the last year  sortable s popularity has followed a similar trajectory to trump s  we have been growing   month over month  and our ad engine is handling  billion ad impressions each month  while donald trump has been really bad for america  he is actually proving to be quite profitable for our northern neighbor  sortable isn t the first canadian entity to offer their country up as an alternative option if trump is elected  recently an island in the country also announced they would welcome us with arms wide open if the billionaire somehow manages to bamboozle his way into the white house  further  the anti trump sentiment across america has given the country a noticable bump in tourism sortable s founder christopher reid said he began the ad campaign after watching the progression of the united states  presidential election  it s bizarre and it s funny and we thought  why not use that as an opportunity to sort of promote the fact that we re hiring aggressively and we re looking globally  we re doing it because we need to find people and it s fun  what s perhaps even funnier than the campaign to lure american workers to the company  is their attempt to bring canadians  who are working in silicon valley  back home while it is funny to watch canadian businesses and towns use donald trump s rise to power to advertise  it s also really embarrassing for america  we are quickly becoming a laughingstock around the world  it was bad enough when our allies were scratching their heads and wondering why we have so many mass shootings while they have virtually none  but now we have bozo the clown running for president  trump s steady flow of hate  bigotry and bullshit is damaging our already bruised reputation further these kinds of ad campaigns further highlight how important it is that democrats get off of their sofas and vote in november  we have way too much at stake featured image via facebook
