at least two republican campaigns are using veteran s groups as props for campaign debate stunts the stomach turning trend began with super pacs backing senator ted cruz  r tx   who responded to donald trump pulling out of the officially sanctioned republican presidential debate by offering a ransom for trump to appear in a one on one event super pacs supporting republican presidential candidate ted cruz say they will donate    million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival donald trump agrees to a one on one debate with cruz  not only would this be a heck of a debate  but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans   the keep the promise i and ii pacs said in a joint statement wednesday night former hp ceo carly fiorina  who is mired in the single digits in her campaign later chimed in  promising to donate    million to veterans to join in a cruz trump debate  or   million to debate trump at drake university my campaign will also donate    million to veterans  cause to join debate saturday in sioux city   tedcruz  realdonaldtrump      carly fiorina   carlyfiorina  january    the ante  i m free tomorrow at    realdonaldtrump  my campaign will give   to veterans  cause to debate at drake u       carly fiorina   carlyfiorina  january    stunt   and they are both publicity stunts that trump will likely reject in all likelihood   managed to go into detail about what services nor relief would be provided to veterans  while also neglecting to mention that many of the warmongering policies supported by the candidates would create more  wounded veterans the dueling offers also highlighted just how much the other candidates are yearning for a news cycle involving themselves and trump  in order to raise their visibility and in theory help their performance in the iowa caucus the possibility of both the campaigns and super pacs donating money to charitable veteran s causes no matter what trump s campaign response is never came up the frankly cavalier decision to use troops as a pawn does not appear to have attracted a detracting point of view within the fiorina campaign or the cruz pac  with both entities furthering the crass campaign game without thinking of the big picture featured image via flickr
