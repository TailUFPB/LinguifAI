president obama has a few months left in office and at this stage in his presidency  he wants to make sure that the likes of donald trump is as far away from the most powerful position on earth as possible  the president had his opportunity when he sat down with the republican mouth piece fox news in an interview with the conservative organization that has given donald trump free press for months  the president wasn t shy about pointing that out during an interview on fox news sunday  host chris wallace asked the president if he felt any responsibility for angry constituents  who have not seen a change in their economic situation and are now attracted to donald trump  the president said  there s no doubt that i feel frustrated about it  number one  we re still shell shocked from what happened in    people lost homes  lost jobs  lost life savings and they still don t fully know how that happened and was the system fixed in a way they can have confidence in  wallace asked why obama had not  fixed that in eight years   the president responded  the perception is going to be changing over time as people see results  but   and this is the big but   nobody is going to be  percent satisfied in a democracy like ours with every outcome  and i think the danger both among republicans and among democrats who just listen to each other or they just listen to people that already agree with them   you know  republicans have their own tv station  go ahead   wallace said   you can say fox news  of course it s fox news  is the president correct  yes he is  trump has received at least   million dollars of free airtime from may   to the end of  alone  mikey mouse would be leading the republican race if he would be given a major news outlet as a personal mouthpiece let s hope that the damage fox has done by giving this demagogue a platform will not go beyond this year and we can look back at all this and sigh in relief that we won t be seeing trump s demagoguery on display as president of the united states watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
