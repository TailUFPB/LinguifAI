philandro castile  the black man in minnesota who was a licensed concealed carrier and carrying his weapon when he was pulled over and shot  must present quite a dilemma for the nra  castile did everything right   he informed the officer he was licensed  he was carrying  and then told him he was reaching for his wallet as ordered  and he was murdered anyway  one might say he was murdered for daring to carry while black as  the nation s largest and oldest civil rights organization   oh  please   the nra remained suspiciously silent for two days following castile s murder  likely because they know how this makes them look  and it ain t good  today  they finally broke their silence  obviously figuring out a way to comment on castile s murder without actually giving validity to the black lives matter movement and their many justified grievances investigation  really  do they want a thorough investigation into the deaths of the dallas police officers before actually commenting there  too  no  of course not  the deaths of those officers feed their narrative and makes them look like allies of the police  which bolsters the racist beliefs of their primary base  the death of a black man exercising his  amendment right  well  that should just be swept under the rug lest we continue to fuel racial tensions here s what they said about the tragedy in dallas  judge for yourself they were very quick to issue a statement following the shooting of  police officers in dallas  the nra caters to  white identity  politics  and they love to whine about blm s criticism of police  thus  it s easy for them to talk about police officers being shot  and white people being shot  as though black people are the scourge of our society but when it s a black person that s been shot because they dared to exercise their  amendment right to carry silence until they figure out exactly how to craft a response that still caters to  white identity  politics while pretending they aren t also implying that black people don t have a  amendment right to carry a gun racial resentment  read  white pride  is one of the main drivers of opposition to every form of gun legislation ever  the two are intimately linked  and the nra fuels it because it ensures more gun sales  the more racist a white person is  the harder the nra works to court them their statement is a non statement  and it s shameful and disgusting  both in its tardiness and in what it says featured image by justin sullivan getty images
