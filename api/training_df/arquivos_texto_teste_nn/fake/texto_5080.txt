after all the backlash trump received for saying that obama was literally the founder of isis  he tried backpedaling  and then tried to backpedal off his backpedal  wait  what  make a decision  fool   he first tried to lie his way out of it on twitter  saying ratings challenged  cnn reports so seriously that i call president obama  and clinton   the founder  of isis    mvp  they don t get sarcasm   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    it s always the press that s out to get him  and not the press reporting on what he says  but that s beside the point  after that tweet  he held a rally in erie  penn   and he went back on that tweet  so i said the founder of isis   trump recalled to the crowd  after accusing the president of being  so weak and so bad  that he allowed the islamic state to grow   obviously i m being sarcastic  then   but not that sarcastic  to be honest with you   well  which is it  your royalness  either you were being sarcastic or you meant what you said  trump  however  really doesn t know what he s doing  and he will never admit that he was wrong to say something  when hugh hewitt asked him  point blank  whether he was talking about the vacuum created in iraq by pulling our troops out  that exchange went like this trump  no  i meant he s the founder of isis  i do  he was the most valuable player  i gave him the most valuable player award  i gave her too  by the way  hillary clinton hugh hewitt  but he s not sympathetic to them  he hates them  he s trying to kill them trump  i don t care  he was the founder  his  the way he got out of iraq was that that was the founding of isis  okay the only reason he s saying that was sarcasm now is because he was called on the carpet for it  and he has to cover his growing mountain of lies somehow  but it seems his loyal subjects might not have liked that as much  because he decided swerving back and forth on this was better than picking an opinion and sticking to it trump knows his campaign is in trouble  he s asked for help in utah and ohio  and also called for a meeting with the rnc to repair that relationship after more than fifty republicans signed a letter to ask the rnc to pull his funding  trump isn t going to change  though  he thinks he s invincible now that he s locked up the nomination  and has become so incapable of consistency that he can t even pick one lie and stick to it featured image by regine mahaux getty images
