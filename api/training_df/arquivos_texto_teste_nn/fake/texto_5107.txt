the gop is scrambling to do damage control after its disgraceful presidential candidate called for the assassination of democratic nominee hillary clinton yesterday  prominent gopers like paul ryan are brushing off donald trump s comments about the  second amendment people  shooting clinton as a  bad joke  and the responses from the trump campaign itself have been just as shameful we knew trump s team would try to spin those comments any way possible  but it seems that trump finally made a comment serious enough that there is no way it could have been misinterpreted or skewed  but when infamous trump spokesperson katrina pierson went on msnbc to try and explain trump s statements  her  logic  left host kate snow literally  speechless  when pierson tried to play it off like trump had merely been talking about encouraging gun owners to vote against clinton  pierson said  the nra is a bipartisan organization  and that is also left out of the discussion in the media  considering how there are even democrats who won t touch gun legislation in an election year because the nra has been able to take out democrats as well  snow argued that trump had called on gun owners to stop the former secretary of state as if she had already been elected and was picking liberal supreme court justices  snow said  he s assuming she s in power  and then says there s nothing you can do about it at that point    well  but maybe the second amendment people  maybe there is  pierson continued to insist that trump was talking about the nra being able to stop senators from appointing people that are hostile towards the second amendment  snow tried to make pierson understand the severity of what trump had said  whether it had been misinterpreted or not  if his words are misinterpreted as president  he will not get a do over as president of the united states  i think that s what a lot of people are reacting too here  you don t get a do over  pierson did what any goper does when they re cornered   change the subject to blaming obama and clinton for everything  pierson suddenly began talking about the the horrible things that have already happened while hillary clinton was at the state department  and even threw obama under the bus while she was at it  snow kept trying to keep pierson on subject  pressing her  you have no concern about his ability as president   if here were president   to make an argument with foreign leaders  in negotiations and not be misconstrued or misunderstood  what pierson said next stunned snow to the point where she had no words for several seconds  pierson said  he wasn t talking about policy  he wasn t talking about implementation of policy  he was talking about what would happen if hillary clinton were to be elected and he was absolutely right  after a long  awkward silence  snow finally said  i m speechless because i m trying to follow your logic here  katrina  and i m having a hard time   that s because with trump  there is no logic   there is only fear and insanity you can watch pierson s insane defense of trump s comments below featured image via screenshots
