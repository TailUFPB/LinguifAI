an atheist group has found a truly genius way to troll christian conservatives over their   noah s ark being built in kentucky   by crowdfunding mock billboards for the christian  theme park  author and columnist dan arel writes in pathos that a group called the tri state freethinkers are raising    to place billboards which name the ark adventure genocide and incest park  image via indiegogothe indiegogo page for the project states the billboards are likely to serious annoy the ark adventure team  who have lurched from one crisis to another in their attempts to set up the site australian born creationist ken ham and his fundamentalist christian organization answers in genesis  aig  are looking to build a   ark adventure in kentucky  with the centerpiece of a reconstructed ark  the problem is  they want you the taxpayer to pay for it according to newsweek  aig purchased a  acre plot of land just outside williamstown  kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago  but since then  the project has hit one hurdle after another  many  of ham s own making the principal issue at stake now  is that ham and aig want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates  the group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the tourism development incentive program  projects of   million and upwards can recover   of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes after much debate on their initial application  kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as aig agreed to non discriminatory hiring practices  this means  they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none  they could not specifically hire creationists a few bumps down the road later  and ham and aig had to significantly strip back their pans for the park  they were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park  due to the substantial changes to the plans  they had to resubmit their application to kentucky for the tax rebate  this time is was denied  why  because apparently  honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash  aig had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the ark adventure  the website demanded a salvation testimony  and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants   clearly ruling out non believers so now  ken ham and aig are suing kentucky for the money   claiming religious discrimination  greg lipper  senior litigation counsel for americans united for separation of church and state points out the muddled thinking that aig is applying in this case  aig is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund  they re saying kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry  that kind of argument would make thomas jefferson turn in his grave  no one is telling ham as a private citizen  who or how he can hire  it is only as a recipient of state funds  an agreement which he is free to enter or not  that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same  just like chances of his theory of genesis being true  ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none and his ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either i just realised that america s immigration policy doesn t weed out australian ark building lunatics   kenham  michael   gotapulse  january     kenham could get a  yr old dude   his kids to build the ark themselves w o modern technology i would give the park more credit   uncle john   azmoderate  january    the universe was capable of giving ken ham and his cohorts a sign that their project was doomed to failure  this comedy of errors and public embarrassments would be it  featured image via flickr creative commons
