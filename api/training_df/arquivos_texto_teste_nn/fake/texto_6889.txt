bill o reilly refused to believe the findings of a poll conducted by his own news organization on thursday night  because it was simply too bad for him to contemplate  according to the poll  democraict candidate bernie sanders would beat all current gop contenders for president while endorsing all other sections of the poll  which supported his views  o reilly flat out loses it with the section which doesn t  the section shows that that sanders beats trump by  points  ted cruz by  points  and narrowly defeats john kasich by  points   it s also not the first poll to show this sort of result nevertheless  o reilly wasn t willing to tolerate such information  which flies in the face of his own views on the electability of vermont senator bernie sanders  he appeals to his fellow fox news veterans geraldo rivera and dana perino to join him in denouncing the results  rivera immediately obliges  calling the findings   pie in the sky   while perino makes sympathetic noises but it s not enough to quell the perplexed o reilly  who turns to camera saying  i don t believe it  and i have to say  with all due respect the fox news poll has been good i don t believe this  i just don t  the incident is a perfect example of the phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance  as chris mooney explains in mother jones the concept of cognitive dissonance has been well established in psychology and even  to some extent  embedded in public consciousness  basically  when the mind is faced with an idea that is threatening to one s identity or sense of self an idea that induces unpleasant dissonance one tends to try to either avoid the thought or  perhaps  reinterpret it into something unthreatening or positive this urge is also known to affect conservatives to a far greater degree than liberals this doesn t mean every conservative is less likely to open their minds to information which challenges their world view than every liberal  it simply follows the overall trend it is a major obstacle in the way of liberals seeking to change the minds of conservatives  as whichever way they appeal   it is rejected  if liberals appeal in terms of reason and evidence   their case is rejected the moment it creates cognitive dissonance  however  if liberals move into more emotive arguments  these are often rejected on the basis of confirming to  naive idealism  stereotypes by conservatives  so liberals are painted as either policy wonks with no humanity  or airy fairy liberals with no common sense meanwhile  the most ridiculous arguments put forward within the normalised conservative worldview go unchallenged  requiring minimal or no evidence  such as mexico paying for trump s border wall for example  mexico has stated on the record this will not happen  and yet it remains fact among trump supporters  there is little doubt that if the fox poll had shown donald trump or ted cruz beating sanders and clinton in a head to head   o reilly would have considered it water tight this is something for us to all watch in our own behavior  do we demand the same level of evidence for arguments that conform to our world view  as those which do not  if the answer is no  then we are no better  if we want a cleaner  better politics   it starts with us  featured image via screengrab
