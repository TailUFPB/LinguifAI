rand paul and carly fiorina have recently received word that they have been left out of the next republican presidential debate   and one of them isn t taking it very well thursday night s gop debate in north charleston  south carolina is set to feature the usual knuckleheads  donald trump  ted cruz  marco rubio  ben carson  jeb bush  chris christie and john kasich  paul found out that he wasn t included in the debate last night  and couldn t contain his disappointment  referring to the slight as a  rotten  thing to do  paul posted several angry tweets about his exclusion from the line up   and even told cnn that he is boycotting the debate and  won t participate in anything that s not first tier because we have a first tier campaign    randpaul  i will not participate in an undercard debate https   t co  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  january    business  january  debate marks the first time only seven candidates will be in the republican debate  allowing candidates to be included based on the average of the five most recent national polls and the top five candidates in iowa or new hampshire  paul didn t qualify  but he doesn t want to accept that  he told cnn  it s a mistake because the thing is we actually have been in the top five or six in most of the recent polls  in fact  last week in a national poll we were just one point out of fourth place  so i think it s a mistake to try to exclude me from the national debate  continuing his temper tantrum on social media  paul busied himself with retweeting posts from supporters that painted him in a more favorable light rand was so angry  that he also released this statement and of course when all else failed to get his point across  paul begged his  supporters  for donations to prove the media wrong paul has not had much luck in the polls  coming in consistently low compared to his fellow gop candidates   but he apparently felt entitled to this debate and felt he should be given the chance to bore voters with his speeches  despite the fact that they ve already proven that they re not interested  for a man who was once considered the most interesting man in american politics  that s certainly a hard pill to swallow featured image via medill dc   flickr
