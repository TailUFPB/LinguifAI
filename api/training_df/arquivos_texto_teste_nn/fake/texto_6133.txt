a new war toy for the navy was shown off recently in an article published in the wall street journal the  supergun  as the wsj s headline refers to it  is really just a large railgun  a railgun is a weapon that uses an electromagnetic charge to fire a round rather than chemical explosives the only time that cost is mentioned in the article is when it compares the cost of using a railgun projectile versus that of a standard missile  the wsj reports that each projectile only costs around    dollars to make  compared to the cost of a   million dollar interceptor missile   wow  it almost sounds as if this thing might actually save the military some money in the long term  it won t though  it s just another military pipe dream that ll end up costing tax payers an arm and a leg   possibly literally seeing as the money that could go towards building these things might have gone to something useful  like a universal national health insurance program the weapon requires a massive power source the rail gun requires  megawatts to work  as vice pointed out in an article published last year  this need for a huge power source is the reason this technology is going to be quite costly  or even possibly impossible to make practical for a long time  it s hard to conceptualize  megawatts  for me anyway  for some perspective  th e navy s next generation zumwalt class destroyer  the  century stealth battleship with electric engines  is powered by a  megawatt array of turbine generators  so  firing a rail gun once would take almost a third of the most advanced ship s whole capacity  most ships today don t have more than  megawatts to spare      the railgun is going to be tested on the usns millinocket next year  the first of three zumwalt class ships railgun or no railgun is slated to be delivered to the navy next year  and the last in   they re estimated to cost   billion in total  the bigger problem here is that the united states is entering into a new cold war era  except this time it is with both russia and china  projects like this may give the u s  a small military advantage over one of these two nations for a few years at least  then we will have to spend billions upon billions of dollars on new weapons systems that everyone is terrified of actually using  considering the chance that a full nuclear response is a possibility we have to really ask ourselves is this the road we want the u s  to go down  of course  we cannot leave ourselves defenseless but we seriously have to make decisions about what we invest our money into  how exactly do we plan to use these weapons systems  should they ever actually become practical  we also have to ask ourselves if it is more important to spend countless billions of dollars on weapons that are built in  the justification of defense against the next bad thing  yet will probably end up just being used to  spread a little democracy  to poor nations i  for one  would prefer to invest in building a nation that makes sure that every person is given the opportunity to get an education  see a doctor  or breath clean air and drink clean water than one that is hell bent on winning another cold war you can watch a video of the railgun below  featured image from video screenshot
