donald trump set tongues wagging with a tweet on monday promising a special guest scheduled to appear with him at campaign event in iowa on tuesday  january   his campaign announced  he ll be making a major announcement   bringing a special guest  now  after some sleuthing by some conservatives online  it appears that the guest may be none other than failed republican presidential candidate and half term governor sarah palin eagle eyed campaign watchers found a flight on a private jet that left anchorage international airport  and five hours later touched down at des moines international airport since her campaign flameout  palin has kept her brand alive at the center of conservative politics  she has been a featured speaker at the cpac conference and regularly has pumped out books targeted at conservative readers  a pay per view video venture of hers was less successful and recently shuttered  palin recently put her gated arizona mansion up for sale palin may be accused by some conservatives of being disloyal to trump rival ted cruz  who she endorsed and campaigned for in the past but palin has also been a booster of donald trump  last november she said his nomination was a strong possibility  i think it s a very real possibility because people are really tired of professional politicians who  you know  won t call it like they see it and maybe don t have life experiences that allow them to prove a track record of success   the former vice presidential nominee said in a radio interview with wbt charlotte s news talk radio on thursday  that s refreshing about trump   she said   he s a fighter  we know he s gonna put america first  and he really nailed it early on what the main problems are in america right now  so it s a very real possibility  in  when there was speculation palin might challenge president obama in   she took her bus tour to new york city and had a weird pizza date with trump and his wife  melania while mostly a laughingstock to the public at large  republican base voters remain enamored with palin  and may view an endorsement by her of the reality tv star as a signal to select him as their candidate as the iowa caucus waits only a couple of weeks away featured image via youtube
