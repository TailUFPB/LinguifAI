we could already make the assumption that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  was making decisions off what the lobbyists in his back pocket are telling him to do  but now it has been confirmed  and in the worst way imaginable mcconnell is literally holding up the confirmation of merrick garland to the supreme court because the nra doesn t want him  he s keeping one of three branches of government from functioning as it should  because he wants to please the gun lobby over working for the american people mcconnell told fox news  i can t imagine that a republican majority in the united states senate would want to confirm in a lame duck session a nominee opposed by the national rifle association  the national federation of independent business that represents small businesses that have never taken a position on a supreme court appointment before  they re opposed to this guy  i can t imagine that a republican majority senate  even if it were soon to be minority  would want to confirm a judge that would move the court dramatically to the left  that s not gonna happen  this is just absolutely unacceptable  and hopefully mcconnell is right  hopefully the republicans in the senate will soon be the minority  and we can actually get congress working for the people again  and not just for the lobbyists with the most money watch mcconnell bow to the nra here not  theonion   mitch mcconnell told fox news that the nra must approve of the next supreme court justice  pic twitter com   gavin newsom   gavinnewsom  july    image via video screen capture
