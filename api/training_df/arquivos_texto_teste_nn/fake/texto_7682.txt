the united states secret service is investigating conspiracy theorist and right wing radio host glenn beck  the probe is in relation to a statement beck made on his nationally syndicated radio show while broadcasting from the cpac conference the agency is required to investigate any and all threats related to the people it is protecting  in this case it happens to be comments beck made about donald trump  who beck is opposed to  from cbs dallas during his radio show friday morning  beck and his producers were talking about the other candidates saying they would support donald trump if he becomes the republican nominee his producer mocked beck after beck mentioned being in the shoes of trump s rivals  was it gigantic shoes   asked the producer stu burguiere  if i was close enough and i had a knife  really  i mean the stabbing just wouldn t stop   beck responded  appearing to direct his comments at burguiere beck s comments were blasted out by the conservative daily caller  which is run by fox news host tucker carlson but unlike so many other inflammatory statements from beck  this may actually be a mistake  beck was apparently talking about his producer  stu burguiere  burguiere posted on his facebook page after the incident noting   if you were listening  you know that glenn actually threatened me  not donald trump  so i am in the odd situation of defending my boss for threatening my life  the comments may have been seen as more credible because beck has been a critic of trump  claiming that his preferred candidate  ted cruz  is more qualified and destined for the presidency than trump  beck has accused trump of being a huckster and a phony it seems fitting that a conservative media outlet s sloppy reporting led to federal law enforcement being called in on another conservative media icon beck has for years promoted conspiracy theories about president obama  democrats  and other progressives  he also claimed that obama hates white people and that he has been using the power of the government to give black people reparations  beck s theories were so out there that advertisers began abandoning his afternoon show on fox news  and the network soon dropped him  now he broadcasts online and on a few niche cable networks  while still retaining his radio show   but even that is dwarfed by more successful hosts like rush limbaugh and sean hannity featured image via flickr
