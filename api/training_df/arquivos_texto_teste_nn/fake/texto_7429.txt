as canadian prime minister justin trudeau continues to prove that he s an all around amazing person  he s become admired far beyond canada s borders earlier this week  trudeau was confronted by some very passionate americans while stopping at a deli in new york city  which trudeau was visiting to announce that canada would seek a un security council seat in   having spotted the prime minister and desperate to escape the horrifying u s  presidential election  these americans spoke for many of us when they approached trudeau and asked   could you run for president here  and why wouldn t they want him to help rescue us from the possibility of republican front runner donald trump   he s the exact opposite  he s already increased taxes on the wealthy  welcomed syrian refugees into his country  become an outspoken feminist and is just as interested in climate change as president barack obama  the prospect of president trump is such a threat  that another candidate in addition democrat candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders would be a tremendous relief trudeau gently explained to those two americans why a presidential run wasn t a possibility for him  it s very simple  i m not american born  but these americans weren t ready to take no for an answer  one of them quickly countered  ted cruz can do it  trudeau reminded them that cruz was  born as an american  because although cruz was born in canada  his mother was an american citizen then trudeau s admirers began to get desperate  one of the men said  all our guys are so bad  you ve gotta believe us  we ve met  em all   they re so terrible  please  his companion added  they re boring  weird  we have to settle for them  please  trudeau stood firm and said  you know what  i have tremendous confidence in the american people  then  both men literally dropped down to their knees and pleaded with trudeau  we ll do anything  we re begging you  we re literally begging you  trudeau simply responded  i don t know if you noticed  but i actually have a job  and it s a pretty good one   he then patted one of the kneeling men on the back and continued on his way this just happened to  justintrudeau in a nyc cafe   cnn  abc  huffingtonpost  foxnews pic twitter com bucewmngge  stephen ward   stephenward  march    s another view justin trudeau dans un resto de manhattan  ces  am ricains le supplient de se lancer dans la course pr sidentielle  pic twitter com qgrredvaij   marie jo lle parent   mariejoelle  march    news believe it s possible that the two men in the clips are actually pranksters that have shown up at other u s  presidential campaign events  putting the statement  we ve met  em all  into context   the duo resembles the two men who wore nazi like armbands to a trump event  with a pro trump logo instead   a man who interrupted a marco rubio rally to accuse the florida senator of stealing his girlfriend  and a man who sat behind hillary clinton with a  settle for hillary  whether or not this was a stunt  it very much reflects where america is at right now  most of us are looking to anyone who could save this country from donald trump   and judging from the amount of supporters trump has gathered  we wish we had as much faith in our fellow americans as trudeau does  featured image via video screen capture
