ted cruz is one of the most extreme individuals to ever run for the presidency  as such he has left a trail of quotes that should be held against him as his  campaign continues his campaign has primarily focused on religion in an effort to attract the support of conservative  christians   much like rick santorum did in  and just like rick santorum  cruz has also made his fair share of statements on topics such as the environment  science  foreign policy  and women s rights among others based on his fanatical religious views that completely disqualify him as a viable occupant of the white house here are  of them    i am saddened to see that some here  not everyone  but some here  are so consumed with hate  if you will not stand with israel and the jews  then i will not stand with you   ted cruz trashing his muslim american audience  who promptly booed him  september    it is now or never  i don t think we ve reached the point of no return yet  but we re close  we are close  and i believe if we go four or eight more years on this same path  we risk losing the greatest country in the history of the world  millions of americans are realizing this isn t working  the obama economy is a disaster  obamacare is a train wreck  and the obama clinton foreign policy of leading from behind   the whole world is on fire   ted cruz before scaring a little girl with same ending line as if the apocalypse is upon us  march     you always have to be worried about something that is considered a so called scientific theory that fits every scenario  climate change  as they have defined it  can never be disproved  because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder  whatever happens  they ll say  well  it s changing  so it proves our theory   ted cruz bashing science and denying the reality of climate change  january    i think it s an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression  because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away   ted cruz being a hypocrite on immigrants  june    no man who doesn t begin every day on his knees is fit to stand in the oval office   ted cruz saying atheists should are unqualified to be president  august    let me say something to the school aged kids here  when heidi s first lady  french fries are coming back to the cafeteria  the last i checked the cardboard was supposed to be on the tray and not in the food   ted cruz tries to pander to kids by promising them unhealthy food for lunch  january    if i am elected president  we will repeal every word of obamacare  now  once that is done  everyone agrees we need health care reform  it should follow the principles of expanding competition  empowering patients  and keeping government from getting between us and our doctors  three specific reforms that reflect those principles  number   we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines  that ll create a true  state national marketplace while will drive down the cost of low cost catastropic health insurance  number   we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax advantaged way for more routine health care needs  and number   we should work to delink health insurance from employment  so if you lose your job  your health insurance goes with you  and it is personal  portable  and affordable  and i tell you  bret i think that s a much more attractive vision for health care than the washington driven  top down obamacare that is causing so many millions to hurt   ted cruz stating that only the rich and healthy will have health insurance if he is president  january    listen on the question of tithing  all of us are on a faith journey  and i will readily admit that i have not been as faithful in this aspect of my walk as i should have been  that article focuses on ten years ago  we don t have the ability to go back and change what occurred ten years ago when heidi and i were newly married and we d just started a family  but at the end of the day  being a christian is not about holding yourself out as righteous  it s about beginning with the understanding that we are flawed sinners and we are saved not by deeds but by christ s redemption  i am grateful that god is a patient and forgiving god and this area  as in many areas of my life i am working to do a better job walking in my faith   ted cruz lying to a christian reporter about how much he tithes  january    well my aspiration is to  uh  oh i don t know  be in a teen tit film like that guy who played horatio  you know he was in malibu bikini beach shop  well  other than that  take over the world  world domination  you know  rule everything  rich  powerful  that sort of stuff   ted cruz admitting at the age of  that he wants to achieve world domination in a video released in january    i ll tell you  you know who one of those millions of americans is who s lost their health care because of obamacare  that would be me  i don t have health care right now   ted cruz lies about not having health insurance and blames president obama for it  january    jfk campaigned on tax cuts  limiting government and standing up and defeating soviet communists  jfk would be a republican today  he stood for religious liberty  and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern democratic party   ted cruz claiming jfk would be in the gop today only to then be smacked down by jfk s grandson  january    i believe in the death penalty   ted cruz in his book as dug up by the new york times in january    we will carpet bomb them into oblivion  i don t know if sand can glow in the dark  but we re going to find out   ted cruz stating his willingness to kill everyone and everything in the middle east to beat isis even though carpet bombing is a war crime  december    if you re a daca recipient  you were brought here illegally  and violating the law has consequences  one of the problems of our broken immigration system is that it is creating human tragedies and there are human tragedies when people break the law   ted cruz tells a woman to her face that he will deport her and her family if elected president  january    what happened in benghazi is a national disgrace  four americans were murdered  we lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the carter administration  the immediate response of barack obama and hillary clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception  obstruction and cover up  they began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video  but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again  keep us safe  we do know hillary told her daughter chelsea  well gosh  i knew it was a terrorist attack  while we were out telling the american people it wasn t  you know i ll tell you  in my house  if my daughter catherine  the five year old  says something she knows to be false  she gets a spanking   ted cruz lies about benghazi before saying he wants to physically discipline hillary clinton for it  january    i want to tell everyone to get ready  strap on the full armor of god  get ready for the attacks that are coming   ted cruz tells his fanatical supporters to get ready to do battle on his behalf  january    we ve seen six and a half years of president obama leading from behind  weakness is provocative  and this iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic  this deal  on its face  will send over   billion to the ayatollah khamenei  making the obama administration the world s leading financier of radical islamic terrorism you d better believe it  if i am elected president  on the very first day in office  i will rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal   ted cruz vows not to honor the iran nuclear deal  favoring war instead  september    the next president should announce that america is moving its embassy to jerusalem  for decades political candidates  republicans and democrats  have talked about doing so  enough talk  we need a leader who will act and respect the eternal capital of israel   ted cruz says he would inflame tensions in the middle east and basically start world war iii for israel  june    listen  absolutely  yes  i think the first obligation of everyone in public office is to protect life  life is foundational  in fact  as you look at the declaration  that ordering of unalienable rights   life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   i think is a very deliberate ordering  i very much agree with the pope s longstanding  and the prior popes  before him  longstanding call to protect every human life from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death  and  this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child s fifth and  amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law   ted cruz misreading the constitution and declaring his intention to outlaw abortion despite roe v  wade  december    the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are democrats   ted cruz says  percent of the american people are violent criminals  november    there is no doubt that millions of people are suffering from the rise of radical islamic terrorists  christians are suffering  jews are suffering and other muslims are suffering  what i m saying is syrian muslim refugees should be resettled in the middle east  in majority muslim countries   ted cruz says only christians should be allowed to enter the united states  november    there is no meaningful risk of christians committing acts of terror  if there were a group of radical christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they  we would have a different national security situation  but it is precisely the obama administration s unwillingness to recognize that or ask those questions that makes them so unable to fight this enemy  because they pretend as if there is no religious aspect to this   ted cruz falsely claiming that christians do not commit acts of terrorism  november    climate change is not science  it s religion   ted cruz claims climate science is a religious view  october    it s wrong for barack obama to threaten to shut down the government over the issue  under no circumstances should we spend   million   funding planned parenthood  which appears to be a criminal enterprise   ted cruz attacks planned parenthood and blames president obama for wanting a government shutdown when he s the one really trying to shut it down again  september    i stand with kim davis   ted cruz declaring his support of a religious anti gay bigot  september    nothing is more important in the next  months than that the body of christ rise up and that christians stand up  that pastors stand up and lead  in this last election   million evangelical christians stayed home   if we can simply bring christians to the polls   is it any wonder we have the government we have  we have the leaders we have if believers stay home and leave electing our leaders to unbelievers  we get exactly what we deserve and nothing is more important than having people of faith stand up and just vote our values  vote biblical values and that s how we turn the country around   ted cruz openly planning to turn america into a christian ruled tyranny  august    following the tragic shooting in newtown  connecticut  president obama and harry reid lead an assault  not on going after violent criminals  which is what they should have done  but instead going after the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens  and i led the fight to protect the second amendment in the u s  senate and we defeated president obama efforts to undermine our rights   ted cruz bragging about ignoring the mass killing of  little kids to oppose gun control measures  august    we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth  we will not defeat radical islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words  radical islamic terrorism   what we need is a commander in chief who makes clear  if you join isis  if you wage jihad on america  then you are signing your death warrant   ted cruz thinks merely shouting  radical islam  will defeat isis  august    our single vote in opposition is just and the abstentions of our friends are welcome  but at this point they are meaningless gestures  it is time to stop ceding moral authority to the unhrc and tell the truth about this hopelessly biased and anti semitic institution  there is no equivalency between israel s right to self defense and hamas  genocidal aggression against the jewish people  there is no equivalence between israel s extraordinary efforts to protect civilians and hamas  use of the palestinian people as human shields  being party to any body that believes there is only perpetuates this injustice  the united states should stop legitimizing the unhrc with our membership and withdraw now   ted cruz declaring that he will remove america from the united nations human rights council  july    i like donald trump  i think he s terrific  i think he s brash  i think he speaks the truth he has a way of speaking that gets attention  and i credit him for focusing on an issue that needs to be focused on   ted cruz agreeing with donald trump that mexicans are a bunch of rapists  june    you know  vice president joe biden  you know the nice thing  you don t need a punch line   uproarious laughter  i promise you it works   the next party you re at  just walk up to someone  say  vice president joe biden  and just close your mouth  they will crack up laughing  and biden said  if anyone attacks your house  just go outside with a double barrel shotgun  and fire both barrels  now that is very very good advice  if it so happens you re being attacked by a flock of geese   ted cruz cruelly mocks joe biden after his son beau died  june    this bill is symptomatic of a larger problem in washington   an addiction to spending money we do not have  the united states senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt   ted cruz denying disaster relief funding to hurricane sandy victims in     there are a series of federal statutory thresholds that have to be satisfied  initially  it appears those thresholds are likely to be satisfied by the magnitude of the damage we re seeing  democrats and republicans in the congressional delegation will stand as one in support of the federal government meeting its statutory obligations to provide the relief to help the texans who are hurting   ted cruz demanding federal disaster relief for his own state and being a hypocrite simultaneously  may    instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met  imagine a simple  flat tax that lets americans fill out their taxes on a postcard  imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the irs   ted cruz saying he would abolish the irs and lower taxes to the point where our government couldn t function  april    we need a hundred more like jesse helms in the u s  senate   ted cruz longing for the senate to be dominated by pro segregationist racists who oppose the civil rights act and the voting rights act  march    i think when it comes to campaign finance reform it is one of the most misunderstood issues in terms of the debate  i am first and foremost a constitutionalist  i believe in the constitution and i believe in the bill of rights  we saw last year  and you probably didn t see it because it wasn t covered in the local media  but senate democrats introduced and voted on an amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the first amendment   ted cruz saying he support wealthy people buying elections  march    net neutrality is obamacare for the internet  it would put the government in charge of determining internet prices  terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered  leading to fewer choices  fewer opportunities and higher prices  government regulated utilities invariably destroy innovation and freedom   ted cruz opposing a free and open internet  november    of course we should have a surgeon general in place  and we don t have one because president obama  instead of nominating a health professional  he nominated someone who is an anti gun activist and that individual didn t have the votes in the senate   ted cruz keeping america from having a surgeon general during the ebola outbreak because the nominee supports gun control  october    if harry reid kills this bill in the senate  i think the house should hold its ground  and should begin passing smaller continuing resolutions  one department at a time  it should start with a continuing resolution focused on the military  fund the military  send it over  and let s see if harry reid is willing to shut down the military just because he wants to force obamacare on the american people   ted cruz tries and succeeds in causing a government shutdown  september    justice scalia was an american hero  we owe it to him  and the nation  for the senate to ensure that the next president names his replacement   ted cruz vowing on twitter to help senate republicans block any obama nominee to the supreme court in hope of a republican like himself being able to do so in   february  these  quotes  especially the final quote on this list  demonstrate precisely why ted cruz should never be allowed to become president featured image  wikimedia
