american taxpayers are being charged more than    an hour for prayers said in the us house and senate   the total cost per prayer  which lasts an average of  seconds  is a whopping    according to andrew seidel of the freedom from religion foundation  who did the math to determine what taxpayers are being charged for prayers in washington  the total annual bill comes to more than    both the u s  house and senate employ a chaplain whose singular duty is to administer prayer  the budget for the house chaplain s office is     while the senate chaplain s office receives    seidel reports that both the house and senate chaplains earn executive level salaries which are equal to those of high ranking government officials  such as  general counsels of the departments of the army  navy  and air force  the chief financial officers of nasa and the epa  the chief information officers of almost every major federal department and agency  and the army s director of civil defense  the two chaplains earn three figure salaries for presiding over opening prayers in the house and senate  which only convene about  days out of the year seidel reports and even with those fat salaries  the official chaplains let  guest chaplains  deliver many of the prayers about   in the house  the house chaplains gave   invocations over the  years from    or about  invocations each year  guest chaplains gave another  over that same span  congress is budgeting more than three quarters of a million dollars every year for chaplains to give these prayers or coordinate the guest chaplains  prayers as seidel explains here  in  the house chaplain delivered just  prayers  lasting an average of  seconds each  that s about   hours of work  for that he was paid     or    an hour over the  year period between  and   us taxpayers spent   million on prayers in washington  in the meantime  elected officials slashed spending on essential programs like wic and snap as well as other assistance for the vulnerable the idea that taxpayers are being billed exorbitant amounts of money for prayers  all while right wing politicians screech about the national debt and wasteful government spending  is beyond outrageous the church is not government and government is not a church  everyone is free to exercise their religious beliefs in the u s  using millions of dollars in taxpayer money to support daily prayers in washington  however  is not even close to acceptable the freedom from religion foundation is encouraging voters to make their voices heard on this issue by contacting their elected representatives here and here image credit  wikipedia
