as you may or may not know at this point  msnbc is no longer the place for liberal politics anymore  and if you watch daily  you may have noticed this slow shift over the past year or so  sure  there s still shows like rachel maddow and chris hayes  all in  but all in all  if you re looking for real progressive tv  you re going to have to find it somewhere on the internet  the network is making a strong effort to switch from opinion to hard news  and that s why you re seeing fewer and fewer opinion shows and more generic broadcasts  especially during the day unfortunately  it looks like melissa harris perry was being forced to silence her voice by the network as well  and as of friday  harris perry has decided that she will no longer do her weekend show in a letter written by harris perry  and put out by one of her original producers  jamil smith  she explains in great detail why she has made this decision here s the letter in full dearest nerds as you know by now  my name appears on the weekend schedule for msnbc programming from south carolina this saturday and sunday  i appreciate that many of you responded to this development with relief and enthusiasm  to know that you have missed working with me even a fraction of how much i ve missed working with all of you is deeply moving  however  as of this morning  i do not have any intention of hosting this weekend  because this is a decision that affects all of you  i wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning some unknown decision maker  presumably andy lack or phil griffin  has added my name to this spreadsheet  but nothing has changed in the posture of the msnbc leadership team toward me or toward our show  putting me on air seems to be a decision being made solely to save face because there is a growing chorus of questions from our viewers about my notable absence from msnbc coverage  social media has noted the dramatic change in editorial tone and racial composition of msnbc s on air coverage  in addition  dylan byers of cnn has made repeated inquiries with msnbc s leadership and with me about the show and what appears to be its cancellation  i have not responded to reporters or social media inquiries  however  i am not willing to appear on air in order to quell concerns about the disappearance of our show and our voice here is the reality  our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season  after four years of building an audience  developing a brand  and developing trust with our viewers  we were effectively and utterly silenced  now  msnbc would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes mhp show distinctive the purpose of this decision seems to be to provide cover for msnbc  not to provide voice for mhp show  i will not be used as a tool for their purposes  i am not a token  mammy  or little brown bobble head  i am not owned by lack  griffin  or msnbc  i love our show  i want it back  i have wept more tears than i can count and i find this deeply painful  but i don t want back on air at any cost  i am only willing to return when that return happens under certain terms undoubtedly  television nurtures the egos of those of us who find ourselves in front of bright lights and big cameras  i am sure ego is informing my own pain in this moment  but there is a level of professional decency  respect  and communication that has been denied this show for years  and the utter insulting absurdity of the past few weeks exceeds anything i can countenance i have stayed in the same hotels where msnbc has been broadcasting in iowa  in new hampshire  and in south carolina  yet i have been shut out from coverage  i have a phd in political science and have taught american voting and elections at some of the nation s top universities for nearly two decades  yet i have been deemed less worthy to weigh in than relative novices and certified liars  i have hosted a weekly program on this network for four years and contributed to election coverage on this network for nearly eight years  but no one on the third floor has even returned an email  called me  or initiated or responded to any communication of any kind from me for nearly a month  it is profoundly hurtful to realize that i work for people who find my considerable expertise and editorial judgment valueless to the coverage they are creating while msnbc may believe that i am worthless  i know better  i know who i am  i know why mhp show is unique and valuable  i will not sell short myself or this show  i am not hungry for empty airtime  i care only about substantive  meaningful  and autonomous work  when we can do that  i will return not a moment earlier  i am deeply sorry for the ways that this decision makes life harder for all of you  you mean more to me than you can imagine yours always melissait s really a shame that msnbc is trying to silence the liberal voice  a voice that is being drowned out endlessly as more and more news outlets are acquired by right leaning companies and ceos  it s as though msnbc gave up on itself  and instead of work on a formula that could really bring in more views  decided it was easier to just be generic  hopefully the network comes to their senses sooner rather than later  and hopefully we will hear harris perry s very well educated  and much needed voice once again  however  we must respect her decision featured image  rcp
