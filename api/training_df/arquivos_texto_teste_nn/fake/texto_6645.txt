whenever republicans dredge up a certain specious  quote  from former president lyndon johnson about  n ggers   i am reminded of my grandmother my grandmother didn t like black people much at all  living next door to her and conversing regularly  i heard more slurs than one would typically hear at a tea party convention devoted to discourse on race relations  in fact  when a republican says that  blacks are the real racists  or tells us what he or she thinks about  negroes   it reminds me of my childhood   and not in a good way apart from that  she was a sweet  kind woman who genuinely cared about others   enough so that her personal prejudices rarely  if ever  impacted her interactions with others  my mother  though her demeanor has changed over time  was also not too fond of african americans when i was younger  when i was  or   i was dating an african american girl  she was intelligent  caring  and probably one of the better people i have had the pleasure to know  however  her skin was darker  so my mother disapproved heavily after meeting the girl  we ll call her samantha  once  my mom knew what she had to do to protect her son from the risk of race mixing  which  at the time  she was against   for the good of the child    i was not permitted to leave the vicinity of my house because i might visit her  i was not allowed to go out with friends because she might meet me wherever i wanted to go at any given time  i was a prisoner despite my grandmother s pretty open racism  she had a huge problem with my mother s actions  while she personally had a low opinion of people because of their skin color  she also recognized one great truth  it doesn t matter how she or anyone else feels  because everyone deserves to be treated equally  after learning of my mother s decision to effectively imprison me around my home because disagreed with the skin color rather than the character of the person i was dating  my grandmother pulled me aside and said something that was equally heartwarming and offensive to me  i want you to know that no matter what your mother says  there is nothing wrong with you dating that n gger girl  she s nice and sweet  you tell me any time you want to see her and i ll make it happen because it ain t right that your mom won t let you be with who you want  and so it went for months  any time my parents left the house  my grandmother would take me to pick samantha  and she would go over an  escape plan  if they returned home prematurely  despite her prejudices  she was always kind to samantha  in fact  those interactions changed her opinions somewhat  she stopped being a  n gger   she became a person in my grandmother s eyes  she became human  actually getting to know someone can have that impact  at first  she was  one of the good ones   but eventually race stopped being a factor altogether as my grandmother learned that people are just people  regardless of skin color people could offer a number of defenses for how she felt the majority of her life   she was a product of her time  or  she didn t know any better   i won t do that  at any point in our nation s history  there has been someone strong enough to fight for what is right  to take a stand against such horrific classifications of people  my grandmother was not one of them  but despite this she was also outspoken about equal rights  though a slur was usually included in the discussion   she genuinely believed that her own prejudices  which she admitted even early on  might be wrong   should have no bearing on how society as a whole treats people   just like lyndon johnson at first glance  johnson would fit right in at a trump rally  in april   msnbc s adam serwer noted that the former president was  practically a connoisseur  of the n word  there is absolutely no question that johnson was a massive racist  but he was also a huge proponent of the civil rights act  which he lovingly called the  n gger bill   serwer writes then in   johnson would help get the  nigger bill  passed  known to most as the civil rights act of   with the  civil rights act and the  voting rights act  the segregationists would go to their graves knowing the cause they d given their lives to had been betrayed  frank underwood style  by a man they believed to be one of their own  when caro asked segregationist georgia democrat herman talmadge how he felt when johnson  signing the civil rights act  said we shall overcome   talmadge said  sick  the civil rights act made it possible for johnson to smash jim crow  the voting rights act made the u s  government accountable to its black citizens and a true democracy for the first time  johnson lifted racist immigration restrictions designed to preserve a white majority   and by extension white supremacy  he forced fbi director j  edgar hoover  then more concerned with  communists  and civil rights activists  to turn his attention to crushing the ku klux klan  though the fair housing act never fulfilled its promise to end residential segregation  it was another part of a massive effort to live up to the ideals america s founders only halfheartedly believed in   a record surpassed only by abraham lincoln ihle is under fire for jumping on the opportunity to use the word  n gger  in a context he assumed was safe the remark was in response to a thread about food stamps   the sort of  free stuff  the right often claims democrats use to get black votes  the implication  of course  is that black people only want  free stuff   while ihle used the quote in furtherance of racist bullsh t  something we can expect from pretty much any republican at any time  he defends his uncensored use of the n word  claiming the tweet is being is taken out of context  you know  just like he used the quote without providing context   that kind of racism needs to be rooted out of society and shining a light on it is an effective way to do so   ihle told wchs  he says that he was simply stating a  historical truth  and that he will not be taking the tweet down  he did not address the fact that there is little evidence that johnson even said the words he quoted while ihle doesn t see a problem with his  n gger  tweet  pretty much everyone else does     johnson was a racist  but he was a racist  just like my grandmother  who believed society s attitudes  including his own  needed to change  johnson recognized that he irrationally hated the very same people whose rights he fought for   it is not just negroes but all of us  who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry   he said of the plight of african americans  undoubtedly  he included himself in that assessment the first step toward change is self awareness  johnson knew enough to know he was a racist   something of which ihle seems incapable watch him defend his remarks below featured image via screen grab
