donald trump is attempting to actually  you know  run for president now  it s about time  right  instead of holding violent rallies in which he spews racist remark after racist remark  he is now actually attempting to give speeches with some substance that take on his incredibly formidable opposition  well  despite his best efforts  he is failing miserably at what political insiders are calling a deliberate pivot  nicolle wallace  who was the white house communications director under president george  w  bush had harsh words for trump s rebranding attempts  in short  it s not working  on msnbc live  wallace blasted trump  saying he s into the right wing conspiracy theories again when it comes to attacking hillary clinton  here is the transcript of her conversation with msnbc reporter brian williams  via media matters brian williams  and so  again  to take your model  that is to watch for  hours like a message control group  you think that fairly  nicolle wallce  like an experiment williams  yeah  and you think that that can be held up against as a test of the discipline of the new manafort era wallace  i just think that is the test  right  so we will say that he read from his teleprompter and our colleague  rachel  laughed at me last time i gave him credit for doing so  but i really   i think the test is to look at  whole hours  i will pledge  in service of this network  to watch the next  hours and report back  because what happened the last time  when he came out and gave a foreign policy speech that was riddled with its own problems  was that he stepped on his own message by trotting out conspiracy theories on fox   friends in the morning  so  this was a speech that had the definite imprint of paul manafort and the family  which has taken firm control of the trump campaign  trump  i m told  realized by sunday night that things weren t just bad  they were  quote  awful  and so  he is trying to make a pivot  and when you have such a small  skeletal campaign  you can pivot in two days because there s not very many people to turn around  so he has made that pivot in the last hour  but we do have to watch the next  hours  the next  you know  however many interviews he does and see if he veers wildly off message like he s done in the past  the thing is  much of what trump said during his anti hillary speech on wednesday is nothing more than lies from anti clinton books  such as the widely debunked clinton cash by peter schweizer  and crisis of character by gary byrne  mr  trump  you re going to have to do better than that  considering that all hillary clinton has to do is use your own literal words to show just how dangerous for america you are hell  even many members of your own party  veteran political operatives like nicolle wallace  can t stand you  that should tell you something  and none of it good watch the exchange below  again via media matters featured image via gerardo mora getty images
