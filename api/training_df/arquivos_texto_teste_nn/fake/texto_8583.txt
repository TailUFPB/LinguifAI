house of cards star kevin spacey  who plays the fictional character president frank underwood  sat down with cnbc international on thursday and just couldn t avoid getting asked questions concerning the  presidential election  chief among them was a question about what would happen if donald trump ever had to debate frank underwood here is the answer he gave  which drew quite a bit of laughter  he wouldn t  debate underwood   there would be a terrible accident  on the way to the debate  it would be terrible  and very sad  if that wasn t funny enough  he followed that up with his best trump impersonation  i m huuuge  i m too huge for this church  spacey is currently making rounds across the globe promoting the new upcoming season of house of cards  which airs in march  he was also asked this very same question at the annual skybridge capital reception hosted at a piano bar just a day earlier  he says he often gets asked the question of what would happen if frank underwood had to debate trump   who would win  i thought about this and i said   we must remember one important distinction  one of these characters is a fictional character  and the other is a fictional character   it turns out he s used this line in the past often  probably the best and most elaborate answer he s ever provided is from a q   a session with cnn he did back in september  oh  i think underwood  would win   he  would win  because he would kill donald trump  trump would never make it to election day  it d be over  done i think it would be great if donald trump started a feud with a fictional character  because maybe for once it would be a fair fight  perhaps trump will appear in season  of house of cards next year after he loses the real u s  election this november  he is  after all  a tv personality  it s not too far fetched that trump could be a rival of frank underwood one day featured image via screen capture
