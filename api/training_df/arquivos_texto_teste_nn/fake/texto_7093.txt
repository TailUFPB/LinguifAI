we all heard the reasons why republicans  mainly mitch mcconnell  swear that they will not confirm president obama s scotus nominee  it s all about the  process  or about rules that don t actually exist  that s what mitch keeps saying anyway  it turns out he s nothing but a damned liar  and the hard evidence is in the video below do you remember what mitch has been saying about why he s blocking the nominee  it s up to the next elected president to appoint a replacement  these were literally his exact words for weeks  he and other republicans claim it will give the american people a  voice  by voting for president  allowing them to determine what side gets to pick a replacement on the supreme court with mcconnell s exact words in mind  cnn host dana bash asked mitch if hillary or bernie won in november  would republicans then concede to the will of the people and vote on and or confirm merrick garland during the final months of the obama presidency the context is obvious  if democrats retain control of the presidency and the nominee was content with garland  then the  people  have spoken and a democratic nominee should get a hearing and be confirmed  it would be  the will of the people   as mitch keeps saying this is the part where mitch forgot what he was doing and accidentally spoke truthfully mitch s answer to dana was a total contradiction to every reason he s been giving about why he is holding up the confirmation process  mitch flat out said that republicans would never allow president obama s nominee to be placed on the supreme court  even if democrats won the presidential election in november  he literally went from saying if democrats win they get their pick  to saying even if they won republicans would not confirm their appointment  mcconnell s lame excuse was that the nra opposed garland  great   here we go with the nra again at this point  it s hard to say if this is a personal grudge mcconnell has with obama  or if this is really the will of the republican establishment  mitch has been working very hard for  long years to sabotage the president while obama just keeps handing him defeat after defeat  now  mitch s irrationally racist obsession with soiling the legacy of our first black president will officially extend beyond obama s second term in office one thing s for sure  mitch just proved what a total liar he is  that republicans do not actually care about the will of the voters  and that nobody can ever trust a republican for any reason watch mitch mcconnel prove what a liar he is below featured image via screen capture
