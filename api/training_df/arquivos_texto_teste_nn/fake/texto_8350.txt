something we keep hearing about hillary clinton is that the former secretary of state is pals with donald trump  of course this line is perpetuated by the fact that hillary did attend trump s wedding in   however  let s remember something  hillary was pretty powerful in new york at the time as a senator and was likely asked to attend in that capacity  but  myths being what they are  if it s repeated often enough that she s palling around with trump  at some point it becomes a  fact  that they re besties hillary has a four word message for all those out there who insist she s bff s with the donald  we were not friends  she exclusively told people for the upcoming issue  we were not friends  we knew each other  obviously  in new york  i knew a lot of people  also noting that she really doesn t give a sh t what he says about her either  i don t really care that much about what he says about me because i do see that as  you know  politics   not particularly the brand i approve of  who would approve of trump s brand of politics  it s smarmy  bigoted  abusive  and flat out wrong in so many ways  and even though trump said back in   hillary clinton  i think  is a terrific woman  i have known her for years  i live in new york  she lives in new york  and i ve known her and her husband for years and i really like them both a lot  it lines up with what hillary said about their relationship perfectly  and doesn t prove  whatsoever  that they re pals  what it shows is trump doing what trump does   do what s in the best interest of trump  which is say and do anything that will go to his favor  for all we know he could like the clintons a lot  or he may loathe them  trump says what he wants to at any time  and that could change at any given moment at this moment in time  you ve really got to take hillary at her word on this  because not only does her explanation make perfect sense  it lines up with trump as well  so what if they know each other  she knows a lot of people  a lot  so does he  it doesn t mean that their all best friends forever featured image  flickr
