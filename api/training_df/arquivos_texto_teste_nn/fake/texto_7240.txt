today we found out who s really in control of the republican party  the religious right or corporate america  in georgia  at least  big business reigns supreme  in a move that is sure to exacerbate the tensions within the republican party  georgia s republican governor nathan deal has vetoed a controversial  religious freedom  bill that was aimed at legalizing anti lgbt discrimination deal s decision comes two weeks after the state legislature passed a bill aimed at shoring up the rights of religious organizations to refuse services that clash with their faith  particularly with regard to same sex marriage immediately after passing that bill  georgia came under fire from numerous large corporations like disney  the nfl and others who threatened to boycott the state or move their business elsewhere  the top show on television  the walking dead  also threatened to leave the state if the bill was signed into law liberals are celebrating  but took the entirely wrong message from the veto  today  governor deal heard the voices of georgians  civil rights organizations  as well as the many leaders in the entertainment industry and private sector who condemned this attack on the fundamental rights of lgbt people  and he has set an example for other elected officials to follow   chad griffin  president of the human rights campaign  said in a statement while conservatives turned around and blamed liberals and politically correct something or another  i m assuming the death threats have already started flowing in to deal s office but governor deal is not a sudden proponent of lgbt rights  he s a republican  that should give a hint that the only reason this happened is because corporate america told him what to do  since marriage equality and lgbt rights won the culture war  being seen as anti lgbt hurts profits that is  literally  the bottom line while pounding their chest about  religious freedom  still helps republican politicians in their benighted conservative states  being associated with the anti lgbt movement hurts corporations  even chick fil a had to back down after acting on their anti gay sentiments in the form of donations to anti lgbt groups  yes  there was a surge in business as bigoted conservatives rushed out to support the fast food company but once that died down  the boycott and bad pr remained being publicly anti lgbt is bad business  doing business in an anti lgbt state is bad business  too  that s why corporations keep threatening to leave states that pass what are laws essentially legalizing discrimination and hate  in a state like georgia  one of the few red states with a functioning economy  they can t risk the loss of business for a pointless ideological fight that s going to eventually be struck down by the soon to be liberal controlled supreme court this is not a new victory for the lgbt community so much as a predictable and direct consequence of their already winning the war  still tastes pretty sweet though  doesn t it featured image via jewel samad afp getty images
