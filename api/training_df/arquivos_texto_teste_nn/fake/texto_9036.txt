a university of north texas student is in critical condition after one of the nra s  responsible gun owners  shot her in the head during a roadway dispute  according to police  the shooting occurred shortly after  a m on new year s day  police arrived at what they assumed was a run of the mill new year s drunk driving incident  but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near texas woman s university had been shot in the head according to witnesses  the driver   a  year old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of new year s terror when an suv carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them  the occupants of the vehicles apparently argued  leading the men to do what gun toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan after taking a bullet to the head  the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole  her passengers suffered minor injuries  one of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released  the driver remains in critical condition  the shooter  of course  fled the scene along with his friends according to witnesses  at least two of them men were seen at a new year s eve party earlier that night  though there are no other leads that would help locate them unfortunately  people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes  according to a harvard school of public health study  in addition  a university of wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the second amendment stick hopefully  the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is  the nra constantly tells us that  responsible gun owners  will save us   but the problem is that everyone who owns a gun is  responsible    until they aren t  everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t since the open carry of handguns just became legal in texas with the start of the new year  we can surely expect to see more of this from the lone star state the victim   sara mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before  p m  she had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night featured image via odisha sun times
