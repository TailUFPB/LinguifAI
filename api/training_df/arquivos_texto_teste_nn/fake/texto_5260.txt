donald trump is not a detail person  learning about issues is apparently below his pay grade  as is spelling  at least if you look at his latest attempt to attack hillary clinton on friday night  trump tweeted this hillary clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement   insticts   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    you notice it  well  there are three  maybe four  things  actually  he misspelled  loose    judgment  and  instincts    in that  might be grammatically okay  but it s still awkward the problem with a campaign that s being run almost entirely on twitter  is that most people reading the tweets also have twitter accounts and they are quick to jump on tweets like trump  they didn t let us down  here are just a few of the responses    realdonaldtrump you ll have to do some editing to get this under  again but the mistakes were too bad to ignore pic twitter com   shrillary tintin   theshrillest  july     realdonaldtrumpquick spelling lesson  lose   opposite of  win  loose   your mom  matthew inman   oatmeal  july     sheilainct  realdonaldtrump nah  every time he speaks he embarrasses himself  what s a few more typos   the nostra thomas   tomtrudeau  july    realdonaldtrump how s the spelling going over there  big cheeto   andrew w chamings   andrewchamings  july       nevertrump sorry  i honestly thought this tweet was a joke  trump has the insight and intellect of a angry  year old boy  andrew w chamings   andrewchamings  july    realdenaldtrump  realdonaldtrump dirty don  you ve got the best words  unfortunately you can t spell them  you ve become a national joke   scott kuhn     july     realdonaldtrump dummy pic twitter com pcrywfffrn  drew olanoff   drew  july    hillary clinton responded    andrewchamings  realdonaldtrump it might just be  twitter  but he s running for president  he should know how to spell  maybe   hillary for america   nevertrump  july    isn t the first time trump has been ridiculed for gawdawful spelling in his tweets  even the conservative daily caller mocked the republican candidate for his spelling that would be bad if he were in middle school  and then  there was this back in february if you think about it  proper spelling is probably low on the list of presidential qualifications  but this is a sign of something much more dangerous  this is a time when trump should be putting his best  most professional face forward  and his sloppiness is an indication that he s really not ready to lead the country  he s impetuous and  in fact  he s the  lose  cannon  we need a president who thinks before speaking  and the fact that trump can t even be bothered to run his tweets through a spell checker shows that he has no intention of taking professionalism with him to the white house featured image via sara d  davis at getty images
