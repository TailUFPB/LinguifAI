for years  a street preacher has been embarrassing christians by peddling what can only be described as extremist bullsh t unfit for a family gathering at the palin household  brother dean saxton  who has been raising eyebrows and blood pressures while simultaneously lowering the standards of human decency by standing around holding  you deserve rape  signs on college campuses and other places   a message to  whores   that s  christian extremist  for  women   that if they decide to consume a single drop of alcohol  or wear something that exposes so much as an ankle or a shoulder blade they deserve whatever happens to them  i think that girls that dress and act like it   saxton told the daily wildcat in    they should realize that they do have partial responsibility  because i believe that they re pretty much asking for it   he s also made some less than nice remarks about african americans and the lgbt community   though he is most famous for telling every female rape victim that they were asking for it  here are just a few examples of the dumbass bullsh t that goes on inside the cesspool that is this jerk s mind via arizona daily wildcat   now  you may have been wondering  a question may have been burning within you  when the hell is someone just going to take a baseball bat to this motherf cker while he was holding his hateful  you deserve to be raped  sign and condemning women who leave their homes without covering themselves head to toe in front of apollo high school in glendale  arizona  a female student grabbed a baseball bat and hit him in the head  the bible says it s not okay to be gay   he yelled  holding his hateful  rape  sign in his hands in a double whammy expression of hatred   you need to stop doing naught  nasty things  apollo high school  you need to stop looking up naughty  nasty things on the internet   all the while  for some inexplicable reason  he was recording the children video posted by the preacher himself shows numerous students and teachers approaching him  demanding that he leave  as one gentleman informed saxton that he shouldn t be displaying this sort of message to kids  we hear a loud  metallic impact noise with students cheering in the background  the gentleman to whom saxton was speaking calmly said   you see that  that s what i m telling you  saxton then beat a hasty retreat as the students told him to get lost tabitha brubaker    was certainly wrong to respond with violence  but when you think about it it was really saxton s fault by his own logic  like men who can t resist raping those dirty  dirty whores who go outside looking like sluts with their elbows and knees showing  the ones he says deserve to be raped   we really can t blame brubaker for giving into her inability to deal with misogynist bullsh t and acting on her natural urge to bust this smarmy motherf cker s head open  after all  by preaching hate in front of a high school  didn t he place himself in a scenario where he was likely to meet someone who wasn t willing to deal with his particular brand of awfulness though some would award her a medal  what brubaker did was a crime and she has been charged with felony assault  she also had some weed on her  so she was charged with possession of a plant as well watch the full incident below featured image via screengrab
