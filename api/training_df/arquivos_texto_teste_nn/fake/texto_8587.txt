some people in life still haven t grasped the fact that all people should be treated equally  many still feel it is well within their rights to be discriminatory based upon personal beliefs  such is the case with deepika avanti who lists herself as a  holistic therapist  and  psychic healer  avanti  along with being a  psychic healer   is also a property owner in boulder  colorado who leases out her property to renters  however  when one couple who sought to rent her property  avanti flat out rejected them  why  because she didn t want the  uniqueness  of the couple to harm her position within her community  what makes this couple so unique  they are a lesbian couple  and one of the women is transgender rachel and tonya smith  alongside their adorable child  are seeking legal action against avanti with the help of lambda legal  according to the legal documents  defendant suggested that the smith family look for housing in a  larger town where the community would better accept them and intimated that she did not see them as a legitimate familial unit who could live together on her property  rachel smith said  we just thought it was a little bit ridiculous  particularly given that boulder is known for being a more liberal  open minded area  honestly  if this was going to happen in colorado  i would expect it maybe in colorado springs  but not so much out of boulder  and especially not in gold hill  i thought it was more accepting  good on these women for not backing down in the face of discrimination  the only way some of these bigots are going to realize they are  in fact  bigots  is by throwing their bigotry back in their bigoted faces  you d think this woman  being a psychic and all  would ve seen this lawsuit coming  but apparently she s as good of psychic as she is a landlord  video  youtube featured image  youtube
