immediately after the police identified the suspect in the florida high school massacre  as  year old nikolas cruz  the media began to scour social media  desperate to find any ties cruz may have had to the  right   in the media s narrow minds  you can t be a gun owner and not be tied to the republican party  the republican party and the nra must be held accountable  and they must be held accountable at all costs  even at the cost of being accurate or truthful  when the media couldn t find any facts to report  they immediately began to scour social media for hints   what they got was a bunch of social media trolls who thought it would be funny to lead the mainstream media on with lies about the shooter  the mainstream media and the anti defamation league  who ironically  claims to defend people who are victims of discrimination  yet works overtime to demonize anyone whose views are to the right of theirs   had to settle for fake ties to the massacre suspect and  white supremacist  group in tallahassee  florida unfortunately  both the media and the anti defamation league s stories quickly fell apart when they were outed for not having done their homework to properly vet the comments made on an open chat  social media platform called  on thursday afternoon  the anti defamation league reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with nikolas cruz  who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least  people  including many high school students  at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland  florida from the anti defamation league s website a spokesperson for the white supremacist group republic of florida  rof  claimed to the anti defamation league on thursday  february   that nikolas cruz  the man charged with the previous day s deadly shooting spree at a parkland  florida  high school  was associated with his group update  on thursday afternoon  following news reports of the alleged association between cruz and the republic of florida  a member of an alt right discussion forum wrote that all of the claims were false and were part of an elaborate attempt to troll a network news reporter and other media outlets  at a press conference thursday afternoon  the broward county sheriff said a connection was  not confirmed at this time   but that law enforcement was still investigating cruz    a former student at marjory stoneman douglas high school  allegedly entered the school wednesday  february  with an ar  and opened fire  killing at least  people and injuring  more  cruz left the scene but was later captured by police and has been charged with premeditated murder after self described rof members claimed on the discussion forum  that cruz had also been a member  the anti defamation league spoke with an rof member who identified himself as jordan jereb jereb  based in tallahassee  is believed to be the leader of rof   in   he was arrested on charges of threatening a staffer in the office of florida governor rick scott because he was allegedly angry at the staffer s son jereb said that cruz was associated with rof  having been  brought up  by another member   jereb also claimed that cruz had participated in one or more rof training exercises in the tallahassee area  carpooling with other rof members from south florida rof has members in north and south florida  the alt right white supremacist group borrows paramilitary concepts from the anti government extremist militia movement  not itself a white supremacist movement    rof describes itself as a  white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics  and seeks to create a  white ethnostate  in florida   most rof members are young and the group itself is only a few years old jereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shooting if cruz s role is confirmed  the parkland school shooting would be the second school shooting by a white supremacist in the past two months  in december   another young white supremacist  william atchison  engaged in a shooting spree at a high school in northwest new mexico  killing two students before shooting himself what we know about rof  the republic of florida   a spokesperson for the white supremacist group republic of florida  rof  told the anti defamation league on thursday  february   that nikolas cruz  was associated with his group   the adl reported  the adl quoted a man named jordan jereb  who runs the small group  which is based in tallahassee  jereb added that rof had not ordered or wanted cruz to do anything like the school shooting   the adl wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by abc news and the associated press  and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets  even the daily stormer  a neo nazi website  picked up the claim some outlets reported they had their own conversations with jereb or classmates of cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of cruz with rof but a few hours later  after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking cruz to rof  jereb said his identification of cruz was a  misunderstanding  and that he  too  had been the subject of a  prank   on online forums and twitter  trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed  politico reports   all of our evidence seems to point to the adl getting this wrong   said joan donovan  a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for data   society  a think tank in new york city the adl subsequently revised its report  as did many news outlets  adl shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events   an adl spokesperson said in a statement on friday   confirmation of whether cruz was part of rof is now in the hands of law enforcement  and that s what the broward sheriff s team is looking into  the adl traced its original tip to posts on   where researchers found  self described rof members  claiming that cruz was a brother in arms  but many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researchers on wednesday  an anonymous  user posted about receiving a message on instagram from an abc news reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew cruz  prime trolling opportunity   another user replied  you have to take advantage of this   a third chimed in he asked for proof of the reporter s identity  according to posted screenshots from their correspondence  the reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an abc identification badge some on the  thread joked about sending back obscene photos  but others gave concrete tips for tricking the reporter   keep talking to her so she gains your trust    keep this going be realistic   say you have known him for years you met him on a liberal facebook page years ago and you have kept in touch    say you are scared to tell her in case you get blamed  it will get her excited you know something big  this particular  user seems to have sent the reporter a racist cartoon and was quickly blocked  many on the forum ripped into him for missing a  a golden opportunity
