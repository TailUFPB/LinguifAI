millions of immigrants came to america through ellis island in new york city and were greeted by the statue of liberty  they came with hopes for a better life  to a place where big dreams are encouraged because with hard work  and determination  those dreams can come true in new york  these big dreams are emblematic of bernie sanders  campaign message  throughout his political career  he has demonstrated the honesty  integrity and work ethic required to turn ideas into reality  the story of a lower middle class jewish brooklyn kid becoming mayor of a city in vermont by ten votes after rigorous grassroots organizing  defying the odds stacked against him by getting elected to congress as an independent  and managing to serve there for over  years shows the kind of tenacity that makes new yorkers stand apart  new york is where the most ambitious and driven go to change the world  and that s what bernie sanders  campaign is looking to do  not just continue with the status quo  new yorkers are people who dared to take a risk or do whatever it takes to see their dreams come true  people still come to new york with the new york state of mind   if they can make it here they can

through working with one another and talking to one another about the issues bernie sanders has been addressing  rather than rely on wealthy corporate donors or the mainstream media to spread the message of the campaign  bernie sanders has relied on everyday americans and their resiliency to keep fighting despite the odds stacked against them by the establishment  popular consensus thought it was unrealistic to think bernie sanders could ever challenge hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination  but his campaign has overcome the adversity of those notions and is transforming the country s political landscape new yorkers know all about resiliency and coming together in the face of adversity  after the terrorist attacks on    new york led the way in bringing americans together  helping to rebuild what was lost  banding together to move forward to a better  safer future  new yorkers showed the world their resiliency once again in response to hurricane sandy  when new yorkers who still had electricity and water unabated  lent a helping hand to their neighbors in a world where violence and tragedy are covered daily in mainstream media  new yorkers have shown the world time and again good prevails against evil  in   new yorker s stories began to be encapsulated by the humans of new york project  cataloging the diversity and beauty of new yorkers for the world to see  it s known as the greatest city in the world because of its history  diversity  and character  which all attest to the greatest achievements of mankind many of the nation s historic battles with the labor movement took place in new york  samuel gompers  a new york native  was the american federation of labor s first president  called new york city   the cradle of the american labor movement   that labor movement brought america the  hour work week  and drastically improved working conditions and labor laws  today in new york  labor unions maintain more membership and power than any other state in the country  no other presidential candidate has been fighting for workers  rights to the extent bernie sanders has in october   bernie sanders was the only candidate who took time off from campaigning to join a picket line with verizon workers and union members in new york city who were fighting for a fair contract and to have an employee who was fired for leading an organizing campaign reinstated  he is the only presidential candidate who supports a   minimum wage  and only his economic policies go far enough to help rebuild the working and middle classes in this country  the average american has not had an increase in pay in  years  but things have cost more in the marketplaces  he has been in a recession for  years  nothing has changed for him  up at the top  we re not in a recession  but  percent of the americans have been in a recession for at least  years   said new york native and godfather of wall street  asher edelman  in an interview on cnbc fast money edelman endorsed bernie sanders on the show  if you look at something called velocity of money  that means how much gets spent and turns around   he said   when you have the top  percent getting money  they spend five to ten percent of what they earn  when you have the lower end of the economy they spend  or  percent of what they earn  as you ve had a transfer of wealth and income to the top  you have a shrinking consumer base basically and a shrinking velocity of money  bernie is the only person out there who i think is talking at all about both fiscal stimulation and banking rules that will get the banks to generate lending again as opposed to speculation  so from an economic point its straight forward  bernie sanders campaign is what new york is all about  new york is dubbed the  empire state  not because of its millionaires  billionaires  and corporations  but because its wealth lies in its diversity  character  ambition  and resources which are all quintessentially american bernie sanders  popularity has manifested in the form of record attendances at his campaign rallies and an overtaking of the internet by his supporters because his campaign has that same addictive energy as new york  the people are what are driving bernie sanders campaign  and the people are what make new york so great  hard working americans have been devoting both contributions and their free time to the campaign because the ideology behind bernie sanders  campaign is a future americans can believe in  and millions of americans are willing to put in the work to achieve it featured image via flickr
