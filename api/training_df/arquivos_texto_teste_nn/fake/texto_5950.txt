do you hear that sound  that sizzling and popping  that s the beautiful melody of the heads of conservatives across the nation exploding in the wake of some very  very bad news  for them  delivered by the  circuit court of appeals in california  in a precedent setting decision  the san fransisco based court ruled thursday that gun owners do not have a constitutional right to conceal carry their weapons if they face no specific threat the court determined that san diego and yolo counties did not violate the second amendment when they denied some applicants concealed carry licenses  in those counties  applicants must show  good cause  to be armed at all times  in other words  a woman who is being stalked by her ex boyfriend or someone in a dangerous profession can carry their guns around because they have a legitimate need for protection  someone who just feels like taking his gun to the grocery store  however  might want to think twice before he tucks it in his waistband  in a  page opinion  judge william fletcher wrote  because the second amendment does not protect in any degree the right to carry concealed firearms in public  any prohibition or restriction a state may choose to impose on concealed carry   including the requirement of  good cause   however defined   is necessary allowed by the amendment   the  circuit said reuters notes that this ruling isn t exactly unusual the ruling places the  circuit court in line with other u s  appellate courts that have upheld the right of officials in the states of new york  maryland and new jersey to deny concealed carry applications in certain cases under california s concealed carry law  more than   residents or less than  percent of the state s population had active permits last year  according to the center for investigative reporting the u s  supreme court in   in the middle of a raging national debate on guns  declined to weigh in on whether firearm owners have a constitutional right to carry their weapons in concealment outside the home this is also in line with the supreme court s  finding that the right of the people to bear arms is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons  this decision reversed a     decision by a  circuit court panel that found california residents have an inherent right to carry concealed weapons  while this issue may seem settled  these gun owners promise to keep fighting for the right to carry their confidence around with them everywhere they roam   though they may be in for a bit of a surprise  as the supreme court could refuse to hear the case because other circuit courts have upheld limitations on the issuance of concealed carry permits featured image via toberight com
