bernie sanders smacked down a man at his harlem rally on saturday when he tried to imply that the senator was a supporter of israel s war against palestine at the end of the event  a man grabbed the microphone from someone and brought up sanders  religion and the fact that he once spent a year in israel before saying  as you know  the zionist jews   and i don t mean to offend anybody   they run the federal reserve  they run wall street  they run every campaign  bernie  realizing where the question was going  shook his head and said   brother  brother  brother   the man finished his question  what is your affiliation to your jewish community  that s all i m asking  no  no  no   sanders shot back   that s not what you re asking  he s right  what the man was really doing was trying to imply that the senator is just like the republican party and blindly supports what israel is doing to the palestinian people  he wanted people to think that just because the democratic candidate is proud of his ancestry and religion  that he s totally cool with benjamin netanyahu s reign of terror on palestine in his quest to steal all of their land  that s what the man was doing instead of rising to the bait  bernie took the opportunity to discuss his position on israel and palestine  i am proud to be jewish  but you re not going to find any candidate running for president  for example  talking about zionism and the middle east  i am a strong defender of israel  but i also believe that we have got to pay attention to the needs of the palestinian people  there are wonderful people  i ve met them  on both sides of that issue and there are bad people on both sides of that issue  and if we are gonna bring peace  hopefully  god willing  in the middle east we are gonna have to treat both sides with respect and equality  so while it is unfortunate that our lawmakers support israel  they really shouldn t  the reality of the current situation makes it impossible not to   even senator sanders knows that  but it is important to realize that you would never  ever hear donald trump or ted cruz say that we need to treat the palestinian people with respect  they are too busy calling them  terrorists  and kissing netanyahu s ass watch  featured image via video screenshot
