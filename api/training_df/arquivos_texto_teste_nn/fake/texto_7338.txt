ted cruz has said many stupid things during his run for the republican nomination yet it s no surprise  he s still a contender among gop candidates since all the choices are pretty bad  the senator from texas faced tough questions from cbs this morning hosts about his call for law enforcement officials to patrol muslim communities  after the attacks in belgium  cruz said  we need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized  cbs hosts demanded an answer to his bizarre suggestion on how it would logistically work to patrol millions of muslims who are not  ghetto ized  in radical communities as cruz had suggested  cruz also admitted that he didn t even know how many muslims live in america when asked by co host norah o donnell  co host gayle king then slammed cruz  there are so many people that say that your comments are decidedly anti muslim  and that you re playing right into the hands of isis  you re giving them ammunition to come after us  to really take action against us  instead of addressing the issue  the creepy cruz went on a nonsensical tangent about political correctness  he said  gayle with all respect  people are fed up with the political correctness of barack obama and hillary clinton  islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad  king then pointed out cruz was painting a broad population  with one brush  king is correct  not only is cruz painting millions of people with  one brush   but his rhetoric is very dangerous because it vilifies millions of people and dehumanizing them  moreover  as president obama stated following the attacks on belgium   what they can do is scare and make people afraid and disrupt our daily lives and divide us and as long as we don t allow that to happen  we re gonna be okay  that s what cruz does with his rhetoric  he divides americans and that s not the type of leadership we need in this country watch video here    featured image via video screenshot
