as the polls closed for the republican primary on super tuesday  illinois experienced a phenomenon that could only have been captured by being in the right place at the right time  the moment lightning struck the trump tower in downtown chicago instagram user  mrmikeyv posted a video of this coincidental  once in a lifetime event  captioning the clip perfectly by writing   lightning storm ironically hitting the trump building on  supertuesday   polls were closing just as this force of nature occurred  revealing that the business mogul had taken illinois as a win  as well as florida and north carolina  clearly  mother nature wasn t happy about that lightning storm ironically hitting the trump building on  supertuesday    thepassportreport  instachicagoa video posted by  mrmikeyv on mar    at   pdtthis ironically timed  strange message from mother nature was a result of a major storm in northern illinois  which resulted in approximately six tornadoes that damaged several houses and a church  the super tuesday polls revealed that trump got   percent of the vote in illinois  along with  delegates from the state despite running a campaign based on bigotry  violence and some of the most extreme rhetoric a presidential campaign has ever seen  trump has been unstoppable   even though he hasn t proposed one solid solution that will actually  make america great again   trump has risen above negative reports about lawsuits from his failed businesses  his awful misogynistic track record with women  support from white supremacists  and constant flip flopping and lies  still  he s continued on to defeat every single one of the gop s incapable yet better than trump candidates aside from ted cruz and john kasich  although they probably don t stand a chance against the front runner  america is getting desperate for ways to end this trump nightmare once and for all perhaps it was divine intervention that caused the sky to open up and rain down on illinois as trump won yet another state  striking one of the candidate s precious towers in disappointment  unfortunately  the trump tower still stands and was barely phased by it  trump is also still standing  running for the gop nomination  and winning  featured image via instagram screenshot and flickr
