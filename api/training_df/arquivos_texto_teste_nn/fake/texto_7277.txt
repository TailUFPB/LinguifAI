this story is the perfect example of just how detached from reality the american right wing has become  two white nationalists  read as  virulent racists  are so excited about how many new racists have come crawling out of the woodwork because of trump  they can t help but giggle over it on saturday   taylor joined  political cesspool  host james edwards on his program  where the two expressed optimism about the future of what edwards called the  pro white  movement  something that they attributed in part to trump s candidacy edwards gushed about an  awakening happening within the spirit of our people  that was beyond his  wildest dreams  when he started his program taylor said that he too was  hugely encouraged  by the growth of the movement  particularly among  young people  who have  grown up with it   he described it as  a real sea change  and i get it  if i were an openly racist scumbag  i would also be thrilled that so many closeted scumbag racists are coming out into the open  people like taylor and edwards have always insisted that they represent a  silent majority  of whites  why  if there was only some way to bring them all out into the open  we could finally have the second civil race war that would forever establish american white supremacy in case you re unfamiliar with the white supremacy movement and think i m exaggerating  you must not know about the turner diaries  a wildly popular book among racists  here s part of the wikipedia summary the novel ends with an epilogue from the year   summarizing how the organization continued on to conquer the rest of the world and how all non white races were eliminated  africa was invaded and all of its black inhabitants were killed  the puerto ricans  described as a  repulsive mongrel race   were exterminated and the island of puerto rico was re colonized by whites  when china begins an attempt to invade european russia  the organization launches a full scale assault with nuclear  chemical  radiological and biological weapons which render the entire continent of asia uninhabitable and rife with  mutants   and in america  the last remaining non white elements are hunted down as well as all individuals involved in organized crime  such as the mafia  so  yeah  these are heady times for racists  trump has made it ok for them to be out in the open and at political rallies  white power is on the rise but here s the problem  it isn t  at all america is a deeply racist county but racism flies in the face of everything we say we believe in  equality  fairness  justice  etc  that means we like our racism to be out of sight  out of mind  in the   when white america saw hundreds of peaceful black protesters being savagely attacked by the police  they pushed back and the civil rights act was passed  lesson learned  keep it on the downlow  give white people the ability to deny that racism is a problem and they ll happily ignore it  shove it in their faces and they get really mad  next thing you know  blacks have more rights and more justice how dreadful with the rise of trump and his white nationalist army of violent thugs  the public is being exposed  once again  to widespread racism  specifically widespread conservative racism  yes  liberal racism exists but we re not fucking proud of it like conservatives are   the more preening idiots like taylor and edwards parade their hate in public at republican rallies  the less plausible deniability the gop has  not for nothing  you don t see neo nazis and the kkk coming out to support a democratic candidate  ever the corporate media has bent over backwards to under report this fact but it s getting harder to hide  trump is drawing out the worst elements of america s conservative movement for everyone to see  more importantly  that element will refuse to go back into the closet after trump loses and fades from view  republicans will be forced to loudly denounce the very racists they used to rely on or be permanently labeled as the party of white supremacy  an electoral kiss of death  republicans will lose their racist base and the racists will lose their political party so even as taylor and edwards giggle at their  rising  power  they re guaranteeing themselves a future as a marginalized voice in america politics and they re going to cripple the conservative movement in the process keep laughing  dumbasses  keeeeeep laughing featured image via getty
