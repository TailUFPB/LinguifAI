despite a petition calling for guns to be allowed at the upcoming republican national convention in cleveland  ohio  accumulating more than   signatures  the secret service has killed what many see as the perfect scenario for natural selection to do its job  this masterful piece of trolling started as a tongue in cheek statement about how  responsible gun owners  are allowed to place everyone at risk everywhere else  yet enjoy safety from armed maniacs whenever they congregate   but the right wing began to take it seriously  demanding that their rights not be infringed on monday  the killjoys in the secret service announced that attendees will not be permitted to carry their confidence on their hips at the convention   no matter how badly quite literally everybody  even donald trump  wants it secret service spokesman robert hoback explained that  only authorized law enforcement personnel  working with the agency will be allowed to bring their weapons inside  individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint  regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event   hoback told the hill  explaining that everyone else will have to leave the second amendment freedumbs at the door this  of course  was a huge disappointment to people who really wanted to see how this sort of thing would play out  with some even suggesting crowdfunding an open bar just to help things along      we must take a stand  we cannot allow the national nominating convention of the party of lincoln and reagan to be hijacked by weakness and political correctness   the hilarious petition reads   the policies of the quicken loans arena do not supersede the rights given to us by our creator in the u s  constitution  this is a direct affront to the second amendment and puts all attendees at risk   the petitioner writes in his attempt to create chaos simply by allowing violent  gun obsessed republicans to be themselves despite the clearly satirical nature of the petition  donald trump stands behind it  though he wants to  read the fine print  before his supporters are allowed to carry guns   which is probably a good idea  the rnc  of course  jumped on the chance to evade any responsibility for the very  very bad idea it would be to allow right wingers to carry guns into what will almost certainly be a volatile environment  the republican party has been and will continue to be a staunch supporter of the second amendment   said convention spokeswoman kirsten kukowski   it is in our platform and is strongly supported by our candidates the republican national convention is a national special security event which means the secret service is the lead agency and we will defer to their planning as it relates to safety and security of the convention  this may seem surprising to hear from us  but the secret service should reconsider  if the people want republicans to be able to carry their guns at the convention  they should be allowed  after all  we have to deal with them in restaurants  grocery stores  schools  hospitals  and anywhere else guns should not be allowed  it would be nice for them to experience what they force the rest of us to deal with on a daily basis for once if someone is hurt or killed  it s just the  price of freedom   isn t that what they say whenever a child dies in a completely preventable shooting featured image via dallas news
