on tuesday morning  republican front runner donald trump was supposed to go on several television appearances  but wimped out at the last minute and decided to do audio interviews instead  the reason for this sudden change of heart  he just didn t feel pretty enough cnn money reported that trump was scheduled appear on nbc  abc  cbs  fox news  and msnbc  but told all the networks that he was experiencing  technical difficulties  on his end and begged them to let him do the interview over the phone instead  most of the programs agreed to trump s demands  but this response from cbs this morning s executive producer chris licht proved that not everyone was buying it twitterso far  three network sources  who wish to remain anonymous  said they felt trump s so called  technical issues  were an  excuse    and when you consider this following statement  it certainly looks like it  according to someone who heard trump refuse an on camera interview  trump needs to be a little more careful when he spews flat out lies  he didn t like the shot  but he didn t realize that his microphone was on for everyone to hear  the source reported that trump said  i don t like the way i look  just tell them there s technical issues  several hours later  cnn s ashleigh banfield called trump out on air  making it perfectly and hilariously clear just why trump was giving audio only interviews earlier that day  she explained to her guests  i want to run his sound byte  it is on the phone because he cancelled all of his on camera appearances  he was heard by a technician saying   i don t like the way i look so tell them there is a technical issue   and he carried on his interviews by phone  that s why we are hearing it by phone  can we seriously trust a presidential candidate whose self esteem is just as back and forth as his positions on policies  the fact that he has to modify his interviews just because he doesn t like the way he looks is a clear sign that he can t be a confident leader and focus on more important matters  featured image via gage skidmore
