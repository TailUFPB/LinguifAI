ted cruz probably wishes donald trump had attended the debate last night because without trump  all of the focus on thursday night turned to ted cruz  who is in second place behind the billionaire real estate mogul as seven republicans took the stage for the official debate in iowa last night  trump held his own competing event  one would think that would especially benefit ted cruz  but he failed to deliver and the des moines register declared that he had a  rough night  in other words  without trump  cruz took over the spotlight and everyone was able to witness him fall on his face as the other candidates and the moderators turned their attention on him because the donald was not there to be a distraction  if that is what trump planned for all along  his strategy to skip the debate was a masterstroke ted cruz ended up being plastered on the front page of the register on friday morning with a headline that will be hard to swallow for the cruz campaign  but the main story didn t go any better for the texas senator either  without the dominant national front runner in the room  the target was the candidate who inherited center stage for the night  ted cruz   the front page read   but the texas u s  senator largely forfeited this golden opportunity  indeed  even iowa republican activists believe cruz was the loser in this debate  candidates and voters are not putting up with him tonight   said emily grimm  a  year old republican activist from des moines   i don t think there was a clear winner at this debate  but i think the clear loser was cruz  cruz always knows how to use standard republican sound bites to garner applause  the moment he senses that he might be losing the crowd with policy  he just throws in a few grand words to gain applause   said grimm  a fiscal conservative who worked for mark jacobs   u s  senate campaign at one point in the debate  cruz channeled trump by complaining about the moderators like a toddler and threatened to leave the stage  if you guys ask one more mean question  i may have to leave the stage   cruz said and that didn t go over very well at all university of iowa political science professor tim hagle said the attack  fell really flat  he seemed plastic and insincere   said another iowa republican  according to politico  his entanglement with the moderators was one of the worst moments for a candidate in any of the debates   a new hampshire republican told politico and yet another iowa republican explained why trump made a good move by sitting out while cruz got hammered  trump got exactly what he wanted  nobody lays a glove on him  while the rest of the field beat each other up  better yet  trump got both former caucus winners to attend his event  and his main competitor  ted cruz  might have had his worst debate performance of the campaign  ted cruz clearly has his presidential aspirations tied to iowa  should he lose  he would be faced with overcoming trump s  point lead in new hampshire and his  point lead in south carolina make no mistake  losing the last debate before iowa votes is a disaster for cruz and as previously stated  he probably wishes trump had been present at the debate  because if he had been  cruz would not be the butt of embarrassing headlines today featured image  twitter
