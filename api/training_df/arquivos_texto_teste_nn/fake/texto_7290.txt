in the world of politics there are going to be scandals  it s just a fact  there s no way around it  they can be true or they can be false  but they are going to happen no matter who you are  what s important  however  is how one handles the scandals  and so far republican presidential candidate ted cruz has shown that he can t handle much of anything thrown his way with the national enquirer printing a story that alleges cruz s involved with five different women other than his wife   cruzsexscandal quickly started to take over social media and the national conversation  is the story true  who knows  really  but at this point it doesn t really matter  because it s out there now  cruz could simply shrug off these allegations  or even laugh at them for how ridiculous they may be  but instead he chose to throw a ginormous hissy fit on facebook and blames the entire thing on donald trump  and who knows  maybe trump is to blame  however  how cruz is handling all of this shows how he may handle times of trouble  and let s just say  it ain t pretty cruz wrote on facebook  i want to be crystal clear  these attacks are garbage  for donald j  trump to enlist his friends at the national enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low donald won t go these smears are completely false  they re offensive to heidi and me  they re offensive to our daughters  and they re offensive to everyone donald continues to personally attack donald trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt i want to be crystal clear  these attacks are garbage  for donald j  trump to enlist his friends at the national posted by ted cruz on friday  march     ted  calm down  if the story from the national enquirer is false  it will simply drift away over the course of the  hour news cycle  drawing further attention to it  and acting so defensive doesn t necessarily make you look guilty  but it also doesn t make you look good  it s a tabloid paper that will also talk about people giving birth to aliens and  or maybe the queen of england taking up heroin  it s not like it was printed in the new york times or the wall street journal  simmer down now  stuff like this is inevitably going to come up  true or not  for goodness sake  ask a clinton if this is how he handles ridiculous stories about himself  how the hell is he going to handle being commander in chief  simple   he won t be able to no matter who  vote blue featured image via gage skidmore  flickr
