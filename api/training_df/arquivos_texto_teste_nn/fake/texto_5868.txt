as the gop presidential nominee  republicans have  as of late  been grudgingly getting behind donald trump  following the massacre in orlando  though  it seems that senate republicans can t stomach the thought of even mentioning trump s name anymore  on capitol hill  the mood is one of depression  fatigue  and giving up and of simmering anger instead of being classy and offering condolences  or even just saying he was saddened at the loss of so many lives  trump gloated over being right about radical islam  and said we need toughness and vigilance  then he expanded his  ban all muslims  policy proposal to include people from any country with any history of terrorism  and said he d accomplish that through executive order can we say  despotic  he also blamed obama for the attack by calling him weak  and insinuating he might even be helping the terrorists that might be what his drone like fans want to hear  but putting the blame on obama was what sent majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  over the edge on trump  he told politico  i m not going to be commenting on presidential candidates today  that s it  that s all  he s spent a lot of time explaining what trump needs to do differently  and how he needs to tone it down  and it s fallen on deaf ears  so  at least for a day  mcconnell is done majority whip john cornyn  r tx   the number two republican in the senate  also brushed off any discussion of trump   except he s so sick of the guy that he went several steps further than mcconnell  he doesn t plan on talking about trump at all for the next five months  he ended his talk with politico by saying  wish me luck  he s going to need it senator bob corker  r tn   whose name has been bandied about as a possible vp pick for trump  is upset about what trump said during a foreign policy speech following orlando  politico says corker is normally very talkative  but he would only say  i don t know that i really have a lot to say  apparently he said that twice  but he eventually spoke a little bit about king trump s speech  it wasn t the type  of address  that one would expect a person who is wanting to lead the greatest nation in the world to make  fifty people have perished  and  more have been harmed  senators john mccain  r az  and richard burr  r nc  had nothing to say about trump at all  according to politico  except for a hurried comment from burr about going to read trump s speech  he then disappeared into an elevator senator susan collins  r me  also slammed trump s remarks  saying  i think his comments are inappropriate when the nation is in mourning over the worst terrorism attack that we ve had since    she s not even sure she ll be able to make herself vote for trump  according to politico trump s more outspoken critics on capitol hill  such as senators jeff flake  r az  and lindsey graham  r sc   continued to be outspoken as they slammed trump s reaction to orlando  but it was flake s comments that hint at the strong possibility that trump just sounded the death knell for his own campaign  he s won  million votes total so far  he s got to get  million or so to win the general election  which includes a lot of independents and republicans that don t feel as he does  he can t win the general election talking the way he is  the latest bloomberg poll shows hillary clinton leading trump nationally by  points  bloomberg says that orlando has had little effect on the  campaign  but that s likely to change as trump continues to try and talk tough and falls flat on face with those who are reluctant about supporting him senate republicans have been hoping for months that he would stop being the offensive  bombastic candidate that embodies everything shameful about america s conservative wing  but he s a particular problem for the senate  because he could end up being the reason republicans lose both the white house and the senate in november featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
