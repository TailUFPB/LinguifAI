if you ve ever noticed how donald trump brags more about how much money he s made than how much he s given away  that s because he s notoriously uncharitable  apparently that same level of pennypinching applies to the people who come out to endorse him   even conservative celebrity sarah palin according to a new fundraising email sent from sarah palin s controversial political action committee  sarahpac   palin needs her supporters to break out their checkbooks and give as much as they can to the one time vice presidential candidate so she can attend  political events to support endorsed candidates  like trump  the email  captured by politico reporter ken vogel shamelessly tells palin s loyal fans to visit the pac s website to   what you can  because palin  went all in for donald trump  as bizarre as it is for trump to not offer to cover travel expenses for his new best friend and political ally  it s downright offensive to suggest palin herself can t afford to pay her own way  either  this is the same person  after all  who recently put her    million arizona mansion on the market  she s also the person who quit her job as governor in order to cash in on a book deal and a fox news gig that earned her around   million  she may not be donald trump rich  but she s wealthy enough to buy a ticket or two from travelocity longtime followers of sarah palin s grift machine won t be surprised by this latest moneygrab  sarahpac has consistently operated like a personal bank account for palin  the millions of dollars pulled in by gullible conservatives rarely go to meaningful political campaigns  instead  the  fiscal conservative uses the money to fund her lifestyle and promote her brand as political watchdog group open secrets noted in  what did sarahpac spend most of its money on  then  in the third quarter  many of the same consultants she has used all along   for speechwriting  fundraising  logistics and research  there s even someone paid to consult on  coalitions   travel  presumably for palin  is part of the equation  a pac like this is useful for keeping a high profile nationally without having to pay those pesky airline and hotel tabs out of personal funds  and the pac sent    to harpercollins   publisher of all three of palin s books   for  books for donor fulfillment   that wasn t the only book purchase by the committee  a lump sum of    was listed as being spent for  lodging  suv rental  books for donors  in other words  palin s superpac is designed exclusively to  legally  steal money from conservatives hoping to get involved in the political process  instead of using that money to fulfill her commitment  she spends it on  suv rentals  and buying her own book in bulk to boost her sales  now she says she needs more to keep up with trump s traveling circus in the interest of transparency  let s consider what one would get should they decide to give palin some traveling money it s been less than  hours featured image  screengrab
