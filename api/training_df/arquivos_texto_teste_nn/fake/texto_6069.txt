the family research council s hater in chief tony perkins is joining his fellow deranged right wing christians in insisting that left wingers are slowly but surely about to outlaw christianity  he appeared on d  james kennedy ministries  truths that transform show with the ministry s president  frank wright  and ranted on about how the inability of christians to force their crazy beliefs on the rest of us somehow means they are being persecuted  perkins told wright  we are not disqualified from engaging in the public square simple because we re christian  and that s where we re at today  where people want us to check our christian faith at the door of even public service  not just holding public office  but if you re a fireman  a policeman  a teacher  a football coach  you re supposed to leave your faith at home or within the confines of the church   totally contrary to what the founders envisioned and  i would argue  frank  totally contrary to what god has called us to do  the thing is  though  the idea that you cannot bring your religious beliefs into doing jobs in public office and other parts of the public sector is not persecution  mr  perkins  it simply means that you cannot force your beliefs on others in the workplace or in the public sector  that s it  nothing more or less  further  it is quite ironic that this man is crying foul on this one  considering that his organization s entire purpose is to strip basic civil rights from anyone and everyone who isn t a right wing christian  particularly lgbt people  hypocrite much wright  of course  being just as much of a loon as perkins  took things a step further  suggesting that any day now  the government would be outlawing the practice of christianity altogether  of course  perkins latched on to this one  and said  we see this administration  we see the left creating these spiritual ghettos where we are forced into  confined to these areas  trying to quarantine faith so it s more easily controllable  get real  you morons  president obama isn t trying to get rid of religion  he himself is a christian  he s just smart enough to know that america was never meant to be a theocracy  that theocracies don t work  and that our constitution forbids religion in lawmaking then again  when deluded individuals such as these two men speak on such matters  facts fly out the window and are replaced with utter lunacy get serious help  stat  both of you watch the video of this insanity below  via right wing watch featured image via video screen capture
