newt gingrich is hoping president obama will say  yes sir  and do what white conservatives tell him to do during an appearance on fox   friends on sunday  the former house speaker and former republican presidential wannabe chimed in on the death of justice antonin scalia and whether or not president obama should be able to nominate a replacement during his final year in office of course  picking a nominee is the job of the executive branch as laid out clearly by the constitution  it is then the job of the senate to hold hearings and then bring up the nominee for a confirmation vote  that s how this works but senate republicans have already vowed to block any and every nominee president obama puts forward  and newt gingrich s solution is even worse than not having a nominee confirmed at all when clayton morris explained that democrats expect senate republicans to do their constitutional duty because president obama was elected to a four year term and not just three  gingrich said that if president obama wants to guarantee the confirmation of a nominee he should meet with conservative senators and let them handpick a conservative like scalia to be the nominee in other words  conservatives actually think that since scalia was a conservative that a like minded individual should be selected to replace him  thus keeping the supreme court a conservative leaning institution morris   senator leahy and others have said though this would send the  court into disarray  having four four and leaving these big decisions to the appellate courts and let these decisions stand for a year  and democrats also saying  look  president obama was elected to a four year term  americans spoke  he was elected to four years  not three years  he has every right to choose a nominee  gingrich   no  no  no  he has every right to recommend  he doesn t have every right to choose  this goes back to the constitution  the senate is not obligated to approve who he recommends  i mean  he has a simple model  if he really wants to get somebody approved  sit down with mitch mcconnell and with conservative senators like mike lee  ask them who they would approve and nominate somebody who is in the scalia tradition  now  obama is not going to do that  obama wants to send up a radical to eliminate the second amendment right to bear arms  to eliminate religious liberty  to impose bigger government and more power in washington  and that s his right  i understand that s what he believes  but the senate has no obligation to shift this court for the next  years radically to the left in the last year of the obama presidency  here s the video via media matters however  gingrich s demand is ridiculous  this is not how the system works  while the truth is that no one really knows how a supreme court justice will rule once they start hearing cases and issuing decisions  the fact is that no president is obligated to replace a dead or retiring justice with one that has the exact ideological views  nor does the constitution require such a thing and if senate republicans think that s how it should be  they would be committing a sort of political blackmail to get their own way  the bottom line is that the president picks nominees to the court and it s the senate s job to confirm them or not  we all know that if ruth bader ginsburg ever stepped down from the bench during a republican presidency that she would be replaced immediately with a staunch conservative  republicans certainly would never entertain the thought of replacing her with an ideological copy in the name of  fairness   so conservatives like gingrich should not expect scalia s replacement to be a nominee of their choosing  president obama will fulfill his constitutional obligation and whether senate republicans like the nominee or not  they must do theirs  america deserves a fully functioning supreme court featured image  wikimedia
