the general election hasn t even truly begun and already donald trump has reached a level of mudslinging previous candidates would have been horrified by  having already dealt an astoundingly underhanded blow to former opponent ted cruz by suggesting cruz s father was involved in the kennedy assassination  trump has turned his gold plated bullshit spewer in the direction of the clintons on may   trump gave weight to the conservative conspiracy theory surrounding the death of former white house aide vince foster  to the surprise of nobody  trump put a lot of stock in the idea that bill and hillary clinton murdered white house counsel foster in  as part of a cover up  the washington post  apparently having quite literally having nothing better to do  dutifully reported trump s comments as if they were genuine criticisms and not  as one might hope  the ravings of a lunatic he called theories of possible foul play  very serious  and the circumstances of foster s death  very fishy  he had intimate knowledge of what was going on   trump said  speaking of foster s relationship with the clintons at the time   he knew everything that was going on and then all of a sudden he committed suicide  the title of the piece could have been  trump full of shit   instead it was  trump escalates attacks on bill clinton   because when it comes to a theory wrenched from the lowest dregs of the right wing internet  we gotta hear both sides hilariously  seconds after bringing up foster s death and describing it as  very fishy  trump claimed he wasn t going to weigh in on what he just weighed in on   i don t bring up    he lied   because i don t know enough to really discuss it  i don t do that because i don t think it s fair  again  we catch a glimpse of just how nasty trump s campaign is going to be towards clinton  he s unable to run on policy  trump doesn t have any   experience  trump doesn t have any   or integrity  trump doesn t have any   he s also unable to point to obama s presidency due to the inconvenience of it being extremely popular  instead  cheap shots  conspiracies  and outrageous lies are the only weapons in his arsenal and he clearly plans to use them relentlessly for what it is worth  there is absolutely no evidence that the clintons were involved in vince foster s death  in a snopes post titled  the clinton body count   who said snopes didn t have a sense of humor    fact checkers find roughly zero evidence that the clinton administration killed foster or anyone else to cover up damning scandals  according to multiple investigations  foster sadly took his own life following a harassment campaign partly led by right wing news outlets like the wall street journal and a political scandal white house deputy counsel vince foster committed suicide on the night of  july  by shooting himself once in the head  a day after he contacted his doctor about his depression  a note in the form of a draft resignation letter was found in the bottom of his briefcase a week after his death   note that this letter was not  as is often claimed  a  suicide note   it was foster s outline for a letter of resignation   foster cited negative wall street journal editorials about him  as well as the much criticized role of the counsel s office in the controversial firing of seven white house travel office workers donald trump  who freely admits that he doesn t know anything about the case  finds that evidence he has heard  from right wing blogs   fishy    which makes him either a lying smear merchant or a complete and utter moron  take your pick featured image via mark lyons getty images
