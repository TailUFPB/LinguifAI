while the country has a meltdown over hillary clinton s email scandal  even though she didn t break any federal laws   there seems to be a blind eye on an even bigger scandal   and yes  it would involve donald trump mother jones reports that should trump win the presidency  he will potentially face having to owe over   million to deutsche bank  which has sparred with u s  regulators for years  such a conundrum would be the biggest conflict of interest any presidential candidate has ever faced here are the facts trump has acquired quite a bit of debt  totaling roughly   million  or possibly more  from various loans from a multitude of lenders  his ambiguous financial statement lists  loans from  different creditors  at least five of these loans are worth   million or more  and have no been paid back  at least in full  deutsche bank appears to be trump s biggest line of credit  with loans totaling   million for two projects alone    million to buy trump national doral golf course  and most recently   million for his newest project  his hotel on pennsylvania avenue  with the election a mere five months away  and the hotel slated to open in fall  trump will  if elected  waltz into the white house owing a foreign bank more than   million that  as richard painter  an attorney who teaches at the university of minnesota puts it  is very troublesome  for starters  this will mean that as president of the united states  trump will literally be beholden to a foreign bank  and if it s anything like his ocean city taj mahal  will it ever be paid  with bookings for his hotels dropping by a whopping  percent  who knows  as painter told mother jones they  had large assets and usually diversified assets  they weren t in a situation where someone could put pressure on them to do what they want  whereas having a president who owes a lot of money to banks  particularly when it s on negotiable terms it puts them at the mercy of the banks and the banks are at the mercy of regulators  in real estate  the prevailing business model is to own a lot but also owe a lot  and that is a potentially very troublesome business model for someone in public office just because trump is a billionaire doesn t mean he ll pay it all back with full faith  as mother jones reminds readers in   trump borrowed   million from deutsche bank and several other lenders for the construction of a chicago hotel tower  when he failed to pay back the money on time in   the banks  including deutsche bank  demanded he pay up the   million he had personally guaranteed  in response  trump sued deutsche bank for   billion  saying the project s financial troubles were the fault of the economic recession  essentially an act of god  and accusing the bank of undermining the project and his reputation with no indication of a blind trust being set up as to avoid a conflict of interest  one could assume trump would bend the rules in his favor  as he boasts to always doing and if that alone wasn t a reason to be suspicious  deutsche bank has been fighting u s  regulators for years  which would make a partnership with trump all the more conflicted with an ongoing battle of trying to bypass the rules in favor of wall street  the german bank was forced to pay a staggering    billion fine for rigging interest rates  the fine included paying   million to the new york state department of financial services    million to the commodities futures trading commission  and   million to the department of justice the bank also reached multiple settlements for price fixing metals great business partners you got there  trump  when democrats and republicans say hillary clinton is beholden to banks  maybe the attention should be turned to trump  who literally owes a bank over   million it s no wonder trump has pledge to repeal dodd frank featured image via spencer platt getty images
