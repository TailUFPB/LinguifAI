the republican party has been a thorn in the side of the president since he took office  they have challenged his policies at almost every corner and at times just for the sake of it  thus preventing the country from running smoothly  even now  as the president is close to the end of his final term  the gop is not letting up  in their latest attempt at obstructionism  the republican party is attempting to scuttle the president s nomination to the u s  supreme court  president barack obama appeared on fox news sunday for the first time as president and had a few things to say about republican obstructionism watch video here the president wants the gop to simply do one thing  which is to give judge merrick garland a hearing in order for the american people to be given an opportunity to see what his nominee is all about  the president said  i think that people will evolve as they get familiar with judge garland s record  as it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the american people think that the president should nominate someone to the supreme court and the senate should now do its constitutional job and give him a hearing  our goal is to just make sure that the senate does its job and treats him fairly  the republicans want the next president to nominate a justice to the supreme court  hoping that a republican president would appoint a conservative justice  the president went on to add that never has a republican nominee for the supreme court not at least had a hearing  yet  here are the republicans yet again scuttling by preventing the president from doing his job and not doing their constitutional duties as well the republicans continue to obstruct but let s hope that they remain on the sidelines come november and we don t have to deal with a gop presidential administration  featured image via video screenshot
