from the very outset of trump s improbable political career one thing has been abundantly clear  his contempt for the american soldier borders on pathological while he occasionally gets goaded into praising the troops  with all the enthusiasm of a hostage held at gunpoint   the republican nominee  who deferred his own military service in vietnam a number of times  more often than not shows nothing but outright disgust for them  he famously accused john mccain of being a loser because he was captured and tortured by the north vietnamese  while trump was sitting out the war   he more recently used the military to avoid partaking in an uncomfortable primary debate and then refused to give veterans the money he raised until he was exposed and now  in a moment that is sure to be hillary clinton s very next campaign ad  trump accused unnamed iraq war veterans of stealing millions of dollars from the u s  government that was meant to help rebuild the war torn country  if it s not immediately obvious  that would be a massive crime  trump tossed around the accusation almost casually republican presidential nominee donald trump  ladies and gentlemen  iraq  crooked as hell  how about bringing baskets of money  millions and millions of dollars and handing it out  i want to know  who were the soldiers who had that job  because i think they re living very well right now  trump  as could be expected  offers absolutely zero proof that this took place  another conspiracy to add to his vault full of them in fact  the soldiers who returned home from iraq are not doing  very well right now   having served their country in a war without a clear objective  they got back to discover that the republicans who sent them there now had no interest in helping them  struggling with war injuries both physical and psychological  high rates of suicide and devastating unemployment  the veterans of the most wealthy nation on earth were kicked to the curb in   senate republicans unilaterally killed a  sweeping   billion bill  that would have  expanded medical  educational and other benefits  for these troops  their reasoning  it s an  entitlement  that we cannot afford republicans have charged the bill was too expensive and disputed the way it would be paid for with overseas contingency operations funds used to fund the war in afghanistan  and that  republicans argued  wouldn t amount to real savings  since the money wouldn t have been spent anyway with the war winding down by year s end if there were baskets of money sent to iraq  it certainly doesn t seem like the troops who served there came home with any kudos to donald trump  in a week where one might have assumed accusing the president of the united states of helping isis was the lowest thing he could do  he managed to dig a little deeper  it s a wonder he has any supporters left update  as expected  donald trump s campaign has rushed to do damage control  spokesperson hope hicks claimed trump was referring to iraqi soldiers  not american ones  a blatant lie given the exact quote  go back and re read it   but undermined even further by the fact that  as charles johnson of little green footballs noted  trump has previously made a similar claim about american soldiers stealing money  as far back as   he also suggested that some american soldiers charged with distributing money to fund the afghan and iraqi government embezzled it instead   i want to know who are the soldiers carrying suitcases with     asked trump   how stupid are we  i wouldn t be surprised if those soldiers  if the cash didn t get there  trump doesn t even have the guts to stand by what he said  sad featured image via darren mccollester getty images
