when president obama announced his nominee to fill antonin scalia s seat on the supreme court  it took mitch mcconnell all of half an hour to announce that the republican party would see to it that not a single meeting  hearing or vote would ever come of it in a purely toddleresque temper tantrum that not only scoffed at the constitution and the president s executive authority  but at the american people  more than  percent of whom are uncomfortable with the high court in a   deadlock mcconnell has given every reason imaginable   other than a good one   why president obama doesn t have the right afforded his office more than  years ago  his finest moment was when he admitted that nra is running the show at republican national headquarters  former mccain strategist steve schmidt said  mitch mcconnell s knee jerk response after justice scalia s death is a public relations debacle for the republican party   he s not kidding according to a report from nbc  there are at least  republican senators who have taken mitch mcconnell s directive to obstruct at even the common courtesy level and tossed it in the garbage where it belongs  some are republicans up for re election in blue states  like kelly ayotte from new hampshire and mark kirk from illinois  who will be the first to openly defy mcconnell when he meets with merrick tuesday  others are republicans from red states who understand that it s better to allow the process to happen rather than prove to the american people that republicans are incapable of governing effectively even with the moderates like susan collins of maine and jerry moran of kansas advocating for full hearings  the likelihood that merrick would actually be confirmed is nearly non existent  but that s not keeping gop strategists from insisting that holding a hearing would seem much less obstructionist and rude  john kasich  the last establishment candidate left for the gop  has also said that merrick garland  at least  deserves the respect of a hearing  the man was  after all  nominated to fill a seat on the highest court ion the land by the president of the united states that s the problem  though  isn t it  it s not that he was nominated  it s who nominated him  republicans have become as predictable as they are reprehensible featured image by alex wong getty images
