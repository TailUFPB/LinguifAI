looking back at all of the offensive  ridiculous things that republican front runner donald trump has said over the past few months  it seems that trump would probably have a more promising career in stand up comedy than politics  but unfortunately for the rest of us  trump is still a leading presidential candidate for the republican party and continues to say more insane  delusional nonsense every day one of the latest trump ramblings reveals just how little trump cares about the safety of america s youth  maureen dowd recently wrote a column about the front runner  pulling from a recent interview she had with trump  like every interview the business mogul partakes in  it s absolutely insane trump performed his typical bullying tactics  from insulting  total whack job  megyn kelly and attacking elizabeth warren   before hilariously denying that he was a misogynist or racist  trump said  honestly  i m with the people  the people like trump   while that s pretty bad  the most shocking part of the interview came when trump spoke about his rallies  which have become infamous for their violence despite the fact that he has absolutely encouraged violence at his rallies and even promised to protect his supporters if they attacked a protester  trump continues to deny that his campaign events are anything but peaceful  in fact  over the last few days he has blamed the outrageously rabid behavior of his fans on both bernie sanders and hillary clinton  trump s dishonesty and delusion run so deep that when trump was asked if parents should be concerned about bringing their children to rallies where cursing  physical assaults and bullying are par for the course  trump said this  the rallies are the safest places a child could be  trump was then questioned about a particular incident in which a man rushed the stage  causing him to visibly quiver in fear  trump  denying that he felt he was in any danger at all  said  i got credit for that because it looked like i was moving toward him   he also said that when his protesters scream at  agitators  or protesters   it adds a little excitement  clearly  trump s rallies are not a safe place for a child  and it s terrifying that trump is denying this and encouraging his supporters to bring their kids into such a chaotic  unstable environment  the scary thing is  trump s supporters hang on to his every word and are probably too dense to know any better while trump continues to deny that his rallies are extremely dangerous  several more incidents of violence happened at a tuscan  arizona rally yesterday   ironically the same day that dowd s column about trump was published  during the rally  a man was punched  kicked and stomped on the ground  and trump s own campaign manager was seen grabbing the collar of a protester  previously  trump s campaign manager was accused of assaulting a female reporter and those are not isolated instances  this type of violence follows trump everywhere he and his protesters go  these attacks are sometimes racially motivated  and sometimes for no reason at all  attacks on peaceful protesters have become quite common   suggesting that parents expose their children to the type of bigotry  racism and all around disgusting behavior that we ve seen from trump and his minions is despicable  through his denial and lies  trump has greatly endangered america s youth featured image via gage skidmore
