what s happening in the united states is not okay  what s being allowed to happen is not okay  we currently have a person running for president of the united states who is not only condoning violence  but instigating and encouraging it  recent donald trump rallies have turned into something very reminiscent of nazi germany from the  and   if this doesn t terrify you  wake up  if you approve of this  you re part of the problem in yet another move to motivate his band of merry morons who are clearly unhinged and will do his bidding at a moment s notice  trump tweets out a direct threat to democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders as well as his supporters who attend his rallies  the real estate mogul seems to think that sanders is lying when he says that his supporters aren t told to go to trump events  so he took that as his cue to threaten sanders back trump said  bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren t told to go to my events  be careful bernie  or my supporters will go to yours  bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren t told to go to my events  be careful bernie  or my supporters will go to yours   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    threat isn t even thinly veiled  telling someone to  be careful  insinuates harm may follow  he s literally giving permission and telling his version of brownshirts to go to sanders rallies  this tweet will most certainly encourage several of his supporters to go  this is getting very scary  folks  and trump needs to be held accountable for inciting violence bernie sanders has since spoken out against trump and his ridiculous allegations  the sanders campaign just retweeted this to make the message clear  bernie said while on abc news  well  i think anybody who understands mr  trump s campaign knows that he tells the truth very  very rarely  and i m afraid that on this occasion  he s lying again  first of all  he calls me a communist  obviously that s a lie  then he says that our campaign is organizing disruptions of his rallies  that s a lie  we have millions of supporters out there  and clearly some of them were at that rally along with many many other protesters  but to say that we organized that   totally untrue  watch   berniesanders says  realdonaldtrump s claim he organized protesters at trump rally is  totally untrue   https   t co   this week   thisweekabc  march    imag via flickr flickr
