successfully proving that we will kill ourselves before isis ever gets the chance  a patriotic gun owner decided that the only way to make shooting his lawn mower better was to also rig the lawn mower to explode  what could possibly go wrong  the short answer is   a lot david presley loaded up an old lawn mower with three pounds of tannerite  which is a compound used to create exploding targets for use on shooting ranges  there s no legitimate need for a target to explode  but hey    murica  right presley clearly didn t read the instruction manual  sheriff joe chapman told local news that you are supposed to use less than a pound of the explosive compound if you want to make an exploding target and you need to stand at least  yards away from it when you shoot presley opted to use the  pounds and stand  yards away  the ensuing blast of liberty deprived captain dumbass of his left leg below the knee lydiah mays  presley s neighbor really said it best  you would ve had to be on drugs or something to think it was a good idea to play with that and try to blow up a lawnmower  source  ajc comwalton county fire rescue chief  craig league  also gave his opinion  if you hear a loud boom and it shakes your home  your windows  and the china in your cabinets rattle around  then there is a good chance one of your neighbors is shooting tannerite  source  ajc comlet s think about what he just said  this must happen so frequently in the county  that he actually said in a non joking manner if your house literally is shaking from explosions  someone is shooting large concentrations of explosives for fun  wow how soon can i move there to experience this as well so many parts of this story  despite the obvious tragedy  are absurd to the point of being hilarious  possibly the best one of all is the fact there is not a law against doing this  you can t smoke a teeny little joint in this area legally  but you can willy nilly shoot large quantities of explosives  america   f ck yeah featured image via youtube screen capture
