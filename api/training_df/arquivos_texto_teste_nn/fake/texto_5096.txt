republicans are already predicting doom and gloom for november  since donald trump seems not to grasp what  get on message  means  they ve been telling him to do that for months   members of the republican party are already predicting hillary clinton as the victor in an exclusive with the hill  several members of the house gop caucus under anonymity  who back trump  now say they are preparing for a clinton sweep in november one  southern lawmaker   who is a trump supporter  told the hill i m not feeling great about the immediate future of the conservative movement right now  as a conservative who believes our ideas are good for america  it is pretty gloomy these days the southern lawmaker acknowledged trump would be a difficult candidate to sell to the american people  considering the gop s lack of a coalition with women  minorities  lgbt  and youth voters  yet they re still a trump supporter   which means they don t care about the bran issues facing their party  there was some hope that the disaffected  so called silent majority would be broad enough and turn out in large enough numbers to give trump a chance  but if he continues the next  days like the last week  then he will lose big time   the southern lawmaker told the hill one  northeastern lawmaker  was more candid with his feelings i think it will be hillary  if i had to bet  i d definitely  bet that trump loses  this is like a football game where you hate both teams  you root for a tie   and maybe some minor injuries right now  it sucks to be a republican  rep  matt salmon  who originally backed marco rubio  then ted cruz and now trump  admitted a trump win will be a  steep climb   that s because the gop didn t listen to their  autopsy report  and they are paying the price  but not all members of the gop are ignoring the findings from their last loss in   rep  charlie dent of pennsylvania told the hill that the gop must learn from their autopsy report if they hope to win another autopsy will occur  and the next time i hope lessons will be learned fat chance that will happen  they seriously thought romney was going to beat president obama  and decided to disregard all the points they missed when he didn t win the gop is bracing for a clinton win  and so is the rest of he country   anything is better than donald trump featured image via joe readle getty images
