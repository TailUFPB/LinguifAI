a so called  pro life  republican has yet again proven the entire concept of being  pro life  is a total fraud   this time  with her comments on the flint water crisis  sandy rios  who wastes her time fighting against both abortion and contraception  has declared the flint lead poisoning crisis and the zika virus as liberal conspiracy theories that are not worthy of concern rios actually made the incredible suggestion that neither of the health crises posed as great a threat as either isis or latino immigrants  how latino immigrants moving into this country are related to an entire american city being poisoned for over a year is beyond comprehension a caller to her radio show asked her why she and other republicans that are obsessed with the well being of fetuses were mostly silent on the flint water crisis  rios had the following mind numbing response  the whole issue in michigan   the left loves to  they re now creating this  i m sorry  i m going to really go out on a limb here  this zika virus which i haven t talked about  they love to come up with tragedies and they love to blame and they love to scare people  i think this issue in michigan is a serious one  but i don t think it s the big issue that these other issues are  source  rawstoryhere is a bit of context on what rios said  lead poisoning is not safe at any level for any person  but it s most harmful to developing brains and nervous systems found in fetuses and children  the zika virus has been linked to microcephaly  which is a condition that causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development  it s causing such an epidemic in brazil that at least one judge is planning on challenging brazil s harsh restrictions on abortion  which only allow for exceptions of rape or life of the mother these are real public health issues that are seriously endangering the unborn  and an absolutely rabid christian anti abortionist just blows them off  insisting they are not a serious problem  it s unreal how narrowly they define their concern for the unborn  they seem to only care about the act of forcing women to give birth  whether or not the child is healthy is of no concern listen to rios  ridiculous comments below featured image from huffington post
