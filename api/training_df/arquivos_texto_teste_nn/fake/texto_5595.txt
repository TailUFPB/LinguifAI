republicans clearly just have absolutely no shame anymore  it s already been discovered that the image tweeted out by donald trump featuring hillary clinton next to a star of david on top of a pile of money was originally created by white supremacists  but that s not stopping trump  nor rnc chair reince priebus from lying through their teeth appearing on cnn with wolf blitzer  priebus is parroting trump s effort of claiming that the star was just a random star pulled out of microsoft paint by their campaign staff when creating the image  that it s some sort of  sheriff s star  even though it doesn t have the globes on the points  and looks exactly like the star of david priebus seems to completely ignore the fact that it s been revealed the original image came from white supremacists  and instead touts the line after claiming the star came from microsoft  they figured it out  and they fixed it  which they did  they turned the star into a circle  but it doesn t negate the fact that the original image is from racists  and both priebus and trump are lying to cover their own asses republicans need to learn to own their mistakes and apologize  it s really that simple  lying to cover things up just makes them look even worse watch priebus lies through his teeth here rnc chair on trump s star tweet   they figured it out  and they fixed it  https   t co  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  july    image via video screen capture
