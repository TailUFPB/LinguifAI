hours after right wing militia members committed treason against the united states  fox news defended the confederacy and the confederate flag fox and friends host tucker carlson declared that attacking the confederate flag as a symbol of racism is an assault on middle america during the sunday morning broadcast carlson took particular issue with director quentin tarantino s recent remarks on the subject  in which he said   i ve always felt the rebel flag was some american swastika  this caused carlson to fly into a rage against the the hateful eight director before going on to defend the flag and the confederacy  i don t think he knows anything about the confederacy   the fox host said   i would be shocked if quentin tarantino could name three civil war battles if his life depended on it  this is an attack by the elites on middle american culture  using the confederacy and the battle flag and all that stuff  they re just symbols to them of what they believe is the backward culture between malibu and georgetown  it s like they look out and  man  everyone is in the klan  you know  they eat pork rinds  they watch nascar  they re horrible  co host clayton morris pointed out that nazis and american white supremacists both use the confederate flag as a symbol of their racist and anti government views  which seemed to cause carlson to step back for a moment to claim that he isn t defending the flag even though that s what he was doing the entire time  he also claimed that he doesn t support armed rebellion against the government  but  of course  carlson concluded by trying to enrage conservatives enough to the point where they might become even more violent against the government  i would say that  is not making a reasonable point here  he s making the point that the president always makes  that the real threat is middle america  they have too many guns  they re into this christianity thing  they are opposed to abortion  they have all kinds of medieval views that are a threat to america  it really is an attack on middle american culture  here s the video via youtube as right wing militias continue to become more emboldened  conservative media appears to be supportive of their actions  after all  carlson and his co hosts only devoted about  seconds to covering an armed attack on the united states government while focusing much more time on defending the losers of the civil war who tried to overthrow the united states via armed rebellion  clearly  these thugs in oregon need to be arrested and locked away from civilized society and fox news should be shut down for trying to anger more people into supporting violence against government because that s exactly what they are doing by claiming that the government thinks people in middle america are a threat  they are trying to gin up fundamentalist christians  anti abortion fanatics  and gun nuts into getting angry enough to start shooting and committing acts of terrorism that will get people killed  it s one thing to have a conservative point of view  but what fox news is doing now looks an awful lot like support for treason and terrorism featured image  tumblr
