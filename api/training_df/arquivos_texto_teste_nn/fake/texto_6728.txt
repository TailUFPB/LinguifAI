part of the hippocratic oath that every doctor must take requires them to vow to  reject harm and mischief   put another way  a doctor should never allow harmful or unscientific nonsense to get in the way of treating their patients with the best possible medical procedures  put an even simpler way  republicans should stay out of the hospital room in south dakota  republicans are forcing through legislation that would require doctors to directly lie to their patients in order to give them second thoughts about having an abortion  two other states  arizona and arkansas  already have this law in place  it s the newest trend in anti abortion measures  instead of targeting the women  which hasn t worked   they ll just require doctors to push anti abortion myths or face losing their jobs specifically  the new law  signed by republican governor dennis daugaard  will tell doctors that they must inform their patients that they can get an  abortion reversal  pill that will stop abortions in progress and allow them to keep a viable fetus  as judith graham at medical blog stat news notes  the magic pill is psuedoscientific nonsense an antiabortion group is promoting model legislation to inform women they can  reverse  medication abortions yet that claim has no solid science behind it  just an anecdotal case report written by a physician who invented a protocol and arranged to have it tested on a half dozen patients who regretted swallowing the abortion pill to put it mildly  the medical community is not cool with being told to lie to their patients about untested medical procedures which may  in fact  harm them  as physicians  we can t just experiment on patients willy nilly   said dr  daniel grossman  a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of california  san francisco  doctors offering to undo medical abortions are  essentially testing an unproven  experimental protocol on pregnant women   he said if requiring doctors to use untested drugs on their patients in order to lie to them about having an abortion isn t doing  harm and mischief   then what is it s also attempting to fix a problem that doesn t exist  despite what anti abortion activists emphatically insist  the research shows conclusively that virtually no woman who has an abortion regrets it  when a university of california san francisco school of medicine study asked over  women at facilities across the country how they felt about their decision to have an abortion  more than  percent said they felt it was the right thing to do  women overwhelmingly felt abortion was the right decision in both the short term and over three years  and the intensity of emotions and frequency of thinking about the abortion declined over time   the study concluded it seems that women  far from being doe eyed  victims  of sinister planned parenthood clinics preying on them  actually know what they are doing and do what is right for them  their bodies  and their families  go figure none of this seems to matter to south dakota republicans  who have long retreated into superstitious dogma and seem only dimly aware that the scientific community thinks they are ridiculous  instead of reassessing their beliefs  they are telling doctors to help them promote their misconceptions or else face their wrath  galileo is probably nodding his head in recognition  an age old problem with a modern day spin featured image via flickr
