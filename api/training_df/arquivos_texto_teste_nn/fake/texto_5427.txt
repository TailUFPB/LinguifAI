after the horrific murder of three police officers in baton rouge  louisiana  president obama gave a heartfelt speech   one that could have been given by any politician   condemning the  cowardly and reprehensible attack  against those who  put their lives on the line for ours every day   obama declared that  justice will be done  that  though  wasn t convincing enough for trump  who stated in a fox news interview that somehow  obama must be in collusion with the murderers because of his  body language  after fox   friends host steve doocy read donald trump a statement from a cleveland police union president   which accused obama of having  blood on his hands    trump replied   well  it s true  i watch the president and sometimes the words are okay  but you just look at the body language and there s something going on  source  ny magazinehere s the video when the hell did donald trump become a body language expert  oh  he isn t   body language  is nothing but code  president obama is black  to racists  and trump  that means that he s anti cop and he must be a member of the black panthers  just as all muslims are terrorists and all mexicans are rapists for decades  and probably centuries  part of the country s narrative was that cops and black people don t mix  who can blame the african american community  really  the justice system has been rigged against them from the start of course  white people turn that around to prop up the image of black people as criminals  they only have problems with the justice system because they are lawbreakers  of course  that s not true  more on that in a minute   but that doesn t stop those on the right  including their leader  donald trump  from playing that particular race card with the highly educated african american president of the united states  who must hate cops  simply because he has black skin here are the ugly facts  and they don t bode well for the justice system if i were african american  i d be pissed  but obama is the president of the entire united states  a fact that has made some civil rights leaders  like dr  cornel west  turn on him  sure  obama doesn t deny his race  but he knows injustice wherever he sees it  and the shootings of cops was unjust   there was nothing in his  body language  but weariness from our seemingly increasing rash of violence see for yourself as for trump  his rhetoric is only ginning up the violence  all while the president tries his hardest to soothe a nation being driven to crisis level  partly because of trump featured image via drew angerer at getty images
