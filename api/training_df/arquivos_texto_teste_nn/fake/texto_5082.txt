a north miami resident shot his unarmed ex girlfriend after following her into the ladies  room at a denny s in   and he s now facing his hearing  he s been charged with attempted murder  but he and his lawyers are invoking florida s insanely loose  stand your ground  law as a defense for him  that law has been used to justify all manner of shootings in that state brooke tuchinsky  the victim  survived with a broken jaw  sean barnes  the shooter  claims he saw her open her purse and pull out something shiny  fearing for his life  he pulled his gun and fired  however  tuchinsky was found unarmed  and her purse was closed  she wouldn t have been able to put the object back in her purse and close it after getting shot in the face  barnes told a bald faced lie right there barnes  lawyers are maintaining that he never intended to use the gun for anything other than self defense  and that tuchinsky was allegedly stalking him  that s all he really needs for a defense  florida s dangerous law has made vigilante justice  and shooting people out of anger  entirely too easy since people no longer need to prove they tried to get out of a situation before using lethal force while tuchinsky does have a history of causing problems for ex boyfriends  she also said that barnes threatened her  i bought a new gun and would love to use it on you and make it look like an accident or self defense  in a sane state  that would be pretty damning  even if every word barnes spoke about tuchinsky s actions was true  but not in florida  never florida  in fact  miami judges have cleared several people from wrongdoing under  stand your ground   and the florida supreme court decided that anybody invoking  stand your ground   had a right to a hearing before a judge  who would decide whether their claim was valid  if it is  then the case would be dismissed and the defendant wouldn t be held responsible for legal fees or court costs it s a little difficult to claim  stand your ground  when you lied about the person you were facing being armed  and with that law  barnes doesn t have to have tried to leave the denny s after the two got into an argument requiring employees to separate them  the fact remains that  instead of leaving  he followed her  likely with intent to shoot her  and then shot her  then he lied about what took place  that s horrible  regardless of how horrible his situation was featured image via screen capture
