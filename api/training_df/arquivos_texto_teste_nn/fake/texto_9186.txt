 lauren mcgaughy of the dallas morning news did a disgusting hit job on a top texas lawyer and former judge  as a mother of  girls  i m offended by  journalists  like lauren mcgaughy  who wrote about a lawyer who was fired from his law firm for posting an article written by a rape survivor about her views on the now hijacked feminazi  metoo movement  it s sad to see the left grabbing onto the serious issue of sexual assault and doing the exact same thing they did to racism  using it as a political football  and trying to make it a republican or conservative thing  if everyone s a racist  then no one is a racist  lauren mcgaughy  a reporter for dallas morning news didn t stop at exposing the firing of a top texas lawyer over an article he shared on his personal facebook page about the  metoo movement  that was written by a rape survivor   she went after him with a bizarre vengeance  as though she had been personally harmed by his words  mcgaughy didn t stop after pointing out that his law firm fired andrew d  leonie in a shameful case of censorship  she went on to tie him to  conservatives  and prove that he s actually  gasp  supported republican candidates in the past   mcgaughy took it a step further  and provided evidence that this horrible human being was also involved in litigating a case against are you ready  muslim students praying in public schools mcgaughy wrote  leonie was behind an ag s office letter that blasted a frisco area high school for allowing muslim students to use an empty classroom to pray  the letter  which alleged the school might be infringing on the constitutional rights of its non muslim students  was called a  political stunt  by district staff who said the room was open to all students from the dallas morning news article a top lawyer in the office of texas attorney general ken paxton resigned thursday after reports he wrote a facebook post that called women s sexual misconduct allegations  pathetic  the dallas morning news reported thursday morning associate deputy attorney general andrew d  leonie posted on facebook this week   aren t you also tired of all the pathetic  me too  victim claims  if every woman is a  victim   so is every man  if everyone is a victim  no one is  victim means nothing anymore  the post went up at   a m  on wednesday  by thursday afternoon  leonie had resigned  in a press release  paxton s office said leonie s exit was effective immediately  the views he expressed on social media do not reflect our values   paxton s director of communications marc rylander wrote   the oag is committed to promoting and maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment  leonie s post was removed late thursday afternoon  his bio was changed from  associate deputy attorney general  to  retired  the dallas morning news was fortunately  able to get a screen shot of the offensive post for everyone to see his facebook post linked to an article from the conservative website the federalist titled   can we be honest about women   the teaser to the article  which was written by a woman  states   here s a little secret we have to say out loud  women love the sexual interplay they experience with men  and they relish men desiring their beauty  he previously worked for paxton s predecessor  gov  greg abbott  as a regional chief for consumer protection and special litigator  according to leonie s linkedin  his salary was listed as    in april on the texas tribune s salary explorer leonie s post comes as some conservatives question the increasing number of sexual harassment and assault claims against the nation s most powerful men in media  politics and business  while the stories have led to a number of high profile resignations and apologies in the private sector  change is slower in the political realm  where it s usually up to voters to oust elected officials accused of sexual misconduct in texas  for example  republican congressman blake farenthold on thursday decided not to run for reelection after allegations he made lewd comments and unleashed profanity laced tirades on staffers  the decision was made after farenthold declined to resign for weeks after news broke he once used    in taxpayer money to settlement a harassment claim  accusations against state lawmakers   as well as concerns over the ability of elected officials to harass with impunity   have also led to new training requirements in the legislature oops  it looks likethe federalist reported that leonie s facebook post linked to an article entitled  can we be honest about women   authored by mcallister  who is a survivor of sexual assault  here s a little secret we have to say out loud  women love the sexual interplay they experience with men  and they relish men desiring their beauty   mcallister writes   why  because it is part of their nature  as a society  we need to encourage both sexes to become comfortable with who they are naturally and all the messy  uncomfortable  stumbling  tantalizing  and glorious twists and turns that come with it   she continues   men and women need to show each other grace and respect as they engage as sexual beings in whatever sphere they interact  the article explicitly condemns sexual assault but argues that what some call sexual assault doesn t deserve that label and expanding its definition into innocent behavior hurts both men and women  in the past  mcallister has written about how our society has emboldened men in positions of power to think they can get away with sexually harassing or assaulting women in a post entitled  it s not up to women to end sexual harassment   she explains why men need to step up their efforts to protect women from such evils  she has also criticized aspects of the  metoo movement  writing recently that it is destroying trust between men and women because the social media movement denies human nature the sexual tension between men and women will always exist  and if women assume a man s sexuality is a threat instead of a powerful complement to their own sexuality  they will always be on guard  in this environment of suspicion  there can be no privacy between a man and a woman  if there is any kind of interaction or discourse  even if it s not sexual  the man can t trust that the woman won t use it against him so communication is silenced  fear is generated on both sides  and fear is the death of trust  it is also the death of love throughout mcallister s critiques of the  metoo movement and discussions of sexual topics  she has repeatedly stated that women ought to be respected and that sexual assault and sexual harassment are wrong   a fact left out of the numerous media accounts of leonie s resignation and her article
