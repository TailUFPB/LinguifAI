are you  or is someone you know  a legally blind patriot who really wants to exercise their second amendment rights  well  move on down to georgia and you can do just that  no  this is not an onion story a man in the southern state is making his friends very  very nervous because he is one of these legally blind patriots who are walking around strapped  david bunch s friend  eule stewart  is outraged that his state allows someone to carry a weapon even after they have been declared visually impaired  i don t see anybody in their right mind giving a blind man a license to tote a gun in public he says that he can see shadows  pretty much  just shadows and movement  think about that for a moment  bunch is only able to see shadows and the state of georgia is like  that s cool  bro  go ahead and carry this deadly firearm   he literally would not be able to see if an intruder was coming into his home  or if it was one of his friends stopping by unannounced what s worse is that the state actually pulled his driver s license because he is unable to see well enough to drive but he is still allowed to own a shotgun stewart said he offered to help his friend get around after georgia pulled bunch s driver s license in january  stewart said he drove bunch to a dawsonville gun shop to buy a  gauge shotgun  he asked me what the gun looked like   stewart said   i said   well  it s a nice looking gun  you know  i d like to have a gun like that   and he said   i ll take that one  that s right  he couldn t even see the shotgun he was buying georgia isn t the only state that puts our lives in danger by allowing people who cannot see to own guns  the blind citizens of iowa  wisconsin  texas  michigan and a few other states also allow it  all of this is possible because there is no federal law banning the visually impaired from carrying and the chances of that changing with the nra puppets in control of the senate and house  are slim to none as we all know  the gop isn t the least bit interested in keeping us safe as long as the nra and gun lobby continue to keep their campaign coffers full  featured image via youtube screenshot  image of iowa man  not bunch
