senator john mccain just got outed as a hypocrite with a damning video that shows him acting just like donald trump   even though he blames the presumptive gop nominee for hurting him among hispanic voters last week  the arizona republican complained to private donors that donald trump s rhetoric against hispanics is making his re election bid difficult  i do not take my primary opponent lightly   mccain said  he continued  but have no doubt that if it is donald trump at the top of the ticket  here in arizona   with over  percent of the vote being the hispanic vote   i have no doubt that this may be the race of my life  people are angry  they re upset  they feel that there s this disconnect and all of that and frankly there s an element of nativism in it as well  as you know  mccain is all of a sudden worried about the hispanic vote because trump has accused hispanic immigrants of being rapists and murderers  all while promising to build an expensive wall along the entire southern border to keep immigrants out of the united states but as it turns out  mccain is apparently pretending that he is totally different from trump because in   mccain used the exact same rhetoric in a campaign ad that makes it clear that he should blame himself for any troubles with hispanic voters he will experience in november msnbc host al sharpton caught mccain being a hypocrite  so he played the video during an interview with mccain s democratic challenger rep  ann kirkpatrick in the ad  mccain is walking along the border with a local sheriff   drug and human smuggling  home invasions  murder   he says  the sheriff uses the term  illegals  to describe desperate undocumented immigrants fleeing violence in their countries of origin for a better life in america  john mccain then concludes by calling to  complete the dang fence  here s the video via youtube  blaming immigrants for murder  for home invasions  vowing to  quote  complete the fence  i mean  this is john nccain   sharpton said  is there that much difference that you see there between what he s saying and what trump is saying about building a wall   he asked kirkpatrick kirkpatrick agreed  saying that john mccain changed his position again as he often does  depending on who he is talking to  he s not a straight shooter   she continued   he s not a maverick  he doesn t stand for anything  here s the video via youtube looks like john mccain has some explaining to do featured image via flickr
