donald trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president during a speech to a crowd in ottumwa  iowa on saturday  trump expressed praise for north korean dictator kim jong un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents  you ve got to give him credit   trump gushed  how many young guys   he was like  or  when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden  you know  it s pretty amazing when you think of it  how does he do that  even though it is a culture  and it s a culture thing  he goes in  he takes over  he s the boss  it s incredible  he wiped out the uncle  he wiped out this one  that one  i mean this guy doesn t play games  here s the video via youtube  the relevant remarks begin at the  minute marker yeah  you heard that  a republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power  doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy and it s not like trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign  after all  we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters donald trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies  he has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking republican and democratic presidential candidates below the belt  he has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt  if anyone has the capacity to become america s first tyrant  it s donald trump and that s why it is scary to hear him praise kim jong un and his deadly power tactics featured image  flickr
