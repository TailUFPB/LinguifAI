gun nuts are a strange breed  they are paranoid  uneducated  and don t feel complete without a few penis extensions guns fully locked and loaded at all times  however  one ammosexual just took it a step further  by holding on to his beloved ar  during an interview on cnn who is this guy and why is he allowed anywhere near guns  you might ask  this guy actually is new hampshire s own mark limoges  owner of black op arms gun store  he s also a donald trump supporter  and he showed up to the interview with a perfect copy of the ar  that he lovingly presented to the donald himself  limoges told the show s hosts  this is an exact replica of the gun we gave mr  trump  it has our black ops arms symbol on it with our black ops arms symbol on the handrail  and the other side  we have the  live free or die  with the american flag on the handrail  he did  however  admit that trump s secret service detail was more than a little concerned about both the visit to the gun store and the gift of an assault rifle  limoges goes on to explain how that was handled  we actually wanted mr  trump to come to our gun store  which the secret service was not real thrilled about  a secret service agent came to the store  took the gun  we removed the bolt out of it  they took possession of the weapon and then presented it to us before we went into the room to present it to mr  trump  limoges also admitted that the weapon he give the gop front runner would be illegal in trump s home state of new york without modifications  then  of course  he had to go and accuse president obama of attempting to seize guns  saying  i think it s probably a first step towards it  yes  host john berman seemed surprised  and said   really   in response berman s co host kate bolduan challenged this assertion  reminding limoges that president obama explicitly says that he has no such plans  the president said yesterday in his speech that his actions are not a plot to take away everybody s guns  this statement led to limoges accusing the president of being a liar on live television  mr  obama has also said other things that have not always been the truth  berman went on to press limoges  look  he says he respects the second amendment  and if you just look at the actions he s taking  even the things he was proposing a few years ago which were steeper than this  even if you support universal background checks  that doesn t necessarily mean you want to take someone s guns away  limoges  mind was not changed  though  and he concluded  most of the people that come in  are real nervous about what mr  obama is going to do to limit their chances of getting weapons  maybe that s why he insisted on keeping his ar  cradled so closely for the duration  obama could come take it during the five minutes he was talking to those lovely cnn hosts get some help  mr  limoges  you clearly need it watch the entire bizarre exchange below featured image via video screen capture from raw story
