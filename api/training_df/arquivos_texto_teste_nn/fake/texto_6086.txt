this is why we have separation of church and state  to guard this country from religious whackos like mississippi governor phil bryant in april  bryant signed a sweeping anti lgbt law that allows public and private employers to discriminate against gay people and anyone else such as interracial couples  atheists  and people who have had premarital sex if they claim to have a  sincerely held religious belief  this abuse of religious liberty by republicans has now reached fever pitch as many red states are adopting similar laws as a way to be bigoted assholes toward to certain groups of people  and now bryant  despite being criticized by people in his own state  is calling upon christians across the country to martyr themselves for the right to discriminate during the right wing watchmen on the wall conference  family research council hate group leader tony perkins introduced bryant as the winner of the first ever  samuel adams religious freedom award  for passing the bigoted law in his state  which means samuel adams is probably rolling in his grave perkins declared that all elected officials should be  ministers of god  and bryant kissed perkins  ass by comparing him to david in the biblical story of david and goliath  i remember in sunday school  reading one of my favorite stories  it was about a giant  a bad giant  who came into a valley one day and he called to the israelites   send down your champion and let me vanquish him   we were in that valley  but tony perkins was there with us  he was there as surely as our lord and savior  as surely as the god of all gods stood there with us  and i can tell you how fortunate we are in this nation and in this organization to have a man of faith and leadership in tony  god bless you for what you do  bryant then proceeded to whine about the opposition to the discriminatory law he signed claiming that they don t know the history of christians being persecuted and said christians are willing to stand in line for crucifixion to secure their right to discriminate  they don t know that christians have been persecuted throughout the ages  they don t know that if it takes crucifixion  we will stand in line before abandoning our faith and our belief in our lord and savior jesus christ  so if we are going to stand  now is the time and this is the place  here s the video via right wing watch this is proof of how insane conservative  christians  have become  they imagine that they are being persecuted because they aren t allowed to refuse service to people they hate  of course  if christians were really being persecuted in this country they would be dragged out in the streets and beaten or killed as they are in countries where christianity is a minority religion  that s what real persecution looks like but bryant is hardly the first mississippi governor to use religion to justify bigotry  as a two term governor and us senator from the state in the  through late   bilbo believed that god sanctioned racism according to think progress for senator bilbo racism was more that just an ideology  it was a sincerely held religious belief  in a book entitled take your choice  separation or mongrelization  bilbo wrote that  urity of race is a gift of god         and god  in his infinite wisdom  has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity  it can never be redeemed   allowing  the blood of the races  mix   according to bilbo  was a direct attack on the  divine plan of god   there  is every reason to believe that miscengenation and amalgamation are sins of man in direct defiance to the will of god  another mississippi governor named ross barnett was still repeating the same justification in    the good lord was the original segregationist   he claimed segregation has since been outlawed  but conservatives are still using the same argument to justify their bigotry and it s going to be fun watching a federal court put them in their place once again featured image via screenshot
