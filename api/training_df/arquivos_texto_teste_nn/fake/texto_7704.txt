during a segment on the late show  host stephen colbert ripped the gop for creating the  monster  that is donald trump  republicans are right now working double time to slay the beast right now  the gop s strategy is to urge people to vote for any candidate who they think can win enough delegates to take down trump  mocking this strategy  colbert says  what an inspiring message for the world s greatest democracy  don t vote for who you think should be president  vote for whichever candidate in your state has the best chance of keeping trump from getting enough delegates  it s a system often employed by bros in bars that rhymes with clock block  the gop has cast mitt romney as their knight in republican red  the republican establishment thinks that romney s anti trump political crusade might be what is needed to halt trump in his tracks  however  as colbert notes  there is something that the gop seems to have forgotten   trump isn t a politician  this guy says that s the only way to save democracy from the voters  after you vote  maybe they ll give you a sticker that says   i did what mitt romney told me to do   this game of ganging up on the popular guy that s actually winning  that s not democracy   that s a reality show strategy  and that s trump s home turf  do you honestly think you re going to be better at this than him  trump is not running a political campaign   colbert continues   he s a reality show contestant who has established himself as a villain to polarize the audience and then do whatever it takes to get to the final tribal council to get the rose that lets him have sex with the top chef  then you get to name a supreme court justice in the fantasy suite  it looks like the only thing that will take down trump s campaign is the democratic nominee  fortunately  polls indicate that there is an almost guaranteed chance of a dem trouncing trump in the general election you can watch the segment below featured image from video screenshot
