michigan governor rick snyder is still desperately clinging to his job  but there are signs that his fingers are slipping for weeks  the country has been learning with growing horror the depths to which snyder s administration sank to save a few bucks  a startling picture has finally come into focus  rather than listen to scientists and residents  michigan s state government decided to simply ignore all signs that the water system in the city of flint was beginning to corrode away  as a result  dangerous chemicals including lead had begun pouring into the drinking water  the fix to prevent a mass poisoning of residents from their tap water would have cost barely anything  but they gambled it all   and flint lost as early as october   there were problematic signs  a local general motors engine plant stopped using water from the flint river because parts were becoming rusted  but officials nevertheless continued to reassure residents the water was safe to drink   a decision deemed  unconscionable  by democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton this week tests also revealed elevated levels of chemical compounds in the water supply that can lead to liver or kidney issues  nonetheless  officials downplayed residents  concerns  saying   confidently   that the water was safe to drink how bad was the lead poisoning in flint s water  ten people have died from drinking it  doctors now warn that every child in flint under the age of six   over   of them   must now be treated for lead poisoning  the long term effects to their health and mental development won t be known for some time it s gotten so bad that president obama was forced to declare a federal emergency in flint  national guard troops have begun pouring into the state to help get water to people who can t trust their faucets not to kill them  celebrities such as cher and michael moore have flown in tens of thousands of bottles of water through it all  michigan s republican governor has spent almost all of his energy trying to spin this epic disaster as not his fault  absolutely nobody is buying it in a bold move  hillary clinton even used her time during the democratic debate to put a spotlight on flint and the failures of snyder s administration  i spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what s happening in flint  michigan  and i think every single american should be outraged  we ve had a city in the united states of america where the population which is poor in many ways and majority african american has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water  and the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care  snyder responded to this forceful condemnation of his pathetic actions by giving a more pathetic response political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the flint water crisis   governor rick snyder   onetoughnerd  january    convenient that the man that every finger is pointing to now believes finger pointing isn t important another person not buying snyder s buck passing  president obama  snyder recently demanded the federal government give him   million in  natural disaster  aid money to help him pay for the fall out of his negligence  obama  who has already pooled resources to help flint residents out  said  no way  federal emergency management agency administrator w  craig fugate  in a letter to snyder  said his request for a major disaster declaration was denied because the water contamination  does not meet the legal definition of a  major disaster  under federal law  the incident was not the result of a natural catastrophe  nor was it created by a fire  flood or explosion   fugate said this wasn t a hurricane or a tornado or a wildfire  this was a republican party that was so interested in turning a profit that they gambled with the lives of their constituents  calling this a natural disaster would be one of the biggest political lies ever told it should also be noted that while snyder would like nearly  million dollars from the federal government   hypocritical coming from a small government conservative  no    his state just posted a   million surplus  flint s lawmakers have asked that some of that money be used to help out the city  so far snyder hasn t offered it  as we ve seen time and again  a republican governor wants nothing to do with the government until he needs its help to clean up one of his screw ups  president obama and federal agencies routinely serve as punching bags for republican politicians who pretend that government equals tyranny  now  with a man made disaster unfolding on his hands  snyder is mad that this very same  tyrannical  government won t do more to help save him from himself if snyder wants help he should take responsibility and confess that it was his actions that brought on this water crisis  he can clarify that this wasn t a  natural disaster  in his resignation letter featured image via michigan municipal league flickr
