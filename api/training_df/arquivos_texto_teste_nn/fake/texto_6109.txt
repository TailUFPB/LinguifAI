as republicans unite around gop candidate donald trump  all hope seems to be lost for the  never trump  camp but republican strategist  commentator and neoconservative bill kristol may have just revived the  never trump  camp with one tweet just a heads up over this holiday weekend  there will be an independent candidate an impressive one  with a strong team and a real chance   bill kristol   billkristol  may    kristol has in no way hinted at who that candidate may be  one can assume it could be from a shortlist of conservatives who have been openly hostile to trump  senator ben sasse of nebraska  former presidential candidate mitt romney  governor of new mexico susana martinez  or perhaps kristol himself should a conservative  independent  run against donald trump  such a move would all but ensure a clinton victory  a split gop would pave the way for not only a democratic takeover of the white house  but the gop would suffer badly in their vulnerable senate elections  and democrats could very well take back the house simply put  republicans putting in a third party candidate would be the revolution sanders and trump have been talking about all along  and neither would benefit much from it it s amazing that republicans haven t learned their lesson from the last two elections   that a last minute effort to add pizzazz to an election never bodes well for their end game  they learned that when mccain tried to pander to women with sarah palin in   and they learned that in  when they tried to entice business republicans with mitt romney perhaps this third party candidate  aside from gary johnson of the libertarian party  could have a real representation by the electorate  sending a strong message to the gop that their flirtation with right wing extremism needs to come to an end once and for all maybe that was the gop s end game after all   put the final nail into the coffin that is extremism and start anew  because with america s growing diversity  they won t last long cow towing to the crazies featured image via george frey getty images
