with donald trump handing out nicknames left and right  one nickname that has come to mind for him would be  hypocrite trump  first of all  he doesn t apparently realize that the internet can document the things you say for years after you say them  secondly  he also doesn t seem to realize that those things that he said can and will come back to haunt him for instance  back in   trump  on top of previously requesting president obama s birth certificate  also demanded that he release his college transcripts trump tweeted out on october     only days before the  presidential election  why does obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition  hiding something  why does obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition  hiding something   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    of course president obama wasn t hiding anything  and trump was just trying to stir up trouble to make people believe the president was up to no good now  flash forward to today and trump refuses to release his tax returns  documents that every presidential candidate releases to show the nation financial transparency  of course  trump has lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he can t release them  all of which have been debunked so  please  by all means  let s remind trump of his blaring hypocrisy  clearly  according to himself  he s hiding something featured photo by scott olson getty images   twitter
