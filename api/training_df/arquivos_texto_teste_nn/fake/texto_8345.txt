the iowa caucuses have come and gone  leaving in their wake a trail of fallen candidates no longer willing to have their dignity handed to them by the likes of donald trump and ted cruz  not that republicans have any actual dignity  so let s just go with the idea that they re tired of being embarrassed who can blame them  mike huckabee was the first to fall  joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness   the voters are sick of me   said the huckster  waka waka  buh bye  rand paul went down in flames shortly thereafter  deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead  which is a valid concern for the democrats  martin o malley dropped out  which comes as no surprise to anyone that leaves the two major contenders for the democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors  senators who don t bother voting and a few non politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works even with the dropouts and a cruz victory proving devastating to donald trump  the real loser of the iowa caucuses was jeb bush  who outspent every by dropping more than   million and walking away with votes in the single digits  none of the  establishment  favorites fared well with the exception of marco rubio  who stepped up in the absence of donald trump at the last fox news debate and screamed at america every time he was given the chance it s a circus for sure  luckily  we have people like stephen colbert who know how to take the ridiculously irritating republican field and turn them into the buffoons they are for our enjoyment  stephen dons his hunger games attire  which includes eyebrows that his  forehead can t contain   and spends a few minutes making asinine asshats look even worse than they already do watch stephen colbert lambaste the  fallen tributes  in this hilarious clip featured image from screen capture
