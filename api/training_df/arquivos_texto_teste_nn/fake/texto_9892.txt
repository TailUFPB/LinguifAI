as one of the most approachable presidents in history  president donald trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo  he s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture  as soon as the photo hit the internet  everyone noticed one shocking thing in it the photo looks like every other fan shot out there  with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president  however  it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s elijah and gianna lucas live in fresno  california but were in washington  d c  on monday to attend a ceremony in honor of national peace officers  memorial day  like thousands of others  they sat in the crowd and listened to our commander in chief speak about the importance of police work in america and the sacrifice it often is  which has gone without recognition for eight years under barack obama  trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well  many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty while obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it  trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name  this means more to elijah and gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father  who died while on duty on october     president trump holds fresno county sheriff s sgt  rod lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with lucas  children  elijah and gianna lucas  at the capitol in washington  d c i don t recall obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed  let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children  he did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims what s seen in this shot of the president with fresno officer sgt  rod lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the trump had to be a part of this day for them  to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service  lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on october     they were shifting guns around  talking about different ways to carry a second gun  when a gun was accidentally discharged  and a bullet struck lucas in the chest   breitbart reports   investigators determined no foul play was involved  rather  lucas  a  year veteran of the force  was  having a conversation with a nine year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired   in years past during police week  families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president  now that trump is in office  he s more than making up for that lost time under obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home  feel that they aren t forgotten in an incredible moment at the same event on monday  held in front of the u s  capitol in d c   trump turned his speech to a  year old boy named micah  who he saw in the audience  micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in phoenix  arizona  trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium  which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it until trump took office  the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime  whenever a cop was killed  the past president wouldn t have even addressed it  however  that era officially ended on monday when trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying   i want you to know that patriotic americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police
