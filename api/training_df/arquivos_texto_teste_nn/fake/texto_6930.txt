south carolina republicans just introduced an anti lgbt bill similar to laws passed in north carolina and mississippi  and they are already paying the price for it gop state senator lee bright thinks trans people are a threat to the safety of women and children in bathrooms despite there being zero evidence of it across the country  i mean  years ago we kept talking about tolerance  tolerance  and tolerance  and now they want men who claim to be women to be able to go into bathrooms with children   bright said on the floor of the state senate while introducing his legislation   and you got corporations who say this is okay  but bright s claim is a complete lie that is not based in fact  in  states and over  cities across the country that have passed protections for lgbt people against discrimination  there has not been a single recorded instance of a trans person entering a women s bathroom to sexually harass anyone yet republicans have made the claim to justify their anti lgbt bills anyway  making discrimination legal under the guise of religious liberty  north carolina passed the odious law last month  and mississippi did the same this month  so far  both states have faced a severe backlash and it is costing both states dearly businesses and corporations are threatening to pull out of the state and many have already done so or cancelled plans to expand into the states  both are also facing the loss of billions of federal dollars and corporations aren t even waiting for south carolina republicans to pass their own bill into law  just introducing it was enough for one ceo to move his company to california rather than remain in a state that still embraces bigotry uphold is a financial services industry that allows users of the service to transfer deposits of bitcoin into reserve backed currencies such as the dollar  it s a fast growing business that has handled nearly   billion in transactions in just the last two years ceo anthony watson is so disgusted by bright s bill that he has decided to move his company  which is headquartered in charleston  out of the state  uphold is founded on the key pillars of transparency and accountability  and at our very core  we stand for fairness  inclusion and equality   watson wrote in a statement on the company website   just as uphold brings financial services to everyone  everywhere  we ve also built a company that brings the principles of fairness  inclusion and equality to everything we do  watson then proceeded to rip south carolina republicans a new one and announced his decision to launch a preemptive exodus out of the state rather than sit and watch as bigoted republicans jam the bill into law  as the openly gay  british ceo of an american company  i have watched in shock and dismay as legislation has been abruptly proposed or enacted in several states across the union seeking to invalidate the basic protections and rights of lgbt  lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender  u s  citizens some of you may be aware that uphold s u s  headquarters is based in charleston  south carolina  in recent days  we have been made aware that south carolina sen  lee bright has introduced a bill largely mirroring north carolina s controversial law that blocks local governments from passing lgbt inclusive anti discrimination ordinances  as such  we feel compelled to take action to oppose the discrimination being proposed in south carolina and protect our lgbt employees today  uphold has taken the difficult decision to move its u s  corporate headquarters from charleston  south carolina to los angeles  california we will stand firm in our commitment to fairness  equality and inclusion and our strong conviction that we can make a difference by living our core values  it s the right thing to do for our members  employees  partners and the communities in which we live and work  the bold move will cost south carolinians hundreds of jobs and will likely be a major blow to the state and local economies  it s just a taste of what south carolina republicans can expect if they continue on the path of taking the state backwards featured iamge via wikimedia
