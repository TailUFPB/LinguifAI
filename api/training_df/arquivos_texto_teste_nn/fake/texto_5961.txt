donald trump  the gop candidate who has been completely anti muslim for his entire presidential campaign and even proposed a ban on all muslims from coming into the united states  has said that he wants to attend the funeral of boxing legend muhammad ali  who happens to have been an openly proud muslim not only has trump perpetuated xenophobia and a deepening fear and hatred of muslims in his supporters  but he has repeatedly insisted that everyone who follows islam  hates us   all things considered  it s baffling that trump would want to be at a funeral where there will literally be thousands of muslims  while it s not clear why trump wants to go  ali s family has responded to trump s desire to attend the muslim funeral on thursday  and it s definitely worth sharing ali s family spokesmen bob gunnell said  everything we re doing here was blessed by muhammad ali and was requested  ali firmly believed in inclusiveness  and gunnell said that the boxing legend would have wanted people from all different faiths to be at the service  while gunnell couldn t confirm if trump would actually show his face or not  he said trump  would be welcome to attend  saliha shakir  a friend to ali  said that the family knows the nasty things trump has said about muslims  but it wouldn t have stopped ali from extending kindness in the face of hate  he would have wanted people to know that islam is an inclusive religion  rather than the divisive one that trump has portrayed it as  shakir said  none of us care for  rhetoric  but this is what ali would have wanted  he would not have turned him away  this response shows a great deal of class  as ali wasn t naive to trump s islamophobia  after trump said he would ban muslims from coming into america in response to a terrorist attack in san bernardino  california  ali spoke out about islam and its true principles  i am a muslim and there is nothing islamic about killing innocent people in paris  san bernardino  or anywhere else in the world  true muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called islamic jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion  we as muslims have to stand up to those who use islam to advance their own personal agenda  they have alienated many from learning about islam  true muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force islam on anybody  and he also brilliantly called out trump and those who try to make islam out to be a violent religion  speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness  i believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people s views on what islam really is  even after his death  ali s values will live on  while it s not clear if trump will attend ali s muslim funeral on thursday or the interfaith services on friday  he could really learn something featured image via wikipedia and john moore   getty images
