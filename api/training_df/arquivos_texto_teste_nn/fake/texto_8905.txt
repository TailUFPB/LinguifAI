republican presidential hopeful ted cruz stunned audiences on the campaign trail this week with a piece of paranoid fantasy that would make alex jones blush  on wednesday  cruz reportedly told crowds cruz   we re just steps away from the chisels at arlington coming out to remove crosses and stars of david from tombstones    daveweigel   daveweigel  january    most rational human beings  this statement would occur as a flight of fear mongering fancy so far beyond the bounds of reality that it was laughable  but  he is appealing to republican voters after all   a majority of whom believe the earth was created  years ago  by an omnipotent god but even for a gop candidate  this is out there  so  what on earth prompted this moment of insanity context of that cruz nightmare of crosses being chiseled off soldiers  tombstones  it could happen if  liberals dominate scotus  daveweigel   daveweigel  january     that s it  apparently senator cruz believes that the only thing restraining obama from sneaking into arlington with a chisel and removing religious symbols from the gravestones  is the presence of conservatives on the supreme court of the united states could it be that the gop hopeful s rant had less to do with arlington  and more to do with the fact that the birther conspiracy has blown up in his face cruz  born in canada to a u s  citizen mother and a cuban father  is now facing the birther conspiracy that he so enjoyed inflicting upon president obama  the three requirements to be president of the united states are the definition of  natural born citizen  is still unsettled in u s  law  meaning that cruz is far more open to genuine challenge by the birther movement than hawaii native barack obama this sounds like the desperate rant of a candidate in trouble  as driftglass points out expertly ted cruz knows the rotting  raving heart of the gop perfectly well  from his dentist s drill voice to the transparently concocted  treacly fascism of his style  he has spent his adult life meticulously constructing a public persona to fit the madness of his party hand in glove and he is not going to let some interloping radioactive chia publican sweep in and steal his brownshirt chumps awkward featured image via flickr creative commons
