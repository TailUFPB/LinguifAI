donald trump made an appearance last night on the tonight show starring jimmy fallon when fallon informed the republican front runner that he would be performing a mock interview with him for the presidency  the usually aggressive trump seemed mild mannered at times and appeared tired  perhaps from the toll that an election campaign can take on someone however  trump stuck to his previous controversial statements about muslims  saying that although he has muslim friends  they should be banned from entering the united states  he also took a few shots at hillary clinton  saying that he doesn t understand how she s not beating bernie sanders  trump said  i mean  how can you lose like this  he really isn t even a democrat  but he said he s a socialist  and i think he may be a step beyond a socialist  he also said that he would easily beat hillary clinton in the general election  i m winning against hillary one on one  and i haven t even started on her yet  although last week i did a little bit  but we haven t even started  later  during the mock interview  trump was asked about his strengths to be president  his response was ironic since he described himself as a unifier of people  drawing uncomfortable laughter from the audience this is the same trump who has frightened millions of hispanic and muslim americans in the united states with his rhetoric here is a transcript of the mock interview describe yourself  i m an extraordinarily handsome person  i have a beautiful head of hair  i was always a good student  and i always worked hard  why do you want this job  because i wanna make america great  what are your strengths  i think  believe it or not  i can bring people together  what are your weaknesses   that i never forget  i m too nice too long  and when i become   somebody takes advantage of a situation  i become too bad for too long  are you willing to relocate  i love the white house  this is a high profile position  is media attention something you d be comfortable with  not at all  i d be very uncomfortable  featured image via youtube screenshot
