it s astonishing that after all of the fake russia collusion on trump  we have hillary  obama and others who are the real thugs dealing with russia senator chuck grassley had this to say about the russia uranium deal   despite an ongoing criminal investigation into officials working for subsidiaries of rosatom  the russian government entity seeking to acquire ownership of u s  uranium  the obama administration approved the deal  the justice department has reportedly threatened to prosecute the informant if he discloses details of his involvement in the investigation  the executive branch does not have the authority to use non disclosure agreements to avoid congressional scrutiny  if the fbi is allowed to contract itself out of congressional oversight  it would seriously undermine our constitutional system of checks and balances  the justice department needs to work with the committee to ensure that witnesses are free to speak without fear  intimidation or retaliation from law enforcement  witnesses who want to talk to congress should not be gagged and threatened with prosecution for talking  if that has happened  senior doj leadership needs to fix it and release the witness from the gag order   grassley said
