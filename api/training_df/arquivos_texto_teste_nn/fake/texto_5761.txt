author stephen king has been a longtime advocate for gun control and he knows exactly why we can expect to see more mass shootings in the future during a chat with game of thrones author george r  r  martin  king briefly talked about about gun violence in the wake of the orlando mass shooting in which  people were killed and over  were wounded king suggested that shooters like omar mateen and dylann roof are at least partially driven to commit their heinous crimes by the media because they are looking for fame and the media always talks about the body count as if they are keeping score  in addition  the shooters end up getting their very own wikipedia page and their photos are plastered on the news for days or even weeks after their crimes king said that these shooters start out as  nobodies  and that they see committing a mass shooting as a way to gain notoriety  a lot of these guys are nobodies who see their way to some kind of stardom by creating an act of mass terror  and  of course  the sad thing about this is that we remember the killers long after their victims are forgotten  and that s one of the things that makes this a self perpetuating act  i would argue that someone like the man who shot all these people in orlando  he may have pledged allegiance to isis but before that he was a spouse abuser and somebody with a lot of anger  and i think that in a lot of cases these acts are perpetrated by people who may put some political icing on the cake  but basically they re just f cking crazy  indeed  and those  f cking crazy  people are able to legally buy assault weapons  which king pointed out will continue to lead to more mass shootings as long as we allow people access to them  if that guy had gone in there with a knife he would have been overpowered before he had stabbed more than four people  as long as anybody who s got only two wheels on the road can walk into a store and buy a f cking killing machine like an ar  or something  this is just going to go on  it s really up to us  here s the video via youtube  king s remarks on gun violence begin at the  minute mark stephen king is absolutely right and his point is illustrated perfectly by australia  after five mass shootings between  and   the people there demanded action and banned assault weapons  there hasn t been a mass shooting since featured image via screen capture
