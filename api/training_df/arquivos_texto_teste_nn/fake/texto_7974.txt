there are a lot of things citizens of the united states can and do look for in a commander in chief  however  it s doubtful that  schoolyard bully  is part of the ideal criteria for president  there s really no better way to describe donald trump  he s nasty  vile  bigoted  hate filled  and outright nauseating  the things that he says aren t okay to say in any arena of professional life  and they only reason he s allowed to get away with it is because of money  power and privilege  if the words he uses were to come out of a poor person living on the street  you d think they were unstable  phone the police and they would likely get carted away for a lifetime in an asylum for years  trump has tried to perpetuate the myth that president obama not only isn t a natural born citizen  but that he s also muslim  and while there s absolutely nothing wrong with being muslim  hearing it from a man who equates islam solely to terrorism means he s calling our commander in chief a terrorist continuing this hostile fallacy  trump took to twitter to try to be witty  and posed the question  i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque  very sad that he did not go  i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque  very sad that he did not go   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    of all  president obama did go to the supreme court building alongside his wife to pay his respects while justice scalia lay in repose on friday  and vice president biden will be attending the funeral service  however  this wasn t at all a jab at the fact that obama wasn t unable to attend the service  it was a direct attack on president obama to once again perpetuate the myth that our president is muslim  which in trump s language means  he s a terrorist  it s not even coded language  it s clear as day as he lays down his hatred for muslims nearly every day this man has a very real chance at becoming the gop nominee for president  which is absolutely disgusting  and it says a lot not only about trump  but about the hateful bigots in this nation who seem to think he s the right choice featured image  flickr twitter
