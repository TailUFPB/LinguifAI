watching people line up behind donald trump is concerning in and of itself  but we may finally have an explanation as to why certain people have been so quick to endorse the republican presidential frontrunner after dropping out of the race themselves first  it was new jersey governor chris christie  who had been slamming trump his whole campaign  but then turned around to endorse him  and now  dr  ben carson has backed the real estate mogul  however  carson may have just revealed why he actually threw his support behind trump   and the reason may actually be illegal while being interviewed on newsmax  carson seemed to imply that he was offered an  advisory  position in trump s potential administration in return for an endorsement  one big problem with that  though  offering a role in exchange for an endorsement is against federal law carson said  i didn t see a path for kasich  who i like  or for rubio  who i like  as far as cruz is concerned  i don t think that he s gonna be able to draw independents and democrats unless he has some kind of miraculous change  is there another scenario that i would have preferred  yes  but that scenario isn t available  however  expanding on what cemented his decision  carson said  i will be doing things as well   certainly in an advisory capacity  we haven t handled out all the details but it is very important that we work together in this country  again  i m not going to reveal any details about it right now because all of this is still very liquid  which leads any person with common sense to realize trump clearly offered carson a role in exchange for his support  however  according to the federal legal code  whoever  being a candidate  directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment  or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment  for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year  or both  and if the violation was willful  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years  or both  carson very may well have led to the chance of federal charges being filed against trump  will that happen  likely not  should it  most definitely  trump is gaming the system and seems to be promising favors  it s scandalous at best  and most definitely illegal here s the video via think progress featured image via youtube
