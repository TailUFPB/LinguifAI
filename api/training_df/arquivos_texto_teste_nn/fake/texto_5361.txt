trump s campaign has been desperately trying to win over all the minority groups it has spent the last several months offending and excluding  and that was obvious after the pandering we saw trump do at the republican national convention not only did trump s daughter ivanka talk about the gender wage gap to target women  but trump also gave a shout out to the lgbt community after basically ignoring them during his campaign  regardless of these efforts to expand his reach  we all know who trump s primary fanbase is  white men while it s obvious to most of us just why conservative white males flock to trump to champion their racist  misogynistic views of the world  congressman sean duffy  r wi  had a completely different theory to why trump is so popular for this demographic   white men have been neglected in politics up until trump  in an interview with cnn  duffy explained that it was because finally  white men had a candidate that spoke to them  referencing trump s closing speech at the rnc  duffy said  i think what a lot of people want  the greatest line of the speech was when he pointed at the camera and said   i m going to fight for you   there are so many people who feel like they ve been left aside  there s a viewpoint that says   i can fight for minorities  and i can fight for women   and if you get that  you make up a vast majority of the voting block and you win  and white males have been left aside a little bit in the politics of who speaks to them white males have been left aside a little bit in the politics of who speaks to them   not in regard to the economy and culture   but who speaks to them politically  donald trump is  i think  speaking across a wide breadth of people in a way that i think you re going to see these numbers pop  you can watch this cringe worthy segment below   repseanduffy   white males have been left aside a little bit in the politics of who speaks to them   rncincle https   t co   new day   newday  july    hosts were pretty much left speechless that duffy would seriously say something this stupid out loud and on television  duffy actually  with confidence  said that white men have finally found a candidate that plays to their concerns   nevermind the fact that   of congress was composed of white males in   despite that they are only   of the american population this is such a horrific example of someone oblivious to white male privilege  and if anyone understands how  underprivileged  white men are in this country  surely it s duffy  who once complained about how he s struggling to make ends meet on his measly    per year salary featured image via screenshot
