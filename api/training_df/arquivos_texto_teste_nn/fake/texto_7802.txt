ted cruz just got his ass handed to him by a fox news host on national television for whining about hard questions during an appearance on fox news sunday  chris wallace grilled the texas senator over the  dirty tricks  his campaign has perpetrated since the iowa primary in apparently desperate attempts to smear candidates and steak votes from them  your campaign has been involved in a series of incidents that people are calling dirty tricks  in iowa  the cruz campaign sent out tweets saying ben carson was suspending his campaign  that was false  the campaign put out fliers accusing people of voting violations  that was false  in south carolina  a cruz super pac attacked trump over the confederate flag  and your then communications director posted a link this week accusing rubio of disrespecting the bible  that was false  do you take personal responsibility   this was your campaign except for the super pac   do you take personal responsibility for this series of incidents  and what does it say about the culture of the campaign you are running  cruz not only failed to take personal responsibility for his campaign s actions  he called wallace a liar and accused him of being a donald trump pawn  every accusation you raised there is incorrect   cruz replied   i appreciate your reading the donald trump attack file on that  and that did not sit well with wallace at all  and he proceeded to take cruz to the woodshed for it wallace   oh  come on  sir  wait a minute  sir  you personally apologized to ben carson on a debate stage  cruz   chris  don t interrupt me  wallace   you fired your communications director  cruz   chris  don t interrupt me  wallace   don t say this in an oppo file on our part  sir  cruz   chris  please don t interrupt me  wallace   please don t accuse me of something i didn t do  cruz   let me know when i m allowed to answer  wallace   well  don t accuse me of doing something i didn t do  two of those things  you apologized for one and you fired your communications director  don t say this is the oppo file  after his ass whooping by wallace  cruz went on to unbelievably claim that his campaign is running at the  highest level of integrity   completely unfazed by the facts presented by wallace to his face here s the video via youtube this is the perfect example of ted cruz saying and doing anything to be president  rather than explain himself and accept personal responsibility  cruz flat out lied to wallace and pretended his campaign has never done anything wrong  and then he complained about the line of questioning and claimed they were part of a donald trump approved attack line ted cruz definitely could have handled this better  but now all he has is egg on his face featured image via video screen capture
