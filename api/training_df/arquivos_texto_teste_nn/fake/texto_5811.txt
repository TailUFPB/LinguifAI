there is an attitude among those on the right that if you aren t a straight white male  you come armed with a political agenda that keeps you from doing your job  even anderson cooper  who is one of the nation s most respected journalists  and who happens to be gay  had his credibility called into question  at least when he s covering stories that happen to be about gay people that was the accusation by fox news  howard kurtz  who said that cooper couldn t have been fair to florida attorney general pam bondi  when he asked her about her civil rights record when it comes to lgbt issues  i respect anderson cooper and i think he s generally fair   kurtz told fox news contributor guy benson   do you think he was acting as more than just an aggressive journalist  he seemed like an activist   benson agreed   of course  i only watch fox all the time  but i ve heard that he s very good at his job  he s a versatile journalist  in this circumstance  i thought the line of questioning for the attorney general of florida  under the circumstance and given the context of what had just happened in that state  it was a bizarre non sequitur  it seemed like he was browbeating her for unrelated political thought crimes in her past   benson added   which did not relate to the to the task at hand  which is roundly condemning the horrific atrocity that happened  here s the video this was the argument used by donald trump  when he said that a latino   american judge just had to be biased against him  simply because the judge was latino  really  this is the argument used against anyone who isn t a penis carrying member of the white race  women can t talk about birth control or abortion  we re too biased  people of color can t talk about issues facing them and gay people can t talk about the time a freak walked into a gay bar and murdered  people  oh  and g d forbid people  other than rich  white men  decide to speak for themselves fox news and kurtz  of course  are the poster children for media bias  the entire network is built around it  kurtz once defended trump against his kicking univision s jorge ramos out of a press conference  saying ramos  seemed like a heckler   ramos  though  like cooper  was just doing his job  if skin color or sexual orientation means that one must be biased  perhaps it s time to look at the biases of rich  straight white men kurtz was fine with christians covering the attack on a christian church in south carolina  though featured image via video screen capture
