let s just say that if you consider being white the best thing about yourself  you must live one sad  lonely  and pathetic life  one of these pathetic people apparently felt the need to create a  whites only  website to meet like minded folk  and not just any website  a dating website what is this dating website called   where white people meet   of course  duh of course  they re not gonna just come out and say they re racist  they re just going to make the website  in the predominantly white state of utah  and claim that it s just like any other dating website  here s what it says in their  about us   section  we developed this dating website as an alternative to the other dating websites that cater to certain groups  we simply want to help people connect in a safe and fun online environment without costing them a ton of money  enjoy  except  who is it an alternative for  it looks as though  for just    it s an exclusive alternative for anti gay white supremacists  it seems as though one can t search for a same sex pairing  and the website doesn t state where it stands on polygamy via wherewhitepeoplemeet com what s even more bizarre is the fact that they would advertise this  whites only  on billboards in utah  a state that is   percent white  is it really that hard to find other white singles in utah  chances are  if you run into a single person  they re going to be white  so  why bother  unless you just want to be a racist douchebag west valley billboard promotes utah based dating site geared toward white people  https   t co  pic twitter com   salt lake tribune   sltrib  december    course  the website states that it has nothing to do with racism  i am sure some of you are wondering about the concept and need for a dating website titled  where white people meet com   our answer to that would be why not  there are various dating websites that promote and cater to just about every origin  race  religion and lifestyle out there  so again  why not  where white people meet com   basically  it s a  don t forget white people exist  too  website  which is often code among white supremacists who feel they are being overrun by people born with more melanin in their skin  they have to make sure they are seen and heard  so  while they try to say things like  as you navigate the website and begin to interact with other members  please remember the golden rule of  treat others as you want to be treated   the staff here at where white people meet will not tolerate rude  aggressive or racist behavior  the last thing we want it to have to remove a member of this community but please know that we will  they should be aware that creating a website in a nearly entirely white state to cater to only white people is pretty damn racist in and of itself  and while the naacp has determined that it doesn t seem to be the work of a hate group  the whole thing just seems really weird and unnecessary  in fact  if this whole thing turned out to some satirical joke  it wouldn t at all be surprising  it s that weird featured image  wherewhitepeoplemeet com
