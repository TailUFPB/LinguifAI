a fellow multi billionaire from new york and neighbor to none other than donald trump has already laid the groundwork for entering into the  presidential race  that person is michael bloomberg   and this time  he s not only flirting with the possibility  but he s also considering throwing in   billion of his own money to make it happen  while that may be a lot of dough for the donald  a sizeable percentage at least  for bloomberg  it s practically nothing the former mayor of new york is no stranger to politics  either  having served in the position for  years  and he s worth an estimated    billion  that makes him the  richest person in the world today  according to forbes  if anyone could make a dent in the race  it s him he would have to run as an independent  for sure  and while the chances of him winning would be slim to none taking that path  here s what s more important  bloomberg entering the race would be a straight up disaster for democrats  to say the least  and  it makes you start to think along these terms  is a billionaire going to buy the presidency this go around  for a fellow new york billionaire mr  bloomberg says he would be in it to win it  but let s look at the numbers  the washington examiner did a poll already on this and had trump winning in a three way race if clinton gets the nomination  trump would receive around  percent of the vote to clinton s  percent while bloomberg would only tally  percent  while it s possible there could still be a clinton win within the margin of error  it opens up a path for a trump win  period  just giving trump a possible win is enough to make this scary the elections department at the huffington post has a vast array of polls pitting clinton against trump  going back months  guess what  clinton has won in a head to head matchup against the donald in  out of the last  conducted  that s an overwhelming amount  it s safe the say that having an independent of bloomberg s stature running is something democrats would rather end up avoiding why bloomberg thinks he would have a chance in this thing  other than to hand the presidency over to the gop is beyond us  but   according to several sources in his camp  he s apparently hoping that bernie sanders takes some key early states  at which case he could step in around an early march time frame  if bernie takes momentum away from clinton  bloomberg thinks he has a chance  here s what that tells us  bloomberg could take even more votes away from the democratic party   he thinks anyways   than he would from the republican party were sanders to win the nomination  that doesn t look good  either his record backs that up  too  he s pro gun control  pro abortion  recognizes climate control is a huge problem  is for immigration reform  in practically every social view he leans to the left  the only thing that hurts him with democrats is the fact that he has close ties to wall street and has a lot of business views that aren t exactly great for poor people even trump wouldn t mind bloomberg jumping in  the new york times even made it the title of their latest article announcing the news  donald trump would  love  to see michael bloomberg run  i would love to see michael run   i would love the competition  i d love to see what would happen   we run  different kinds of business  it s a very different kind of business  but i would say that if he ran  i d be very happy about it  he s not the only one either who sees bloomberg running as a gold mine for trump  alan patricof  a financier and longtime donor to the clintons  said it would be a  terrible thing  for the democratic party if the former mayor decides to run as an independent  if it was president trump or president bloomberg  i d certainly rather have president bloomberg  but  it certainly can t help the democrats  mr  patricof might prefer bloomberg  but that doesn t mean bloomberg would come out ahead  ari fleischer  a former white house press secretary for president george w  bush says this would be a godsend for his party  bloomberg s entry into the race would be a dream come true for republicans  he would draw mostly from the democratic column   i hope he runs  if there s one thing we know  bloomberg is no idiot  if he enters the race  he must know he d only be doing a favor for trump  and  that on the face of it  doesn t make him an enemy of donald trump  if anything  it would make them best friends  no matter what they d like voters to think of their relationship to one another featured image via wikipedia
