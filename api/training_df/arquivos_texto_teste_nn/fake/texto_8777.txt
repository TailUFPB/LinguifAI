we recently saw the heartbreaking plea of  year old ashlie presley  who lives in the area that is currently being occupied by ammon bundy and his band of would be domestic terrorists  she bravely took the microphone and tearfully explained why she was begging the militia to leave  one would think that most people would feel sympathy for her  but no  some people are too callous to feel anything at all  one such person is right wing broadcast personality pete santilli presley is the granddaughter of judge steven grasty  and santilli decided to capitalize on that fact  he said that grasty had allowed his grandchild to become a  prostitute   in one of his broadcasts  live from the wildlife refuge where the militants are camped out  santilli said  that judge was prostituting his granddaughter for political purposes  i m going to call it for what it is  if it were my granddaughter  i would not treat her like a prostitute like he did  he then went on to attack anyone and everyone who opposes what this militia is doing  calling them   bunch of effing communists  for letting the child speak at the meeting  santilli ranted  what he did with his granddaughter is disgusting  it s called prostitution  okay  except you gave it up for free  she s a young girl  she did just a masterful dramatic performance  the only reason that anyone needs to be fearful about what s going on around here are the corrupt bastards like her grandfather  he needs to be fearful because we re going to investigate and we re going to bring some justice to a judge  so  it sounds like this guy is not only attacking a vulnerable  scared teenage girl  but he is also threatening a judge  when will these yahoos be arrested watch the video of santilli s vile remarks below featured image via screen capture from raw story
