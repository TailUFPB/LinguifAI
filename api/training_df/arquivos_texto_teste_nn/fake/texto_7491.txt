hillary clinton s recent appearance with chris matthews for a town hall special turned out to offer far more entertainment than progressives who frequent the station on their dial could have possibly hoped for  while the town hall itself was riveting  with clinton answering tough questions about iraq  libya and other matters of foreign policy and national security  one particular commercial break offered some candid moments the former senator and secretary of state didn t expect to be public alas  the mic was hot  so we get to enjoy a bit of the hillary we don t see on the campaign trail often enough  clinton tries to take the high road when the lights are on and the cameras are rolling  declining to comment in depth on the republican race in an insulting or derogatory way in most instances  sure  she gets her digs  but this was a special moment we have the privilege of enjoying they chatted about trump and the media circus surrounding him  clinton commented that  you guys sure do like to cover him   matthews acknowledged that there is a lot of coverage of the fodder that is the trump campaign  but that most of his network s audience are progressives  to which clinton added   they like to laugh at him   that is so true  those of us who spend our days sharing the world of politics with our readers can t help but cover the buffoonery of donald trump because the alternative is to create more uneducated voters who believe a career in reality tv qualifies a giant orange cheeto to be president the conversation also included some solid jabs at chris christie  secretary clinton  seemingly unsure as to why christie would even consider backing donald trump  asking wallace if he had heard anything about a debt he may have owed  it s a perfectly logical assumption that wallace dismissed with a more obvious answer  he wants a seat in the trump administration listen to the audio below  courtesy of the washington post  featured image from screen capture
