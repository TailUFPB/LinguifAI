donald trump is doubling down on his bizarre claim that the only way that he can lose in pennsylvania this october is because of electoral fraud  trump began this narrative last week in ohio where he said that he is  afraid the election is going to be rigged  we re going to watch pennsylvania  go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don t come in and vote five times   trump said at a rally in altoona  pennsylvania friday   if you do that  we re not going to lose  the only way we can lose  in my opinion   i really mean this  pennsylvania   is if cheating goes on  that claim was made despite the fact that hillary clinton has maintained a very comfortable lead over trump in the polls since then  trump has doubled down on his claims that the election will be stolen from him in pennsylvania  trump s campaign has gone so far as to try and recruit supporters to act as election observers  normally  recruiting election overseers wouldn t be too out of the ordinary for a campaign to do  however  traditionally campaigns hire or recruit people with a legal background to do the work  trump s campaign is calling for anyone and everyone to answer his call to action  we have to call up law enforcement  and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching   trump said on friday calling in an army of your supporters  who will likely have no legal background  to hang out at the polls with a battalion of armed police officers sounds far more like voter intimidation than a move towards ensuring protecting voter s rights  given the scenes of carnage that have come out of trump s rallies  this move is almost sure to set up pennsylvania s polling locations as the backdrops to a few riots  i am going to go ahead and predict that should events unfold that way  it ll be areas with minority populations that are targeted trump cannot give any evidence as to why there will be election fraud in pennsylvania  how could there be  the election hasn t even occurred yet  he is spouting unfounded nonsense because he is desperate  like a wounded animal trapped in a corner  trump is flailing  as nice as it is to see trump squirm  unfortunately  it is the people of pennsylvania and the rest of the united states who will be scratched by the tiny nails on his tiny hands featured image from jeff swensen getty images
