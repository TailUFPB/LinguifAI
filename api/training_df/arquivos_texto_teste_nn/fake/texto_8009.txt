kathryn knott was convicted of a hate crime for helping friends in a gay bashing assault on a same sex couple on a philadelphia street in   she is also the daughter of chalfont borough police chief karl knott  which is most likely why she thinks that she deserves special consideration in this case after she blew her chance at no jail time knott was offered a plea deal for probation  which her two cohorts accepted  but insisted she was just an innocent bystander to the crime and turned down the deal  instead  she opted for a trial where surveillance footage proved she was a damned liar  after the trial  she was found guilty and sentenced to   months of jail time of course  this is an unacceptable situation for her  even though she made her choice to reject the plea  now  she and her lawyers are demanding that her jail sentence is transformed into a public service announcement to  take the infamy of the arrest and maybe heal some wounds   her lawyer is arguing that she is being punished for exercising her constitutional right to have a trial  by the harsher sentence being imposed after she refused a plea deal let s change this up just a bit  a group of  poor  black young adults assaults a heterosexual white couple  beating them up severely  and leaving one with a broken jaw  the same exact sequence of events follows up to the request of one one be let out of jail by doing a psa  this would be laughed out of court she helped beat up a gay couple  leaving them traumatized and one with a broken jaw  she had a chance to accept responsibility and take probation  she blew it by rejecting a deal  but because she s a police chief s princess daughter both she and her lawyer think that grown up consequences don t apply to her  she deserves every damned day of punishment that she gets  and being a white police chief s daughter is not an excuse featured image from philly declaration
