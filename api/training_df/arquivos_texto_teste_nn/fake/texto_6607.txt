chuck todd took ted cruz to the woodshed on sunday after the texas senator claimed that there s a media conspiracy against him cruz is currently in second place far behind republican front runner donald trump  who is close to capturing the gop nomination throughout the interview on meet the press  todd repeatedly tried to get cruz to answer whether he will support trump or not should he become the nominee  but cruz only embarrassed himself by avoiding the question with nonsensical claims about the media and nbc that todd called him out on  if he s the nominee  i take it you can t support him anymore  can you   todd asked  i recognize that many in the media would love for me to surrender to donald trump   cruz accused  it s not about the media   todd replied before stabbing cruz with reality   senator  it s about the numbers  he may win  republican voters are the ones rejecting you  this is not a media conspiracy  senator  todd continued to grill cruz into answering the original question  why can t you answer the question of whether you can support donald trump or not   todd asked   you can t answer that question  why won t you answer that question  straight forward  black and white  cruz then accused nbc executives of being  partisan democrats   which todd immediately called out as a lie  you don t get to just say that  it s just not true  go ahead  you re broad brushing here  and this is exactly what people hate about the media and politics  broad brushes  right  cruz then launched into a rant about how if voters reject him the country will be lost as if he s the only person in the nation who can save it  i m not willing to concede this country   cruz said   if we lose this  we lose our country  at that point  todd dared cruz to take a stand if he really feels that way and answer the question of whether he will support trump or not if he becomes the nominee  all cruz has to say is that he won t support trump  especially if he really believes that by losing to trump the country will be lost  don t you think it s important to take a stand  you just said it s a time for choosing  if it s a time for choosing  say it  for him or against him as the nominee  but like a stubborn petulant child  cruz refused to answer the question and todd slammed him for it  let the record show  you have not taken a position on whether you can support trump if he s the nominee   he concluded  to which cruz replied that the media tried to force him to support trump here s the video via youtube cruz completely humiliated himself during this interview and left us no doubt about why republican voters are rejecting him at the polls he was given a national platform on sunday television to tell voters that he will not stand by trump if he wins the nomination but all he could do was offer contradictory rhetoric about how the country will be lost if trump wins while refusing take a stand against trump when cruz loses the republican primary  he can t blame the media for it  the only one he can blame is himself because he was too cowardly to answer a simple question that would have shown once and for all where ted cruz stands  instead  all he could do is complain  and whining will be all cruz is remembered for doing during this campaign featured image via screenshot
