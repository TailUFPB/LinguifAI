most of us are fully aware that republican nominee donald trump is not only a racist  a misogynist and a bigot  but a complete psychopath and compulsive liar  but what happens when trump is actually put through a clinical sanity test  political commentator keith olbermann decided to find out in a courageous attempt to understand the way trump s disturbed mind works  olbermann examined trump using clinical psychology practices  which lead to his conclusion that trump would not pass any of the  sanity  tests commonly used to identify criminal and antisocial tendencies olbermann released his findings on thursday in vanity fair  and the results were not good for the future of america  the particular test olbermann chose to evaluate trump was  the hare psychopathy checklist   developed by canadian criminal psychologist robert d  hare  which serves as a kind of triage device to separate the injured from the tripping from the psychopathic  this particular test goes through  different personality traits  awarding points for each  such traits include a grandiose sense of self worth  pathological lying  lack of empathy  parasitic lifestyle  promiscuous sexual behavior  and a failure to accept responsibility for one s own actions  just by that small sample of traits alone  you can probably already guess how trump might have scored the maximum amount of points you can get is   and clinical psychopathy is considered any score  or above  trump scored a whopping    making him a certainty for a diagnosis of clinical psychopathy  olbermann remarked on trump s mental health  the implications are clear  our trumperor s new clothes media rightly sees the latest trump  event whatever it is this time as one of the most unbelievable developments in american political history  but the simple mechanics of following  reporting  and writing the proverbial  new high in low  every single day means that they could be missing one overriding truth about the health of the most remarkable presidential candidate since at least   in short  our amateurs  exercise with the very professional hare psychopathy checklist suggests that if you were betting on it  you d probably want to bet that donald trump couldn t pass a sanity test open book  if that isn t terrifying  i don t know what is  trump is the gop nominee  and although clinton will probably wipe the floor with him in the election  the fact that someone as hateful and mentally unstable as trump has gotten this close to the white house should worry us all here s a video from olbermann  which goes through the test and trump s results featured image via screenshot
