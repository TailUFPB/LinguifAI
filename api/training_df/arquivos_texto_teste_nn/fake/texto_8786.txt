during last night s state of the union  republican politicians attempted to put on a brave face and avoid showing any sort of approval for a single thing that president obama said  some succeeded better than others speaker of the house paul ryan had the toughest job  sitting directly behind the president  the camera was directly on his face throughout most of the speech  america cringed as ryan desperately tried to keep his face emotionless and dead while obama spoke  for the most part  the effect was to make ryan seem nearly comatose  his dead eyes barely moved  his slackjawed expression radiated defiant stupidity  it was really hard to watch the farce was blown apart  however  when obama landed a particularly great zinger and ryan couldn t help but break into a laugh  knowing that even flashing a brief smile could send his fanatical republican colleagues into a blood thirsty rage  ryan did everything in his power to stop himself from laughing  his face did things i didn t know a face could do  on live television  ryan s face went to war with itself here s paul ryan trying reeeeally hard not to laugh at one of obama s jokes pic twitter com   gq magazine   gqmagazine  january    one point  ryan appears to physically put his tongue in cheek in order to keep it from betraying its republican values but if republicans were trying   and failing   to put on a brave face  president obama was clearly enjoying himself  in his final state of the union address he took time to go over the many successes his administration had been able to achieve  he also used the opportunity to blast republicans for the childish games they continue to play in order to score cheap political points at the expense of real governance it s unclear whether obama had known ahead of time that republicans would be obsessively focusing on not smiling throughout his speech or if he just guessed based on past behavior  but paul ryan s idiotic attempts to avoid giving obama any sort of credit perfectly accented the president s point  need an example of how delusional the gop has gotten  the republican party  which once claimed to be the party of ideas  couldn t even applaud when the sitting president of the united states said  america is the most powerful nation on earth   even agreeing with him on that point would be  controversial  for these partisan hacks thank you  paul ryan  your weird facial expressions can be used whenever america needs a reminder of where your party s priorities really are  and we ll try not to laugh watch the full state of the union address below  ryan s failed attempt to stifle his laugh begins almost immediately  feature image via c span
