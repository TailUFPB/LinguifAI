one of the most beloved public figures in the entire world is pope francis  he has seemingly restored grace and dignity back to the vatican  where most people were losing hope and feared that corruption and deceit had taken too much of a stronghold  pope francis  humble nature and openness to the world has the world humming with gratitude for a return to solemnity within the vatican walls  so wherever he goes  massive crowds follow who want to meet him  or if anything  merely catch a glimpse however  it looks as though one person became too eager and failed to recognize others around them in their own selfish desire to come into contact with the pontiff according to inside edition  in a rare sight of public agitation  pope francis lost his composure as he greeted a crowd of worshippers in morella  mexico  when a devotee grabbed him by his cassock and wouldn t let go  it caused the pontiff to fall into a wheelchair bound man  the pope sternly told the man in spanish  don t be selfish   pope francis recovered and kissed the man on the head following the incident  he waved to people in the open air gathering for a few more minutes after the incident before leaving  pope francis was exactly right to get mad at what this person was doing to him and made him do to another  they were being selfish and needed to be told that what they were doing was unacceptable  and as far as the pope showing he was upset  that s more than okay  too  heck  even jesus tossed a few tables in anger back in his day this is more than just a soundbite for a story  but a lesson in life  you may want something for yourself  but always respect and think of others who may get hurt if your quest for selfish glory  featured image via youtube
