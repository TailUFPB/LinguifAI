we all know the gop is out of touch with the public  but when there s a major crisis unfolding in the united states  one would expect even the republicans  especially presidential candidates  to keep up to date with what s happening  not so with marco rubio  when asked about the lead contamination crisis in flint  michigan  marco rubio said that he has not  been focusing  on it the contamination has left tens of thousands of residents without drinking water and the lead in the water may have caused irreversible damage to many more who have been drinking it  yet  senator rubio did not feel that it was important to read up on the issue  rubio said  i d love to give you a better answer on it  it s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in michigan on these sorts of issues  rubio continued  saying that he s unable to give  a deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be  other than to tell you that in general i believe the federal government s role in some of these things  largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue  whether he thinks the federal government s role is limited doesn t mean he shouldn t pay attention to a crisis affecting tens of thousands of americans and especially when michigan gov  rick snyder  r  asked the obama administration to declare a state of emergency and send millions of dollars to help alleviate the situation it s not just rubio who s been both silent and ignorant on the issue  other republicans haven t commented on or mentioned the tragedy at all  however  both hillary clinton and bernie sanders have condemned the negligence that led to the crisis  not only framing it as a health problem  but one that is a racial justice issue  clinton said  i think every single american should be outraged  we had a city in the united states of america where the population  which is poor in many ways  and majority african american  has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water  and the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care  he had requests for help that he basically stonewalled  i ll tell you what  if the kids in a rich suburb of detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it  there would have been action  gov  snyder  who s a republican just like rubio  is facing a class action lawsuit from flint residents sen  bernie sanders  added that he thinks gov  snyder should resign   there are no excuses  the governor long ago knew about the lead in flint s water  he did nothing  as a result  hundreds of children were poisoned  thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead  gov  snyder should resign  officials fear that some children in flint who drank and bathed in the water may have brain damage and other long term health problems  yet  rubio and the republicans don t see the importance of addressing and taking the initiative on an unflolding tragedy in an american city featured image via youtube screenshot
