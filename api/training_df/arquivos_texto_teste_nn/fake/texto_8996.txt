people have been quick to point out that there is a clear double standard in the media and people s attitudes regarding the armed occupation of the malheur wildlife refuge headquarters in oregon  cnn law enforcement analyst art roderick gave a blatant example of this double standard when he appeared on a broadcast of cnn s  in this case  dubiously titled reliable sources  on sunday during the segment  roderick made the case that the militia members occupying the federal building are not  looting anything  which makes them way less of a threat to people s safety than say  black lives matters protestors  the last thing we need is some type of large confrontation because that s when stuff goes bad   roderick explained   and i think in this particular instance  if we just wait them out  see what they ve got to say  then eventually  they re all going to go home  cnn host brian stelter was quick to point out that some have said that if    black lives matter protesters  or if these were peaceful muslim americans  they would be treated very differently by law enforcement  this is a very rural area   roderick responds   it is out in the middle of nowhere  what are they actually doing  they re not destroying property  they re not looting anything  it s important to remember that in the united states   rural  means white  and  urban  means black  i mean  there s a whole separate situation going on as to exactly why they re there and that will be worked out through the legal process   he continued   but i think now that they ve taken over this location out at the fish and wildlife  this brings in the federal side  and i know the federal government has learned over the years how to deal with these types of incidences  let s face it  we all know if a black lives matter group of protesters  or any group that isn t legitimized by the white supremacist narrative of the right wing  was to do the same thing as these wannabe revolutionary cowboys are doing  they would have been demonized in the press and probably killed outright by federal authorities  no one was calling for  calmer heads  when police beat the hell out of blm protesters you can watch the segment below featured image credit  screenshot via youtube
