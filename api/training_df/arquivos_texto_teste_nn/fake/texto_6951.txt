the republican war on poor people has been killing americans and now we have the proof  a study published this week in the journal of the american medical association shows clearly that poverty compounded by republican refusal to spend money on the poor is unnecessarily shortening the lives of millions of people  we know that it s unnecessary because in the parts of the country where the poor are not treated like animals  they live longer it s so bad that in some of the poorer parts of america  people have a life expectancy on par with developing african nations the poor in some cities   big ones like new york and los angeles  and also quite a few smaller ones like birmingham  ala    live nearly as long as their middle class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the  century  but in some other parts of the country  adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like rwanda  and their life spans are getting shorter meanwhile  the rich continue to live longer because in america  even longevity is for sale to the highest bidder  the gap in life spans between rich and poor widened from  to   the top  percent in income among american men live  years longer than the poorest  percent  for women  the gap is  years  these rich americans have gained three years of longevity just in this century  they live longer almost without regard to where they live here s the map put together by the new york times color coded for average lifespan  notice that most of the low end life expectancy is located squarely in republican controlled states this is a direct result of republicans refusing to lift a finger to help those most in need  between refusing to expand medicaid  savage cuts to food stamps and a general attitude of  die quickly   conservative politics are killing people with their greed and inhumanity but it s more than just a lack of access to doctors that is killing the poor  by denying them any kind of economic help  the poor are forced to eat junk food because that s all they can afford  by denying them a proper education and job opportunities  the poor are highly stressed  already bad for your health  and have been turning to drugs and alcohol to cope life expectancy for the poor is lowest in a large swath that cuts through the middle of the country  and it appears in pockets in the rest of the country  in places like nevada  david m  cutler  a harvard economist and an author of the paper  calls it the  drug overdose belt   because the area matches in part a map of where the nation s opioid epidemic is concentrated the good news bad news is that in the places where the poor are not treated like lepers  they love much longer and healthier lives  birmingham  alabama took numerous measures to improve the public s health and  shockingly  it helped in the area in and around birmingham  ala   the life span for adults in the bottom quarter of income rose   years for men and   years for women from  to  clearly  they must have used the big government to tell you what size soda to drink  right  well  not so much the county expanded availability of preventive health care like vaccinations and mammograms by opening clinics in poorer neighborhoods in the  and early   though recently it has closed some of the clinics   although a relatively high percentage of the population lacks health insurance  a portion of local taxes goes to hospital care for those who cannot pay  the county has been ahead of the rest of alabama in banning smoking in restaurants and workplaces  with a law enacted in   and philanthropic foundations backed by old industrial money have funded campaigns to make people healthier in the birmingham area if the republican controlled legislature of alabama had expanded medicaid instead of throwing a temper tantrum  these measures would be even more effective  still  birmingham proves that even with a state government dedicated to hurting the poor  local governments can  and do  still mitigate much of the damage the bottom line here is that while the rich reap the benefits of better doctors  less stress and access to healthy foods  the poor in large swathes of the country are denied the same  mostly by the rich and their puppets in the republican party  the net result is that millions of people are dying before their time so a small group of people can amass more wealth and power  sadly  this drive to succeed at the expense of others is the new american dream the only silver lining here is that many of those same poor people have finally  finally figured out that republicans are not going to help them  sure  they turned to donald trump for leadership but even after he s gone  they ll remember who s been stabbing them in the back for decades  they may never embrace the democrats but maybe  just maybe  they ll start demanding republicans stop catering to the rich while throwing the poor the crumbs we can only hope featured image via ny times
