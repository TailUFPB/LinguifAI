you know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government  but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check  this right wing patriot sure does among the thousands  upon thousands  of delusional anti government comments the bundy ranch facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right wing nut job  who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it you read that right  daniel brewer here can t spend the   he estimates he ll need to get to oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet  instead  he sends his  prayers  to the oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement first identified by blogger jim wright of stonekettle com  the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti government extremists manage to live in  it may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government  but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case  a literal check every month so you can get by this isn t the first time we ve seen right wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government  during the ugly healthcare debate  one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare   medicare  you may remember  is a government healthcare plan  president obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti government government users  he recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by fox news that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the aca  i got a letter the other day from a woman  she said   i don t want government run health care  i don t want socialized medicine  and don t touch my medicare   yikes our hapless anti government militia sympathizer is  unsurprisingly  a conspiracy enthusiast as well  scattered among pictures of his family  brewer s facebook page features dozens of right wing memes and articles suggesting muslims are imposing sharia law in america  they re not  and calls for obama to resign  he isn t  the conclusion we can draw from this is clear  many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it  they don t want to pay taxes  who does   and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want  but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them feature image via sbnation
