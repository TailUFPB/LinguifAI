on february   justin linden went out to caucus for bernie sanders in clark county  nevada as he was waiting to be counted   he says he saw a volunteer begin passing out ballots to hillary clinton supporters  who already had ballots in their hands  when he tried to ask why this was being done  linden says his questions were ignored that s when he took out his cell phone and started recording over the next  minutes  linden captured footage that shows how easily the caucus process can be manipulated at the time of the count  there were  caucus goers present to support bernie sanders  there were  present to support hillary clinton according to caucus rules  only people who are actually present are supposed to be included in the final tally yet after the official count was taken  linden was stunned to see officials adding ballots to the count  from people who were not there suddenly  to everyone s surprise  the count on hillary clinton s side began to rise another caucus goer  rhiannon frauenfeld  confirmed that this is exactly what happened frauenfeld told addicting info with the paper ballots of absentee people included  it was   bernie still leading  as she went to walk away after counting the hillary ballots she turns back around and pulls out ballots that were in her hands and counts several more  this is when we were all confused because we didn t know where these ballots came from  she had been holding everything so we didn t know if they were ballots she already counted or where she got them it gets worse from there as documented in linden s video  the tally on clinton s side continues to rise  although no one is sure where these extra ballots keep coming from linden provided us with a timeline from the video  noting that all of the volunteers mentioned were wearing hillary clinton shirts here s an overview of the major events  as linden describes them  minutes  volunteer claims hillary now has    ballots  is questioned where the extra ballots came from and does not reply   minutes  volunteer  claims there are even more ballots to add to the count   minutes  volunteer  claims there are even more ballots to add to the count   minutes  volunteer  comes back and says  with the extra added   both camps are tied    to     the delegate count is    to     she had not collected ballots from people present at this point  minutes  volunteer  collects the ballots of those  minutes  ballots are collected from bernie s camp  but handed back out to hillary camp  minutes  volunteer  hands ballots to hillary side  claiming they are filling out second alignment  bernie s side does not get this opportunity  minutes  volunteer  and volunteer  begin counting physical ballots   minutes  additional ballot handed to volunteer  from off camera and added to count  minutes  count of    for hillary  count for bernie       numerous ballets now missing   as the events were unfolding  frauenfeld placed a call to a legal observer  who confirmed to her that a person must be present in order for their vote to be counted during the caucus frauenfeld told addicting info while i m on the phone with him i hear the woman conducting the caucus say now the numbers are at  to   as i try to approach her and tell her that she can only count people who were there and we can demand a recount  she kept telling me to go away this encounter is also captured on linden s video you can watch the entire video  via justin linden on facebook  below          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt voter fraud  woman hands out completed ballets for people who are not there  and they get counted despite numerous  posted by justin linden on saturday  february    points out that there is no way to know if the extra ballots were filled out by actual voters  nor is there any way to know if people filled out multiple ballots in any case  according to the nevada democratic party s website  people who are not physically present cannot be counted during a caucus frauenfeld told us  while i can t say conclusively that i believe that the conduct was a deliberate attempt to cheat the count  it raised doubts about the legitimacy of the process  i feel there was an attempt to skew the results toward hillary  their favored candidate  linden told us he believes that the volunteers were aware that they were only supposed to count people who were present he told us  i find it strange that it was called as an even tie  before the volunteer actually collected the ballots  linden also said  i find it more strange that hillary s number kept going up with every count  and that was fine with them  but when a third of the bernie ballots disappeared  it wasn t an issue  image credit  video screen capture via justin linden on facebook
