add comedian louis c k  to the ever growing lost of people trying to stop republican front runner donald trump from getting any closer to the white house  in a scathing rant released on saturday morning  c k  skewered trump with a plea to voters in an email about his web series  horace and pete  c k  compared trump to adolf hitler  stating that the nazi leader was once thought to be just a harmless crazy nut   until it was too late to stop him  c k  s message  which appeared in full on variety  said  please stop it with voting for trump  it was funny for a little while  but the guy is hitler  and by that i mean that we are being germany in the    do you think they saw the s t coming  hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all  twitter he s not a monster  he s a sad man  but all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president  give him another tv show  let him pay to put his name on buildings  but please stop voting for him  c k  didn t mince his words as he continued  stating that voting for trump would be  national suicide  i get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists  the whole game feels rigged and it s not going anywhere but down anymore  i feel that way sometimes  and that voting for trump is a way of saying  f ck it  f ck them all   i really get it  it s a version of national suicide  or it s like a big hit off of a crack pipe  somehow we can t help it  or we know that if we vote for trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years  i mean i can t wait to read about trump every day  it s a rush  but you have to know this is not healthy  c k  noted that although he likes the democratic candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders  he would enjoy seeing the next president as a conservative  however  he s smart enough to recognize that trump is not the guy to face sanders or clinton  and certainly not presidential material  i m not advocating for hillary or bernie  i like them both but frankly i wish the next president was a conservative only because we had obama for eight years and we need balance  and not because i particularly enjoy the conservative agenda  i just think the government should reflect the people  and we are about  percent conservative and  percent liberal  when i was growing up and when i was a younger man  liberals and conservatives were friends with differences  they weren t enemies  and it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while  but it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate  a good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time  trump is not that  he s an insane bigot  he is dangerous  for all the conservatives that have pledged to vote for trump despite how awful they acknowledge him to be  c k  had some much needed advice  if you are a true conservative  don t vote for trump  he is not one of you  he is one of him  everything you have heard him say that you liked  if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite  he is playing you  trump is not your best  he s the worst of all of us  he s a symptom to a problem that is very real  but don t vote for your own cancer  you re better than that  c k  is just the latest comedian to blast trump  and his message follows an epic verbal lashing from john oliver on last week tonight  which aired a  minute takedown of trump  many other celebrities  including miley cyrus  george clooney  and stephen king  have also urged voters to wise up and forget about voting for the business mogul currently  the republican party is scrambling to figure out what to do with trump  he s currently dominating the gop polls  and even though several conservatives have pledged to stop him  many republicans feel helpless and are afraid no other candidate will be able to stop him from getting the nomination featured image via wikimedia commons and gage skidmore
