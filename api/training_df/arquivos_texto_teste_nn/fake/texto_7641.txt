if republicans thought a multibillion dollar  foot wall could keep latinos from becoming american citizens  they may have completely overplayed their hand  knowing the stakes are four years of an anti immigrant bigot in the white house has led to many latino immigrants who may have been putting off getting their citizenship to get it in a hurry  they want to ensure their voices are heard on election day it should be noted that those seeking citizenship are mostly legal immigrants who are living in the united states  but unlike republican voters  they understand that trump s anti immigrant message means bigotry towards all minorities  not just the undocumented  indeed  many of trump s supporters seem to have little clue that latinos can be legal citizens  so if it comes down to trump vs  the democratic candidate  the choice is clear  as as one latino resident told the new york times while filling out her citizenship application  i want to vote so donald trump won t win  he doesn t like us  that s an understatement you may remember that this is the exact opposite of what republicans were hoping to achieve in   following the disastrous  election which saw republicans getting hammered by nearly every demographic but old white men  the party had hoped to soften its stance towards the growing latino population  instead  the toxic underbelly of the party rejected the cries for tolerance and ran head first towards the candidate they felt was most in line with white supremacy  donald j  trump  a lot of people are opening their eyes because of all the negative stuff donald trump has brought   said ms  villegas s husband  miguel garf o    who was born and raised in colorado and came to the workshop here to help his wife and other family members become citizens this year  his parents came from mexico in the  and worked hard all their lives  he said  helping him create a construction company in denver that now employs  people  contrary to mr  trump s depiction  he said  none of his relatives have criminal records  and in a move that highlights how democrats are embracing immigrants where republicans are rejecting them  the obama administration is working closely with nonprofit groups around the country to help put immigrants on the path to citizenship  this would seem like a good thing  after all  republicans have repeatedly said they don t mind immigrants as long as they go through the proper channels  but that talking point seems to have gone up in flames  rather than celebrate the white house s efforts  it has outraged republicans  who have worked hard to prevent as many people   mostly among demographics that lean democratic   from voting as possible despite these signs that republicans are again on the path to an epic shellacking on election day thanks to their message of bigotry  trump has the delusional sense that latinos  love  him  he promised republicans that he would  do really well with hispanics   he s nothing if not painfully optimistic featured image via u s  citizenship
