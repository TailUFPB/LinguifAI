christopher o kroley was a co worker to caroline nosal  christopher wanted caroline as his girlfriend  but caroline said no  two days later  christopher murdered her in the parking lot where they used to work  saying it was  easy  to kill her because she ruined his life it wasn t just saying no one time  caroline had to deal with harassment from christopher over a period of time where he wouldn t take no for an answer  it got so bad that caroline had to report his behavior to management  which in turn got christopher suspended then eventually fired christopher admitted that he bought the gun right after he was fired  but waited a day before murdering caroline because he wanted to practice using the gun  he shot her three times in the parking lot of the grocery store where they used to work together  when he found out her work schedule from a co worker  after the murder  christopher texted a co worker   i killed caroline and i m about to kill myself  so don t be surprised when i don t respond anymore  madison police officer michele walker got onto the scene quickly though  and exchanged gunfire with the murderer  resulting in him being taken alive instead of letting him finish his plan this entire situation could have been prevented  if we only could take our gun laws seriously  a former girlfriend of christopher said that he had a history of severe mental health issues  and attempted suicide once before in   there is no excuse for a person with a history of severe mental illness and a suicide attempt being able to procure a firearm so easily  not only did he get one  but he got one as if he was buying a loaf of bread at the local mini mart  while it s true that a mandatory waiting period may not have stopped this  it certainly couldn t have hurt anything republicans keep squawking that we have to address the mental health issues in this country  but their  address it but cutting it  is yielding no results  if this gun was purchased with a background check  the mental health history was not flagged in the report  this is courtesy of the nra  they literally do everything they can to block the things for which they keep calling  perhaps the real spot we need to improve mental health is among republicans  and then it would trickle down from there featured image from huffington post
