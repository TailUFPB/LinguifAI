there s nobody your standard issue right wing nutjob loves more than chris kyle  his story is the stuff of ammosexual dreams  not only did he join the military to go fight terrorists  he scored more kills than anyone in iraq  he also told some blatantly fictitious stories about things he did here at home  but his military career  not even those darned lefties who think glorifying killing women and children for any reason is wrong could deny what s written in black and white  ultimately  it seems  it s those same records that will cheapen the legacy of chris kyle an investigation by the intercept  reveals that while kyle does have a remarkable military record  it wasn t enough for his ego  in his book  american sniper  kyle said  all told i would end my career as a seal with two silver stars and five bronze   all for valor  that s awfully impressive  unfortunately  it s a lie  according to internal navy documents  chris kyle received one silver star and three bronze stars  why anyone would need to embellish a career already that impressive is truly baffling  but kyle did  is it really that big of a deal  though  so the guy told a little fibsky what s the harm in that  apparently  when it comes to navy seals and valor  there is little that is worse  according to the intercept kyle was warned at least once before american sniper was published that its description of his medal count was wrong  according to one current navy officer  who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the case  as kyle s american sniper manuscript was distributed among seals  one of his former commanders  who was still on active duty  advised kyle that his claim of having two silver stars was false  and he should correct it before his book was published current and former navy seals interviewed for this article  who agreed to speak on background because they feared being shunned by their close knit community  did not dispute kyle s heroism in combat  but saw the inflation of his medal count as significant because they consider battlefield embellishments to be dishonorable not only did kyle lie  he was called on it  it may have been one thing if he could have claimed he thought he had medals or that   aw  gee there were so many i got mixed up   but that time came and went  not only do kyle s lies about shooting looters after katrina or killing carjackers with his  amendment now get the  pants on fire  rating   his military career is now in question as well  who is to say that he didn t embellish other things  the man was obviously constitutionally incapable of telling the truth maybe it s a good thing  maybe a few fewer women and children met their end with what kyle called   grains of justice  featured image by the fort worth star telegram getty images
