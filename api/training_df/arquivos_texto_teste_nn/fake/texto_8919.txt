the bundy brothers and their militia continue to play patriots at an oregon wildlife reserve  but the rest of the world hasn t joined in their revolution  in fact  people are getting really good at mocking them as the fbi announced that it would be cutting off power to the building and supplies have already begun to run low  who knew you needed more than a few boxes of ramen noodles to sustain you on an months long occupation of a federal building    things are looking pretty desperate for the anti government fanatics hold up within  it s an open question of how long they will stubbornly insist on staying out in the cold to prove how macho they are other than a few baffling interviews  and one hilarious blue tarp  the bundy s have been mostly quiet  the rest of the world is left to wonder what they are getting up to in there on these cold nights needless to say  twitter began speculating  and the right wing militia isn t going to like what they came up with under the hashtag  bundyeroticfanfic  people from around the country are describing   sometimes in lurid detail   the romantic encounters the bundy s and their companions may be having while trying to keep warm  the results are oftentimes laugh out loud funny he wanted snacks  but what he needed was for cletus  calloused hands to explore every inch of his body  bundyeroticfanfic        january    jason pressed jed against a rack of  birds of oregon  books  his breath was sweet with jerky  somewhere  an egret cried   bundyeroticfanfic  colin meloy   colinmeloy  january    bundyeroticfanfic the small improvised washtub was filled with two things  cletus  and cheetos   c mon  ammon   he purred   snack time    skip mendler   smendler  january    bundyeroticfanfic  ammon hesitated   isn t this against the laws of nature     laws   panted dwight   we make our own laws  ammon    remittance girl   remittancegirl  january    my personal favorite  colinmeloy zek had fired some big guns before  but this would be his first true magnum   bundyeroticfanfic  john wegner   rtheny  january    has been one of the most effective weapons against the bundy s pathetic attempt at revolution  in interview after interview  cliven bundy s son  ammon  spoke breathlessly about how noble and important the occupation of this wildlife refuge was for  freedom   the reality was anything but awe inspiring  ammon has made repeated calls for others to join him and bring supplies  but few have heeded his call  the relentless mocking paired with the group s own embarrassing moments in front of the camera have made even sympathetic right wing anti government nut jobs like sean hannity recoil when you ve lost hannity  you ve lost your right wing revolution ironically  it turns out that all the guns they brought along with them while they were dreaming of a showdown with the government didn t stand a chance against the relentless mockery they have received from the internet  their cause was doomed to fail  but it s hard to imagine they anticipated it failing because people couldn t stop laughing at them  that probably stings a lot worse than the cold wind feature image via youtube
