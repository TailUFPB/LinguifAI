fox news created a monster  and now he is eating them alive over the course of president obama s presidency  fox news gleefully welcomed donald trump to the studio  whether in person or via telephone to make crazy attacks against him  thus instantly making him a star among the network s conservative viewers and it seems like the honeymoon between fox and trump would never end as fox initially supported trump s presidential campaign but then trump totally turned against fox news  particularly host megyn kelly  and it s been downhill ever since as trump continues to lead in the republican primary polls by a large margin  he has been able to keep massive support from conservatives while repeatedly attacking fox news and the republican billionaire continued slamming fox news on wednesday morning at a rally in south carolina and on twitter  where he took aim at fox for being biased  fox news is so biased it is disgusting   trump wrote  accusing the network of of trying to kill his campaign via negative messaging   foxnews is so biased it is disgusting  they do not want trump to win  all negative   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    then expanded upon his attack during the rally  i get treated so badly  i was watching fox this morning  they treat me so badly  fox treats me  like  worse than anybody  but i get treated badly by the media  i don t even   i don t really understand why  they have pundits on that are just one after another negative  negative  negative  it started where actually nobody   they all thought i wasn t going to run and they said   he ll never run  he ll never run  and then they look bad and then they just don t stop  some of them have become much better but i think fox in particular treats me so badly  it s incredible  here s the video via youtube because of trump  it s very possible that fox s audience is now split on how to feel about the network  which affect ratings  and remember  fox news only has themselves to blame  featured image from wikimedia
