talk show legend montel williams is a conservative  one who has expressed very critical opinions of barack obama in the past  but williams says there s an area where he can t disagree with  the president   obama s plan to use his executive powers to help alleviate a problem most of his fellow conservatives won t touch on tuesday  the president broke into tears as he discussed the problem of gun violence in america today   specifically  the lives lost in the mass shooting at sandy hook elementary in   which obama calls the  worst day in  presidency   obama has pledged to close the  gun show loophole   which has traditionally allowed pretty damn near everyone to circumvent the background check procedure and get themselves a shootin  stick with minimal hassle  in addition  the president will be removing legal barriers preventing a doctor from reporting when someone is too crazy to have a gun  strengthening licensing requirements for sellers  and making dealers responsible for reporting guns that go missing while many conservatives  including the veritable brady bunch of ignorance that is the gop  presidential field  view these common sense steps as an attack on the freedom of every single man  woman  and child  williams applauds the president s approach to the problem of gun violence today   i proudly own  guns responsibly   williams wrote on facebook   naturally  i listened closely to what president obama said today on guns  and i ve read what was put out detailing his proposals  he explained that no truly responsible gun owner should oppose the president s plans to reform gun laws  nor should any of them develop the opinion that the president and his jack booted thugs will be going door to door taking people s firearms from them  i m a proud  responsible gun owner and we ought to be the loudest voices for universal background checks  for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill   he says   that is how to be a proud steward of the     right i and so many others hold dear  if i thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns  i d oppose it   williams added in a comment   i m a law abiding american   nothing to fear  i think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it easier and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns  in an op ed for huffpo  williams says that  as a proud  responsible  gun owner   he  can t not support  the president s proposal  i realize this may not make me popular with some gun owners  and i realize there is deep distrust of president obama and his use of executive action  simply put  i ve always believed in being a responsible ambassador for the second amendment  a right that i hold dear  and  thus  i believe responsible gun owners must be the loudest voices for universal background checks and addressing the mental health crisis we face in this country  which form the crux of the president s proposals  williams says that he has formed his views largely through his work with students  in the wake of school shootings over the years   williams challenges anyone who disagrees that it is important to enact common sense gun legislation to spend time with children who have survived school shootings  they all have the same  haunted look in their eyes  one that frequently keeps me up at night  i would challenge anyone to listen to their stories  experience their pain and then go back the next year and the next  and see how profoundly they are affected and then do it all over again for the next school   you ll feel the same way i do  universal background checks should be a no brainer  guns should not change hands without a background check   he says   i cannot give my car to my children without filing a form with the dmv  and no one complains about that burden  nor do they suggest it s a veiled attempt to de car america  unfortunately  the nra and its acolytes spread fear   obama wants your guns   to all who will listen  and unfortunately too many listen  the nra and its bought and paid for politicians fight progress with regard to gun legislation every step of the way   including  of course  background checks  giving up even that much  in their eyes  would be giving up their guns williams suggests that we dispense with the meaningless rhetoric  cross the aisle  and work together to solve the problem of gun violence in this country   the root of which  he  says  is that it s  dangerous allowing people to acquire guns without a background check  williams says that both liberals and conservatives need to skip the divisiveness that plagues our country and focus on the fact that our children s lives are at stake  he asks his fellow gun owners not to buy into the extreme right s propaganda that paints this as a gun grabbing measure  this is common sense  and  ultimately  the best way to advance and protect the second amendment right we hold dear  williams is right  no one is trying to take anyone s guns  in fact  president obama is attempting to ensure that everyone who should be able to get a gun can get one  in the end  this would even accomplish some conservative goals  people would feel safer around armed individuals if they all passed a comprehensive background check and were mentally competent to handle the weapon  for instance  in that sense  the president s plan is a godsend for pro second amendment people of all stripes  if conservatives want to end the stigma associated with gun ownership  the absolute best way is to support this opportunity to protect the integrity of the second amendment featured image via facebook screengrab
