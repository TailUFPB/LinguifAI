if you listen to republicans  the affordable care act is the worst thing since caillou first aired on television   or  something to that effect  while ted cruz may claim that  millions of americans are hurting  because of the jobs that have been  destroyed  since the passage of obamacare  marco rubio says that we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people   and carly fiorina ignorantly asserts that   obamacare is crushing small businesses   none of that seems to be happening not only do we enjoy the lowest uninsured rate in history  but    the first full year of implementation of the affordable care act   treated us to a  year high in job growth   wasn t too shabby either  with the two full years in which obamacare has been up and running being the best back to back years since there were new episodes of full house as forbes dan diamond noted last week  since obamacare was signed into law in march   or  armageddon  as conservatives call it  the private sector hasn t lost any jobs  in fact  obama is the worst job killing president in recent history  if that is actually his goal msnbc took diamond s graph and made some alterations showing job  growth  under george w  bush compared to under president obama  clearly  after inheriting the dismal economy left to us by the bush administration  the president and his evil socialist cohorts attempted to destroy america by putting people back to work  but whenever this or related topics come up  i hear from conservatives who insist that the data is deceptive because most of the new jobs are part time  not full time   maddow blog s steve benen notes   this pesky detail makes the seemingly good news appear far more discouraging   this would  of course  be heavily disconcerting  he notes   if it were true  vox s sarah kliff reported on monday that the  part time  theory is complete and utter bullsh t ew research in the journal health affairs suggests they weren t the norm  the data shows no national trend toward more part time employment under the affordable care act   even if you drill into the type of people you d expect to get hit hardest is obamacare hurting the economy or the job market  all signs point to no   but that won t stop republicans from trying to figure out a way  or  of course  they might just make some stuff up  they re good at that featured image via msnbc
