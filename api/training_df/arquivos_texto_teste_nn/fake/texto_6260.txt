donald trump gave a speech to the nra  who then endorsed him for president  that seems a little odd  given trump s past support for certain gun control measures that the nra wouldn t touch with a  foot pole  it s especially telling that  as recently as   trump supported president obama s attempts at reasonable gun legislation following sandy hook  now  though  they seem to have forgotten back then  president obama said  we can t tolerate this anymore  these tragedies must end  and to end them  we must change  we will be told that the causes of such violence are complex  and that is true  no single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world  or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society  but that can t be an excuse for inaction  surely  we can do better than this  trump s response to that back in   he also wrote in his book  the america we deserve  i generally oppose gun control  but i support the ban on assault weapons and i also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun  those are both things the nra can t stand  trump used to call out republicans for  walking the nra line   and  refuse even limited restrictions  on firearms too  which is really all democrats want  the nra  however  would have us believe that obama is coming for our guns any minute now  and  if not him  then the next democratic president will  somehow  some way  some democratic president will take everyone s guns we have to wonder when that s actually going to happen  since they keep saying it s just a matter of time so trump used to be pro gun legislation  and now he s anti gun legislation enough for an nra endorsement  the nra has a short memory  apparently  while people do evolve on their positions as they learn new facts  this is pandering  because the nra willfully ignores the facts trump  however  must enjoy pandering  because he does an awful lot of it he s also pandering to the extreme end of the pro gun crowd  even proudly accepting an endorsement from a sandy hook truther back in january  in march  pastor carl gallups gave a speech where he said that trump was the  pragmatic choice  for christians  however  gallups  website calls the sandy hook massacre a gun grab hoax  and allegedly has evidence proving that  he also said that there s no question that the victims  parents are all fakes the fact that it doesn t occur to the guns everywhere crowd that trump s support for the nra  the gun nuts  and everything they stand for  is an illusion in order to gain support he knows he needs boggles the mind  of course  it s hard to catch the liar of liars in a lie  because he s got excuses for everything and he s good at making his lies sound perfectly reasonable  he s very likely snowed the nra here featured image by scott olson getty images
