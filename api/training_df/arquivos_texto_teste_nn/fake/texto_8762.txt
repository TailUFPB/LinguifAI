today s lesson in the horrors of how easily a person can obtain and legally carry a firearm come from   big surprise   texas  for two weeks now the lone star state has been imposing its ammosexuality on not just the residents who feel the need to keep an arsenal at home but on the college campus communities as well that s right like it or not   and most colleges say  not    campus carry  has become a reality  now any student over  with a legal concealed carry permit can carry a loaded weapon onto any college campus across the state  texan lawmakers  proving they are dumb as stumps  have decided that would be the best way to curb the onslaught of campus shootings some people may say   well  at least they have to be properly trained  concealed carry permits come with a safety training course   while that may sound nice  it s true on paper   in reality it s far more frightening university of texas at austin student zachary stone  in preparation for a debate on the issue of  campus carry   decided to go out with zero experience  having never fired a gun before and see what it took to get the concealed carry permit necessary to carry at school  he chronicled his experience for the new york times and it is absolutely horrifying the class required is a  hour course where you learn such important rules as  you can only shoot in self defense   no vigilante justice  not to intervene in a crime  and certainly not to stop someone from running away   that would be murder   his instructor told him  stone says everything he needed to learn to pass the written part of the test  which was basically a list of where you can carry a concealed weapon  he learned in the last  minutes  he got a  on the written test when it came time for the live fire portion of the test  stone was a wreck  fire  i shot  the gun flew back  my neighbors each hit the center  but i missed a foot too high  fire  i didn t realize i d have to shoot again so soon  i hadn t taught myself how to aim yet  and i wanted a few seconds to learn from the first shot  i also hadn t learned how to deal with the recoil  anxiously  i pointed and shot   a few seconds after my neighbors  i still missed that s when the instructor yelled at me   you need to line up your sights   i had no idea what that meant  he explained that for me to aim properly the dot at the front of the gun needed to be inside the post at the back of the gun that was remarkably useful information  fire  my next shot hit the center  x  stone found himself being screamed at every step of the way  because he had no idea what he was doing  lining up his sights paled in comparison to the reloading process  which required him to eject the magazine   something he had no clue how to do i tugged on the magazine  it didn t move  so i pulled harder  i pulled as hard as i could  nervous to put so much force on a gun   empty or not i called out to the instructor   my magazine s stuck  show me  try to pull it out  that really shouldn t happen  i pulled on the magazine for the instructor   you need to push the release   he said  what s that   i asked  the button  i pushed something  no  the button   he said that did the trick keep in mind that this young man had already passed the written portion of the test and was now on his way to being a  responsible gun owner  legally licensed to carry a concealed weapon to school  after repeating the live shooting portion until  rounds had been fired each  it was time to tally the score and see if zachary had the marksmanship necessary to be considered safe enough for public places to pass  you need  out of  points  if you fail  you get two more chances  i did pretty well in the end   i got  points the targets are huge  the distances close  in     percent of those who applied were given licences to carry concealed in texas  as stone proved  it s nearly impossible to fail  after less than one day s time  with a rented gun and absolutely zero real training  zachary stone had a permit to bring a gun to class at his debate  after telling the story  he asked one question that the pro gun crowd would struggle with  given that the system allows me   lacking firearm experience   to get a license  would you be comfortable if we sat with each other in class  upon learning i m secretly carrying a gun  the system sucks featured image via wikipedia
