there s really no better person to roast sarah palin than bill maher  and he most definitely didn t disappoint on friday s edition of his hbo show  after the failed vice presidential candidate and half term governor of alaska endorsed republican presidential frontrunner donald trump this past week  it s been pretty much nonstop coverage of her idiocy  after all  the woman showed up  dressed in wind chimes  and was clearly either drunk or overly caffeinated  any way you put it  no one put it better than maher when he stated  trump and gump  fatman and little brain  it was really something  did you happen to see any of her speech  oh my god  it was like a crazy drunk bridesmaid grabbed the mic at a wedding reception  this woman has a thousand stupid clich s in her head  and when she opens her mouth  it s like they re all escaping a nightclub fire  he then showed a clip of all her craziness during the endorsement  and said  you cannot put into words how much she cannot put something into words  maher also brought up palin blaming her son s domestic violence on obama somehow not respecting the troops  saying   and that s what makes the republican party the party of personal responsibility  if obama would just secure the borders  maybe bristol would stop getting knocked up all the time  and that s really the truth of all of it  sarah palin wants to pretend that she s some high and mighty person  somehow morally superior to others  but the truth of the matter is  her son beats up women  and her daughter needs to learn where the condom aisle is  palin is a walking and talking joke  and the sooner she realizes this the better kudos to bill maher for utterly annihilating palin and her craziness  watch  billmaher react to sarah palin s incoherent endorsement of  realdonaldtrump in his  realtime monologue  https   t co kczjxvmgau  real time   realtimers  january    video featured image  twitter
