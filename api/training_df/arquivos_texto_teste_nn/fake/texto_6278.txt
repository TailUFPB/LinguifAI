trae crowder  known on youtube as  the liberal redneck   has returned again with yet another damned funny commentary on the recent creepy obsession that republicans have with what people do in public restrooms crowder started by taking aim specifically at the new wave of idiots that are invading target department stores  in order to loudly  protest  the fact they allow transgender people to use the restrooms in their department stores  one case in particular was one where a woman was walking up and down the aisles in target  towing along what appeared to be half of her  children she claimed to have sympathizing with the woman  in the comedic sense  he said he could understand how with  kids she was  crazier than michelle bachmann on bath salts   you gotta agree with his logic  with  kids  and having to manage them in a militant christian household that you know she runs  she s probably crazier than an outhouse rat crowder is sick of hearing about how republicans are going to  take their country back  as well  and suggested that they all move somewhere that religion and government are the same   like saudi arabia  crowder said i know what you re thinking    eww  they re brown  gross  but check it out  they love screaming  they hate books  they throw rocks at queers   you d fit right in   what a great point  right watch trae completely own every person who can t stop thinking about people peeing below considering how many republicans get caught doing bad hings in public rest rooms  you would think that they d be focusing more on their own party  instead of an entire segment of society that already lives in such fear of going to the bathroom they are in and out while drawing as little attention to themselves as possible featured image via video screen capture
