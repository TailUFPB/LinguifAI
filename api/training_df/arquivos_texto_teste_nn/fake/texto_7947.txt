in an obvious scheme to keep the supreme court slanted their way  a conservative lawyer in arizona claims that scalia can and should be allowed to vote from beyond the grave when justice antonin scalia died just over a week ago  he left behind some major cases that could have been ruled   in favor of conservatives  including an anti abortion case  an affordable healthcare act contraception case  a case involving public sector unions  a case on voting rights  and a case on affirmative action just to name a few conservatives were foaming at the mouth in anticipation of winning most  if not all  of these cases  so it s understandable that they were disappointed when scalia passed away before decisions could be made on these cases but one conservative attorney in arizona is throwing a desperation hail mary in an effort to make sure conservatives continue to control the supreme court   even though the composition of the high court is now   during a kpnx panel on the status of the court  kory langhofer claimed that justice scalia should be allowed to cast a vote even though he is dead  there s no ouija board required to figure out how justice scalia would vote on these things  he s already voted   langhofer claimed on sunday  he explained that all of the justices meet and discuss the case before one justice goes off to write the decision  and that is why langhofer thinks scalia can still vote on these cases   we re at the second to last step in how these cases unfold when justice scalia died   he said   we know exactly what he thought  and it s not unprincipled to say we should give affect to that  langhofer then used an example of a us senator dying after the senate sends a freshly passed bill to the president after the vice president casts the tie breaking vote the problem with comparing congress to the supreme court is that the senator had already cast their final vote on the bill  whereas justice scalia might have changed his mind anytime between discussion and writing an opinion  and that s how attorney thomas ryan explained it to langhofer  justices  after they do the conferences can also change their minds   he pointed out   the general rule is dead justices don t vote  i mean  that sounds cruel  but that s it  here s the video via youtube but langhofer continued to argue that justice scalia s conservative ideology should be used to decide cases with his opinion even after his death of course  if that s the case  why not continue to use long dead chief justice roger b  taney s notes to let him vote on cases today  i m sure the author of the dred scott decision in  would love to be able to cast votes in cases involving civil rights  after all  we know how he would vote on these things  or how about we let former justice harry blackmun  who died in   vote on any upcoming abortion cases  after all  we know how he would vote on these things considering he authored the roe v  wade decision  americans have sat on the court   of them still live  but only  are still active justices  so it would be a pain in the ass to access how each of the  dead justices would vote on a supreme court case in the present day  only a living justice can make a decision  and none of the cases scalia was discussing reached a final decision because no decision is final until it is announced  justices can and have changed their minds before at the last minute and there is no way of knowing what scalia would have done had he still been alive  even with notes kept by the chief justice  and that s why dead justices do not get a vote on the supreme court this is nothing more than a ploy that conservatives are toying with to keep scalia on the high court for the next year while republicans block president obama from nominating a living person to fill the empty seat  it s a dangerous slope that threatens our constitution  which  by the way  says nothing about letting a dead judge continue to issue rulings until a new judge replaces them the bottom line is that scalia is dead  and while that is tragic for his friends and family  the supreme court must move on and that means a new justice must takeover whether conservatives like it or not featured image  flickr
