we ll never forget karl rove s meltdown at fox news when president obama was re elected in november of   it was a moment when he simply couldn t wrap his head around fox declaring obama the victor and he was in complete denial  it was as though his schemes to prevent obama from winning didn t work  and now it seems as if his embarrassing moments didn t cease there now  in a new   and pretty damn embarrassing   video of him trying to say his clear establishment choice of marco rubio might still pull out a victory in virginia  he s proven wrong in literally less than five seconds when chris wallace asked rove what he thought about the race in virginia  rove replied  well  i think this race is going to continue to tighten however  it was then that rove was abruptly cut off with wallace saying  wait  wait  hold on just a second  apparently we ve got a call in virginia  so you can tell us after we get the call  and that  call   as we all know by now  was for donald trump being declared the winner  wallace then asks rove while laughing  karl  tell me  what does that mean for marco rubio and donald trump  what does it mean  it means rubio can t win is what it means  and the gop s only shot at an establishment candidate just went out the window  sure  rubio won minnesota  but that s the only state he s won so far in the republican primary battle  the chances of him securing the nomination are little to none rove  much like with what happened during his meltdown in   is likely in utter disbelief  his puppet strings to control republican elections are no longer working and he s probably in a deep panic  his party is disintegrating right before his very eyes into thousands of trump shaped pieces needless to say  this is pretty funny  check it out for yourselves    featured image via youtube
