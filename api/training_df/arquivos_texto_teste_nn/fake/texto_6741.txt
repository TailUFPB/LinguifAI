bill maher loves ripping donald trump apart  and friday night s real time was no exception  as the media has recently been fawning over the republican frontrunner s new politically correct persona and celebrating the fact that it has been a few days since trump has disrespected or offended anyone  maher took it upon himself to set the record straight during his show  maher was joined by his panelists  author charles cooke  leslie stahl of  minutes  and cnn s van jones  to talk about trump s new public image   a move that trump s newly hired senior aide  paul manafort  was behind  it seems that trump s campaign has finally caught on to the fact that the candidate s vulgar  brash personality is working against him as the general election approaches  and manafort has been trying to get the business mogul to tone it down  since trump has been playing nice lately  the conservative media hasn t stopped gushing over how  presidential  he is remarking on manafort s comments that trump has merely been  playing a part  this whole time  stahl wondered  they re trying to tell the  party that he s going to change  that they re gonna  fix  his personality  he can t do that  how s he gonna change his personality  maher was quick to jump in and made a hilarious connection between trump and dichotomous comedian andrew dice clay  who switches identities whenever he feels like it  imitating what trump might sound like  maher said  he doesn t have to  sometimes he goes  i m done being andrew  i m dice now   and then trump puts on the leather jacket   hey  hickory dickery dock   a mexican went up the fucking clock  you can watch maher s entire takedown below manafort s comments about trump s personality are reminiscent of something trump endorser and former candidate ben carson said about the donald when he was explaining why he was supporting him  completely leaving out the part where trump bribed him with a job  carson said  first of all  i ve come to know donald trump over the last few years  he s actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about america  there are two different donald trumps  there s the one you see on the stage and there s the one who s very cerebral  sits there and considers things very carefully  hardly believable  trump s team can try to repaint trump s personality all they want  but they ll never be able to hide his ignorance  intolerance and bigotry  featured image via vince bucci   getty images
