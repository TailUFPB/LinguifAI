it s one thing to go after donald trump and how bigoted he is  but it s another to look at why he s gotten to where he is in this election cycle   his voters  if he didn t have a large amount of folks who think he s absolutely ideal for the presidency  well  then he wouldn t be the presumptive republican presidential nominee on hbo s real time  guest neil degrasse tyson  an astrophysicist and one of the most brilliant people on the planet  told host bill maher why and how trump is so popular  and what we need to do to fix it he said  as an educator i care about the population and the electorate  and all this attention going to complain about donald trump  you re not really complaining about donald trump  there s a major portion of the electorate who likes him  and so they are your obvious object of your ire  then shouldn t you be looking at the educational system that somehow allows people to not think about data  to not think about what is or is not true in this world  basically calling trump supporters dumb  because they haven t been properly educated in facts and reality  thus  their support for a candidate who is pretty much only qualified to be the president of his own fan club  and not the president of the united states degrasse tyson added  you can knock trump out of the contest and the population that supports him will just wait for the next one to rise up and you have to beat the next one over the head  and he s absolutely correct  if we don t fix our educational system and start giving people the proper knowledge to discern who should and shouldn t be president  then if it s not trump  it s just going to be the next raging bigot with absolutely no policy experience watch here featured image via video screen capture
