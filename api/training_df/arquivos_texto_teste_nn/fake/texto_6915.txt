donald trump made a big stink a few weeks ago because it was pointed out that many of the products he has lent his name to have turned out to be complete and absolute  losers   quickly discontinued and removed from the market  those products include trump water  trump steaks  and trump magazine buzzfeed decided to get in on the action and spent   to buy a bottle of trump vodka  here s what happened when they got some people to actually taste it as pointed out in the video  the vodka from the man who has promised to  make america great again  in his campaign was actually a product of netherlands  this follows a pattern of several other trump products  like his discontinued neckties  being sourced and manufactured in other countries  the ties were from china   it shows that when it came to his own products that he stood to make a cut of the profits from  trump was more than willing to make a  deal  to produce them cheaply overseas  adding to his personal bottom line trump said he got into vodka because  a great friend of mine was a founder of grey goose and what we re going to do is to top it  i want to top them just because it s fun to top my friends   despite trump s grandiose predictions of success for the drink  it was not to be  sound familiar   the only trouble was  nobody bought it  by the end of  it barely registered among the top selling vodkas  badly trailing the likes of smirnoff and no threat whatsoever to grey goose  go figure that customers wouldn t line up for a product that existed for the sole purpose of one upping trump s friend by   trump vodka was gone the reviewers in the video were not optimistic  they told buzzfeed they thought the alcohol would taste like  self tanner  or  misogyny  while one drinker said it  burned like a uti   another said it tasted  surprisingly good   another woman said it tasted good   but not   good  featured image via youtube
