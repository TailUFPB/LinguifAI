saturday night s debate saw donald trump and ted cruz going at each other repeatedly  more specifically  it saw them calling one another liars  now  trump has gone on record saying that cruz is the biggest liar he s ever known  in fact  trump seems to believe that these alleged lies on the part of ted cruz is enough to bring a lawsuit against the texas senator  watch trump seem to lose his mind as he repeats the same line over and over like a crazy parrot  so we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn t straighten his act out  he s a lying guy  a really lying guy  some people misrepresent  this guy s just a plain out liar  in fact  i felt better because marco rubio called him a liar the other night on stage  i felt so much better  i said good  politician calls a politician  now i can actually call him a liar   well considering that donald trump has a pretty tenuous relationship with the truth himself  this isn t really saying a whole lot  that whole field of gop clowns lies through their teeth for sport  so it s really just hypocrisy at its finest  but hey  at least it s great for entertainment watch the video below  as posted to facebook by fox news         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt  we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn t straighten his act out  is a lying guy     donald j  trumpposted by fox news on monday  february    image from video screen capture
