if you listen to senator marco rubio  isis is outside your door and is about to attack your family  and the only way to defend against this threat is to buy a gun senator rubio needs the support of diehard conservatives if he is to make any headway in the iowa caucus or new hampshire primary  and they are almost as suspicious of his conservative bona fides as they are of figures like jeb bush so in order to get those voters on board  senator rubio has to do what he does so well   pander that s why when he appeared on cbs  face the nation on sunday morning  rubio went into detail about the latest revelation from the campaign trail   his christmas eve purchase of a gun rubio told host john dickerson that he bought a gun in order to defend his family from isis rubio explains why he purchased a fire arm recently  explains that it is the last defense between his family   isis https   t co   face the nation   facethenation  january    explained  i m a strong supporter of the second amendment  i have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us  in fact  if isis were to visit us or our communities at any moment  the last line of defense between isis and my family is the ability that i have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or from anyone else that seeks to do us harm  rarely does a politician so blatantly pander to a constituency group that he or she needs to be viable  but rubio has gone there his rhetoric echoes the fevered donation seeking fantasies of the nra  who has recently told their followers that they need to have a gun in the house to defend against an isis attack just outside their homes of course  the unfortunate reality is senator rubio and other gun owners are far more likely to hurt themselves or members of their family than to engage in a fantasy shoot out with an isis terrorist but keeping this level of fear up continues to benefit the right in many ways  telling people to go out and buy guns creates a false sense of security  and fills the coffers of the gun manufacturers who then donate to republicans and help to keep them in office  resulting in lax gun legislation or opposition to new laws  everybody benefits  except public safety and security marco s got a gun featured image via twitter
