sarah palin is back at it again  only this time  jake tapper was caught in her crosshairs  while discussing donald trump s flip flopping on the issue of abortion  palin somehow was inspired to bring justin bieber into the debate  let s just say cnn host jake tapper  wasn t exactly prepared for that  it took him completely off guard here was their exchange  in part tapper  donald trump is somebody who clearly has had different positions on issues than he has today  including an issue very near and dear to your heart  the issue of abortion and life palin  i am so glad trump has seen the light there are groups that are pro life  they are giving trump a hard time on his views of abortion while they re celebrating others like  umm  i was going through a list  like justin bieber  and umm  gosh tapper  justin bieber palin  yeah  yeah  pic via screen capture we can only imagine what was going through his head when she said that  the expression on his face  though  was utterly priceless  that much is for certain so  why then  was palin bringing up justin bieber  we were curious  we did some digging  and apparently the teen heartthrob made some past statements about  waiting until you re in love  before you do anything with a girl  and   i don t really believe in abortion  it s like killing a baby   he said that back in   why that s relevant  we still don t know we re also not sure what s going through donald trump s head by his continuing to let mrs  palin stump for him  why is she still doing interviews  personally  we love it  we hadn t laughed this much since  well  when trump began running  it s like every single interview is a skit straight out of saturday night live  laughter is the best medicine  they say featured image from screen capture
