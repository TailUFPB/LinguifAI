last year  a wisconsin man was busted for threats he made against president obama s life  this wasn t just an instance of someone who has been brainwashed spouting off about lynching   hanging for treason   the president  brian dennis dutcher actually intended to kill the president  even if he had to use a slingshot  during a july  visit to wisconsin  a threat lurked in the shadows  the usurper is here and if i get a chance i ll take him out and i ll take the shot   dutcher told a security guard at a la crosse library as he prepared his attack against the president   something conservative media had convinced dutcher was his constitutional duty  sure  he may have just been making small talk   nice weather today  i m going to kill the president    but dutcher s facebook posts leading up to the vocalization of his plot reveal that this is something he had been openly planning  i have been praying on going to d c  for  months and now the upsurper is coming here  saving me a  mile trip   wrote in a june  facebook post   doing what i do for my daughter  so she can live free  pray for me to succeed in my mission   dutcher explained to his friends and family that it is his  constitutional duty to take action  because  the gov has declaired war on us  another post  which dutcher had deleted explained his plan in more detail  that s it  thursday i will be in la crosse  hopefully i will get a clear shot at the pretend president  killing him is our constitutional duty  numerous other posts complained that secret service was stopping people like him from taking the shot  dutcher even told a detective in no uncertain terms that his threat was serious and   he would not have said what he said if he didn t intend to carry it out   in fact  he told secret service his intent was to  circumvent security and figure out how to shoot  obama  with a slingshot   dutcher  referencing the biblical story of david and goliath  told law enforcement that he could easily kill a human bart simpson style each of the many times he threatened the president could have landed him in prison for up to five years and cost him     despite the very real nature of his promise to murder president obama  the would be assassin was only sentenced to three years in prison and three years of supervised release this is exactly why conservatives feel it is acceptable to threaten the president  no matter how clear their intentions  no matter how many times they explain the ways they will  exucute   to use dutcher s word  barack obama  they receive the equivalent of a slap on the wrist dutcher will likely be seen as a martyr to the revolution by our frenemies on the right  but the truth is that he is a symptom of a cancer in society that we must cut out before it is too late featured image via addicting info archives
