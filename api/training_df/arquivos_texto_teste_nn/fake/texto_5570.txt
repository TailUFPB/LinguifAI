it is literally impossible for donald trump to let america forget about what an awful person he is for one day trump s campaign has been getting wrecked over the past week thanks to a blatantly anti semitic tweet he sent out a few days ago  the tweet was a meme with the star of david slapped over an anti hillary clinton graphic  a meme that was traced back to a website frequented by white supremacists and neo nazis  it doesn t seem possible  but trump has managed to make the situation even worse at a rally in ohio on wednesday night  trump went on an insane rant about how unfair it was that his offensive tweet had to be taken down and is getting so much negative attention  the donald repeatedly insisted that the star of david is actually just a regular star  or a sheriff s star  and that the  dishonest  media are actually the ones who are profiling   not him  trump went out of his way to go after cnn  or the  clinton news network   for rightfully calling him out on the anti semitic tweet  labeling the network and the rest of the media  sick  then  trump complained that he d had to alter the meme  by putting a circle over the star of david  and pull the original off of social media  he whined that his social media director  dan scavino   shouldn t have taken it down  twitteryou can watch trump throw a temper tantrum about not being able to show his true bigot colors freely below it s clear that trump doesn t give a sh t if his meme carried a super offensive or oppressive message  all that matters in trump s mind is that he s right  everyone else is wrong  and he can do whatever the hell he wants without being called out on his bigotry featured image via gage skidmore   flickr
