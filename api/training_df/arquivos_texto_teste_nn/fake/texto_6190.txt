if donald trump were a smart man  he d be doing everything he possibly could to woo new mexico governor susana martinez who has not yet thrown her support behind him  she is the perfect gop poster woman    tough  on crime  anti immigration  pro corporate tax cuts  opposes obamacare  and she is anti gay marriage  however  instead of doing what a typical candidate would do and trying to win governor martinez over with his plans for the future  trump has chosen to attack and bully an endorsement out of her during a rally in albuquerque  new mexico on tuesday night  the presumptive republican nominee slammed the governor to his vapid supporters  we have got to get your governor to get going  she s got to do a better job  okay  your governor has got to do a better job  she s not doing the job  hey  maybe i ll run for governor of new mexico  i ll get this place going  she s not doing the job  we ve got to get her moving  come on  let s go  governor  trump went on to say  syrian refugees are being relocated in large numbers to new mexico  if i was governor  that wouldn t be happening  lies first of all  governor martinez is one of those republicans who has no interest in helping syrian refugees  she believes that the government doesn t vet refugees  basically  she has no idea what she is talking about  because of her lack of education on how resettlement works  her state is not very welcoming  in fact  the refugee processing center reports only ten syrian refugees have been settled in new mexico since   the year martinez assumed office ten  that s the  large number  of syrians trump is talking about so  the question of the day is  did trump s speech convince the governor to support him not even a little martinez spokesman mike lonergan issued a statement responding to trump s criticism  apparently  donald trump doesn t realize governor martinez wasn t elected in   that she has fought for welfare reform  and has strongly opposed the president s syrian refugee plan  but the pot shots weren t about policy  they were about politics  and the governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for new mexicans  governor martinez doesn t care about what donald trump says about her   she cares about what he says he will do to help new mexicans  she didn t hear anything about that today  good for her  i may disagree nearly all of governor martinez s policies but at least she isn t going to allow a misogynistic jackass bully her into submission featured image via mark lyons getty images
