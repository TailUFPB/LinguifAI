fox news  greg gutfeld isn t happy with our presidential candidates  he sees hillary clinton as a criminal  and donald trump as a liberal in conservatives  clothing  to him  if there was ever an election where the choice was between two true evils  this is it  he s got a solution to the problem though  elect a robot to be president this year no  really  he did say that  gutfeld would nominate ibm s watson supercomputer for president if he could  he said  the fact is  every single bad decision in life is an emotional one  in which feelings  insecurity and ego overcome our rational brain  so is every single good decision  that s the first spot where he shows off how little he understands this  another spot is where he talked about how robots won t engage in discrimination  another plus that eliminates the hazards of sex differences  no disputes over temperature  studies have shown that women prefer a room warmer than men   roughly  degrees to   the difference in preference may be due to the lower average skin temperature for women  so they start out already feeling chilly  by eliminating the male female conflict over the thermostat  we cut down on workplace animosity and  gender discriminating bias in thermal comfort predictions   what  just what  so people wouldn t work in the white house at all anymore  sure his whole line of thought is that  instead of electing a third party candidate  who would be just as shady as he sees our two main candidates  we should put a cold  emotionless  runs only on algorithms robot in the white house  and lead the free world  here are some of the other benefits gutfeld sees with having a robot in the white house a robot can work nonstop  without the need for a feeding break  and its mental capacities don t diminish at all from a lack of nutrients or sleep the second item   that there s no sexual harassment or sexism  which could also be parlayed into no more racism  ageism  etc    is a little more tricky because that algorithm would be programmed by man  therefore  it could still contain biases against certain demographics the third point   that robots stick to the algorithm  depends heavily on just how sophisticated as ai beings they are  if all they do is stick to their programming  they d fail miserably as leaders  leaders have to be able to think creatively  innovatively  and even with emotion and empathy  a robot that just sticks to its algorithms can t do that sure  it sounds interesting enough  but for this year  at least   that story should be marked as satire  or otherwise as a joke  because that s what this idea is right now  a joke  watson isn t sophisticated enough to actually lead the country  it s odd that gutfeld doesn t know that  either that or this story is a really stupid joke put forth by a really dense fox news contributor believe it or not  this idea has been floating around for some time as we work towards actually creating artificial intelligence  zoltan istvan  a near totally unknown presidential candidate from a near totally unknown party  believes that  as soon as   we could see artificially intelligent robots running for president  by   they ll be sophisticated enough to actually do the job istvan says  the reality is that ai will likely make far less errors than humans in politics  an ai president would be designed to fully represent the greater good for the people and the country as a whole  whose influence would be heaviest  though  republican or democrat  conservative or liberal  istvan believes that we could solve some of the limits of programing  like faulty human bias and the threat of turning the world into some mix of the terminator films and the matrix films  by creating empathy in these robots  empathy is needed when leading a nation  so a robot would have to have it however  istvan also says  there are large risks for letting ai take office  yes  there are  especially right now  because ai is still in a fetal stage of development gutfeld  though  doesn t see drawbacks to this at all  because he hates both our candidates equally and very likely doesn t understand what all is involved with putting a robot in a leadership position  he doesn t get that  while yes  watson is an amazing achievement  it s just not fit to be a leader in any capacity because it lacks the emotion and empathy needed to be a leader image by david r  tribble  licensed under cc by sa   via commons
