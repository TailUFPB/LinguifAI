ted cruz is creepy  really creepy  so creepy that his own daughter shies away from him when he tries to force a kiss on her  according to cruz s former college roommate  he would  leave a greasy film on everything  he touched   a substance dubbed  cruhz  by people who hated him  which is pretty much everyone who has ever met him  cruz  a man who used to hang out outside women s dorms in a paisley robe  is deeply disturbing in many ways  including his face  the unsettling nature of which has been the subject of study among neurologists   even his own wife has trouble faking a kiss for the cameras on thursday  gawker released a video compilation of the moments following applause breaks during cruz s super tuesday victory speech  though they note that  if you look back at pretty much any speech ted cruz has given during his presidential run  every last applause line is punctuated with this bizarre  stifled  lip biting smirk   this weird facial tick   almost as though he is attempting to smile  like the humans do   on grebulon   this would be interpreted as a challenge to a duel  so it does not come naturally to the texas senator   or keep something inside him from escaping cruz s mouth recently made headlines when something did escape during a recent debate   a throat booger that cruz eagerly slurped back into his mouth after it landed on his lip staring at ted cruz s face for more than a few seconds at a time is nearly impossible without sustaining severe damage to the eyes  brain  and liver  under normal circumstances  but after watching this video  even those few seconds can be a nauseating experience watch the video below featured image via screengrab
