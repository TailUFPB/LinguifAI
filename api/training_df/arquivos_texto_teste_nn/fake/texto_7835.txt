sue klebold  the mother of columbine high school shooter dylan klebold  has written an op ed column in the washington post discussing the issue of gun violence in america the april    shooting at columbine in colorado killed  and injured another   the shooters  dylan klebold and eric harris  committed suicide  at the time it was the deadliest school shooting in u s  history  but then the shooting at newtown happened in her moving piece  klebold discusses the role of mental health in mass shootings  and notes that over the years since the massacre  we as a society have learned to better see the signs of mental distress and to know better how to reach out to kids in crisis but she also notes that as important as that is  the issue of easy access to guns is still hanging over this issue having said that  i still cannot help but believe that dylan and eric would not have been able to take the lives of so many if they had not had such easy access to guns  as i later learned  dylan and eric   both of whom were minors   secretly attended a gun show where they bought the shotguns they would use in the massacre and met a young man who sold them a tec  semiautomatic pistol is our right to gun ownership under the second amendment so absolute that we cannot  at the very least  restrict access to certain kinds of weapons to protect the most vulnerable among us   especially teenagers  whose judgment at the best of times is compromised by hormones  impulsivity and immature decision making  is our right to bear arms so vital to what it means to be an american that there can be no limit on those rights whatsoever  whether raising the legal age at which one can purchase a gun  as we did with the drinking age or conducting more extensive background checks or restricting access to assault weapons designed for the battlefield her words strike right at the heart of the core beliefs of the nra  who insist nothing can ever actually be done to rein in guns in america  instead  the nra and the politicians it owns   democrats and republicans   mouth words about  mental health  and move on from one mass shooting to the next if the mother of one of the worst killers in american history can see this  why can t they  is the money really worth it featured image via youtube
