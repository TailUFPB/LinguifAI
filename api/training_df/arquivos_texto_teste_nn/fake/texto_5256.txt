how do you stop cyber attacks  well  if you re donald trump  the solution is very  very simple  it s so simple it s amazing nobody else has thought of it  trump must think he s the genius of the world for thinking of this  he believes that stopping cyber attacks is as simple as no longer using computers  let alone the internet no  really  he pretty much said that at a rally in colorado just yesterday  it s almost laughable if you can get through his word salad  i like the old days  especially for the military  on things like that  you wanna attack or you wanna do something  it s called courier  it s called  let s put it in a thing in an envelope and let s hand it to the general  let s not send it over the wires where everybody s probably reading it  right  and no matter how good  no matter how good they say it is  it s not  i mean  people can hack it i guess  it s terrible  i know and if you talk about military and you talk about secrets  you talk about politics   because that s totally realistic in this day and age of information technology  trump is remarkably regressive   he s also said he doesn t use email all that much because he s  just not a believer in it   as for his nonstop twitter use  the jury is out on whether he does that himself or not  he s told some outlets he does  and he s told others that he has staffers do it so who knows what he really does with twitter  his policy on cyber security  though  is absurd on its face  there is no getting rid of electronic communication  there is no getting rid of the internet in the name of security  there is no going back to outmoded means of communication in the name of security  it is just not happening but don t tell that to trump  because he probably won t hear it  this is the man who asked bill gates to close up the parts of the internet that the islamic state uses  as if bill gates runs the whole entirety of the web by himself  and  of course  trump thinks the internet is ours  so closing up parts of it to keep hostile powers from using it should be easy the man is clueless  his lack of even the most rudimentary understanding of how the internet works is astounding featured image by joe raedle getty images
