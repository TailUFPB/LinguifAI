donald trump s son  eric trump  wants to be just like daddy  and  truth be told  normally there would be nothing wrong with that  except for the fact that his dad is none other than donald trump  so   maybe it s not his fault per say for this latest slip up of his  it is  after all  engrained into him  but little trump ended up making quite the statement monday night when he appeared on fox s on the record  it s so ridiculous even that maybe he does have a political future ahead of him  just like daddy here was what little trump said when asked to explain what his dad meant by his  we ll do something worse than waterboarding  comments yesterday  you see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings  right  you see our cities getting shot up in california  you see paris getting shot up  and then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded  which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day  and  you know  the man would keep this country safe  there is no question about it  as he says  he  just wants to protect his father   but  that s quite a statement he made  we re still trying to process it  we might even let such a ridiculous statement slide if it wasn t such a serious issue  waterboarding is torture  end of discussion  we ve already dealt with george w  bush s presidency  we don t need another  but  this is the main difference between republicans and democrats it seems  trump isn t the only one who thinks waterboarding is okay  ted cruz has also come out on the record of saying it doesn t even fit the definition of torture  contrary to not only common sense but even the united nation s definition  here it is  torture  means any act by which severe pain or suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession  when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public office or other person acting in an official capacity time and time again  highly credible experts and well respected people have come forward on this issue  and all have said waterboarding is torture  this is a political issue of trying to look tough on terrorism  and it s also an election year  deep down these guys don t care if it s torture or not  they think they re making the country safe  and  they re wrong featured image from screen capture
