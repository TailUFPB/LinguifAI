the republican party is currently holding a joint conference with right wing religious zealots at a event called the faith and freedom summit  it s an insane mix of bible thumping and shameless religious pandering   ex  donald trump  no one s definition of a christian poster boy  gets to be a featured speaker   it also includes guys like sen  david perdue  r ga   who led a room full of christians in prayer   for president obama to die according to reporter betsy woodruff  perdue told the crowd that he had a specific prayer in mind for obama and one they should all help him with  psalm s    he quoted from the top with  let his days be few  and let another take his office   the rest of the verse s basic premise is for the subject to die quickly and for his family to live out their days in misery  it s not exactly the stuff jesus talked about let his days be few  and let another take his office let his children be fatherless  and his wife a widow let his children be continually vagabonds  and beg  let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places let the extortioner catch all that he hath  and let the strangers spoil his labour let there be none to extend mercy unto him  neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children let his posterity be cut off  and in the generation following let their name be blotted out let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord  and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out it s worth noting that perdue  a relative newcomer from georgia  is not considered a  fringe  right winger  he s often identified as a moderate  the fact that even the  level headed  members of the gop will stand up before a room full of people and pray for obama s death says a lot about just how far right the republican party has shifted  he may look  moderate  compared to donald trump  but that s a pretty low bar fortunately  we know that republicans have been beseeching god to assassinate obama since the day he took office and it doesn t look like those prayers are going to be answered  however  many of perdue s fans might get it in their head that the will of god flows through them  and that makes this kind of violent rhetoric extremely dangerous  perdue may think he s delivering a harmless prayer meant to pander to his base  but he should probably account for the fact that many of his supporters are crazy enough to believe it   even if he doesn t asking god to kill a man and leave his family destitute because you don t like his views on healthcare and taxes is truly craven  it s a stark reminder of just how warped the fox news crowd has become in their blind rage towards obama and democrats  it s not wonder president obama has basically given up on ever trying to compromise with them  when one side comes to the bargaining table with dust on his knees and callouses on their hands from praying too hard for the other side s death  there is only so far a deal can go the entire country needs to shame sen  david perdue  believe it or not  there is still a line and he crossed it featured image via jessica mcgowan getty images
