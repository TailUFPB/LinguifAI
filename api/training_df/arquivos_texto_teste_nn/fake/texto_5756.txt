the republican party s response to making america a safer place following the most devastating mass shooting in modern america has been truly despicable just a week after the tragic shooting at a nightclub in orlando  florida   an incident which left almost  dead and dozens injured   the gop decided to strike down an attempt to pass gun control legislation yesterday  as republicans went to lunch and then continued on with their lives without a care in the world  rep  john lewis  d ga  led democrats in staging a  hour sit in on the house of representatives floor in protest the gop s reaction to this powerful protest has been just as disappointing as its response to senseless gun violence  speaker of the house paul ryan commented on the sit in and called it a  publicity stunt and a cry for  attention   now  a radio host for the national rifle association has taken those comments a step further and compared the democrats fighting to protect americans from gun violence to  criminals and terrorists  on the nra s radio show cam   company  host cam edwards claimed that just like terrorists and criminals  the democrats participating in the sit in were not following rules  he said  so in order to push legislation that the sponsors say would not have prevented the attacks in orlando  florida  they re also going to flout the house rules  kind of like  you know  criminals and terrorists flout the rules that we have in place right now and will continue to do so  edwards also said that those democrats were  in violation of house rules on photography  because they continued to post the event after house republicans turned off c span cameras to make edwards  comments even more infuriating  he actually tried to educate rep  lewis  who is a civil rights legend  on civil rights movements  edwards whitesplained the democrats  sit in  i don t know what to call it  a sit in  again  generally speaking we saw the sit ins in the civil rights movement that were advocating for individuals being able to enjoy the same rights that other americans enjoyed  right  that s what the protests were  that s what   we re sitting at this lunch counter and we re not leaving until we get served  not we re sitting at this lunch counter and we re not leaving until you remove this item from the menu we re going to sit right here and we re not leaving until you recognize us as human beings  as americans who have the same rights that that guy has over there and that she has over there  that s what the sit ins were about in the civil rights movement  this  on the other hand  this isn t congress demanding more rights for americans  this isn t congress demanding rights for themselves  this is congress demanding power  these are house democrats demanding the authority and the power to ignore the fifth amendment when they see fit  to view the bill of rights as an impediment to lawmakers  to treat it as such and to try to degrade  kind of like what they say with isis right  blind white privilege is an ugly  terrifying thing  you can watch edwards  disgusting comments below no matter what the gop serves up  lewis and his fellow dems have vowed to keep the pressure on the republicans to change gun laws  lewis promised that the fight would continue immediately after the july  holiday  on july   we re going to continue to push  to pull  stand up and if necessary  to sit down  featured image via elizabeth warren twitter
