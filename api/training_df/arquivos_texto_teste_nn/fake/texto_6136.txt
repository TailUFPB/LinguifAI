a pre general election debate between bernie sanders and donald trump would have been a political event that would be talked about for years  however  such a debate will never happen because trump is a giant chicken  sanders blasted trump on real time with bill maher friday night after trump  jokingly  said that he would debate sanders ahead of the california primary  trump quickly backed out  sanders expressed his disappointment with the presumptive republican presidential nominee s decision  sanders put out a challenge to trump  saying  i would have loved   first  he said he would do it  then he said he wouldn t do it  then he said he would do it  then he said he wouldn t do it  so i would hope if he changed his mind four times in two days  change it a fifth time  trump claims to be a real tough guy  pushes people around  hey donald  come on up  let s have a debate about the future of america  that s when sanders unleashed a savage takedown of trump  this guy is a pathological liar  and i don t mean to be malicious  but that is just the damn truth  he would be not only an embarrassment  he would be a real danger to this entire world if he were to become president  maher and sanders discussed many things during the interview  sanders  as he usually does  talked about the tough issues that the american people are facing  including the disappearance of the middle class  the enormous amount of poverty there is in this country  and the need for issues based politics sanders also pointed out how trump s constant lying and flip flopping makes him hard to create an effective strategy against  how exactly does one challenge their opponent when said opponent s supporters don t hold that accountable to their stance on the issues or their character  while sanders himself may have seemed unsure  or at least wasn t willing to lay one out in the open during the interview   sanders has clobbered trump on the campaign trail while staying classy   love trumps hate   being a simple effective message that gets to the hearts of both sanders  and trump s campaigns sanders knows that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar  and he has an amazing platform that actually speaks to the needs of the average person   an agenda that will be championed by many long after this current race is over you can watch the interview in full  below featured image via video screenshot
