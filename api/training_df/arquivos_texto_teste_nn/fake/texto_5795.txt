when donald trump launched his presidential campaign he bragged that because was worth    billion  he would not have to concern himself with raising money and could self finance his campaign  thanks to his weak competition in the republican primary  trump did not have to spend much to get an advantage over rival campaigns and super pacs  but in the general election it is unlikely that trump can get by simply based on tweets and bombast as he did with bush  cruz  and rubio on monday night trump filed his finance report with the federal election commission  fec  and the failure of his campaign to bring in money is nothing less than amazing in may of   trump only raised    million from contributors and loaned his campaign an additional    million  at the end of the month the campaign only had a shocking    million dollars in cash on hand as journalists quickly pointed out  trump s fundraising more likely resembled a house member with  a semi competitive seat  or  a safe senate seat in a deep red state   the numbers are definitely not the sort of figures associated with a national presidential campaign the results look even worse compared to hillary clinton  at the end of may  her campaign had   million on hand  an amazing disparity of   million between the two campaigns and while donors have said they are still unable to determine which super pac to donate to in order to support trump  the super pac backing clinton  priorities usa  had its biggest month ever with   million in donations even compared to fellow republicans  trump s numbers are pathetic  in may of   mitt romney s presidential campaign and the republican party raised   million dollars  the current gop only raised   million this may defunct campaigns like ben carson s currently have    million on hand  more than trump s active campaign there are also some weird expenditures from the trump campaign found in the fec reports  he appears to be redirecting some money back towards himself his campaign paid    for the use of trump s own house the mar a lago mansion and club in florida even stranger  trump seems to be drawing a salary from his campaign  a very unusual arrangement especially for someone claiming to be a  billionaire   the filings find that trump is regularly being paid    as part of  payroll  for the campaign featured image via flickr
