on sunday  president barack obama gave an amazing speech at the rutgers university graduation ceremony speaking to well over   people  obama went on a subtle trump targeted rant to reject the presumptive republican nominee s divisive  offensive rhetoric  although obama never said trump s name  there was no mistaking who he was talking about as he spoke against  building a wall  obama said as his audience applauded  the world is more interconnected than ever before  building walls won t change that  obama continued his anti trump attack  criticizing some of the gop front runner s positions   such as trump s infamous proposal to ban all muslims from coming into the united states  he continued  isolating or disparaging muslims  suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country   that is not just a betrayal of our values   that s not just a betrayal of who we are  it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism   addressing the   graduates listening to his speech  obama urged them to rise above the  strain of anti intellectualism  that trump has encouraged in his race for the white house  in the process  obama couldn t help but laugh as he exposed trump for the idiot that he is  so  class of  let me be as clear as i can be  in politics and in life  ignorance is not a virtue  it s not cool to not know what you re talking about  it s not  keeping it real  or  telling it like it is   it s not challenging political correctness  that s just not knowing what you re talking about  you can watch obama deliver this powerful message below obama urged graduates to remain dedicated to learning the truth and keeping an open mind  warning them that only exposing themselves to information that confirms their own beliefs could result in ignorance  ironically the flood of information hasn t made us more discerning of the truth  it s just made us more confident of our ignorance  taking the republican party to task  obama added that when politicians are  not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up  while actual experts are dismissed as elitists  then we ve got a problem  soothing frustrations felt throughout the campaigns in this election  obama reiterated his previous comments on income inequality that he d given during a commencement address at howard university last week  obama reminded the graduates how important it was to vote and be involved in the political process  the reason some of these things have not happened even though the majority of people have approved  it s really simple  it s because a huge chunk of americans  especially young people do not vote  apathy has consequences  you can watch obama s full speech below   it serves as a reminder to america s youth that they are powerful  and that they should use that power to unify instead of divide our country featured image via eduardo munoz alvarez   getty images
