just when you thought kentucky county clerk kim davis would drift off into obscurity  as she should  she reemerges just as hate filled and full of drivel as ever during an interview with frank wright of d  james kennedy ministries  neither of these people understand how the constitution works as supreme law of the land davis still seems to believe that the laws of  the bible  reign supreme over her actions serving the public she said  i was obeying my law i had couples bring in the whole supreme court ruling and i said   you know  i really don t need to see this because that s not a law  that s a ruling    well  why won t you do this   and so then i go to the bible and i d tell them    don t be reading me the bible   well  you asked why i couldn t issue you a marriage license and i m explaining to you  i m showing you why i cannot  they didn t want to hear that though  they wanted to shove that paper down my throat and make me eat it for my dinner  actually  kim  the bible has nothing to do with your job and serving the public  if you re to serve the public as your job requires you to do  you are to abide by the law  including federal law  which in this case is the  amendment of the united states constitution offering equal protections to all citizens  not just the ones that fit your standard under your religion  if you don t want to do your job  might i suggest you resign  you are free to worship as you choose on your own time  but when it comes to restricting others equal protections  you are disobeying the constitution which was made clear by the supreme court  they re not writing new laws to tell you what to do  they are upholding the ones written upon our nation s founding  end of story watch part of her interview here via right wing watch featured image via video screen capture
