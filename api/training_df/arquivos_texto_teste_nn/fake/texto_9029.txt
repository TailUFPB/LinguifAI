it turns out that the individual who bought the anti trump sky ads at the rose bowl is a supporter of trump s rival for the republican nomination  that person happens to be luther stan pate iv  a real estate developer worth millions  who is a backer of marco rubio pate had already donated    to the rubio campaign in early   before rubio officially announced his candidacy for the republican nomination  fec filings show that pete is listed as the treasurer and custodian of records for a new group called the  wethepeople foundation   an anti trump pac set up on december  the banners read  anybody but trump    iowans dump trump   and  america is great trump is disgusting  in the sky at the rose bowl with a number of skywriting planes  the skywriting also directed individuals to the pac s new website where people can view even more attacks on the controversial billionaire candidate  the website  allows visitors to buy anti trump items  and to post anti trump videos and material so what is pate s motivation behind spending lots of time and money attacking trump  another republican candidate  apparently  pate is an establishment gop figure and trump has been smashing all of the establishment gop candidates   including bush  kasich  and christie  meanwhile  carson s campaign appears to be coming to a halt  with many in his campaign jumping ship  a republican strategist said  people are finally taking the threat that trump will destroy the republican party and lose the general election to hillary clinton seriously  establishment republicans believe that the controversial billionaire has alienated a large sector of the republican voting block  his sexist statements on women  his racist statements on mexicans  and his islamophobic rants have led many to believe that he wouldn t stand a chance against the democratic nominee  that apparently means that besides the creepy ted cruz  marco rubio is the only establishment backed republican who has any shot at beating trump and winning the nomination hopefully all the republican candidates and their supporters will continue to discredit each other  featured image via screen capture
