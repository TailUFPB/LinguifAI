unless you re an idiot  you know that while the terrorist attacks in benghazi were a tragedy  neither barack obama nor hillary clinton were at fault for the attacks  of course  republicans have never exactly been the sharpest knives in the kitchen  for years  the right has been waging a desperate war on clinton  obama  and sanity with their asinine benghazi investigations  all across conservative media  we hear that hillary clinton  barack obama  or both murdered four patriots with their bare hands while blaspheming god s name and murdering babies  or something  it s hard to understand what they are talking about at times  the republican benghazi  scandal  has been slowly going up in flames for quite some time now  but a letter from trey gowdy s former counsel has completely decimated any hope they have of getting anything useful out of the millions and millions of taxpayer dollars they wasted on this senseless exercise  nevertheless  republicans continue to claim that obama and clinton prevented the military from taking action that would have saved the lives of the americans who died in the attacks  this is the drumbeat to which republicans have goose stepped as they attempted to railroad the obama administration in court   but as much as they try to deny it  reality is a thing  even more unfortunately for republicans  their own former counsel in the matter was very clear that no one did anything wrong on may   rep  elijah cummings  the voice of reason in this mess  sent a letter to gowdy to remind him that his own attorney disputed many of the gop s claims unfortunately  your letter failed to include any statements from your own former republican chief counsel a retired three star general with more than  years of service in the united states army who repeatedly commended the military s actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with defense department officials for example  on january     the select committee conducted a transcribed interview with former secretary of defense leon panetta  during that interview  your former chief counsel stated i think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in benghazi or in tripoli or elsewhere in the region  and  sir  i don t disagree with the actions you took  the recommendations you made  and the decisions you directed gowdy s former counsel also acknowledged that it was impossible  given time and distances  for military forces to arrive fast enough to make a difference your former chief counsel acknowledged that it is clear from the time and distances involved that none of the military forces could have gotten to benghazi in time to save lives he stated and  again  sir  i don t mean to suggest that anything could have been done differently to affect the outcome in benghazi  and i think you would agree with that but most importantly  there was nothing that could be done at all in addition  on january     the select committee conducted a transcribed interview with the defense department s former chief of staff  jeremy bash  during that interview  your former republican chief counsel stated i would posit that from my perspective  having looked at all the materials over the last  months  we could not have affected the response to what occurred by    in the morning on the  of september if benghazi  libya  so let me start with that positing or that stipulation your former chief counsel also stated i don t see any way to influence what occurred there  but what i am worried about is we re caught by surprise on    we ve got nothing postured to respond in a timely manner and you can debate what s timely  what s untimely  but nothing could have affected what occurred in benghazi  the conclusions of your former republican chief counsel match almost exactly the findings from more than two years ago of the house committee on armed services  which conducted its own investigation into the attacks in benghazi   cummings wrote  noting that rep  buck mckeon  the republican chairman of the committee who led the investigation at the time  was satisfied that  given where the troops were  how quickly the thing all happened and how quickly it dissipated  we probably couldn t have done more than we did  there you have it  barack obama killed no one  hillary clinton killed no one  if anything  republicans are trying to distract from their own responsibility in the matter  thinkprogress reported in  that republicans had cut funding for embassy security because defending americans abroad was not a  priority  for fiscal   the gop controlled house proposed spending    billion for the state department s worldwide security protection program   well below the    billion requested by the obama administration  house republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by   million in fiscal  and   million in fiscal    secretary of state hillary clinton warned that republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to america s national security    a charge republicans rejected  ryan   issa and other house republicans voted for an amendment in  to cut    billion from state operations  including funds for  more diplomatic security positions  under ryan s budget  non defense discretionary spending  which includes state department funding  would be slashed nearly  percent in   which would translate to more than   million in additional cuts to embassy security these cuts occurred  of course  not long before the deadly attacks the gop is so desperate to pin on their favorite enemies go figure featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla  getty images  eric thayer
