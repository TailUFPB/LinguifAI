while donald the trump is busy making the rounds decrying immigration  hillary clinton decided to make a surprise appearance in new york city for pride  she joined nyc mayor bill de blasio and governor andrew cuomo on the parade route near the stonewall inn   an especially fitting show of solidarity and support following the orlando massacre hillary has worked hard on reaching out to the lgbt community  and right now  they need it more than ever  the entire community was rocked to its core by the orlando massacre  and how they feel right now is evident in pride celebrations that are more subdued than usual some have avoided pride altogether out of fear  others have refused to engage anybody that might show the slightest hint that they re bigoted towards the lgbt community  make no mistake  orlando was a direct attack on their community and they have every reason to be terrified right now where are the republicans who decried orlando  oh  right  twiddling their thumbs  shaking their heads  and making empty gestures so they don t piss off their evangelical base  paul ryan said that authorities knew omar mateen had specifically targeted the lgbt community  then he gave the lgbt community a big  fuck you  when he introduced a rule that the house wouldn t vote on any measure giving workplace protections to lgbt employees of federal contractors marco rubio pretended to mourn the massacre while saying that it can make people think harder about where they can best serve their countries  it s not likely he s talking about military service  and that was a ridiculous way of saying he ll continue to work on behalf of the hate filled evangelicals from which the horror of orlando came and then there s good ol  ted cruz  he tried to use orlando to convince people that it s really the democrats who are responsible for the deaths of millions of lgbt people all over the world  so why isn t he marching in pride parades  then  he should if he really wants to make the point that it s not his side of things that caused this trump himself once thanked the lgbt community and claimed nobody would be better for them than him  because he ll allegedly fight for their freedoms while hillary wants to take them away  however  he s also said he d never appoint justices to the supreme court who would support marriage equality  and wants people who would give serious thought to overturning obergefell v  hodge  since when is taking a right away from a specific group of people the same as fighting for their freedom hillary supports full equality and isn t afraid to say so  she s also unafraid to show up at a major pride event to show her support  she didn t let the organizers know about her plans because monkey wrenches of all sorts had already been thrown into the works for so many pride celebrations  thanks to orlando  so it wasn t totally a surprise  however  some of her campaign volunteers said that she had been planning this for weeks  she would have appeared to show support and solidarity even if orlando hadn t happened  the gop  we hear crickets from them  if not outright discriminatory statements featured image by drew angerer getty images
