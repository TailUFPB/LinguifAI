the indian point nuclear power plant in new york is under investigation  again  because of yet another leak of tritium  a dangerous waste byproduct the amount of radioactive tritium leaking from the indian point nuclear power plant is growing  officials said wednesday  prompting gov  cuomo to launch a multiagency probe into operations at the troubled plant new samples from groundwater monitoring wells show   higher concentrations of tritium compared with when the leak was first reported saturday cuomo had already ordered the state health and environmental conservation commissioners to investigate the incident  but on wednesday  he ordered a more sweeping investigation that also includes the department of public service the private company that runs the plant  unsurprisingly  said that there s no threat to the public but that s what nuclear power plant operators always say even after rates of cancer and birth deformities go up in nearby towns entergy spokesman jerry nappi said the contaminated water was not going into the nearby hudson river or sources of drinking water  some organizations who are longtime opponents of nuclear power will take opportunities to try and frighten the public   said nappi   the fact is this issue did not and cannot impact human health or any aquatic life in the river  frighten the public indeed  and i m not even going to bring up the ongoing disaster in fukushima advocates for nuclear power say that it is a safe technology and certainly not as dangerous as fossil fuels  but putting aside the massive problem of storing nuclear waste  a problem we have not even come remotely close to solving  by the way   the single greatest danger of nuclear power is what we are seeing at indian point  human error and corporate greed as the energy companies that run these power plants look to squeeze more money out of their facilities  they cut corners  those cut corners inevitably result in  accidents  that end up irradiating the surrounding environment  then the power companies throw up their hands and claim it couldn t have been avoided  spend millions to crush lawsuits and give their ceos giant bonuses for a job well done this is a similar pattern to what we ve seen at coal mines that suffer avoidable explosions and cave ins as well as at oil companies that continue to use  bomb trains with little to no regard for the towns they threaten to vaporize  the money lost to these  accidents  is less than the money made by cutting corners so there is every incentive to place the public s health at risk  it s not like the executives live or work near the areas impacted by their greed  after all  so who cares if a few hundred kids get thyroid cancer from a little extra something in their drinking water sure  nuclear power can be safe when done properly  but as long as  privatize the gains  socialize the risk  remains the status quo with no possibility of prison time for greedy executives  nuclear power will remain an existential threat to everyone living anywhere near  safe  power plants like indian point featured image via screen capture
