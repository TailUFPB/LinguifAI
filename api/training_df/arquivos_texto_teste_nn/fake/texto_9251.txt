thank goodness for rep  jim jordan s masterful grilling of fbi director chris wray today  see video of testimony below  regarding the trump investigation  the videos below reveal bombshell information that this is a set up by fbi agent strzok who took the fake dossier to the fisa court in the beginning this is a big deal jordan on lou dobbs after his questioning of wray  there are a couple of fundamental questions here  did the fbi pay christopher steele  i asked that of the attorney general two weeks ago he wouldn t answer the question  did they actually vet this dossier   because it s been disproven  a bunch of lies  a bunch of national enquirer garbage and fake news in this thing  did they actually check it out before they brought it to the fisa court which i m convinced they did  and all of this can be cleared up if they release the application that they took to the court  i think they won t give it to us because they did pay christopher steele  i think they did use the dossier as the basis for the warrants to spy on americans associated with president trump s campaign  strzok is the guy who took the dossier to the fisa court politically corrupt fbi    jimjordan  i believe the fbi paid christopher steele  and then used the discredited  fake news dossier to spy on  potus and his campaign   maga  trumptrain  dts  realdonaldtrump pic twitter com   lou dobbs   loudobbs  december    in the day  rep  jim jordan grilled chris wray about the dossier  let s remember a couple of things about the dossier   he said   the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign  which we now know were one and the same  paid the law firm who paid fusion gps who paid christopher steele who then paid russians to put together a report that we call a dossier full of all kinds of fake news  national enquirer garbage and it s been reported that this dossier was all dressed up by the fbi  taken to the fisa court and presented as a legitimate intelligence document   that it became the basis for a warrant to spy on americans  the easiest way to clear it up is tell us what s in that application and who took it there   jordan said jordan finished with this   here s what i think   i think peter strozk   mr  super agent at the fbi  i think he s the guy who took the application to the fisa court and if that happened  if this happened  if you have the fbi working with a campaign  the democrats  campaign  taking opposition research  dressing it all up and turning it into an intelligence document so they can take it to the fisa court so they can spy on the other campaign  if that happened  that is as wrong as it gets
