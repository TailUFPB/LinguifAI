while the trump campaign and its candidate celebrate the surrender of his final real competitor for the republican nomination  there will be no pleasure about this incredible situation from fox news charles krauthammer  a pulitzer prize winning conservative journalist  and long term trump critic appeared on the o reilly factor to pour a bucket of ice water over the celebration   telling o reilly that a man of trump s temperament has no place in the white house  or anywhere near the nuclear codes the interview began with o reilly asking krauthammer to give his view on how the gop establishment felt about trump becoming the presumptive republican nominee for president of the united states  his guest replied calmly  i have no idea what the so called establishment  if it exists  is thinking  i can tell you what i m thinking   and boy  he really did o reilly asks krauthammer if he would vote for trump  who responds that based on the campaign so far  i don t think i d be capable voting for donald trump  the fox host then attempts to sell krauthammer on trump  as if all the racist  sexist  frat bro behavior from the candidate so far will all fade away once the race for president moves into it s next phase  finally  after working up this fantasy version of trump  he asks his guest why he wouldn t vote for donald if he re positioned himself as a practical popular conservative  why couldn t you vote for him   o reilly asks  before krauthammer delivers a killer deadpan response with  populist conservative is a contradiction in terms  o reilly takes his guest to task on the issue  claiming that he  o reilly  is a traditional populist   to which krauthammer replies that he wouldn t vote for bill o reilly for president either  and there s a second issue   krauthammer continues   his fitness for office  it s matter of temperament and up until now he s not impressed me with his temperament  you have to ask yourself  do i want a person of that temperament  control of the nuclear codes  and as of now i have to say no  while o reilly continues to run defense for the trump campaign  his guest krauthammer bangs the final nail into the coffin  he wins it by floating conspiracy theories that you know and i know are in the twilight zone  in the same way that he led the birther movement  that wasn t ancient history  that was five years ago  playing with absurd and kooky conspiracy theories is way beyond being unconventional  it is disturbing  and that s when you gotta ask yourself  do you want someone who does that  in control of the nuclear codes  it looks like trump is going to be facing some blowback from conservatives who are sick of their party being hijacked by the lunatic fringe  it s great news for the democrats and liberal america  as it means the  election may well see the gop tear itself apart   leaving the democratic nominee to a landslide here s the video featured image via screengrab
