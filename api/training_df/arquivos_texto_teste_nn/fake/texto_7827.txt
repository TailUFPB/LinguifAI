donald trump has this tough guy syndrome that makes it impossible for him to resist doing and saying incredibly stupid things  it has garnered him a lot of attention from the low hanging fruit he calls a base  who love his stance on discrimination and approval of brutish violence  watching trump rise is eerily similar to  germany in far too many ways included in the donald trump school of narcissism for the wealthy is a call to do whatever it takes to get rid of every terrorist on earth  not only should we remove every muslim from the country and deny re entry to anyone wanting to come back  just until we have things figured out   we should also engage in torture again and murder the families of known terrorists it all sounds like a cool scene out of a mobster movie for the common idiot who thinks beating each other up until someone says uncle is the way society should run  in the real world  it s a violation of every international law and treaty we belong to  which as former general and cia nsa director michael hayden explains to bill maher  is enough to cause the armed forces to refuse those orders  as they are required to do by law you see  donald  we can t have rich dudes playing reality tv with our lives  our country  our planet  or our future  it doesn t really suit anyone at any level  that s why our country has  along the way  put safeguards in place so megalomaniacs can t buy their way to power and just blow up the world because they can and they know they ll have a really cool bunker what is truly scary is that the republican party  in its desperation to stay relevent  decided to embrace the hate of the people who support trump  they have no choice anymore but to accept that what started out as a really bad joke could turn into a reality pretty quickly  opening the door for such qualified future gop candidates as james woods  chuck norris  clint eastwood and the late charlton heston  appearing through the magic of disney at least their insanity won t go far  watch the video below  courtesy of real time with bill maher featured image from screen capture
