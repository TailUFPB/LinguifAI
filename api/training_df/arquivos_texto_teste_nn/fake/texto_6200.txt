as donald trump looks like he s going to be leading the republican party in the general election  many conservatives are either jumping ship entirely  or at least voicing their disapproval in various ways  for katrina jorgenson  the communications chairwoman of the young republicans national federation  this meant resigning from her position and writing a lengthy facebook post about why she would never support the donald jorgenson posted the message on monday afternoon  stating that because  her principles would not allow  her to get behind trump s divisive  vulgar rhetoric  she was announcing her resignation  in the post  she shamed those who supported trump  and made it clear that this was a major step backwards for the future of the gop  she wrote  regretfully  i am resigning from my position as communications chair with the yrnf  with the practically fulfilled nomination of donald trump as our presidential candidate  i can no longer continue to carry out the duties of this position  my principles will not allow it  we have been told for years how we are the future of the party  this is our opportunity to seize that future  but if we have instead decided to uphold a man who does not represent us or our views  i cannot participate in that  jorgenson didn t hold back   she called the business mogul a  hateful fascist  and called him out on his forever growing list of controversies  jorgenson also expressed bitterness that trump s rise had forced republicans to compromise their beliefs and principles  in doing so  she criticized other conservatives for supporting a candidate that was going to destroy the entire republican party  and most likely the country if he gets into the white house  in denouncing the presumptive republican nominee  jorgenson stated that there was absolutely no way that she could continue her role in the young republicans national federation and still maintain her dignity  knowing full well that she was going against her values  many of you may choose to support trump in order to beat hillary clinton  that is your decision  for me  i cannot support a candidate who endorses bigotry and lawlessness  with a minimal understanding of the fiscal policies long associated with our party  even if he does have an  r  after his name  i could not later tell my children i did the right thing  instead i would have to live with allowing my politics to be corrupted  i cannot stand by and continue to write newsletters and posts that so strongly conflict with my personal values  i will not surrender my beliefs this is not the way forward  i will not quietly fall in line  i will not give up my principles  you can read her entire post here  which immediately received praise from like minded viewers  many other  nevertrumpers were more than happy to back jorgenson s decision up  telling her that she had done the right thing facebookfacebookfacebookfacebooktrump has divided the republican party in a major way  and it will likely never be the same again  and now that the gop has allowed such a divisive fear mongering idiot to lead their party  trump is threatening to divide and destroy america the same way featured image via katrina jorgensen facebook
