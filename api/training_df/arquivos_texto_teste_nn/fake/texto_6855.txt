according to the nra  we have nothing to fear from gun toting individuals who have completed a safety course  there is no way  if properly trained  that they can present a danger to themselves or others  unfortunately  one texas teenager s family learned the hard way that sending their child off to receive firearms training then giving him a gun probably isn t the best way to go about life weatherford high school senior brennan weikel dreamed of playing football in college  unfortunately  he will never be able to do that because his stepfather gave the inexperienced  year old a weapon and took him out in the middle of the night for what was supposed to be a fun spring break hog hunting trip  i know everybody says   oh  my kid s perfect   he really was  he was a good kid   said stepfather james chambers  chambers took weikel out hunting just five days after the teenager had completed a gun safety course   one that gives him the legal right to hunt under texas law  regardless of the amount of experience he has  chambers also left weikel by himself to hunt  according to the weatherford democrat  they were placed in individual ground blinds  the little wooden ones    said   his stepfather shot a hog and called the victim to ask him to help retrieve it  and the stepfather reported that immediately upon hanging up with the stepson  just seconds later  he heard a shot  it came from the blind where the young victim was  after getting no response to a text asking about the shot  the weikel s stepfather  who was approximately  yards away  went over to the stand and found the teen crumpled up in the corner  his feet tangled up in a chair  according to wise county sheriff lane akin  there may have been some hunter inexperience involved   nixon explained akin says that the teen leaned over the rifle  which had a round chambered and the safety off  when he stood up after receiving his stepfather s text  when he reached for the grip of the rifle  he accidentally squeezed the trigger and fired a single round into his head  it was instantly fatal   nixon said   it s a real tragedy  yes  it is a  real tragedy    but the nra and its acolytes will simply view this as an  accident  rather than a symptom of the problem that is  gun culture  in america  simply put  this would have never happened if the teen s family had made the responsible decision not to place a gun in his hands  this would have never happened if the nra and its republican allies did not present arming teenagers as normal  this would have never happened if we would take reasonable steps to place age restrictions on firearm use  if we required more than a minimal amount of training  or if weikel s stepfather had at least stayed by his side to make sure that he was using the gun properly contrary to the nra s rhetoric  guns do not  keep us safe   if they did  weikel would still be playing football watch a report on the shooting below featured image via screengrab
