four donald trump surrogates tried their best to lay out their case that there is a major bias against trump sunday morning during a broadcast of cnn s reliable sources   trump and his supporters have alleged that the media is out to get trump since the onset of the primary election  now that trump s polling numbers have been in a free fall since the general election began  they are more desperate than ever to prove that it is all because of the media s bias against their candidate scottie nell hughes  one of trump s most vocal surrogates  has previously spoken out against the press at large  claiming that the media is conspiring against trump  hughes reiterates newt gingrich s recent claim that roughly   of those in the media have a tendency to lean to the left politically  the figure that hughes is regurgitating appears to be erroneous  there was a study conducted in  that showed that news does favor more liberal positions  however  the reality of the situation is that most media outlets tend to either be biased towards one side of the political spectrum and cater to that audience much of the debate during the segment centered around trump s plummeting polling numbers  you know  polling can be skewed too   kremer  another trump surrogate mentioned  he made the claim that polling numbers are affected  by the way the questions are   the number democrats versus republicans that are polled  so  you can t say that there s not any bias in the polling because i believe there certainly is  well  of course  those factors do a play a part in public polling  as anyone who is going to go on a cable television show and talk about polling numbers should know  those biases are taken into account by pollsters  if they are not  they typically get disregarded the other claims that the surrogates make during the episode are just as easy to explain away  that does not stop the trump supporters from trying to explain how trump truly is just a victim of the media s liberal bias  it couldn t possibly have anything to do with his flagrant  hateful sentiments that he has made during his very short political career  nor the fact that his policy proposals change on a whim and to sound like they originated from a neo nazi s fever dream you can watch trump s surrogates try and rationalize their terrible candidate s failures below  in full featured image from video screenshot
