christians have long lobbied for the ability to peddle their religion in the public square  this includes public schools  despite the fact that this is patently illegal  per the constitution  however  all of that changed when  in   when they had the supreme court on their side  and were able to have good news clubs and the like open the door to proselytizing to impressionable school children well  that  victory  is coming to bite these idiots in the ass  because if they allow one religion access  they must allow all  now  the worst nightmare of right wing christians everywhere is coming true  those wonderful rabble rousers at the satanic temple are at it again  and this time they are offering  after school satan clubs  to elementary school children  and they might be in schools in some u s  states as early as the coming school year now  of course  the satanic temple members don t worship any devil  they don t even believe in any devil  that won t matter to right wing christians  though  they ll be screaming about the end times and railing against this as soon as their tiny little minds stop spinning  it is also important to note that this move is not  in any way  about pushing satanism or atheism or anything else  it s about reminding people that the law applies to everyone  if christians can peddle religion in schools  then so can satanists and everyone else  even mat staver of the infamously hateful liberty counsel  couldn t find any legal way to keep the satanists out  he said of the clubs  when asked  i would definitely oppose after  school satanic clubs  but they have a first amendment right to meet  i suspect  in this particular case  i can t imagine there s going to be a lot of students participating in this  it s probably dust they re kicking up and is likely to fade away in the near future for lack of interest  dust kicking or not  this is important  it s long overdue for other religious and non religious groups to be on equal social footing with christianity  the way to do that is to make some noise  tell the world  hey  we re here  not everyone believes like you  and we have right  too here is a video on the club what the satanic temple is doing is wonderful and necessary  and the kids will have fun  too  there will be art projects and science sessions and all sorts of educational things  however  they definitely need help to get the materials to pull this off  so  if you are so inclined and able  head here to donate featured image via josh reynolds for the washington post via getty images
