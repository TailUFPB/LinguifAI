it really is perfect and it s from a book that was published in  when joseph heller wrote catch  over  years ago  he had no idea that a particular passage in his classic novel would one day be the exact description of the republican party but twitter user maris kreizman certainly noticed the similarities  which is why she shared the discovery  only for it to then be shared worldwide by singing and acting icon bette midler in a post last month that seems to have gone largely unnoticed for some reason  midler posted the passage  aiming particularly at donald trump  however  the paragraph really can be be applied to the gop in general  it was miraculous  it was almost no trick at all  he saw  to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth  impotence into abstinence  arrogance into humility  plunder into philanthropy  thievery into honor  blasphemy into wisdom  brutality into patriotism  and sadism into justice  anybody could do it  it required no brains at all  it merely required no character    joseph heller  catch  s the tweet via twitter with credit  pic twitter com   bette midler   bettemidler  january    years  republicans have been hypocrites when it comes to lawbreaking  claiming that it s okay when white conservatives use their guns to seize federal property or use their bibles as an excuse to violate the rights of others  in other words  they want us all to think of these vices as virtues the  slander into truth  part is pretty easy since republicans have been lying about liberals and liberal policies throughout the last eight years while insisting that they are telling the truth republicans have also disguised arrogance as humility  although they really aren t hiding it anymore the way conservative donors like the koch brothers use pretended philanthropy to give themselves more power is one of the more disgusting aspects of republicans today  and it was perfectly described by heller republicans have also pretended for decades that stealing from the poor to give to the wealthy is honorable  but it s only caused great suffering among the american people as the middle class shrinks and families struggle to put food on the table donald trump and ted cruz have made it very clear during the gop primary that they intend to bring back torture  which they think is a patriotic and just way of fighting the war on terror  for years  republicans have displayed fake patriotism while at the same time sending our troops to their deaths in wars for profit and once our troops come home  they refuse to take care of them  this is evident in their blockage of bills that would aid veterans and first responders and finally  the conservative support of the death penalty and cops who kill unarmed black men are the ultimate examples of how republicans see sadism as justice make no mistake  this paragraph from joseph heller is downright prophetic  and bette midler did us all a favor by bringing it to our attention  featured image from twitter
