donald trump just got owned for comparing hillary clinton to german chancellor angela merkel in an effort to demonize her plan to let syrian refugees settle in this country during a rally on monday  the republican nominee told a crowd in ohio that crime rates are up in germany due to the influx of refugees from war torn parts of the middle east and declared that hillary clinton wants to be like merkel and make america just like germany  hillary clinton wants to be america s angela merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to germany and the people of germany   trump said   crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever  ever see  it is a catastrophe  trump s claims baffled germany s european affairs minister michael roth in particular because  as usual  trump is lying in an effort to scare americans into voting for him in remarks made to reuters  roth apologized for trump s made up claims and took on the task of cleaning up his mess by informing him of what is actually going on in germany  i m sorry that the republican presidential candidate trumpets out things like that without any factual basis   roth said   if he had studied the actual situation in germany  he would know that  while the many refugees who came to germany and europe pose a big challenge for us  and everything is still not completely resolved  they have not led to a massive increase in crime rates  indeed  statistics show that the number of crimes committed in germany are virtually unchanged from   which means crime rates are not increasing due to the increased number of immigrants according to reuters statistics compiled by the german interior ministry showed the number of crimes reported in    excluding visa violations and other immigration violations   remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at   million once again  trump embarrassed himself and america by spouting falsehoods about another nation  roth should not have to comment on bullshit like this but he is forced to do so because american conservatives hate facts and would rather lie to win elections in addition  comparing hillary to angela merkel is a high compliment since merkel is a powerful and successful female head of state who has turned germany into an economic powerhouse that is  years away from becoming  percent energy independent if hillary clinton is anything like merkel america can expect to achieve great heights in the years ahead featured image via jeff swensen getty images
