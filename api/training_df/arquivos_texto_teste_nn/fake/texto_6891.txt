donald trump is running a campaign that does nothing but tap into the hateful underbelly of american populism  however  this time  it seems the guy has gone to a new low  when nobody believed it possible  rachel maddow took trump to task for a disturbing campaign stop he made in suffolk county new york   which just happens to be where a latino immigrant was murdered in an anti immigrant hate crime  the crime happened in november   just as we were electing president barack obama for the first time maddow says of trump s decision to stop there  in presidential politicking  symbolism is a deliberate choice  and racial provocation is something with a deep and resonant history  it is one thing to do that as a small fry politician  it is another thing to do it as a front runner for a major party s presidential nomination  being a presidential front runner is a powerful thing  it can also be a dangerous thing if you want it to be  trump chose to stop in patchogue  new york  right near where  year old marcel lucero was murdered by a gang of racist teenagers  one of the teens  jeffrey conroy  is currently serving  years in prison for manslaughter  the prosecution also got him convicted of a hate crime  further  it was discovered  aftr lucero s death and the reasoning behind it came to light  that it was just the most brutal in a long line of attack on latino immigrants  maddow continued  patchogue s history of racist and fatal hate crimes against latino immigrants is not necessarily a nationally famous story  but it is a new york famous story  donald trump has not yet won the republican nomination   he s still trying to win the new york primary   but campaigning in patchogue today on the street where marcelo lucero was murdered  it means something specific in new york  now  considering what happened at that site and considering trump s heavy  divisive  and dangerous anti immigrant rhetoric  there can be no questions what kind of message the current gop frontrunner was trying to send with that particular campaign stop  and it is a dangerous one if even one immigrant winds up being attacked by a trump supporter after this  the donald himself needs to be held responsible watch the video below  courtesy of msnbc  the trump remarks start at   featured image via video screen capture
