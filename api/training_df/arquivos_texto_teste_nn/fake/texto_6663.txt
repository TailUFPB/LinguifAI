as you probably know by now  republican presidential candidate ted cruz reached deep into his bag of desperation when he decided to prematurely name carly fiorina as his potential vice presidential running mate  keep in mind  it is pretty much mathematically impossible for cruz to get the nomination through elected delegates  so his only hope is in donald trump not getting to the much desired   delegates needed to secure the republican nomination  then  cruz can go to the convention and try his best to figure out a way to get things to go in his favor  the thing is  trump still has the popular vote by a large margin  so the will of the people is clearly not with cruz anyway  back to fiorina as if ted cruz wasn t already horrible enough on his own  he decided to double down on people not liking him by adding a woman who is against a woman s right to choose  not only that  she lied about planned parenthood  was the ceo to a company that she promptly flushed down the toilet  including outsourcing jobs  and has absolutely no public policy experience whatsoever speaking of planned parenthood  some clever person just took the website  carlyfiorinaforvicepresident com  and pushed it to go directly to the planned parenthood action fund donation page carlyfiorinaforvicepresident comnot only quick thinking on the part of whoever put this together  but absolutely  breathtakingly brilliant just to remind you  carly fiorina loved to lie time after time about planned parenthood  and fed directly into the  baby body parts  myth that circulated unsubstantiated for several months the fact that now her new mythical potential to be vice president now leads people directly to donating for planned parenthood isn t only amazing retribution  but pure magic well done  internet  well done indeed  this is what some may call   karma featured photo by bob levey getty images
