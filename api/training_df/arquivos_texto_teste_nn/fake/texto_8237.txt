a brilliant moment where a high school student turned the tables and gave her white male teacher a much needed lesson on racism has been caught on camera and is currently going viral the video  which surfaced on the but that s none of my business facebook page  shows a young woman of color confronting her teacher during a presentation  for what appears to be his assertion that white people can also become victims of racism the female student calls him out on his misinformed position and explains to him that it is impossible for white people to experience racism  because white people have never once faced systemic oppression or been discriminated against or disenfranchised by institutions  she offered a heated explanation  racism is based on the systematic oppression of people  white people have never suffered that  yeah  you ve tried to say it s possible  yeah  in the future it s possible to like have some sort of systematic oppression of white people  but it s never happened  so you saying it s not going to be up for argument  it s kind of like you  as a white man  saying what is and what is not racist  and that s what s been happening throughout this century  many of her fellow students  most of which also appear to be people of color  begin applauding right before she adds  so for you to tell me that  it doesn t make me believe you  because that s what s been said to us for so long  you can watch her powerful lesson below without a doubt  the parents of this young girl deserve a hand for raising such a socially aware teenager who not only understands white privilege and systemic racism  but possesses enough courage to dispute and educate an adult in power when they are painfully wrong and ignorant it would have been amazing if the entire discussion had been caught on camera  but it s safe to say that this student is probably more capable of teaching a class on racism than her teacher featured image is a screenshot
