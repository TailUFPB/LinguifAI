a caucus formed by politico consisting of operatives and strategists in ten battleground states around the country responded overwhelmingly they predict neither donald trump nor ted cruz will win the republican presidential nomination on the first ballot of the republican national convention in cleveland this summer  nearly  percent of the insiders in the republican party made this prediction  which is the hope and aspiration of many republicans who are embarrassed both ted cruz and donald trump have garnered so much support from republican voters cruz and trump s insane rhetoric and policy proposals almost make ohio governor john kasich look like a democrat in comparison  as republicans cannot come to a consensus over a presidential nominee  the republican party will likely fall apart at the convention  if donald trump doesn t win the nomination after winning the most pledged delegates  he would likely make a third party run as his ego will not accept losing as an option  his supporters will likely engage in violent protesting as the patients take over the insane asylum  trump supporters have treated anyone who dares defy the donald at rallies with violence  there is no telling what they will do if the republican party doesn t hand over the keys to the presidential nomination  donald trump has one chance to win the nomination  and that is on the first ballot  right now  i put his chances at about  percent  and that will require him to get some number of delegates from the unpledged delegates in states like north dakota  colorado  pennsylvania  and a few territories   an iowa republican said in his response to the politico survey  which was conducted anonymously  even if donald trump does win the republican nomination at the convention  so many republicans despise him and his rise in the party  they would rather have a democrat in the white house than listen to donald trump steer the direction of the gop  which right now is going full speed off a cliff featured image courtesy of flickr
