ted cruz is having a rough week  and now he just received a failing grade from a history professor ever since supreme court justice antonin scalia passed away on saturday  cruz has peddled the same lie over and over that  it has been  years since a supreme court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year  there is a long tradition that you don t do this in an election year  it s an obvious attempt by cruz and republicans to keep president obama from nominating a qualified individual that senate republicans would have to consider in confirmation hearings as a former clerk for the supreme court  you would think that ted cruz would know the history of the high court  but he clearly doesn t make the grade and history professor mark byrnes at wofford college in spartanburg  south carolina agrees in an article written for history news network  byrnes mercilessly fact checked cruz  claim suggesting that it s an american tradition that the senate does not confirm judicial nominees during an election year since ted cruz is always singing the praises of the founding fathers  byrnes began by revealing that john adams and george washington both nominated supreme court justices during their final months in office according to byrnes in the final year of his presidency  george washington had two nominations to the supreme court approved by the senate  it was an election year and he was not running for reelection  it doesn t get more  original intent  than that adams  case is even more relevant because he nominated john marshall for chief justice in january  after being defeated in the  election by thomas jefferson mere months before leaving office  adams was a lame duck in the truest sense of the term he was serving out the remainder of his term after being repudiated by the voters  yet he did not hesitate to fill the vacancy in the supreme court  and marshall was confirmed by a lame duck senate   byrnes wrote adams could easily have left the supreme court vacancy for jefferson who had already been elected  after all  and would take office in a matter of weeks and didn t  that seems as clear as it could be  the founders saw no impediment to a president in the final year or even in the final weeks of the presidency successfully appointing new justices to the supreme court byrnes then tacked cruz s claim about the last  years  and of course  cruz fails history again as byrnes absolutely laid waste the alternative history in the texas senator s head the facts are pretty simple  in the last  years there has only been one instance in which a president was in a position to nominate a justice in an election year and did not have the nominee confirmed  in   lbj s nomination of abe fortas to be chief justice to succeed earl warren  and of homer thornberry to take the seat held by fortas  was blocked in the senate  but not because of some alleged  tradition   certainly there were senators who wanted the next president to name a new justice  but the opposition to fortas had everything to do with the specific nominee and specific objections to him  particularly charges of cronyism and inappropriate financial dealings   to the best of my knowledge  no one cited cruz s  tradition  to say it was not appropriate for johnson to nominate someone  or that it would have been inappropriate to confirm anyone a second instance took place  years earlier  in   fdr nominated frank murphy in january of that election year and he was confirmed that same month  there was no  tradition  blocking that election year appointment   this also shows that cruz got the math wrong this happened  years ago  not   so  there were two instances similar to the current situation in the last  years  in one case the nomination was rejected and in the other it wasn t  to ted cruz  this constitutes  a long tradition that you don t do this  in conclusion  byrnes blasted republicans for being cowards by hiding behind this  phony tradition   and rightfully so  president obama is still the commander in chief no matter how much republicans pretend that he isn t  and they have a constitutional duty to give any obama nominee an up or down vote  because anything less would betray everything the founding fathers stood for  featured image  flickr
