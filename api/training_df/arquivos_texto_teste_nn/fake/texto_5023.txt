just a few days after activist and filmmaker michael moore wrote an open letter to ivanka trump begging her to convince her father to end his presidential campaign because trump  is not well   moore has released another article explaining the insane downward spiral that trump s campaign has been going down according to moore s column on the alternet  trump is trying to lose this election on purpose   because he never wanted to be president of the united states in the first place  moore believes that the only reason trump was running was so that he could get a better deal on the next season of his reality tv show the apprentice  moore wrote that trump   never wanted to be president of the united states  i know this for a fact  i m not going to say how i know it  i m not saying that trump and i shared the same agent or lawyer or stylist or  if we did  that that would have anything to do with anything  and i m certainly not saying that i ever overheard anything at those agencies or in the hallways of nbc or anywhere else  but there are certain people reading this right now  they know who they are  and they know that every word in the following paragraphs actually happened  moore outlined that trump had actually been bitter about a deal involving his shows  and felt this was a way to get more money out of it  trump openly admitted that he was thinking about moving his shows to another network  and then launched a presidential campaign that was never meant to make it this far  so  on june  of last year  he rode down his golden escalator and opened his mouth  with no campaign staff  no  state campaign infrastructure   neither of which he needed because  remember  this wasn t going to be a real campaign   and with no prepared script  he went off the rails at his kick off press conference  calling mexicans  rapists  and  drug dealers  and pledging to build a wall to keep them all out  jaws in the room were agape  his comments were so offensive  nbc  far from offering him a bigger paycheck  immediately fired him with this terse statement   due to the recent derogatory statements by donald trump regarding immigrants  nbcuniversal is ending its business relationship with mr  trump  of course  trump s plans backfired because he found himself fired by nbc  but another thing he didn t expect  was that he had struck a nerve in america s most racist and hateful population  moore said  and then something happened  and to be honest  if it happened to you  you might have reacted the same way  trump  to his own surprise  ignited the country  especially among people who were the opposite of billionaires  he went straight to   in the polls of republican voters  up to   boisterous supporters started showing up to his rallies  tv ate it up  he became addicted to the way people responded to him  so his presidential campaign only continued on  trump fell in love with himself all over again  and he soon forgot his mission to get a good deal for a tv show  trump never expected to become the leader of the gop  but after winning the new jersey primary  moore believes that trump s thoughts were something like   i m actually going to be the republican nominee   and my rich beautiful life is f   ing over   upon realizing that he wanted nothing to do with actually leading the country  trump has been on self destruction mode with controversy after controversy over the past few weeks  by this past weekend  the look on his face said it all    i hate this  i want my show back   but it was too late  he was damaged goods  his brand beyond repair  a worldwide laughing stock and worse  a soon to be loser  many now are sensing the end game here because they know trump seriously doesn t want to do the actual job   and  most importantly  he cannot and will not suffer through being officially and legally declared a loser   loser    on the night of november   the fact that trump has been self sabotaging is a theory that is being touted more and more now that trump s behavior becomes even more erratic  moore s insight definitely makes sense here  trump was a victim of his own ego   and how he  and the gop  are stuck with the consequences featured image is a screenshot
