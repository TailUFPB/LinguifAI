as many of us could have predicted would be the outcome  a  white lives matter  rally broke out in chaos and a brawl ensued the rally was held in south buffalo  new york on saturday afternoon  organized by the neo nazi national socialist movement  when the rally took place in cazenovia park  only one neo nazi official was among the other supporters  white supremacist karl hand  hand  who is also the chief of the racial nationalist party of america  revealed he d had little involvement in organizing the rally  i didn t organize it  i was just invited to speak  but that didn t stop him from p ssing people off and spewing his racist views  one video of the event even shows a woman scolding hand and telling him that nobody is going to take your sh t in this day and age  you are sick people  the rest of the united states is going to trample you out  in protest of the event  over  activists came out  which outnumbered the white lives matter supporters tremendously  the protesters held signs that said   not here    black lives matter  and   we promote unity in buffalo   bridget marren  one of the protesters in attendance and a south buffalo native  said  we live here  we don t want that hate spread here  but what the white lives matter rallygoers lacked in attendance numbers  they made up in offensiveness  the buffalo police had dozens of officers at the rally to help control the crowd  but they still couldn t stop another racist neo nazi wearing a green  white pride  t shirt from getting into a fight with counter protesters  the situation had eventually escalated so much that his shirt was ripped off when he got into a scuffle you can watch the rally devolve into chaos in the videos below but really  what else could we expect from a white lives matter rally featured image is a screenshot
