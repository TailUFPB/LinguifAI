a group of house republicans are so determined to make every issue a partisan battle to the death that they just spit on the grave of an african american hero to do it one of the least controversial jobs a legislator can do is sign off on the memorializing of public buildings  in this case  to designate a winston salem post office the  maya angelou memorial post office   but even this small act of recognition of an african american of enormous cultural contribution was a step too far for  republicans  as abc news reports republican reps  mo brooks of alabama  ken buck of colorado  jeff duncan of south carolina  glen grothman of wisconsin  andy harris of maryland  thomas massie of kentucky  michael burgess of texas  steven palazzo of mississippi and alex mooney of west virginia voted against the bill a spokesperson for rep  andy harris said the maryland republican voted against renaming the post office because angelou was a  communist sympathizer  his parents escaped communism and he feels that he cannot vote to name a post office in the united states in honor of someone who supported the communist castro revolution in cuba   the spokesperson said in a statement   who s next to get a post office  jane fonda  the gang of pro confederacy republicans apparently sought revenge with their votes  they argued an equivalent between fighting against angelou s post office  and opposition to memorializing public buildings in the name of confederacy figures what s sad about this  is that you really would have to be a bigot of the highest order to entertain the idea that maya angelou and the dixie plantation owner who would have kept her as livestock  stand as equals in our history angelou s credentials as an american of great talent  wisdom and cultural contribution are without question  she never killed anybody  she never enslaved anybody  her legacy was in words  those words are still moving people after her body left the earth  she was the kind of hero that the american story really needs as new york democrat steve israel put it in a written statement  naming post offices is one of the most benign and bipartisan duties we perform in the house of representatives  and there is rarely any opposition  that s why i was shocked today as nine republicans voted against naming a post office after maya angelou  indisputably one of our country s greatest poets  authors and civil rights activists  unfortunately for the republicans  the vote passed    plus one republican voting  present    so maya angelou will be honored  regardless of attempts to undermine the celebration of an american hero  simply because she happened to be african american  featured image via wikimedia commons wikimedia commons
