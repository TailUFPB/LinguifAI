republican presidential candidate and texas senator ted cruz believes with every ounce of his being that donald trump in the white house is a  grave mistake  but he confessed that he would endorse the disgraceful gop candidate anyway cruz revealed this on sunday during cnn s state of the union  host jack tapper asked cruz about the recent attacks against trump by other conservatives  especially presidential candidate marco rubio  r fl   not to be outdone  cruz also had some choice words for trump  blasting the front runner for standing behind planned parenthood  his plan to stay neutral between israel and the palestinians   and  longtime support of expanding obamacare into bernie sanders style socialized medicine  putting the government in charge of your health care  putting government bureaucrats into a position to ration your care  especially that of seniors  cruz  absolutely terrified of what president trump could mean for america  warned  if donald becomes president  who the heck knows what he would do  even donald doesn t know what he would do  i think the challenges facing the nation  they re too grave to roll the dice  cruz made it perfectly clear during this interview that he felt a trump presidency would be the worst case scenario for america  but tapper pressed him to see if he would still back his rival if trump took the nomination  cruz s answer is puzzling   after all the negative things he just said about trump  cruz still felt that  i will support the republican nominee  period  the end  this response by cruz is absolutely infuriating and goes beyond stupidity  cruz recognizes that trump is dishonest  terribly offensive  unqualified and without question the wrong person to lead the country and will still advocate for him just because he s a republican  cruz should be wise enough to know that even though he doesn t want a democrat president in the white house  america would be in far more capable hands and so much safer you can watch the interview below in another part of this interview  tapper also asked the same question of candidate john kasich  r oh   kasich echoed cruz s opinion and said  at the end of the day  i m going to support that person who came through the arena and became the nominee  as insane as these responses from cruz and kasich are  they re not entirely to blame   the republican national committee is basically forcing them to back trump if he wins the nomination  as every gop candidate took a solemn oath to support whichever candidate wins the republican party s nomination it s so unfortunate that the gop is so bitter about left leaning politics that they would rather support a candidate that is going to destroy america than explore alternative possibilities with a more capable democratic candidate  they cannot see far enough past their narrow minded views and hateful rhetoric to see that the future of america will be greatly jeopardized with trump  and they d rather watch it crash and burn than trust someone outside the gop  featured image via flickr
