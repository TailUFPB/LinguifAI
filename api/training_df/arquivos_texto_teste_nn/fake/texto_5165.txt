oh  donald trump  the pathological liar has struck again  although everyone should have seen this coming  at a rally in daytona beach  he made an absurd claim that he saw  top secret  footage of a u s  plane unloading   million in payment to iran the same day that four american detainees were released  of course  he later used twitter to try and backpedal  but all he really did was admit that he lied through his teeth the plane i saw on television was the hostage plane in geneva  switzerland  not the plane carrying   million in cash going to iran   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    tape that he saw allegedly came from iran  and he made it out to be some kind of taunt on their part  it was interesting because a tape was made  right  you saw that  with the airplane coming in   nice plane   and the airplane coming in  and the money coming off  i guess  right  that was given to us   has to be   by the iranians  and you know why the tape was given to us  because they want to embarrass our country  they want to embarrass our country  and they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who s incompetent  they want to embarrass our president i mean  who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape  it s only for one reason  and it s very  very sad  oddly enough for him  intelligence officials had zero idea what he was talking about  since no such video exists  there are two yuuuge problems with this and he has the nerve to call hillary  crooked hillary   in part because of the right wing narrative that she mishandled classified info  as president  he ll brag about every juicy thing he sees because it makes him feel important and superior to have access to info that others don t have  he can t wait to tell the world how much better he is than they are on wednesday  a spokesperson said that he d simply mistaken a grainy video of detainees being released  which played on fox news  for this  to secret  video  however  trump made this absurd claim again on thursday  in portland  maine  as if the video was part of the intelligence briefings he s getting as a presidential candidate those briefings have not yet begun as his story began developing holes  and then unraveling entirely  trump decided he had to scramble in order to avoid looking like the liar of liars caught in a lie  his tweet is meant to make it look like he d just made a mistake  it s in line with what his spokesperson said  but  again  the timeline is way off all he really did was say   i lied about this  but it doesn t matter  sorry not sorry  featured image by alex wong getty images
