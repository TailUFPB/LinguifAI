republicans in oklahoma just took their war on women and placed it on the doorsteps on doctors in the state late thursday evening  the house of representatives in the state  overwhelmingly approved a senate bill that could revoke the licenses of doctors if they perform an abortion  yahoo news reported in the republican dominated legislature  the state s house of representatives overwhelmingly approved a senate bill late on thursday  governor mary fallin  a republican  has not yet indicated whether she will sign it under the bill  doctors who perform abortions would risk losing their medical licenses  exemptions would be given for those who perform the procedure for reasons including protecting the mother or removing a miscarried fetus according to the author of the bill  senator nathan dahm  the bill was necessary because  this is our proper function  to protect life   republicans often say that they are protecting life when they interfere with a woman s right to choose  but the reality is that they are just pandering to the religious nuts in their voting base as i have said a million times before  if the gop was even a little bit  pro life  they would do absolutely everything they could to prevent unwanted pregnancies  this means they would make sure that children were given a comprehensive education about sex  they oppose that  republicans would also make sure that birth control  all forms  were easily available to women and men  they oppose that  if these imbeciles were pro life  they would want to make sure all children were fed  they oppose foodstamps  pro lifers would also make sure that kids had medical care  even if their parents can t afford to pay for it  they oppose medicaid expansion  finally  if the right were actually pro life  they would never send our kids off to die in their wars  bomb families in the middle east  and they certainly would not support the death penalty  and yet  they do all of those things this bill in oklahoma bans abortion  make no mistake about that  and it doesn t ban it because the right loves babies and respects human life  it bans abortion because the right hates women and they especially hate when women have sex  it bans abortion because the gop wants to punish  whores  who open their legs and it lets men off without any ramifications this is just another way for men to exert their power over women  fortunately  for the women in oklahoma  if the female governor of the state decides to side with the right wing jackasses in her party and sign the bill into law  it is completely unconstitutional and will never hold up in court featured image via justin sullivan getty images
