in   when we were still smarting from the disastrous citizens united decision  the billionaire koch brothers were busy using their money to fund seemingly everything the gop did  that included donating to the gop convention that year  what are they doing this year  holding out  they want no part of trump s coronation  so they won t donate to this year s convention at all the kochs are very influential donors  and they spent billions in  to try and defeat president obama  this year  they do plan on spending about   million on conservative causes  but as far as supporting anything trump does  they ve come to their senses enough to know that he s terrible for the country their specific problems don t just involve his policy positions  although it s hard to know just what policy positions trump has  since he says whatever he wants   and they re angry over his comments about judge curiel  who s presiding over the trump university case  trump believes that curiel  despite having been born in indiana and being an american citizen  is biased against him because of his border wall idea charles koch told usa today  it s either racist or it s stereotyping  it s unacceptable  and it s taking the country in the wrong direction  he can t say whether trump is fit to be president  but withholding the koch empire s mostly gop colored money from the convention seems to answer that question for us  koch said it would require a major shift in tone and policy for him to back trump  koch said he would need to be convinced that trump supported his top causes  in a way  wasn t just hype   ticking off as conditions  support for free trade   free speech  eliminating  corporate welfare  and  trying to find common ground with people   koch doesn t believe trump is capable of shifting on these things  though  he s probably right   trump will not let anybody tell him he s wrong on anything  because of that  david koch  who attended the  convention as a delegate and also contributed   million  isn t going at all this year for his part  trump is playing it off like he doesn t care  saying that he doesn t need their money  he claims he doesn t need any money at all  yet  he s got aides that are going to meet with the koch brothers soon  if it s not to court them as donors to help fill his rapidly emptying coffers  then what s the point while the convention will likely be able to go on as scheduled  that s a massive blow to the party and to  king trump   especially when put together with all the republicans who are  un endorsing  trump  these are people whose money heavily influences gop policy  to withhold it because they don t want to crown trump is very telling featured image by isaac brekken getty images
