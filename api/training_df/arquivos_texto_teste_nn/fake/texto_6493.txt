despite recent assertions from certain democratic presidential candidates  the dream of a single payer national healthcare system in the united states is alive and worth fighting for   even if it may not be implemented tomorrow  thousands of physicians have recently endorsed a proposal to make that dream a reality on thursday  the physicians for a national health program released their final proposal for creating a single payer or as it is commonly referred to a  medicare for all  national health care plan  the proposal was crafted by  top physicians and released in an editorial titled  moving forward from the affordable care act to a single payer system   which was published in the american journal of public health  the proposal also came with a political punch  at the time of the proposal s release   physicians and  medical students endorsed the plan  if you are a physician or work in the healthcare industry  you can endorse the proposal on pnhp s website  our nation is at a crossroads   said dr  adam gaffney  a boston based pulmonary disease and critical care specialist  lead author of the editorial and co chair of the working group that produced the proposal   despite the passage of the affordable care act six years ago   million americans remain uninsured  an even greater number are underinsured  financial barriers to care like co pays and deductibles are rising  bureaucracy is growing  provider networks are narrowing  and medical costs are continuing to climb  pnhp notes that their proposal would  save about   billion annually by eliminating the high overhead and profits of insurance firms  and the massive paperwork they inflict on hospitals and doctors   furthermore  since there is only one health insurance plan  there would be no bars in place from insurers that prevent individuals from seeing whichever doctor they choose  that has been a major talking point for conservatives over the past few years that would be immediately invalidated  going back to the cost savings benefits of the program  since there would only be one major healthcare provider  the cost of medications and other medical devices would almost instantly decline  due to strengthened negotiating power it almost understandable why some progressives might think that a serious push for a single payer healthcare system might be a waste of resources  and instead advocate for small reforms  however  i don t think that there has ever been a better time to go all in for a single payer healthcare system republicans have been fighting the affordable care act tooth and nail since its implementation  during this time  they have not been able to come out with any real alternative proposals or ways to improve the system  instead  right wing politicians and pundits have programmed their supporters to hate the aca  or obamacare  without question  despite having an outright hatred for the concept as a whole  conservatives actually tend to have fairly high favorable attitudes towards specific elements of the plan this gives progressives an incredible talking point to make   that they  too  want to end obamacare  that may sound like a heretical statement to make considering the all out rhetorical war that has raged over keeping the healthcare reforms in place for over half a decade  however  progressives shouldn t shy away from such a statement  the aca was meant to end one day  it was created with the intention of being a stepping stone towards a single payer system  that doesn t mean that the successful aspects of the law would need to be done away with if we switched to a single payer system  if anything  the last few years have taught us much about how such a system would need to work in order to be successful  featured image from photo by lefteris pitarakis   wpa pool getty images
