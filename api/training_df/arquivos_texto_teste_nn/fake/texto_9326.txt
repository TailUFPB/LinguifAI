according to wired   there are hackable security flaws in software  and then there are those that don t even require hacking at all just a knock on the door and asking to be let in  apple s macos high sierra has the second kind on tuesday  security researchers disclosed a bug that allows anyone a blindingly easy method of breaking that operating system s security protections  anyone who hits a prompt in high sierra asking for a username and password before logging into a machine with multiple users  they can simply type  root  as a username  leave the password field blank  click  unlock  twice  and immediately gain full access in other words  the bug allows any rogue user that gets the slightest foothold on a target computer to gain the deepest level of access to a computer  known as  root  privileges  malware designed to exploit the trick could also fully install itself deep within the computer  no password required  we always see malware trying to escalate privileges and get root access   says patrick wardle  a security researcher with synack   this is best  easiest way ever to get root  and apple has handed it to them on a silver platter  as word of the security vulnerability rippled across twitter and other social media  a few security researchers found they couldn t replicate the issue  but others captured and posted video demonstrations of the attack  like wardle s gif below  and another that shows security researcher amit serper logging into a logged out account  wired also independently confirmed the bug watch these two incredible videos posted to twitter letting apple know they have a  huge  security issue at macos high sierra   pic twitter com   patrick wardle   patrickwardle  november    tested the apple root login bug  you can log in as root even after the machi was rebooted pic twitter com   amit serper     november    fact that the attack could be used on a logged out account raises the possibility that someone with physical access could exploit it just as easily as malware  points out thomas reed  an apple focused security researcher with malwarebytes  they could  for instance  use the attack to gain root access to a logged out machine  set a root password  and then regain access to a machine at any time   oooh  boy  this is a doozy   says reed   so  if someone did this to a mac sitting on a desk in an office  they could come back later and do whatever they wanted  facebook user brian matiash tells mac users about how they protect their mac from being hacked  we cannot confirm or deny if his advice is legit  we are simply sharing it with you  matiash gives facebook users the following advice  wonders never cease  apple  how can such a painfully obvious bug like this make it by your qa teams  at least make the default root password be  password  or something  ffs  guys  get you damned act together  edit  it would be socially responsible of me to state that there is a fairly easy workaround  start by opening up terminal app and type the following command  sudo passwd  u root next  enter your primary user password  then  enter a new password for root and retype it to confirm  there  you re protected  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src    https   connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    wonders never cease  apple  how can such a painfully obvious bug like this make it by your qa teams  at least make the default root password be  password  or something  ffs  guys  get you damned act together edit  it would be socially responsible of me to state that there is a fairly easy workaround  start by opening up terminal app and type the following command sudo passwd  u rootnext  enter your primary user password  then  enter a new password for root and retype it to confirm  there  you re protected posted by brian matiash on tuesday  november    also notes  however and other researchers confirm that it s possible to block the attack by either setting a password for the root user or disabling root access altogether  if you ve installed high sierra and haven t set a root password or disabled root access  you should do it now in a statement  apple confirmed the problem  reiterated that short term fix  and promised a longer term software patch   we are working on a software update to address this issue   an apple spokesperson wrote
