on sunday  donald trump proved that he doesn t just endlessly complain about the affordable care act  he has ideas  big  beautiful ideas on how to better provide americans with health insurance in a manner that  trumps  obamacare  which has caused our nation to suffer    through having the lowest uninsured rate ever  despite the overwhelming success of the president s healthcare law  trump agrees with fellow  candidate ted cruz s nonsensical assertion that obamacare is destroying the country   though he takes exception to cruz s claim that the donald wants to replace it with single payer insurance  which trump supported wholeheartedly before becoming a republican overnight during a telephone interview with abc s this week  george stephanopoulos asked trump to respond to cruz s statement that he intends to replace obamacare with single payer insurance  of course  the donald responded in his usual manner  ted cruz is a total liar  i am so against obamacare  i ve been saying it for two years in my speeches  i m going to repeal and replace obamacare  i don t know even where he gets this  but he s a liar  yes  ted cruz is a liar  but so is every republican candidate for president  stephanopoulos reminded the billionaire that he is on record saying he wants everyone to have health insurance  but trump stood firm in his denial  that s true  i want people taken care of  i have a heart  if people have no money  we have to help people  but that doesn t mean single payer  it means we have to help people  how would you do it   the host asked the  hopeful  we re going to work with our hospitals  we re going to work with our doctors   trump replied   we ve got to do something  you can t have a small percentage of our economy   because they re down and out   have absolutely no protection so they end up dying  yes  there are people who need health care   even with the amazing progress made through the affordable care act   and  if we were to replace it  single payer would be the way to go   trump could have said   fine   we ll replace obamacare with single payer  and struck a huge win with many republicans and democrats alike  unfortunately  he just said he doesn t have any ideas watch the interview below featured image from screengrab
