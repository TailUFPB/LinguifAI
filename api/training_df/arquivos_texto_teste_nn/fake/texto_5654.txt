the very cornerstone of bernie sanders  campaign is income inequality  and there s a very good reason for that  the statistics are mind blowing  after all  those in the top one percent make  times those in the bottom  percent  yes  it s that bad  but for the first time in  years  the bottom  percent have seen some gains  unfortunately  the top  percent have seen more gains the top  percent income earners in the united states hit a new high last year  according to the latest data from the u s  internal revenue service  the bottom  percent of income earners registered the best real income growth  after factoring in inflation  in  years  but the top one percent did even better  the latest irs data show that incomes for the bottom  percent of families grew by   percent over  levels  the best annual growth rate since   but incomes for those families in the top  percent of earners grew even faster  by   percent  over the same period source  equitable growththat might sound like a mixed bag  and it certainly is  but it does mark the first time since the clinton administration where those who are struggling have seen real growth  since the beginning of the  recession  those below the top  percent have been seeing anemic   percent growth while this news is pretty good  it s not great  to this day  the non wealthy have only recovered  percent of lost wealth from the great recession  things have been much  much better for those at the top income inequality in the united states persists at extremely high levels  particularly at the very top of the income ladder  figure  shows that the incomes  adjusted for inflation  of the top  percent of families grew from    in  to     in   a growth of  percent  in contrast  the incomes of the bottom  percent of families grew only by   percent from    in  to    in   as a result  the top  percent of families captured  percent of total real income growth per family from  to  while the bottom  percent of families got only  percent of total real income growth  this uneven recovery is unfortunately on par with a long term widening of inequality since   when the top  percent of families began to capture a disproportionate share of economic growth with sanders all but out of the race  our attentions have to turn to what hillary clinton and donald trump might do to correct the problem trump plans very little  other than tax breaks for people making less than    a year  that does little to solve income inequality  but it could take enough money from the irs that republicans could claim that we  as taxpayers  can no longer afford food stamps or health care supplements clinton s plan is to raise the minimum wage to   an hour  middle class green job creation  small business incentives  college assistance and tax assistance of course  don t look for any real improvements in income inequality until the supreme court rules that corporations are no longer people  donald trump is not going to give us that supreme court  hillary clinton vows that she will featured image via alex wong at getty images
