when you re accused of being racist  as the trump campaign is  because they are  it s probably best to show some people of color modeling your campaign gear  however  when all you have is a stock photo of a white model to work with  there s apparently only one thing to do   photoshop on twitter  eric ming  digital director for donna edwards  pointed out that trump s campaign appeared to photoshop a model to be darker than she actually is so it appears donald trump s campaign photoshopped their model to be brown  pic twitter com   eric ming     march    looks as though since the trump campaign likely has a difficult time finding people of color to support the candidate  they ve resorted to literally making them up here s the original model generic gray shirt from jcgapparel comnow  here is that same model on trump s campaign website on august  of last year already appearing a bit darker via donaldjtrump comclearly not satisfied with making her only slightly darker  the trump campaign turned her into full trump orange as only they can  and needless to say  they didn t even do a very good job of it  here she is again on september  of last year donaldjtrump comthis is clearly the same model as can be seen by her collarbone  hair  etc this is just more evidence that the trump campaign is full of lies and deceit  it begs the question   why   why bother doing this  did they think no one would notice  did they just not care of course  many who support him will just say that this is clearly making a mountain out of mole hill and it s not a big deal  but it kind of is  trump s campaign is literally based on hearsay and optics  he wants people to believe in him without knowing what he s all about  and he s clearly done a great job of that  however  that s also what makes him remarkably dangerous featured image  jcgstore com flickr photoshop ht  fusion
