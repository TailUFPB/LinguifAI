comedian denis leary has donated a lot of his own time and money to helping the victims of the terrorist attacks on september    and the first responders who risked it all to come to their aid it s been nearly  years since the world trade center twin towers fell  and leary still attends memorials on the anniversary of the tragedy that killed nearly   people that day  and one person he has never seen at a memorial is donald trump  who has exploited   repeatedly for political gain throughout his bid to become the republican party nominee and his effort paid off because conservatives across the country bought the bullshit trump was selling them as the daily beast points out  trump s biggest claim about   is that  thousands  of american muslims were seen celebrating and cheering as the attacks unfolded  however  that claim has been thoroughly debunked  but trump s supporters don t care  and they still believe trump rather than acknowledge the actual facts trump has also claimed that he personally witnessed people jumping to their deaths from the towers even though he was four miles away at the time  trump did all this despite referring to the twin towers as  not great  buildings a week after    making zero donations to   charities as of   and visiting the   memorial for the very first time to curry favor on the eve of the new york presidential primary  four and a half years after it was erected   the daily beast reports trump has used fear and bigotry throughout his campaign to cast muslims as an evil group hell bent on destroying america and   is a central talking point in that effort  for the most part  trump has succeeded by appealing to the hate and racism of conservatives who have flocked to his campaign out of the belief that muslims are a threat to the united states and that only trump can prevent our destruction  and that makes denis leary sick  so he wasted no time in ripping trump to pieces during a recent interview  i think he ll basically do anything to get the spotlight   leary told the daily beast  trump will take advantage of whatever the situation  the cause  or the event might be  where was he before this  i ve been downtown forever and been to a lot of   memorial events the  anniversary  the  anniversary  others and i don t remember seeing donald trump there once  it s all built on fear  noise  bigotry  and finger pointing  the guy loves to tweet  but i look at all the candidates on both sides  and i m thinking   these are the people we have to choose from  what the fuck is going on  donald trump is the candidate in this presidential race who represents fear and hate  he also represents a right wing that ignores facts  trump doesn t care about anything that made this country great  he only cares about himself and power he can wield if he somehow becomes president in november  that cannot be allowed to happen  we cannot allow trump to use the deaths of   people to propel himself to the white house  it would be a disgrace to their memory and a signal of our own decline as a nation featured image  wikimedia
