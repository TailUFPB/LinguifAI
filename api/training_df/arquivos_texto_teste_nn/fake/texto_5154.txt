penn jillette doesn t want donald trump to run for president  and apparently  neither does bloomberg news  they asked penn to create a new card trick representing trump s campaign  and it apparently only took him a few seconds to do so  because that s how much of a disaster trump s campaign is he starts with a deck of cards and it seems like an ordinary   pick a card  stick it back in the deck and i ll find it  card trick  he then explains how all the shuffling cards while talking around is misdirection  and uses that as an analogy for many of trump s outlandish statements the video even shows trump making some of his idiotic statements and lies  like his repeated attacks on the khan family  his misogynistic  blood coming out of her wherever  slam of megyn kelly  and his claim that he wouldn t lose support even if he shot someone in the middle of  avenue but it s the trick itself  and the ending that are the real gems of the video  watch below trump s campaign isn t a train wreck waiting to happen  it s a flat out train wreck  especially given the week he s had  come november  his campaign will end the same way this card trick does featured image via screen capture from embedded video
