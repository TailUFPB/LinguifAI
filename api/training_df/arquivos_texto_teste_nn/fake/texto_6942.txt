on monday  what has unfortunately become a routinely occurrence at donald trump rallies has happened yet again  a black protester was violently attacked by one of the republican front runner s insane racist fans the incident happened at a rally in albany  ny and was posted to social media by the daily gazette s kate seckinger  in the short clip  a group of protesters were being confronted by several of trump s loyal fans when things suddenly got out of hand and took a turn for the worst  one of the men from the crowd lunged forward and grabbed one of the protesters  an african american male  in the face  other rallygoers tried to control the attack and pull the enraged trump fan off of the protester  but not before he struck the protester across the face again  you can watch the disturbing attack below fight breaks out at  realdonaldtrump rally at the  tucenter pic twitter com   kate seckinger   kateseckinger  april    attacker  who later identified himself as  mike   explains why he attacked the protester in the baffling clip below  courtesy of msnbc  basically  his justification for the violence was  i have my personal rights and my personal space  they re gonna start yelling about some bullsh t  i ll snatch your  ss up  that s all  mike claimed the supporter was  yelling in my face   but if you watched the clip of the attack  it s clear that the protester wasn t anywhere near mike s personal space   mike had to push through several people just to get close enough to attack the protester  it s also interesting that he would make a direct beeline for the only african american protester  but anyway  here s mike justifying his senseless act of violence and racism it s unclear if any charges will come of this attack  and according to police no arrests were made when msnbc s reporter asked mike if he was a trump supporter  his answer explained everything  mike said  hell yeah  he s no bullsh t  all balls  f ck you all balls  that s what i m about  these kind of attacks at trump s rallies are so unfortunately common  they are not only racially motivated and many times brought on by nothing at all  but they are encouraged by the disgraceful candidate himself  trump has continually denied that his rallies are peaceful and safe enough for children to attend  however there is more than enough evidence to prove otherwise  trump is running an irresponsible  anger fueled campaign  and his supporters are just as racist  irrational and dangerous as he is  people like trump and mike are a disgrace to not only america  but humanity itself featured image is a screenshot
