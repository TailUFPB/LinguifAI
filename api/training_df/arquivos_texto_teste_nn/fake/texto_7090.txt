the vacancy left by scalia and the inevitable   ties bound to happen have left the court no choice but to deliver sorry and crippling news to the american public  the court will hear but a fraction of the cases it normally would in a session  with a mere three cases scheduled since scalia died the supreme court of the united states is tasked under article  section  with the power to decide all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution  to interpret the laws of the nation and to be the final word in the legality of all of our treaties  the judicial branch of the government determines precedent often over cases the people and their elected representatives can t agree on by interpreting their letter and spirit as it applies to our society as well as the intentions of the founders that s quite a mouthful and a set of expectations that all too often fall by the wayside in favor of partisan politics  that s not to say that the court doesn t have its moments  centrist judges and even partisan players have often taken their robes and their positions as seriously as they should  such as with the recent decisions on obamacare subsidies and gay marriage  on the other hand  when you have to sit back and witness the destruction of the voters rights act  once again the issue of partisanship comes into play  partisan or not  the court is tasked with those decisions  and it has nine justices for a reason  ties at the highest court of the land don t work no matter how you view the court  its role in our government is imperative  the death of justice scalia and the obstructionist gop led senate hasn t just hampered the court s ability to function  it has rendered it nearly inoperable  between late february and early april  the court hears eight cases on average with a high of eleven in  the reason is simple  the court isn t interested in wasting time by hearing cases that will end in a deadlock  it s counter productive to maintaining the rule of law and a massive waste of time and resources  as a result  the court has heard cases with little consequence or controversy  the court has agreed to hear eight cases in total this term  which runs until january   five of which were scheduled while scalia was still alive  the court typically hears upwards of  cases in a term that means we can forget about integral decisions on archaic abortion laws  redistricting  campaign reform  and a plethora of other issues already ruled on by lower conservative judges until sometime in   or whenever the democrats regain the senate if clinton or sanders are elected this november  the republican party doesn t play fair  their tactics are bush league at best  by obstructing the executive branch and holding the judicial branch hostage  the gop has effectively destroyed the republic they claim to be saving featured image by win mcnamara  getty images
