donald trump is having a very difficult time finding a vice presidential running mate  and it s not hard to see why  after all  the guy is political poison for anyone who wants a post trump political career  two potential vp picks  senator joni ernst  r ia  and senator bob corker  r tn   have now withdrawn themselves from the short list of potential candidates for consideration for trump s running mate of course  in her remarks  ernst was in no way critical of trump  she s clearly one of those party before country types who won t say a bad word against the donald  but she also seems to want nothing to do with potentially being vice president under such a man  ernst said  i made that very clear to him that i m focused on iowa  i feel that i have a lot more to do in the united states senate  and iowa is where my heart is  i m just getting started here  i have a great partner with chuck grassley  we ve been able to accomplish a lot  and i think that president trump will need some great assistance in the united states senate and i can provide that  like all good republican toy soldiers lining up behind their bigoted standard bearer  ernst still wants there to be a president trump  and says she will do what she can to make that happen  she said of the baffling decision to make sure the orange one is elected  i will probably participate more as an advocate  i would love to assist him out on the trail  senator corker was much less enthusiastic when announced his own withdrawal  only saying  there are people far more suited for being a candidate for vice president and i think i m far more suited for other types of things  there were no laudatory words about trump  and nor was there any kind of promise to help trump get elected  in other words  this guy is not going to be associated with donald trump in any way  and who can blame him  trump s bigotry  praise of dictators  ignorance of the rule of law and any number of other repugnant things make him absolute political poison trump better stick to christie and gingrich  they re the only two who are dumb enough and or have little enough to lose to attach themselves to a potential trump administration featured image via marc piscotty getty images
