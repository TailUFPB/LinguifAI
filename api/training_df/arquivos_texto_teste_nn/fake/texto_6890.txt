florida continues to lead the nation in head shaking insanity after  year old luis angel dominguez  affectionately known to his neighbors as  papi   was deliberately run and killed over by a  year old after an argument as reported by the washington post according to broward county police  dominguez and a younger man got into an argument at everglades holiday park on wednesday night  the younger man  whom police have identified as  year old kyle christopher hannover  was at the park fishing when he allegedly started yelling racial slurs at dominguez and threw a rock at dominguez s car hannover then allegedly got into his ford ranger truck and drove directly toward dominguez  striking him  he was completely rolled over from the suspect s car and trailer   a witness told abc   when i called  it was   no ambulance   it was   get a trauma chopper out here as quickly as possible  unsurprisingly  hannover has a history of violence  in   he was arrested and for allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a shotgun  considering how disturbed he is  it s amazing that she survived long enough for him to be arrested  as a result of his threats  his guns were confiscated as part of his plea deal this past march  i can only assume that s why hannover didn t simply shoot dominguez instead of sadistically running him over the cause of the fight is unclear and  honestly  is irrelevant  there is literally no justification for a  year old to run over a senior citizen in a rage  the only upshot to this entire incident is that hannover will probably be about the same age when he gets out of prison his step granddaughter damaris riveron expressed her gratitude to the police  we re extremely happy there has been an arrest  thank you to the police department for all of their hard work and for everyone who contributed  domiguez is survived by his wife  his children and his grandchildren featured courtesy of vivian sanchez
