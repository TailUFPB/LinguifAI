far too many people don t understand the awesome simplicity of the republican war on women  they try to analyze the underlying causes  blame some on religion  some on chauvinism  overthinking is a strictly democratic problem  to the good ol  white boys club of the gop  women are just inferior creatures in need of nurturing  weak and restrained  helpless at best  yeah  sadly it really is just that simple to figure out why their war exists  they have no respect for their mothers  ouch   ok  that was harsh  republicans  in general  find women to be beneath them  republican women depend on their men because their fathers told them to  just like their mothers told them to just pull the republican lever and vote the straight ticket naturally when the time came to review the guidelines for selective service  republicans went bonkers  it seems women have always been exempted from the draft because they weren t allowed to be in combat roles and the draft is for extreme case national emergencies where combat would be likely  things have changed  women are now allowed in not some but all combat roles if they can pass the training the same as a man  two women made national headlines as the first members of the army rangers earlier this year  they probably would have gladly signed up at  for the draft we haven t used since we stopped sending kids off to be slaughtered in vietnam in  republicans still can t reconcile  rep duncan hunter  r ca  told the hill  the draft is there to get more people to rip the enemy s throats out  i don t want to see my daughters put in a place where they have to get drafted  you mean you wouldn t want to see your daughters treated as equals among their peers  you wouldn t want to witness how incredibly strong any human being can be when put into extraordinary circumstances  you want them at home  right next to your sons  watching the horrors of war turned into a game show on fox news  it s difficult as a father to imagine your daughters trotting off to war  it s just as difficult to imagine my son going  hunter was right  the draft is there for extreme situations to get more people to rip the enemy s throat out  do we just keep searching through the men and eliminate half the population s prospective ability to do just that  i don t know if these old men have been paying attention  but women aren t the delicate flowers they once were in the stone age when they were kids the amendment passed the armed services committee and moves forward to the house floor where a bunch more men will debate how awful it would be for their daughters to fight for their country and their freedom while they happily send the sons of the poor and working class and anyone who commits a misdemeanor who has a penis  there are a ton of exemptions available for people to be excluded from the draft  and certainly motherhood would be one  don t worry  republicans  there won t be moms pushing strollers across battlefields just yet featured image from daniel bendji getty images
