for glen grays  a  year old new york city postal worker march  was not a typical day  that s because grays was arrested after criticizing a police officer s driving grays was making deliveries in the neighborhood of crown heights in brooklyn when a car almost hit his mail truck  grays then did what most drivers would do if they were in the same situation   he yelled at the person driving the vehicle for his reckless behavior what grays didn t know is that the vehicle was an unmarked police car  it is at this point that four plainclothes police officers get out of the unmarked police car and begin to harass grays  the incident was recorded by passersby on their cell phones  you can watch the video below grays was eventually ticketed with resisting arrest  he was then handcuffed and put in the back of the unmarked police car where he was taken away  it is not a crime for someone to voice outrage after almost being struck by a vehicle   it is not a crime to state that you re angry at someone who almost hit you  that is not a crime   brooklyn borough president eric adams said during a press conference on tuesday adams wants the four police officers involved in the arrest to be investigated  they place handcuffs on an on duty postal employee delivering the u s  mail  if they would do that to him in his postal uniform  they would do it to any person of color in that community  when the police arrested grays  they also left his mail truck unattended   possibly violating several federal procedures  adams thinks that the police should be punished for any violations of federal procedure that may have happened  i believe there were federal violations  number one  leaving that truck unsecured  number  two  interrupting the delivery of mail  there are clear nypd procedures when you are arresting a federal employee  we don t know if even those basic procedures were followed  this the type of police misconduct that leads to the injuries  arrests  and deaths of so many people   people of color in particular   in the united states every year featured image from video screenshot
