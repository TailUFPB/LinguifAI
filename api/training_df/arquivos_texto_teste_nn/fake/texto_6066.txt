it doesn t seem to matter what it is  if the nra is involved  you can bet it s because they want to see more guns  such is the case in florida  where the nra is pushing that agenda on the environment by calling for a black bear hunt  because bears are nuisance animals and hunters with guns are a higher priority than figuring out a more proactive way of handling nuisance animals marion hammer  a lobbyist on the side of the nra  and one of the people pushing the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission to approve the hunt  says  bears continue to terrorize homeowners and prevent families from allowing children to play outside in some areas  and while fwc is working to educate people about securing trash and is trying to move dangerous bears out of residential areas  those programs are helpful but cannot succeed without hunts to reduce the population  hunts don t necessarily do that  either  despite a large number of bears being killed last year  in last year s hunt   bears were killed over the course of two days  the fwc was forced to end the season at that point  even though it was supposed to last a week  the nra wants an even longer hunt this year  but the logic of pushing for a longer one is non existent if there are fewer bears around due to last year s hunt they re totally ignoring some key facts on the issue  too  these bears were on florida s endangered and threatened species list as recently as   the fwc is supposed to have new population numbers sometime this year  however  without knowing how much the black bear populations have increased  these hunts are completely irresponsible  that is  sadly  typical of the nra these days  virtually every part of their agenda is totally irresponsible why should the nra care about any kind of responsibility  though  in   the number of people in the u s  who hunted was at its lowest point in recent history  public support for hunting began to grow again in   and now we have more hunters  which means we have more guns out there  nothing makes the nra happier than more guns  and more excuses for putting more guns out there the fwc hasn t approved a hunt yet  and here s hoping they don t cave to the nra this year  they re expected to receive a staff recommendation on the issue before their june  meeting featured image by john gress getty images
