the road to full equality for women has been long and it s been arduous  and we re still not there  women are still not paid equal amounts to men for the same work in professions all across the nation  and to this day  women are still put down for their ambition  or seen as less than even if they hold superior experience and knowledge one person who is definitely tired of this rampant inequality is president barack obama  he s been talking about women s equality since day one  he wants a nation where his daughters are treated the same regardless of gender  he wants their dreams to be just and big and bold as any boy s as they grow in to amazing young women while speaking at the new belmont paul women s equality national monument  obama stated  i want young girls and boys to come here      years from now to know that women fought for equality  it was not just given to them  i want them to come here and be astonished there was ever a time when women could not vote  i want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women earned less than men for doing the same work  i want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in congress  that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the oval office   i don t know how long it will take to get there  but i know we re getting closer to that day  because of the work of generations of active  committed citizens  while this isn t a direct endorsement of any particular candidate  it does show the president s ongoing commitment to making sure women are treated just the same as men  no matter the job  and there was no greater place to bring this message than at the new belmont paul women s equality national monument thank you  mr  president  https   youtu be  t  image via video screen capture
