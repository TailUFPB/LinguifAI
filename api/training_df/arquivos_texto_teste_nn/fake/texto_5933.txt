while nearly every governor in the country is either looking for ways to take healthcare away from their citizens  or at the very least  shying away from president obama s signature legislation  california s governor  jerry brown  is about to make it bigger  not just bigger  though  he s opening it to  gasp  undocumented immigrants the legislation directs california to negotiate a waiver with the federal government to expand coverage to a population that was intentionally carved out from obamacare during the law s drafting  the california proposal is sure to receive strong opposition from anti immigration forces and could reignite a fierce health reform controversy in the obama administration s final months the plan s supporters say there s no reason undocumented immigrants should be barred from the exchanges if they can afford a plan without federal aid  the proposal  they argue  could help spur enrollment among mixed status families   with a combination of legal residents and undocumented immigrants   who may have been reluctant to purchase health insurance because of misguided fears about deportation source  politicothis is a pretty gutsy move in an election year where immigration is front and center  it s sure to anger all of the trump voters  who are looking forward to the imaginary wall the billionaire claims to want to build  like clockwork  they re taking their complaints to twitter corrupt as hillary obama is jerry brown  california liberals will soon want a bail out like detroit while they give illegals obamacare   mary carr     june    california lawmakers try to extend obamacare to illegal immigrants via the  foxnews app fuck  jerrybrown https   t co         casellotony  june    moves toward extending obamacare to illegal immigrants  really      who is paying for this  jerrybrown       nancy   nancylovesdean  june     nancy  the immigrants would be paying for it  it s a much better deal than we have now  when undocumented immigrants get sick  they don t have a lot of options  many go to emergency rooms  where taxpayers often get stuck with the bills  this would take the burden off of taxpayers  it would also expose fewer people to contagious diseases   after all  healthcare is in the public interest  jerry brown knows this  i m not sure why republicans don t it s pretty understandable that republicans would be upset  they ve been telling voters for years that obama wanted to include undocumented immigrants and now they re saying that about hillary clinton california s legislation might not pass federal standards  so far  that s the only roadblock  if it does  look for the obamacare expansion to take place possibly as early as next year featured image via justin sullivan with getty images
