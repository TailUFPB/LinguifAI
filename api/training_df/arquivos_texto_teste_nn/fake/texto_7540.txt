republicans care more about protecting rapists than they do about the women they raped kentucky gop senator dan seum made that clear during a committee hearing for a bill that would require people arrested for committing felonies to provide their dna to law enforcement rape survivor michelle kuiper courageously testified as a witness in favor of senate bill  along with a mother whose daughter had been raped and brutally murdered and a man who spent  years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of rape before dna found the real rapist but during kuiper s testimony  seum became the latest republican to deliver offensive and insensitive remarks about rape  only this time the remarks were made directly in the face of a rape victim  i understand your pain   seum claimed before telling kuiper that her rape is not as important as protecting her rapist from  government intrusion  but i can tell you i have eight children and  grandkids  that over the years this government through its intrusion has done more damage to me than all those criminals out there ever did   he callously continued you read that right  a republican literally told a rape victim that the unwanted intrusion of her body by her rapist is less important than making sure the rapist is shielded from the government according to the courier journal seum did not elaborate on what type of government intrusion he experienced  but at a judiciary committee meeting last month  he said that he had been called as a witness several years ago in a child abuse case in family court where  the father was accused of spanking his child  he didn t provide any further details kuiper  however  was severely shaken by the ordeal  i was shaken and felt sick after his comments   kuiper said   basically  he had told us he had suffered worse crimes than us  democratic state rep  sannie overly blasted seum for his remarks and called for her colleague to apologize to every woman in kentucky for brushing off their safety in favor of defending rapists  a rape victim brave enough to step forward and share her personal story of a heinous crime should not get a lecture  he should apologize to these people and all kentucky women who have experienced this horrific crime  the bill eventually passed   despite seum voting against it  but once again  a republican lawmaker demonstrates that the gop still doesn t care about women who are raped earlier this year  a republican in idaho with five daughters of his own made incredibly creepy claims about rape  now  i m of the understanding that in many cases of rape it does not involve any pregnancy because of the trauma of the incident   gop state rep  nielsen said during a hearing on an abortion bill   that may be true with incest a little bit i read a lot of information  i have read it several times  being a father of five girls  i ve explored this a lot  and these latest republican remarks about rape and rape victims are now part of an ever growing list of quotes that republicans have made over the years demonstrating their callous disregard of women and their ignorance of the female reproductive process  you can read a comprehensive list of such quotes here seriously  if there were ever a more important time for women to flock to the voting booth against republicans  this november would be the time  featured image via youtube
