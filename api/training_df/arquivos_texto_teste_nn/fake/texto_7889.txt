twenty four years ago  oprah winfrey had a former third grade teacher on her show who blew every racist s justifications for their own stupidity right out of the water jane elliot was that guest  she is well known for her  blue eyed brown eyed  experiment  you can read more about that here  which taught her young students in iowa how racism is learned  not something they are born with  in   she appeared on oprah s stage along with a group of racists who were convinced that they were better than minorities  the elderly school teacher told the ignorant white people who were basking in their  superiority  just how wrong they were  i heard somebody in the green room say that racism is inbred  no it is not  racism is not part of the human condition  racism is a learned response you have to be taught to be a racist  you are not born racist   you are born into a racist society  and like anything else if you can learn it  you can unlearn it  but people like this choose not to unlearn it because they are afraid they will lose power if they share it with other people  they are afraid of sharing power  that s what it s all about  this is absolutely true  i am sure that you have probably heard a right winger say  everyone is a little bit racist  we are born that way   this is not true at all  babies are like blank canvases  they are taught every single thing they know  people and society teach children to be racist  nobody is preconditioned to hate  that s nonsense elliot went on to tell the hate filled idiots on the stage that they suffered from a mental illness  what we re dealing here with is mental illness  racism is mental illness  racism was defined by the president s joint council on mental health in children in  as being the number one mental health problem among children in the united states  and they didn t say  among black children   they said  among children   if you judge other people by the color of their skin  by the amount of a chemical in their skin  you have a mental problem  you are not dealing well with reality  she is correct  judging somebody because their skin is darker than yours due to extra melanin is as ridiculous as it is sick this conversation took place more than two decades ago and yet  it still resonates today  we have an entire political party that consistently campaigns on platforms of racism and hate  look at donald trump s rise to the top  while kkk members appear at caucuses with trump signs to show their support in   the right likes to pretend that we live in some magical  post racial  america  but that isn t any truer now than it was twenty four years ago  the only difference is that some people hide it better now watch jane elliot s remarks below https   www facebook com  videos   featured image via video screenshot
