once a broken record  always a broken record  at least that s what marco rubio has been demonstrating since his disastrous debate performance on saturday as you ll recall  chris christie absolutely hammered rubio for using a canned line about president obama over and over again  let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing   rubio said during his exchange with the new jersey governor   he knows exactly what he s doing  he went on to repeat the line several more times  leading to christie nailing rubio for being scripted rubio s robotic performance has inspired people to troll him by dressing up and appearing at rubio rallies as robots one would think that rubio would more carefully monitor his speeches to make sure that he doesn t come off as a broken record  but he either doesn t give a damn or he thinks voters are stupid and won t notice on tuesday  rubio repeated himself once again during a rally in new hampshire as he talked about raising his children in the  century  and he actually repeated the same line twice back to back  because as you saw  jeanette and i are raising our four children in the  century and we know how hard it s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats  in the  century it s become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies  in music  in popular culture  here s the video via youtube clearly  marco rubio is having a hard time shaking the appearance of being a scripted robot who glitches out  which certainly does not help him look like a viable candidate for president  not only do we not need a president who will repeat the disastrous policies of past republican presidents  we do not need a president who relies on canned lines to communicate with the american people featured image  flickr
