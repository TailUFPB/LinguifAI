it s been really hard for the lgbt community to welcome caitlyn jenner with open arms and the reason played across television screens on sunday evening  on the season two premiere of her show  i am cait  jenner decided to talk about politics and it was all bad since jenner announced that she was transgendered she has faced criticism for her defense of the republican party  it has left her looking as if she is completely out of touch with the community she says she wants to be a part of  last year  on ellen  she even went as far as to say that she doesn t not believe in same sex marriage  after the incredible amount of backlash she received from those comments  you d think she would have stayed as far away from her gop cheerleading as possible  but apparently she s not very bright  typical republican  during the episode  the right winger voiced a completely asinine opinion about hillary clinton  if we re unfortunate enough to get hillary as our next president  we need her on our side   jenner told her friends   although she won t be   she couldn t care less about women  she only cares about herself  what hillary clinton has been a longtime supporter of women s rights  while jenner s republican buddies have fought tooth and nail to implant their elephants in women s uteri  hillary has stood up for us   along with the rest of the democratic party  anybody who disputes this has clearly not been paying attention  maybe jenner believes that the only way to support women is by making our health care choices for us  limiting our rights  fighting against equal pay and every other dig the gop has taken at us because they think we are all stupid as if her clinton comment wasn t ignorant enough  what she said about the republican party was mindblowing  all of  em    none of the republicans    oh  i hate trans people  or  i hate gays   nothing like that  they do more   i want a thriving economy so every trans person has a job   i don t feel like they re out to get us   jenner said   every conservative guy out there believes in everybody s rights  she s absolutely right  republicans have never said  we hate gays   they just say things like this oh yeah  those certainly sound like comments from people who believe in protecting  everybody s rights   don t they this is why the trans and lgb community doesn t trust jenner  she claims that hillary clinton only cares about herself  but she needs to take a hard look in the mirror  because clinton is not the problem here watch featured image via screenshot
