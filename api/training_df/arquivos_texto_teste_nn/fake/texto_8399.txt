in ted cruz s last ditch effort to scare primary voters into voting for him  he may have accidentally pushed his campaign passed the point of scummy campaigning and straight into criminal enterprise last week  iowa residents woke up to find a disturbing envelope in their mailbox  inside they found what looked to be an official document that announced that they had committed a  voting violation  the mailer  sent by cruz s team   graded  the person based on their supposed voting track record  below their own grade  was that of several of their neighbors  it also let the recipient know that their own grade had been sent to those neighbors  the implication was clear  your neighbors will know you committed a  voting violation  and will be ashamed of you pretty scummy  right well  it may also have been against the law in a fiery rebuke of cruz s pathetic ploy  iowa s secretary of state paul pate released an official statement condemning the actions and strongly suggesting what cruz s team did bordered on illegality  emphasis added  accusing citizens of iowa of a  voting violation  based on iowa caucus participation  or lack thereof   is a false representation of an official act  there is no such thing as an election violated related to frequency of voting  any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and i believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the iowa caucuses in more straightforward terms  what cruz did was mislead voters into believing that they had done something wrong by intentionally posing as an official office  in this case the public records office   as legal analyst dan abram s law newz website points out  that s a huge no no notice that pate used the words  false representation of an official act  in his statement   we looked through iowa code  and a potential false representation is  in fact   a violation of criminal law   the law reads  section     any person who represents any document or paper to be any public record or any civil or criminal process  when the person knows such representation to be false  commits a simple misdemeanor    side note  this is part of the chapter of iowa law entitled interference of judicial process obviously  faking official documents during a contentious election could be considered both unethical and possibly criminal manipulation of the democratic process  it s not clear whether pate will go after cruz s campaign  but what is clear is that the state of iowa certainly has grounds to meanwhile  cruz is only making matters worse for himself  while it is possible that iowa was willing to look the other way  cruz has since repeatedly appeared unapologetic for the pathetic campaign tactic  following the outrage from iowa s secretary of state and on the heels of even his own backers suggesting that this tactic was so abhorrent that they couldn t believe cruz would do it  cruz refused to apologize  i will apologize to no one for using every tool we can to encourage iowa voters to come out and vote  this follows a general pattern of republican candidates refusing to ever concede a single mistake  even when the errors are blatant and egregious ironically  cruz and his fellow competition have spent countless hours blasting hillary clinton for her supposed criminal actions involving her emails  despite all of this energy being poured into destroying her reputation  not a single charge has been filed against her  her investigators can t even decide if she did anything ethically  much less criminally  wrong  so it s more than a little absurd to find that cruz has been willfully and unapologetically breaking iowa state law while criticizing clinton for manufactured ones you know what they say about people who throw stones in glass houses   they don t tend to end up in white ones feature image from gage skidmore flickr
