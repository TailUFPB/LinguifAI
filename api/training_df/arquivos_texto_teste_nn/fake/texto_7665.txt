he s not wrong demonstrating that he is the only adult in a campaign season full of republicans  democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders ripped the remaining members of the gop field for acting like children instead of adults who want to be the leader of the free world  what we are seeing in the republican presidential process is like a sixth grade food fight that you see in a cafeteria   sanders said during a stop in michigan  i think that is not what the american people want  the american people know we have some serious problems and they want to hear some serious solutions to those problems  not vicious personal attacks   he continued sanders went on to shift his focus from the republican toddlers to the real problems americans face such as income inequality  corporate greed  and mass imprisonment later on  the vermont senator blasted donald trump  ted cruz  and marco rubio again for acting like little kids instead of responsible adults  they really do sound like sixth grade food fights  where amazingly enough adults in their  and  are throwing food at each other and cursing at each other and making fun of each other and insulting each other   sanders said here s the video and bernie s assessment of the gop is absolutely spot on  during the last republican debate  trump  rubio  and cruz put on a circus as they insulted each other  trump even went so far as to talk about how big his penis is it s been even more embarrassing on the campaign trail as rubio has suggested that trump has a small penis because he has small hands and even suggested that trump wet himself during the debate  trump has hit rubio by mocking his need to quench his thirst while delivering the republican response to the state of the union address a few years ago it s far from the civility one expects from people who are trying to convince american voters that they are the right person to lead the country and solve problems  but the republicans are too busy trading insults and talking trash instead of focusing on issues that americans truly care about meanwhile  democratic candidates bernie sanders and hillary clinton are taking this election seriously  proving that either one of them would be a good president of the united states who will be respected by the world instead of being laughed at and treated like a joke featured image via bernie sanders campaign website
