in what can only be seen as the worst attempt ever to be a george w  bush apologist  even more so than his own brother jeb  sen  marco rubio is repeatedly touting the line that bill clinton is actually who we should blame for the attacks on    living in his alternate reality  he fails to see that  unlike george w  bush  who ignored intelligence and reports that indicated attacks were imminent within the united states by osama bin laden  clinton actually attempted to thwart the terror mastermind s progress just years earlier  the fact that he wasn t able to rests heavy with clinton  but to see rubio clearly ignore clinton s attempt  and even worse  completely ignore the fact that his beloved george w  bush was absolutely negligent  goes beyond absurd and inaccurate to just outright pathetic you can watch him during the gop debate try to shift blame from republican president bush to democratic president clinton  republicans biggest line that they try to tout is that they will be the ones to keep us safe  when reality shows it s quite the opposite watch here then the storyteller goes on meet the press sunday morning  and when pressed on the lie by host chuck todd  rubio doesn t backtrack  instead he doubles down chuck todd  so i m actually still not quite clear  are you putting   on bill clinton marco rubio  no  i m putting it on his decision not to take out bin laden  absolutely  this is what happens when you have a chance to take out the leader of a terrorist organization  and you failed to do so  and the results are something like   so  yes  you are putting the blame on bill clinton  rubio  and the fact that you have to meander around directly answering that answer like a used car salesman refusing to say if a car has flood damage  is more proof of that watch rubio be very clear that he thinks clinton is to blame does rubio realize that everyone who is present in reality  and not in the bubble of the lies touted on fox news  knows that the attacks on   occurred on george w  bush s watch  does he realize that he s only damaging himself and his reputation by delivering such nonsense time and time again  bush didn t keep us safe  plain and simple  ignoring reality doesn t change facts rubio should honestly be ashamed of himself featured image  video screen capture
