a mother is outraged after her autistic daughter came home in tears because another parent told her that her mom doesn t want to cure her autism if you are a parent with a heart and a brain  you re going to be just as pissed off as this little girl s mom according to a facebook post provided by a science enthusiast  a parent actually had the audacity to tell a little girl that her mother doesn t want to cure her of her autism  and then gave the child a brochure advertising a  natural  cure company so  the little girl s mom took to facebook to give the anonymous parent a deserved severe tongue lashing  to the parent who today told my daughter with autism that is can be cured  through specific diet  avoiding chemicals  idiot  and essential oils  fuck you  my brilliant science minded  but incredibly naive child who embraces her individuality  came home extremely upset and confused as to why i m not trying to cure her  this bitch gave my kid a brochure for a direct sales company that sells  natural and organic foods and spices  and told her  give it to your mom if she s interested in learning more about a cure  the mother destroyed the brochure  but the science enthusiast did provide an image from the company website after reading about wildtree  it s clear that they do not claim to be able to cure autism or any other disorders  wildtree is simply a company that offers organic meals to people who have dietary restrictions due to medical conditions or to those who just want to eat more healthy  so it appears the parent who spouted this nonsense about a  cure  for autism either misread what the company is about or is truly just an idiot but that doesn t make this mom any less angry about what this other parent did  my kid now wonders if i m purposely keeping her sick  i want to beat the shit out of this psycho  my arthritis be damned  here s the full post via facebook         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt this is so fucked up posted by a science enthusiast on wednesday  march    is one of the most evil things to tell a child and this so called  parent  should be investigated and kept as far away from kids and civilization as possible for the record  there is no cure for autism  but there are treatments available such as therapies and behavioral interventions that have proven to be a great help to autistic adults and children featured image via pinterest
