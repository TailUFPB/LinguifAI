republican presidential candidate ted cruz must really be getting nervous about his chances of snatching the gop nomination from front runner donald trump   because he s warning conservative voters that if they don t switch over to team cruz  they re basically handing the election to democratic front runner hillary clinton cruz made these comments during a radio interview on wpht am wednesday  in speaking to host chris stigall  cruz suggested that if voters were going to be stupid enough to nominate trump to run against clinton  they  might as well  just hand her the white house on a silver platter  cruz said  we have got to win and if donald trump is the nominee  it elects hillary clinton  every vote for donald trump is a vote for hillary clinton  you might as well put a hillary sticker on your car because hillary wins by double digits against donald trump  cruz is absolutely right about one thing   and that s the fact that clinton would sweep the debate floor with trump  and right now she s destroying him in the polls  there is no way the disgraced candidate and business mogul would even stand a chance against her  but then cruz begins to add some good old conservative wishful thinking to his rant  and reveals that he is a good enough candidate to beat the former secretary of state  even though he s currently losing to trump   cruz said  i beat hillary in the election and that s why republicans are coming together and are uniting behind a positive  optimistic  conservative message to bring back jobs and economic growth  to defend the constitution and bill of rights and to keep america safe and defeat radical islamic terrorists  of course the republican party is uniting under cruz   they know how dangerous trump is for the gop and will do anything to stop him at this point  but unfortunately  they still haven t come to terms with the fact that the democrats are going to have this election whether they like it or not  at this point  conservatives are desperate and they re grasping at straws you can listen to cruz s threats in the interview below both trump and cruz are no match for clinton or sanders  and they ve spent most of this campaign cycle making each other look like fools  they only have themselves to blame  and the gop will have earned this loss  featured image via darren hauck   getty images
