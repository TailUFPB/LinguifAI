on tuesday  all of kenya went dark for more than three hours after a monkey climbed onto the roof of the gitaru power station and fell onto a transformer  the mirror reports that the unfortunate primate caused other machines at the station to overload  causing the national power blackout  fortunately  all systems have been restored and the country still has power normally  this would be a rather unfortunate  yet benign  story with no protagonist  antagonist  or drama  but enter american conservatives  when a site called drudge today  actual relationship with right wing propaganda mill drudge report unknown  copy and pasted the story from the mirror  you can pretty much guess what happened since the right has spent years portraying our president as a kenyan  not american  usurper who wants to institute a system of socialist  communist  muslim hater of all that is good and righteous  it is unsurprising that they would see the headline and jump on the opportunity to spew a bunch of hateful  racist bullsh t quickly  the comment section filled with  degrees of horribleness here are some of the highlights on the mirror s website  the hatred flowed as well   unfortunately  this is the mind of the modern conservative  while once  a very long  long long time ago  the republican party had some good ideas for the nation  remember when they supported unions    conservatives have become nothing but hate hoses remember  each and every one of these people will be headed to the polls in november  make sure that you re there too  only you can cancel out the hate when you vote blue featured image via screengrab getty images  chip somodevilla
