this morning  the world found out that former fox news anchor  gretchen carlson  was suing ceo roger ailes for sexual harassment after being fired from the network  her complaint is that she was fired because she wouldn t sleep with him  and that women who didn t complain or rebuff him received preferential treatment her account rings true  especially to those of us who have likewise experienced that kind of harassment in the workplace  and the retaliation that so often comes with it despite all the laws and company policies on the books  it s further bolstered by the fact that ailes has a long history of being an openly dirty old man who has zero regard for women as anything more than his sex toys  while interviewing randi harrison  a twenty something out of work producer who had come in from florida  ailes steered the conversation onto uncomfortable terrain  according to harrison  ailes looked over at his nbc office couch and said   i have helped a lot of women get ahead and advance their careers in the broadcast television industry   they were discussing her salary  ailes offered   a week  harrison told him it was a lowball figure  ailes made a counteroffer   if you agree to have sex with me whenever i want  i will add an extra hundred dollars a week   i guess we ll be in touch   harrison said  getting up to leave  ailes maneuvered around his desk and gave her a hug   i remember seeing all the windows in his office and wondering   does he do it here   she later said   i was in tears by the time i hit the street   that comes from a book called the loudest voice in the room  and fox news claims the allegations in the book are false  as companies are wont to do when their ceos turn out to be nothing more than sexist  disgusting pigs that s not all  though  ailes reportedly once called down to the control booth to yell that a laptop was blocking his view of one of his host s legs  and he wanted it moved so he could have a better view  a senior executive also said that ailes once told him he wasn t paying another female host to wear pantsuits  and that he wanted to see more of her legs he has a thing for women s legs  according to that executive there are  of course  those who will say carlson is either lying  why would she  she had one of the top rated shows there so she wasn t fired for poor performance   or that she brought this on herself  the latter will be either those who think women encourage harassment and rape  or those who believe that  since she worked for fox news and helped perpetuate rape culture  she somehow deserves this  they are idiotic sexists no matter where they fall on the political spectrum the former will be mostly those who think women are vindictive bitches  and are just out to ruin men s lives  these are misogynists who think women have too much power these days and need to be cut down at the time of this posting  fox news had yet to issue a statement on the matter featured image by stephen lovekin getty images
