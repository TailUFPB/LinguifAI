one of the tenets of christianity is  thou shalt not steal   but  apparently  jon s  petersen s pastor never bothered to tell him that on monday  petersen admitted to a federal judge that he has stolen almost all of the money people have donated to world ambassadors  ltd   the charitable organization that he has been the president of for years  he pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false tax return   a crime that could lead to a three year prison sentence  restitution and a    fine  the reason for his thievery  he has a sex addiction in his plea deal  petersen admitted that he moved    in donations from the charity to his personal checking account between  and   draining virtually all of its funding  prosecutors said  the group had about three dozen contributors annually  the guilty plea concerned his personal  tax filing  when he failed to report    diverted from the group as taxable income  the charge carries up to three years in prison  and petersen may be required to pay restitution to the group s donors petersen said he struggled with a sex addiction over the last decade and used the donations to pay for it i don t think jesus would approve of this behavior more than thirty people donated a total of    to the organization  and petersen moved    of it to his personal accounts  what s even more alarming is the fact that this wasn t the only money he was using to feed his supposed sex addiction  he said that he was also using his home s equity and credit cards to pay for it think about this for a moment  not just about the christian hypocrisy  but he probably paid half a million dollars for sex  whoah now  sex addiction is a real thing and we really shouldn t laugh about it  i know it s hard   no pun intended   according to recovery ranch sex addiction  also known as hypersexual disorder  is characterized by persistent and escalating sexual thoughts and acts that have a negative impact on the individual s life  sex addicts struggle to control or postpone sexual feelings and actions  most sex addicts do not know how to achieve genuine intimacy  forming little or no attachment to their sexual partners  eventually  the pursuit of sex becomes more important than family  career  and even personal health and safety just like any addiction it can take over and destroy someone s life  if he is telling the truth  that is definitely what happened here  however  if he is using this as an excuse  which is entirely possible  to cover up his crimes  i hope the judge throws the book at him   not the bible  but that would work too find out more about sex addiction here featured image via wdea am
