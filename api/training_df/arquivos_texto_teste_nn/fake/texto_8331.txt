president obama just announced another major shakeup in the last year of his presidency  and the oil companies aren t liking it   that much is for sure  on thursday  obama revealed his plan to place a   fee on every single barrel of oil produced in the country  considering the current u s  crude trading price of    a gallon  that s a pretty hefty tax also   this appears to be a death tax to oil entirely  and  it could make life for the oil companies unbearable  remember   just one year ago  oil was going for nearly twice as much as what it is now  while in the midterm oil will fluctuate up and down  over time it s trajectory has been going downward  who knows what the price of oil will be when the tax proposal goes through  if ever while republicans still control a majority of congress and refuse to take up the proposal  obama s declaration to get rid of oil has already had its impact on the markets  it didn t even take one day and already oil is down  percent after the announcement keep in mind  russia and iran   two major countries that republicans say are our bitter enemies   well   their entire economies rely heavily on oil  when oil does bad  so do their pockets  divesting ourselves from oil is a national security concern  if anything  republicans are hurting our national security from this viewpoint the idea is not just to penalize oil companies and republicans  that s wishful thinking  though  the real issue here is thinking about the future of america s energy and what s in the country s best interest  green energy is  carbon isn t here s what obama plans to do with the money raised from the new tax  invest   billion to reduce traffic and improve commuting  think about that   that s more funding than the epa and interior department combined  a lot of this money will go towards alternative transportation options  think about the hyperloop being constructed between los angeles and san francisco by billionaire elon musk  it s supposed to completely alter our thinking about traveling long distances entirely  and   it s   green  that s what this country needs  invest   billion into state and local transportation and climate programs  put   billion into research for clean vehicles and aircraft the white house sees this as the first step in an ambitious new plan for the  century of clean transportation  by placing a fee on oil  the president s plan creates a clear incentive for private sector innovation to reduce our reliance on oil and at the same time invests in clean energy technologies that will power our future  former governor ed rendell of pennsylvania is calling obama s plan the boldest transportation blueprint since eisenhower  considering many think eisenhower is the last great republican president to take the oath of office  that s quite the compliment  since then we ve just been bumping along  doing short term fixes  and i give them a lot of credit for laying out this kind of long term investment  i also give them credit for having the guts to say how they would pay for it all  that s very unusual in this area  while it may not pass muster in congress  that s not what matters here  this proposal is a vision for the future of the country  and  it makes sense  the only thing that s going to get something like this implemented in congress is voters going to the polls and voting overwhelmingly to fire republicans on the hill  as well as seeing to it that a democrat is sworn in as president  only then will people be able to follow through on this future vision of change for our country  and  in the meantime  it is kind of fun pissing the oil companies and republicans off by talking about it featured image from public domain files
