mike pence  the presumptive republican nominee for vice president  once penned a screed attacking the disney animated musical mulan as liberal propaganda before he was a member of congress and a governor  pence was the host of a right wing radio show  as part of that show  pence wrote the column in  attacking the musical   as a part of the hardcore  religious  right  pence was angry about the main character serving in the military he complained  despite her delicate features and voice  disney expects us to believe that mulan s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts   wrote pence   obviously  this is walt disney s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over the role of women in the military  he later wrote  i suspect that some mischievous liberal at disney assumes that mulan s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right   pence continued    just think about how often we think of bambi every time the subject of deer hunting comes into the mainstream media debate   pence went on to claim that mulan proves that women shouldn t serve in combat  it is instructive that even in the disney film  young ms  mulan falls in love with her superior officer  me thinks the politically correct disney types completely missed the irony of this part of the story  yet in the film  while she does strike up a romance  she is also key to the victory of china over the invading hun  repelling his attempted invasion and defending the life of the emperor  who rewards her for her bravery since the film s release  women have more options to them in the military  under president obama  all military positions are now open to women who are able to qualify for them  including in front line combat despite pence s hostility to a cartoon character  he obviously doesn t hold a grudge as he has decided to run on a presidential ticket with one  albeit one less intelligent and capable than mulan featured image via youtube flickr
