a giddy wisconsin republican congressman was perhaps still buzzing from ted cruz s victory in the state s primary when he accidentally let the cat out of the bag about his party s use of voter id laws  speaking with a reporter at serb hall  where cruz delivered his victory speech  rep  glenn grothman said he was very confident about his party s chances in november because they have voter id laws as the ace up their sleeve for those wondering why this is a big deal  please remember that republicans have repeatedly tried to keep this obvious fact under the radar  thanks to grothman the bell has been rung  the genie is out of the bottle  republicans are using racist and discriminatory laws of their own design to keep democrats away from the polls as a pillar of their election strategy when asked about a republican nominee s chances in a general election  grothman didn t hesitate to give credit where it was due  his party s efforts to make it harder to vote  well  i think hillary clinton is about the weakest candidate the democrats have ever put up and now we have photo id  i think photo id is going to a little bit of a difference as well  this confirms what many political observers have been saying all along  the republicans who push for stronger voter id laws under the pretext to stop  nonexistent  voter fraud are using it as a cudgel to strongarm democratic voters out of the voting booths  given the fact that these laws almost invariably affect poor  often minority voters  this means two things  democrats are being prevented for voting for the candidates who they would like to  and republicans can continue to ignore the plight of the poor because they have been systematically disenfranchised it s particularly unsurprising that a state run by a guy like gov  scott walker  r  would have lawmakers actively salivating about disenfranchising people  his administration has never been one to dwell on actual democracy  a deeply unpopular governor  walker managed to escape a strong impeachment effort by flooding his recall opposition campaign warchest with out of state dollars from conservative groups  it s walker s administration which has been the most passionate about getting voter id laws in place  their jobs literally depend on it thanks to rep  grothman  we know now without question that this is an intentional tactic used by a quickly disintegrating political party to cling onto power featured image via youtube
