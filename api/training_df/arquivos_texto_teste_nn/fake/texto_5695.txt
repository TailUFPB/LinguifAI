pastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church in tempe  arizona  is a bigot in the truest sense of the word   though you ll never hear him admit it  anderson s hatred of the lgbt community  muslims  jews  women  and even president obama  is so deeply rooted that he genuinely believes that he is simply following the bible  you know  if you cut out all that stuff about loving thy neighbor  recently  anderson ignited international outrage when he called the orlando massacre  good news  because lots of gay people died  in december   he said that we could cure aids if we exterminated all the  homos  this may seem like frightening rhetoric  but it pales in comparison to what he said sunday night anderson told his congregation that they   the hateful  anti gay hate group    have more love in our little finger than that f ggoty church down the street  that supports the lgbt community has  in their whole body   anderson says that he is  indeed  required to love his neighbor but his  homosexual neighbor should be dead  shortly before those remarks  anderson said something truly horrifying about what  perfect christians  should be doing  anderson says that while most sinners can find god  the lgbt community is hopeless because it is impossible for them to love or accept jesus  here s the thing about those filthy reprobates   anderson told his congregation   they re not going to turn from their wickedness because  god has darkened their heart and blinded their eyes   anderson continued  explaining that if god has done such things   you can t believe   referencing psalm    which states that the righteous  anderson s flock in this case   will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked   the lgbt community  the pastor says that he doesn t understand why his praise of the orlando shooter made people angry because he  nor the other pastors who have made headlines for their horrific orlando remarks  didn t fly to florida and bathe their feet in the blood of the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in our country s history  i don t think pastor romero hopped on a plane to orlando so he could just go wash his feet in the blood of the wicked and praise god for their death   anderson quipped as his congregation laughed at the super funny awesome joke   but if he would have  it would have been ok   more laughter  then he described his  perfect world  if we were in a perfect world  if we were perfect christians  if we were doing everything that god wanted us to do   anderson said  then they would sing not only hymns but the psalms  and what better way to sing them but while having a nice   reprobate  blood foot bath  why would god want us to sing about washing our feet in the blood of the wicked in the new testament  can someone explain that to me  because it s  valid today  because it still stands  because god is still the same god  anderson said that other christians   the fake ones who accept others for who they are   accuse him of saying that  if a homo loves jesus he still won t be saved   banging his head against a tree prop  the pastor angrily explained that he didn t ever say that  argh  i never said that  i m saying they don t believe in jesus  anybody who believes in jesus will be saved  i m saying they don t believe in jesus   but i met one who says he loves jesus   they re lying  get real folks  and yet they still come at you  anderson s sermon then dissolved into a mini rant about how  normal people  don t want to do the  stuff  that gay people do  like mowing the lawn  shopping  riding a bicycle  playing chess  watching television    who here struggles really hard to not be a homo   anderson said with his hand raised  he was the only one who raised his hand   i mean it s really hard  other men are just so appealing and it s a struggle   no  you re like gross  it s disgusting  look  the only way that a dude would lust after another dude is if god gave him over unto vile affections to do those things  watch anderson s latest horrific rant below featured image via screengrab
