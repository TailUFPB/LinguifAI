how do you make a fortune in real estate  like donald trump  why  be as cold and heartless as possible  just when we all thought the brouhaha over trump university was dying down  along come patrick caldwell and mother jones to throw a stinging dose of reality onto the whole sordid situation  it seems that one of the major things that trump u  tried to teach was how to exploit poor  disabled people facing foreclosure gary eldred  a real estate investment advisor  explained in this particular course that seeking out short sales  situations in which the homeowner can t pay their mortgage back as it stands  and so a buyer convinces both them and their bank to settle for a lower price  that will be profitable requires looking for people who are  certified destitute   that means people who are out of work and not likely to be working again anytime soon then eldred goes on to identify ideal homeowner of whom to take advantage  the borrower is out of work  the borrower has    in unpaid medical claims  the borrower is completely disabled  the borrower has an extraordinarily messy divorce where everything has been squandered   this could sound good at first   the investor is supposedly helping out someone who s otherwise stuck and facing financial ruin  however  short sales can result in thousands more in debt for the seller  depending the laws in their state  they can t sell their house for the balance of their mortgage  so everything they do get goes to the bank it all goes to the bank  so there s the potential for a lot of profit for the investor at the expense of the homeowner because they may still owe their bank what s left on their mortgage  in addition to the thousands they owe elsewhere anybody who would take advantage of the disabled this way is a gold digger engaged in cold blooded fuckery  nothing more we shouldn t be surprised about this  though  the name of the course says it all   real estate goldmine  how to get rich investing in pre foreclosure properties   king profiteer even started the  class  off with  we re not peddling get rich quick schemes  no blue sky promises or an easy road to riches  the sad fact is  more and more property owners are getting themselves in trouble  defaulting on mortgages and losing their homes or commercial properties  i m sorry for them  but life goes on  and the fact is  one person s misfortune is someone else s opportunity  that s just the way the world works  this program shows you how to make a lot of money from investing in pre foreclosures  the profit monger in chief  however  has a long history of disregarding disabled people along with denying that he does so  however  like the fraud cases  he d likely say that he certainly didn t intend for this course to teach people how to exploit the disabled this way  he loves the disabled  nobody will be better for them than him   or he d deny that he even knew what was in this course considering that our wannabe president dunce wants to reopen and oversee trump u  after the suits are over  which he s sure will be dismissed  or that he ll win   this is actually a major bit of news  because he ll probably once again tell students to use the most vulnerable among us  after all  riches are more important than anything featured image by scott gries getty images
