to compete with his frenemy donald trump  texas senator ted cruz has hit upon an old  if dubious  campaign strategy  lie  cheat  and steal his way to victory in what is becoming a pattern with the tea party conservative  cruz has yet again sent election officials scrambling to their rulebooks desperate for money to fund his campaign  cruz told supporters that a group of super secret  mega donors  had personally promised him that they would match all of ted s donations dollar for dollar within the next  hours  cruz begged for people to join on this campaign buy one  get one i just got off the phone with a few very generous supporters who   after our big win in iowa last night   have pledged huge support for my campaign for the next  hours  these most generous supporters have agreed to match all online donations to my campaign made through the link below if that sounds like a scam you might find floating between your most gullible facebook friends  that s because it just might be the problem  as the intercept was quick to point out  was that either cruz is lying or breaking the law  pick your poison  ted campaign finance experts  however  say there s no way cruz could be doing exactly what he promised without violating the law  that s because there s no way  a few very generous supporters  could legally be matching a large number of contributions to the campaign the operative rule is that individual donations to campaigns are legally capped   if this money is going to his campaign  any one of those donors can only give a maximum of     including any money they have given before   said fred wertheimer  a campaign finance expert at democracy  in other words  rich donors and poor donors can only donate up to a certain amount  so what s a mega donor to do  that s where super pacs come in  but here s the thing  cruz can t coordinate with his super pacs without breaking the law  so how can he be instructing his rich friends to match his campaign contributions the other option  of course  is that ted cruz is lying  there are no super secret mega donors  cruz just wants to get people running for their checkbooks  this is a pretty strong possibility because blatantly spreading falsehoods is absolutely in cruz s wheelhouse cruz has been fairly open about running a dishonest campaign from the very beginning  already reviled by democrats and republicans alike  the only way he has managed to get a leg up has been through deceit and pandering  in iowa  cruz s propensity for sliminess came to a head when his campaign sent out fliers telling voters they had committed  voting violations  and   on the night of the caucus   maliciously spreading false rumors that ben carson  one of cruz s biggest rivals  had suddenly dropped out is it so hard to imagine that cruz would lie to the very people who support him in order to trick them into giving him more money  sadly  it s completely believable feature image via flickr
