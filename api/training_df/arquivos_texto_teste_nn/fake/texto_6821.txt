republican strategist cheri jacobus  who has appeared as a pundit on fox news  filed a   defamation lawsuit on monday in new york city against donald trump and his campaign  shocker   the suit alleges that the frontrunner and his campaign manager  woman batterer corey lewandowski  engaged in defamation aimed  with the purpose of making her an object lesson  to those who might question trump and his fitness for office  to incite a virtual mob against her  to destroy her reputation  and to bully her  the bullying tactics occurred after jacobus criticized the frontrunner on tv and twitter  jacobus approached the trump campaign with the hopes of obtaining a job as communications director  but decided against it after finding lewandowski  unprofessional  and a  powder keg   meaning a dangerous or volatile person or situation well  trump didn t like that  after she made her criticism public  trump sent off the first hate tweet  calling jacobus  a real dummy   when jacobus attempted to reign in the drama with a cease and desist letter  the frontrunner took to twitter yet again  referring to her as a  major loser   with zero credibility  lewandowski then went on msnbc to discredit jacobus  saying  this is the same person  i ll just tell ya  who came to the office on multiple occasions trying to get a job from the trump campaign  and when she wasn t hired clearly she went off and was upset by that  after that  jacobus starting getting threatening  harassing hate mail from trump supporters  and fox news stonewalled the strategist  jacobus also shows that trump  who is friends with roger ailes  helped convince the network to drop her from appearing on their cable news programs  according to jacobus  lewandowski showed her the email where ailes promised to be on trump s side  not hers so  donald trump resorted to bullying and intimidation to silence a female strategist who didn t agree with him  i m shocked i tell you  shocked  and of course the trump campaign brushed off the lawsuit as  just another frivolous lawsuit and an attempt to gain notoriety at the expense of donald trump  much like everything else  the trump campaign just brushes everything off  and his band of backwards thinking supporters will eat it up  featured image via flickr
