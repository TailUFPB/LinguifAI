house speaker paul ryan has endorsed donald trump for president  but it is clear that he wishes he hadn t felt like he had to do so  first  ryan had to condemn trump s ban on muslims  before the gop primary was even over  then  he had to speak out again when trump refused to immediately disavow david duke and the ku klux klan  after that  he had to speak out against trump s racist statements regarding judge gonzalo curiel s heritage  and now  the presumptive nominee has tweeted out an image of hillary clinton with a star of david over a pile of cash  and once again  speaker ryan finds himself in a flap regarding trump s obvious and repeated bigotry speaking with the charlie sykes radio show on tuesday  ryan said of the racist tweeting  look  anti semitic images have no place in a presidential campaign  ryan went on to condemn the tweet as  anti semitic  and  ridiculous   while criticizing trump s activities overall  and saying the volume of ridiculousness was that he couldn t stop to comment on every crazy thing trump does  if i had to stop everything to comment on every ridiculous tweet sent out by this campaign  i wouldn t have time to do anything  i really believe he s gotta clean up the way his new media works  here is a transcript of the entire exchange  via media matters charlie sykes  host   i have to ask you about this  the headline on the huffington post right now is   gop leaders totally ignored donald trump s anti semitic clinton tweet   the image  which trump later took down  showed the democratic presidential candidate s face next to a star of david that read   most corrupt candidate ever   the anti defamation league denounced the tweet  clinton called it blatantly anti semitic  your reaction to donald trump s use of that image speaker paul ryan  look  anti semitic images have no place in a presidential campaign  candidates should know that  the tweet has been deleted  i don t know what flunky put this up there  they obviously have to fix that  we have to get back to the issues that matter to the public  i was doing the kenosha parade  the marine parade  grilling brats with volunteers and families  if i had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this campaign i would have no time for anything else sykes  yeah  well  this is like the fifth time though that donald trump  who you are supporting let me remind you ryan  i know  you have reminded me this sykes  i know  but has tweeted something that at some point does reince priebus or somebody else need to get him on the phone and say   mr  trump you have got to stop tweeting these things  these things are no longer accidents  ryan  yeah  i really believe he needs to clean up the way his new media works  most importantly  as you know  one of the few times i spoke out against him during the primary very forcefully was in this area  when he failed to disavow supremacists  white supremacists  so look  i think this is really really clear  the point is  i think he needs to clean this up  my understanding this was done by staff not by he himself  more importantly they got  to clean this thing up well  paul ryan is right there  he can t keep up with every racist thing trump does  after all  trump and or his campaign staffers tweet insanely bigoted things in one variety or another on an almost daily basis at this point  it s like david duke himself is running that campaign  however  the thing that ryan needs to do is this  publicly rescind his endorsement of donald trump  he s clearly a bigot of the first order  and therefore has absolutely no business being president of the united states  this isn t about cleaning up social media  it s about clear  deliberate  and obvious bigotry paul ryan and the rest of the gop know this  but instead they keep pushing for a literal bigoted fascist to become the next leader of the free world featured image via win mcnamee getty images
