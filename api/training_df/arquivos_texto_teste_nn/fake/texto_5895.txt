fox is not only number one with racists  the network is apparently number one at hiring racists as well after a video of a school valedictorian went viral because mayte lara ibarra told the audience that she is an undocumented immigrant during her speech  a fox sports reporter simply could not accept that a latino is smart enough to be at the top of the class during a barstool rundown associated with republican nominee donald trump and his plan to build a wall along the u s  mexico border  fox reporter emily austen openly questions the intelligence of mexicans and made racist comments about asians and jews  i didn t even know mexicans were that smart   austen said  she also derided jews as  stingy  and claimed  the chinese guy is always the smartest guy in math class  here s the video via vimeo  austen s remarks begin at the  minute mark well  while racist trump supporters probably appreciated austen s comments  they didn t go down well with her bosses at fox sports  who promptly removed her from the air for the time being fox sports general manager steve tello condemned austen s comments and quickly made it clear that fox sports had nothing to do with them  we were made aware that emily austen appeared in a social media video unaffiliated with fox sports in which she made insensitive and derogatory comments  she was not speaking on behalf of fox sports  nor do we condone any of the statements she made in the video  emily has been advised that her comments were unacceptable  and she is not scheduled to appear on any upcoming fox sports florida or fox sports sun broadcasts  these kinds of stereotypical precepts have no place in our society  but this is the kind of america that donald trump is hoping to create  as a public media figure  austen should have known better  it would like someone saying that all blondes are dumb  however  that stereotype appears to be true in austen s case featured image via youtube
