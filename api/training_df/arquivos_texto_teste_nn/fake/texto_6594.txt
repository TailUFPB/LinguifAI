republicans haven t had a great time attracting women voters in recent history  and it s about to get much worse for them  their inevitable nominee is someone who has a more lousy reputation with women than any of the  legitimate rape can be a blessing from god  crowd  and he just can t seem to stop making sexist comments  it s no wonder so many republicans are deciding not to attend the republican national convention this year donald trump recently went after hillary clinton with an attack suggesting that if she wasn t a woman  she wouldn t even be a legitimate candidate in the presidential race  trump was asserting that the only thing she had going for her is the fact she would be the first female potus  and beyond that she has no qualifications  as you can imagine  it doesn t go over well with most people when you say a woman has literally no talents or redeeming values beyond her genitalia trump appeared on fox news sunday and was given an opportunity to address his poor choice of words by chris wallace  trump did address the issue in the proper republican way   by doubling down on the offensive comments  i m my own strategist  and i like what i said  and it s true  i only tell the truth  and that s why people vote for me   he then suggested that she is just  going to have to take it  because she s a  strong person  so  the new republican position is that a woman has to just  sit there and take  sexist comments from a guy   otherwise  she isn t  strong   really donald  you re kidding  right  even you aren t stupid enough to actually say that seriously following up on that verbal disaster  he reiterated his original comment by saying  the fact is  the only card that she has is the woman s card  she s done a lousy job in so many ways and even women don t like her  they don t like her  but it is the woman s card  and she plays it  and i ll let you know in about six months whether or not she plays it well  as is the usual case for republicans  trump is totally checked out on the reality of the situation  recent polling models show that women overwhelmingly support hillary clinton over trump by about  percent in hypothetical general election scenarios in a strange way  trump has done a great service for america and for the democratic party  his candidacy has mainstreamed the core values of republicans  such as bigotry  racism and sexism  he managed to convince republican voters that it s ok to embrace these things openly  and require them to also be openly embraced by republican candidates  in doing so  he may have single handedly forced the republican party to destroy itself from the inside  maybe trump will make america great again  after all featured image via wikicommons
