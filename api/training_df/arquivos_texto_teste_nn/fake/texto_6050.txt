despite all the problems plaguing donald trump over his failed trump university  he says he plans to reopen it after the lawsuit is over  he believes that he ll win the case  or that it ll be dismissed or otherwise disposed of  despite overwhelming evidence that the whole scam was just that   a complete fraud  on trump s warped planet  this whole thing just makes trump u  a pile of gold that s not all  though  not only did he say he s planning to reopen it after the suit  he also plans to be president after the litigation is disposed of and the case won  i have instructed my execs to open trump u     so much interest in it  i will be pres   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    u  closed in  because they couldn t afford to stay open with so few students enrolling in its    gold program  a former employee told cbs news that the program was run into the ground  but trump says there s tons of interest in it now  even if that s true  the man is an unethical profiteer who will likely do the same thing again new york s attorney general has been investigating trump u  for fraud for a long time  and he says that trump knew it was a fraud  for instance  he claimed in video tapes that he handpicked instructors  but later testified under oath that he never met the instructors  meaning they weren t handpicked  nor were they experts internal documents also show how trump u  pushed students through increasingly expensive courses without really teaching them any of the real estate mogul s secrets  students were left with heavy debt and little hope of making their dreams of wealth come true trump fancies himself a master negotiator  and keeps saying that s why he ll be a great president  he s making people think he can negotiate us out of whatever rut conservatives think we re in  however  he wields lawsuits as one of his prime negotiating tools  which very likely wasn t taught in his courses  he and his organization just fleeced students for all they were worth  and  in many cases  more  just how does he think trump u  will fare if he loses the suit  or at all  this reeks of the posturing that s so typical of trump when someone makes him look bad  the lawsuit against trump u  has definitely made him look terrible  and he s trying to make up for it now featured image by thos robinson getty images
