things got really awkward on the set of fox   friends on sunday when host brian kilmeade surprised his fellow co hosts by saying that he liked his meat  tight   here is the full quote below  i like my meat tight   not loose  tighten up my meat  the only response they could muster was   okay   thanks for that information  by the way now  it s not like he just started talking about his  meat  out of nowhere  the exchange began when co host steve doocy stated to kilmeade that he s  got to try the loose meat sandwich  when he goes to iowa later today   it s like a sloppy joe with no tomato sauce  the look on his co workers  faces is priceless because they just weren t expecting him to come back with something like that  anything that includes the phrase  my meat  probably isn t the best way to say it  especially with that kind of enthusiasm in any case  kilmeade is never going to live this one down  he s already becoming an internet sensation for it  and not in a good way does anyone else like their meat tight  and not loose  i mean  there is a difference  and  no not that kind of meat  get your head out of the gutter  this really is a thing  and as steve doocey was trying to say   iowa s loose meat sandwiches are world famous  anytime a sandwich is that good you have to try it no matter how you like your meat  kilmeade needs to stop being so uptight and try a good sandwich every once and a while  featured image via screen capture
