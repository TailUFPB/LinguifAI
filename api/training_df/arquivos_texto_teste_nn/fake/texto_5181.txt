the republican party should be prepared to lose the hispanic vote by a record number this year as donald trump has basically just surrendered any chance the party had to reach out to them after  percent of hispanics voted to re elect president obama in   republicans claimed that they would work hard to bring them back into the fold to better their chances in   since then  however  the republican party has only doubled down on their anti immigration stance and they chose trump to be their nominee trump s poll numbers among hispanics have since gone from bad to downright atrocious even as he scrambles to do ridiculous outreach efforts like eating a taco bowl or having white trump supporters hold up signs saying latinos support trump to somehow draw hispanic support to his campaign  and it looks like any substantial effort has just gone down the toilet as well according to buzzfeed  cancellations of outreach events and frustration among hispanic volunteers and surrogates is imploding trump s pitiful attempt to attract hispanic support rnc chair reince priebus bragged prior to the republican convention that trump  is going to be doing a hispanic engagement tour coming up soon  and claimed trump  understands  the need to expand the party in the general election that apparently went in one ear and out the other as trump has failed to meet with hispanic leaders in texas and florida  which is only angering the few republican hispanic voters left the campaign canceled an initial july  roundtable with cuban business and faith leaders in miami because of the tragic shooting in dallas  then the rescheduled july  event was officially canceled because the roundtable participants were out of town   three republican sources told buzzfeed news a hold was put on the campaign calendar for that time slot but the event was never planned  another unreported  but planned hispanic event was also canceled  the july  event was supposed to bring trump face to face with san antonio business leaders and texas republicans  but after the campaign reached out for venue space and possible participants  the event was scrapped  i think they couldn t get enough people to come to the event because their support among hispanic voters is     republican voter artemio muniz said   what do they expect  indeed  trump s is polling so badly among hispanics that hillary clinton is currently leading him in all  swing states  including arizona  colorado  florida  georgia  iowa  michigan  north carolina  nevada  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia and wisconsin furthermore   percent of hispanic voters support hillary clinton while only  percent support trump    percent of hispanics view trump unfavorably trump s performance among hispanic voters in november would be even worse than mitt romney in  if the current numbers hold  romney was able to capture  percent in   trump is  points behind that mark and it may only get worse from there as he continues disparaging hispanics wherever he goes and continues to fail at getting any outreach effort off the ground it also doesn t help that trump s campaign has rejected the effort of ileana garcia  who started latinas for trump  to lead a national effort to attract hispanic voters  the trump campaign got mad at her for telling reporters in cleveland that she is the national latino spokesperson for trump  now it appears she will not have a major role within the campaign at all even though trump and the gop desperately need someone to do something to stop the bleeding at this point  it s very late in the game to convince hispanic voters that trump is somehow the right person to be president  he has made zero effort to reverse the damage he has done and only continues to do more damage  if republican leadership didn t have buyer s remorse before  they certainly do now because it really looks like the only demographic trump is courting is the white vote and that may have been enough to win  years ago  but it definitely is not enough today featured image via twitter
