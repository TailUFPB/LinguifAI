paul krugman  by his own admission  has been drooling over the release of the irs s  tax tables  if you re still awake after reading that sentence  congratulations  you have the stamina of a bull  but seriously  while tax codes and forms and statistics and charts and zzzzzzzz    may be boring as all hell to you and me  they re still useful  specifically  they re useful in determining the impact of obama s nazi socialist commie homosexual muslim agenda  on america and no matter how  disappointed  you are that obama did not turn the united states into utopia  he still managed to do something amazing according to the new tables  the average income tax rate for  percent of americans barely changed from  to   but the tax rate for the top  percent rose by more than four percentage points  the tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes    percentage points for the top   percent and what does that mean  it means obama  that terrible  terrible disappointment that supposedly only serves his corporate masters took a large bite out of reganomics but the available numbers are consistent with congressional budget office projections of the effects of the  tax increases   projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the  percent would rise roughly back to its pre reagan level  no  really  for top incomes  mr  obama has effectively rolled back not just the bush tax cuts but ronald reagan s as well any economist not working for a billionaire s think tank will tell you in no uncertain terms that reagan s  and bush s  claims were total bullshit  giving more money to the rich does not improve the economy  it only makes the rich richer and hurts everyone else  since the   we ve handed billions every year to the rich and they took that money and invested it in buying politicians and factories in other countries  now we have definitive proof  in the form of the strongest job growth since the dot com bubble of the   that taking those tax cuts away will not hurt the economy in any way whatsoever thanks  obama featured image via business insider
