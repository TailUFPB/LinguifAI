the electoral map is being redrawn in hillary clinton s favor as donald trump plunges into near total self destruction while the american people continue to wake up to what trump is   a loud  vile  jackass   the more they flock to hillary clinton  and the evidence is striking when taking into consideration two states where republicans have dominated for decades  arizona and georgia georgia hasn t voted democrat since   when jimmy carter ran against ronald reagan  and arizona hasn t voted democrat since   when bill clinton trounced bob dole  so for over thirty years these states have not been friendly to democrats  but thanks to donald trump  they could come back around a recent poll from oh predictions based out of arizona has clinton beating trump by three points     the second poll from the same nonpartisan organization to show clinton ahead of the blowhard billionaire  when factoring in the two polls from oh  with others showing a close competition  realclearpolitics has the two evenly tied in their average for winning  in   romney won arizona by  points and how is it that clinton could be beating trump in arpaio brewer county  his feud with the khan family across the country  in georgia  a new poll from the atlanta journal constitution newspaper shows hillary clinton leading donald trump in the state by four points  which is still within the margin of error  but a surprising lead nonetheless in a southern red state run by nathan deal a poll from july  showed the two tied  and when coupled with the new poll showing clinton ahead  the realclearpolitics average has trump leading by   percent  in   romney won georgia by eight points while facing a loss in the swing state of colorado  politico has summed up the issue currently facing trump for trump  it s a worrisome sign of a narrowing electoral path to victory  at the outset of the election cycle  the gop nominee already confronted what appeared to be a democratic advantage in the electoral college  the potential loss of a key western swing state leaves even less margin for error in november  increasing the urgency of winning the big prizes of ohio  pennsylvania and florida with a loss in arizona and georgia  and losing colorado  trump is looking at a prospective tail spin in the american electoral process  and it s glorious imagine how much of a surprise the trump campaign would get if they lost georgia and arizona on election day  completely throwing off their trajectory  karl rove would have the mother of all meltdowns on live national television  that alone  democrats  is worth getting out to vote featured image via david becker getty images
