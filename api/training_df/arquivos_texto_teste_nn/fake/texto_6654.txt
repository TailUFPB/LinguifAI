we hear a lot of talk about making america great again coming from donald trump and his massively stupid acolytes   but what about our lawns  can they be great again  that s what one brave landscaper in florida apparently decided to find out when he saw a trump sign in someone s yard  unfortunately  curiosity can sometimes get the cat banned from working in a neighborhood  it all began with a panicked facebook post from the sign s trump supporting owner  look at what our landscapers did    i understand people may not like trump but i have my rights to put this sign in my yard and it was no accident see for yourself  the video shows a  year old worker riding a mower at high speed directly into josh boesch s donald trump campaign sign   one of many in the citrus chase subdivision resident s yard  he then hops off his mower  appears to throw the sign back in front of the mower  and run it over again  then  he backs up and appears to run it over again for those who are concerned  the sign lived through the apparent assault  but boesch is not happy  the resident told news station wkmg that after noticing his mangled sign  he watched six hours of video to figure out who did the thing in his yard boesch says his six hour investigation into the incident reveals that his lawn had already been mowed  though he admits it could have been an accident   a sentiment echoed by fred heldrith  the owner of the landscaping company heldreth says his employee did not typically work in the neighborhood  and that he was simply inexperienced with that type of mower   if he wanted to destroy the sign  he would have destroyed the sign   he pointed out   the sign is still there  indeed  it is still there  but should it have been there in the first place  wkmg reports that boesch s show of support for trump was a violation of the citrus chase homeowner s association guidelines  which prohibit display of campaign signs more than  days before an election  additionally  they report that residents typically remove their signs before landscapers arrive and put them back up later   a courtesy with which the trump supporter could not be bothered  it s been there for like since january   boesch told the station as he explained why he did not do what his neighbors do to make things easier for landscapers   and it s never been hit by the lawnscapers  they either always mow around it or they use their edger because a lot of them have respect  this  of course  is an ironic statement coming from someone who refuses to show workers the same respect his neighbors do  even forcing them to stop mowing to edge around the campaign signs that have been occupying the space in violation of hoa policies since january accident or not  the man responsible for moweerghazi will not be back  in response to the incident  citrus chase assured boesch  the guy has been removed from the crew  he will not be allowed in our development any more  what do you think  was this an accident  or was the landscaper simply trying to make boesch s lawn great again  in any case  the signs are still up and in workers  way  boesch still refuses to show  respect  to people who simply want to do their jobs without unnecessary hassle watch a report on the incident below featured image via screengrab
