last week  the washington post reported that after almost  decades   women came forward to claim they were sexually abused as teenagers  by roy moore  the gop candidate for senator in alabama  nevermind that for  decades they were silent about moore s alleged behavior  and that only  weeks before the election  they all decided to confide in the leftist rag who just endorsed moore s democrat opponent  doug ross for senate it was discovered last week that one of the women who accused roy moore of sexual misconduct actually worked for hillary as a  signer  at her campaign  openly trashed president trump and pushed her friends to support moore s opponent on her personal facebook page meanwhile  the allegations against moore continue to unravel  as the mother of leigh corfman  who says that alabama senatorial candidate roy moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was   told breitbart news that the washington post worked to convince her daughter to give an interview about the allegations against moore  speaking by phone to breitbart news on saturday  corfman s mother  nancy wells    further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren t for the post reporter s alleged actions earlier on sunday  breitbart news reported that corfman s mother contradicted a key detail of corfman s story  speaking by phone to breitbart news on saturday  wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that moore is reported to have allegedly called corfman   purportedly on corfman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter the washington post cited corfman as remembering that she provided moore with her number when she was   she said that she spoke to moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom today  the left got some very bad new about their hit job on roy moore it appears that polls show alabama voters aren t buying it breitbart news   two new polls demonstrate that gop nominee for the u s  senate judge roy moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the washington post against him  and his lead before the post piece on thursday afternoon remains intact  one of the polls  which were both provided by the pollster to breitbart news exclusively on saturday evening  was conducted on thursday morning before the publication of the post piece that afternoon  the second one was conducted on saturday evening  together  they show judge moore s lead over democrat doug jones has been virtually unaffected since the post story came out the first survey  which was conducted entirely before noon local time on thursday  shows moore leading jones by  percent to   percent with   percent undecided  that survey of   likely voters in the upcoming dec   special election has a margin of error of   percent the second survey  conducted saturday evening two days after the post piece hit  roiling alabama s political scene shows moore and jones with about the exact same percentages as before  moore s position in this second poll is   percent meaning he only dropped   percent since the story hit and jones has only picked up   percent to reach   percent total  the second survey  which polled   likely voters with a margin of error of   percent  has   percent as undecided  the polling between thursday morning and saturday showed far less movement than i originally expected   pollster john wahl told breitbart news   the controversy surrounding the washington post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates  but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner  the moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season  and i expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks  his current support level is holding fairly steady  another liberal publication  the hill  reported that moore was losing in the polls to jones after the hit piece on moore was published in the washington post the hill  democrat doug jones is leading republican roy moore in alabama s senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against moore  according to a new poll released sunday forty six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for jones  while  percent said they would vote for moore  according to the louisiana based jmc analytics and polling the survey was conducted on nov   and nov    after the washington post reported that a woman said moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in   when she was  years old and he was  the realclearpolitics poll has moore and jones tied  the poll showing moore losing to jones was conducted by jmp  the same polling operation who gave us this hilariously inaccurate poll  only one week before the general election in  we re gonna go out on a limb  and say that this so called scandal involving judge roy moore is going to backfire spectacularly on the left  and will ultimately only shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the democrat party  who ignored the sexual misconduct of former president bill clinton and his enabling wife  hillary clinton for decades
