by dozens of pastors  who came to the defense of judge roy moore pastor s letterdear friends and fellow alabamians  for decades  roy moore has been an immovable rock in the culture wars   a bold defender of the  little guy   a just judge to those who came before his court  a warrior for the unborn child  defender of the sanctity of marriage  and a champion for religious liberty  judge moore has stood in the gap for us  taken the brunt of the attack  and has done so with a rare  unconquerable resolve  as a consequence of his unwavering faith in god and his immovable convictions for biblical principles  he was ousted as chief justice in   as a result  he continued his life pursuit by starting the foundation for moral law  which litigates religious liberty cases around our nation  after being re elected again to chief justice in   by an overwhelming majority  he took another round of persecution for our faith as he stood up for the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman  you can know a man by his enemies  and he s made plenty   from the radical organizations such as the southern poverty law center and the aclu to the liberal media and a handful of establishment politicians from washington  he has friends too  a lot of them  they live all across this great state  work hard all week  and fill our pews on sunday  they know him as a father  a grandfather  a man who loves god s word and knows much of it by heart  a man who cares for the people  a man who understands our constitution in the tradition of our founding fathers  and a man who deeply loves america  it s no wonder the washington establishment has declared all out war on his campaign  we are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to washington  dishonesty  fear of man  and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our savior and we won t put up with it any longer  we urge you to join us at the polls to cast your vote for roy moore  in your service  dr  tom ford  iii  pastor
