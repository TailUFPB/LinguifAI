ann coulter will be wishing she had the chance for a second take after a bizarre interview  during which she accidentally gave americans the greatest ever reason not to elect donald trump  it will be the end of her career  and the republican party coulter became near hysterical during an interview with the the eric metaxas show last week  according to her  trump is basically the second coming of christ  he is an emissary  sent by god  to save the united states of america  and humanity  from destruction  and no  this is not satire  or an embellishment first  she compared herself to jesus  asked about her reputation for being rather a  divisive  figure on the right of us politics  coulter replied  yeah  i m  divisive  because i say things i believe  generally  so does jesus  but her delusions of grandure also extend to her favorite candidate  donald trump  we are talking about the future of not only of america but of the last genuinely christian country on earth and thus the world  if we lose america  it is lights out for the entire world for a thousand years it is like the fall of rome but  thank god  and i am not using the lord s name in vain  i mean that absolutely literally  thank god for raising up donald trump and giving us a chance to save the country unless donald trump is elected  we re never going to have another republican president  so firstly  in the gospel according to ann coulter  it is prophesied that the failure of donald trump to win the gop primaries would mean no republican in the white house ever again  as good a reason as any for kicking the trust fund tycoon out of the race  but every cake needs a cherry on top  and this came in the form of coulter s reaction when asked what she would do if trump loses she vows she would  stop wasting my time with politics   that s right america  political commentary would be coulter less  permanently  ann sees no point continuing her quest without the bright star of trump to follow  what is the point of talking about abortion or anything else unless you get donald trump in to build the wall  deport illegals  end this  anchor baby  nonsense  stop importing   muslims a year  in addition to two million third worlders per year  it s probably time to spread the word far and wide  after all  opportunities to kill three birds with one stone don t come along very often  america without trump  ann coulter  or a republican in the white house  now  that really would be great featured image via flickr creative commons flick creative commons
