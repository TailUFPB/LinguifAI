yet another republican is leaving the party in protest of donald trump donald trump is doing more to destroy the republican party from within than democrats have ever done simply by being the sane party of the two ever since it became clear that trump would be the republican nominee several republicans have left the party in disgust  the most prominent member of the exodus thus far has been conservative columnist george will  who has loathed trump for months before finally cutting ties with the party he had been a part of for many years just last week  a texas republican who had been with the party for his whole life resigned with an epic letter to the local party chair in his district  refusing to be  one of the good nazis  on monday  a utah republican state senator also called it quits with the party and now a former us attorney appointed by george w  bush just told the republican party to go f ck themselves via facebook in the now deleted post  marcos daniel jimenez wrote that he can t stand being in the  party of hate  any longer  this has not been easy to write  and i ve thought a lot about it  god has blessed me and my family beyond our dreams  i ve had the privilege and honor to see my brother work for governor jeb bush  to be appointed to a senate confirmed office by president george w  bush  and see my brother also appointed to a senate confirmed office by the same president  but i have decided that i will no longer be associated in any way with a party that is led by a bigoted  dangerous demagogue and that has become a party dominated by fear  anger and hate  republicans should make no mistake about this  you now clearly belong to the party of hate   you are supporting a strongman who believes all of that  this is not good news for the republican party but they only have themselves to blame featured image via drew angerer getty images
