in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at a planned parenthood clinic in colorado springs that killed three people and injured nine  conservatives did their best to distance shooter robert dear from the anti abortion movement first they tried to claim that the shooting didn t even occur at the clinic and was part of a bank robbery attempt  when that fell through they tried to say dear wasn t motivated by abortion  but then he made comments in court about  body parts   echoing the series of videos from the anti choice center for medical progress that were deceptively edited to allege misdeeds at planned parenthood and now we are learning about a direct line between dear and past anti abortion terrorists  thanks to court documents that were unsealed on monday the documents give the deepest look yet into dear s seething disdain for abortion providers he told police he admired paul hill  a former minister  who was executed in  for the  shootings of abortion provider dr  john bayard britton and his bodyguard  a retired u s  air force officer named james herman barrett  outside the ladies center in pensacola  florida hill himself said he was inspired by the shooting death of another abortion doctor in pensacola a year earlier  at the time of hill s execution  some urged that he be spared for fear the extreme wing of the anti abortion movement would turn him into a martyr as these documents come out  republican presidential candidate ted cruz is campaigning with the support of an anti choice activist who has praised the killing of abortion providers  while donald trump has said that women who receive abortions must be punished in some way if the anti choice movement has its dream of an abortion ban the line between the mainstream conservative movement and the terrorism of the anti choice movement is continually blurred as the republican party continues to do all it can to appeal to this bloc of voters who are well beyond the mainstream of american thought featured image via youtube
