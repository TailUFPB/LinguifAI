republicans often claim jesus as one of their own  but if you read what jesus said in the bible  it s clear that jesus is nothing like them and jimmy kimmel demonstrated that even further on tuesday night by bringing a guy dressed as jesus on the stage to read quotes uttered by republican presidential wannabes as jesus read the quotes  it became increasingly awkward  after all  we ve read the words of jesus  but hearing him say things that seem contrary to his message slammed home the point that none of the gop candidates practice what jesus preached here are just a few of the quotes recited  you don t lock your doors because you hate people on the outside  you lock the doors because you love the people on the inside    marco rubio we need appropriate vetting  and i don t think orphans under five are being you know  you should be admitted into the united states at this point    chris christie you don t stop bad guys by taking away our guns  you stop bad guys by using our guns    ted cruz i would bomb the sh t out of them    donald trump when you get these terrorists  you have to take out their families  they care about their lives  don t kid yourselves  they say they don t care about their lives  but you have to take out their families     donald trump i ll take the votes of everyone who loves machine guns and bacon    ted cruzhere s the video via youtube yeah  that s a long way from what jesus has said  the servant is not greater than his lord  neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him    jesus in john   judge not  that ye be not judged  for with what judgment ye judge  ye shall be judged  and with what measure ye mete  it shall be measured to you again    jesus in matthew    blessed are the peacemakers  for they shall be called the children of god    jesus in matthew   but whoever has this world s goods  and sees his brother in need  and shuts up his heart from him  how does the love of god abide in him    jesus in  john   come unto me  all ye that labor and are heavy laden  and i will give you rest    jesus in matthew   for i was an hungred  and ye gave me meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave me drink  i was a stranger  and ye took me in  naked  and ye clothed me  i was sick  and ye visited me  i was in prison  and ye came unto me  then shall the righteous answer him  saying  lord  when saw we thee an hungred  and fed thee  or thirsty  and gave thee drink  when saw we thee a stranger  and took thee in  or naked  and clothed thee  or when saw we thee sick  or in prison  and came unto thee  and the king shall answer and say unto them  verily i say unto you  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren  ye have done it unto me    jesus in matthew     jesus and the republican presidential candidates are nothing like each other  feature image via screenshot
