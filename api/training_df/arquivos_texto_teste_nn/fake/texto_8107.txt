conservatives have been floating the ridiculous theory that supreme court justice antonin scalia was murdered  somehow  they are unable to comprehend how an obese  year old smoker with a history of heart problems could possibly die after a day of hunting  partying  and gorging on food   and their irrational hatred of barack obama has instead led them to believe that the president had scalia murdered in an email to addicting info  one conservative summed up the paranoia quite nicely let s look at facts  two to three cases before the supreme court involved obama or an obama agency such as the doj  scalia was the most conservative justice on the court and would have been that fifth vote to say what obama did was unconstitutional therefore scalia gone he puts a liberal justice nomination with the hope either the senate confirms now or democrats take over the senate next year  which is expected  presidents throughout our history have been known to use the cia to commit assassinations  in the  the cia showed congress a gun that shot a frozen dart inside a person and melted poison causing a heart attack  with the new technology we have i think they can do better than a  gun  comparing to what happen in russia  putin had an ex kgb agent killed in a similar way  the ex kgb agent was with a group of  friends  then suddenly felt ill after talking with someone  it was ruled natural causes  then a uk court recently said he was possibly murdered here s another problem  the doj is not allowing texas authorities to investigate  with the doj being a party to a case and yes texas being a party against them to a case  the doj would have incentive to cover it up so yes the theory is not so far fetched thanksfranklin strumafter we mocked him a bit  sturm pointed out that presidents have throughout history used the cia to commit political assassinations  and the technology that i mentioned is on unclassified record the cia had in the   technology is better now  even liberals don t trust the cia  as for obama himself he had everything to gain from scalia s death  nothing would stop him from ordering an assassination as nothing stopped presidents prior this  of course  is just one of the many  many theories surrounding how and why president obama had the elderly man killed  but conservatives like mr  sturm will undoubtedly be relieved to know that scalia actually died of natural causes  usa today reports that the official cause of death is  indeed  a myocardial infarction   also known as a simple heart attack texas judge cinderela guevara says she was called by a county sheriff saturday because the two justices of the peace were out of town  as part of my investigation  one of the things i did ask the sheriff and the u s  marshal   were there any signs of foul play   and they said   absolutely not   at that time i still wanted to be careful  and asked them if  scalia s  physician would call me  the justice s personal doctor called her at  p m  saturday night  she said the physician told her that scalia had a shoulder problem last week and underwent an mri  scalia also suffered several chronic ailments  guevara said  i felt comfortable what i knew was going on with him physically   she said that s right   no poison ice darts  no ninja gerbils  no death rays  or any of the other imbecilic ideas conservatives have had since scalia was found dead in his bed saturday morning  a simple heart attack conservatives have been defiantly refusing to confirm anyone president obama nominates  but the president has vowed to get a nomination through  no matter what they say  while this is  alongside being part of their continuing effort to stand in obama s way on every single issue  an effort to show support for the deceased justice  conservatives are going against scalia s wishes in refusing all nominees until they can  they hope  get a republican in office scalia  for all his many  many  many  many faults  completely disagreed with politicizing supreme court nominations while he was alive   something the right will ignore in their continuing war on obama and sanity featured image via ny times
