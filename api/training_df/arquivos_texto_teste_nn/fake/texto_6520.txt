one of the perks and duties of becoming the presidential nominee for one of the major parties is that you get access to daily intelligence briefings from the current administration  unfortunately  a candidate like donald trump has never come along  and spies are worried about what he ll do with the sensitive information he will receive  my concern with trump will be that he inadvertently leaks  because as he speaks extemporaneously  he ll pull something out of his hat that he heard in a briefing and say it   said a former senior u s  intelligence official who has participated in the process of briefing presidential candidates unlike his presumed rival  former secretary of state hillary clinton  who would receive the same briefing if she s the democratic party nominee  trump has never sat across the table from u s  intelligence analysts and been given updates on the latest machinations of isis  or efforts by foreign governments to penetrate american computer networks  he also has selected a team of largely unknown advisers who might have trouble helping him to contextualize what he might hear and know what questions to ask trump has already demonstrated a habit of regurgitating whatever information comes across his desk or from his team of sycophants  so far he s accused the father of one of his rivals of being involved in the jfk assassination thanks to a sketchy tabloid story  as well as claiming that a member of isis threatened him  based on a youtube parody the presumptive republican nominee has not shown that he is of sound enough mind to receive sensitive information about american intelligence  but the obama administration will be having daily meetings with him and likely the clinton team anyway  out of sense of tradition it is up to president obama to determine how much data can be given to the candidates  and it is doubtful trump will be given more than the bare minimum necessary to meet the voluntary requirements  considering hillary clinton served as his secretary of state and was even in the situation room as the bin laden raid occurred  it s doubtful there are any reservations about giving her the information featured image via wikimedia
