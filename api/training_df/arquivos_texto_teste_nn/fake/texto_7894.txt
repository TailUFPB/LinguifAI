president obama is one of the greatest political orators of our time  listening to the republican response after a state of the union address has been a chore during the obama administration  listening to donald trump speak is an experience that makes non trump supporters skin crawl the divide between the two is summed up nicely in one comparison  the image compares a quote from president obama s victory speech in   after winning the iowa caucus  the other is trump s victory speech that he gave after winning the south carolina primary last week  here s the image how obama gives a victory speech vs how trump gives a victory speech  pic twitter com   dan diamond   ddiamond  february    is a vast gap between president obama s and trump s speaking skills  to say the least  trump speaks like a third grader  trump rarely utters a word that isn t in the  words included in the basic english language  a politician s ability to inspire voters is an important part of being a great leader  then again  trump isn t actually a politician  he s a billionaire has been reality tv star then again  trump is speaking to his supporters  who have been shown to have a similar grasp of the english language no president is perfect and that includes president obama  however  he has consistently proven that when he talks he sounds like he is the only adult in the room  part of that reason is his ability to speak with passion  it also helps that he has reason backing his message  when he has something to say  people listen  that s part of the reason he was elected president twice  as the then senator obama said on the night of his first primary election  they said this country was too divided  too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose  you can watch president obama s victory speech after his win in iowa  it s a throwback to a time when obama made national history for the first time featured image from gage skidmore via flickr and by chuck kennedy  official white house photo   the official white house photostream on flickr    via wikimedia commons
