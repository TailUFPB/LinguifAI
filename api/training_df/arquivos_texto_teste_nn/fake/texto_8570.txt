bill maher is all about telling it like it is  and that is just what he did on his  new rules  segment of friday night s edition of his hbo show real time  first  the comedic host took the terrorists who are currently occupying the malheur wildlife refuge in oregon to task  and rightly pointed out that they really don t have a reason for being there  he zeroed in on notorious anti muslim nutjob jon ritzheimer  who infamously filmed a hilarious   goodbye  video to his children  saying  your daddy swore an oath   and that s why he can t be there  maher said of ritzheimer and his video  just listen here to one them   patriot  jon ritzheimer  explaining to his kids in a video he posted from his truck  why he had to leave  after playing a clip of ritzheimer  maher said  wow  seems like a lot of trouble to go to just to  get out of spending time with your family at the holidays why not just drink like the rest of us  the host then went on to mock the  shopping list  of supplies the oregon militants were requesting from the public so that they can continue their lawless occupation of federal property indefinitely maher didn t stop  there  though  after blasting the militants  he reminded those of us on the left that we have our own brand of crazy  he played a clip of a yale student s expletive filled rant regarding offensive halloween costumes at a professor that was trying to make an argument for free speech while microaggressions and cultural appropriation are definitely a problem  there are people who go too far in their opposition to such things  that kind of ranting behavior only makes the cause and its supporters look nuts  and makes everyone who shares the ideology lose credibility to seem just as crazy in conclusion  maher also pointed out that there s not much difference between the extremists of the two sides  and that s something everyone should think about  regardless of political ideology extremism in either direction   just not a good thing watch the hilarious  and oh so true  clip below featured image  screen capture
