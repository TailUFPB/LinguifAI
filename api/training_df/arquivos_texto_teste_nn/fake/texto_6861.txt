republicans at the university of north carolina have gone completely off the rails and are now literally threatening transgender women who use the women s restrooms on campus with the penalty of death sadly  there is no amount of exaggeration in that statement  college republicans have already made direct threats to the life of one transgender female on campus and are asserting that they will defend  their daughters and sisters   with equal force against anyone else they declare a threat the student who received the threats posted the exchange to reddit while redacting her name  college republicans have completely denied that the exchange occurred  which is not surprising portions of the attack  taken from the thread  are listed below  first of  sic   you are a mentally ill man  no amount of surgery or hormones will change that  second  if a tranny like you goes into the women s restroom  then what about the rights of them  if you value your life  you shouldn t have made this sick choice and settled with the gender god gave you  playing into your delusions would make us no better than someone who tolerates pedophiles  you will never be a woman  and so you should stick with the man s room  as that is what you are  a mentally ill man  you are sick and disgusting for mutilating your own god given body  so a tranny like you find no pity with us  if you ever dare to set foot into the women s room i will make sure to give you a lesson not to harass our women  you freak of nature  we will make sure that you trannies do not molest our daughters and sisters  this comes on the heels of north carolina passing a license to bigot law  otherwise known as a  religious freedom  law  among the usual mundane items of people being protected from the sin of baking gay wedding cakes  it also places restrictions on transgender individuals   forcing them to use the bathroom that is associated with their physical genitalia the unc college republicans released a statement denying everything about the incident  claiming that it s a fake story and they never threatened her  yeah  i m sure that it s far more likely a transgender student decided to make death threats against herself  rather than just simply pee and go on with her business the law  despite its utter failures on so many levels  seems to have had its desired effect  it has now legitimized every phobia and bit of hate that the good moral christian right wingers had inside themselves  they now think that they are within their rights to use deadly force to defend  their women   thanks  republicans  we couldn t have gone full christian sharia in america without you featured image via wikicommons
