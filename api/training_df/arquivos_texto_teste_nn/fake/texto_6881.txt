earlier this week  facebook ceo  mark zuckerberg  long may he reign  praise be his name  holy is he  we bow down before him  subtly denounced racist  xenophobic hatemonger  donald trump  during a keynote speech at the company s annual  conference  while he never mentioned trump by name  the tech god had plenty to say about trump s nature  as i look around the world  i m starting to see people and nations turning inward  against the idea of a connected world and a global community   zuckerberg told the crowd  but then he targeted his verbal beatdown to trump  i hear fearful voices talking about building walls  it takes courage to choose hope over fear  instead of building walls we can help build bridges  instead of dividing people we can connect people  we do it one person at a time  one connection at time  that s why i think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before  trump  and his moronic horde of jaded  hateful teanuts  have all said these things  and worse  it takes courage to choose hope over fear   zuckerberg added   people will always call you naive but it s this hope and optimism that s behind every important step forward  zuckerberg s powerful words obviously struck a chord with employees  who voted to ask their ceo a very important question in a recent weekly q a  do they have a moral obligation to stop trump from rising to power  gizmodo reports every week  facebook employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask zuckerberg in an upcoming q a session  a question from the march  poll was   what responsibility does facebook have to help prevent president trump in   a screenshot of the poll  given to gizmodo  shows the question as the fifth most popular it s not particularly surprising the question was asked  or that some facebook employees are anti trump  the question and zuckerberg s statements on tuesday align with the consensus politics of silicon valley  pro immigration  pro trade  pro expansion of the internet this question could mean many things  depending on the level and nature of  help   in the  congressional elections  facebook used its considerable influence to convince voters to show up at the polls  an estimated   extra people vote  unfortunately  not many of them were democrats  who largely stayed home rather than perform their civic duty  hint  hint  guys  thanks to an aggressive  one day campaign that strong armed users into getting off the couch to head to the polls  could facebook wage a similar war on trump by utilizing a similar strategy to inform conservatives that he s the only man in recent history who chances being unfavorably compared to hitler one day  would such a thing be ethical  no matter the motivating reason in   the social media giant experimented with manipulating users  emotions  in a move that was widely decried by everyone the company removed either all positive or all negative posts from a good number of its users  news feeds in an effort to see how it would affect their emotions  technically  we have all agreed to this sort of thing when we agreed to the data use policy  but no one was warned that they were part of the experiment  either  the result was as one would expect  more negative posts caused people to produce more negative posts  more positive led to more positive posts from users  and so on could the same be done with posts about trump  would showing people more negative trump posts cause the overall sentiment   even among the most vapid who reside in stupidville   toward trump to shift  could they use this method to influence voters  once again  would it be ethical  even if it would accomplish something good  gizmodo notes what s exceedingly important about this question being raised and zuckerberg s answer  if there is one is how facebook now treats the powerful place it holds in the world  it s unprecedented  more than   billion people use facebook  it s where we get our news  share our political views  and interact with politicians  it s also where those politicians are spending a greater share of their budgets and facebook has no legal responsibility to give an unfiltered view of what s happening on their network  facebook can promote or block any material that it wants   ucla law professor eugene volokh told the publication   facebook has the same first amendment right as the new york times  they can completely block trump if they want  they block him or promote him  volokh says that the only way facebook could legally overstep would be to collude with any candidate  if they were to choose to stamp out positive trump posts  to create a blackout  they would have every legal right  if they were working with sanders or clinton  however  it would be a different issue  if facebook was actively coordinating with the sanders or clinton campaign  and suppressing donald trump news  it would turn an independent expenditure  protected by the first amendment  into a campaign contribution because it would be coordinated and that could be restricted but if they re just saying   we don t want trump material on our site   they have every right to do that  it s protected by the first amendment  it is very clear that facebook could take a number of actions to ensure that trump stays as far from the white house as his fans are from reality  but  what if zuckerberg decides the company does have a moral obligation  unfortunately  given the secretive nature of the news feed  and their history of manipulating users   we likely won t know what  if anything  he would decide to do   at least not until after it has happened featured image via getty images
