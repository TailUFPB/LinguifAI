if you don t think that donald trump s horrible racist rhetoric is making a difference in the discourse surrounding race in america  think again  case in point   what happened to one driver at the hands of sanitation workers in brooklyn  new york  the workers can be seen on tape blocking a driver s passage after he had tried to maneuver around their sanitation vehicle  which was blocking his way  they also threatened him with deportation  all the while invoking donald trump s hateful ideas  one worker says to the driver  behave or you ll be deported  another said  where s trump  where s trump when you need him  luckily  the driver did the smart thing and instead of saying anything to these trump loving imbeciles  drove around them another way and left  these are the sorts of every day confrontations and bullying that are becoming all too common as a direct result of the rise of donald trump  the fact that these workers felt like it was okay to do this while working for the city of new york is quite ominous indeed  they are the perfect example of what trump has done to america  whether he gets the gop nomination or not  whether he wins the election or not  he has done monumental damage to america s social climate  and here is your proof hopefully  these workers are identified and fired watch the video below  via ny daily news featured image via video screen capture
