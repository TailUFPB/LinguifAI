president obama was asked during a press conference what his thoughts were on the likelihood of a donald trump presidency  pulling no punches  he laid out exactly why donald trump will never be president  i continue to believe mr  trump will not be president  and the reason is because i have a lot of faith in the american people  and i think they recognize that being president is a serious job  it s not hosting a talk show or a reality show  it s not promotion  it s not marketing  it s hard  and a lot of people count on us getting it right  and it s not a matter of pandering and doing whatever gets you in the news on a given day  source  the hillwhile president obama maintained his normally cool demeanor and smooth delivery  he still managed to deliver what can only be described as a hell of a sick burn to trump and the people that support his carnival barker shenanigans  trump has no qualifications for being president  and obama knows it  most of the american people know it  his only supporters are about a third of the republican fringe who run on pure emotion and are otherwise clueless about civics  and how government works president obama didn t restrict his criticism only to trump  he also took the opportunity to dig hard at marco rubio with a blistering comment about his flip flopping in order to pander to the  trump  effect  the other countries around the world  they kind of count on the united states being on the side of science and reason and common sense  there is not a single candidate in the republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change  that thinks it s serious  well that s a problem  source  the hillfeatured image via video screen capture
