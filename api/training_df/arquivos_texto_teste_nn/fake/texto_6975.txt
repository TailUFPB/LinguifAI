filmmaker ken burns appeared on the late show this week  and explained to host stephen colbert why a section of america has fallen in love with donald trump  in just five words  america has always been racist  i think the american question of freedom is a big one  the tension between individual freedom and collective freedom is a big one  but i think the sub theme of american history is race   burns said  we were founded on the idea that all men were created equal  but oops the guy who wrote that owned more than  human beings and didn t see in his lifetime to free any one of them  didn t see the contradiction or the hypocrisy  and so it set us on a journey where we are constantly having to struggle not with race  but racism  burns  latest film focuses on the life and trials of jackie robinson  one of the greatest players in baseball history   and the first non white player in the professional leagues  he makes the parallels between how many of the same problems faced by robinson  and dismissed as  historical  are actually still alive and well in modern america  we thought it might be possible to liberate him from the barnacles of sentimentality that attach  because what jackie robinson has to teach us now is exactly the same as when he was alive   he says  so  if we re curious  but are not comfortable talking today  having a courageous conversation about race  let s look at jackie robinson s life and see how many of the same tropes that are part of our life today jackie addresses   not only the most important person in baseball  but the most important person in american sports  burns certainly has a point  whether we look at incarceration rates  unequal prison sentences handed down for equal crimes  stop and frisk  the pay gap  african american men earn just    the pay of white men   police brutality  felony disenfranchisement  or the school to prison pipeline   it s abundantly clear that racism still permeates american society in a way that hurts the life chances of non whites now that latent racism has a candidate willing to put a voice to it   and to some such minded people  it feels like liberation but they should not confuse the collective release of unspoken privilege  with an honorable quest for freedom  trump supporters have more in common with hitler s brownshirts than the freedom riders they are angry and vengeful  worshipping a leader who looks like them  blaming everything wrong with their lives on people who don t look like them  they are nothing new  their bigotry is as old as the constitution  they ve been outnumbered and defeated in previous generations  now they ve risen again to fight for their right to be racist in this generation  and the scoreboard is not in their favor  featured image via screen capture
