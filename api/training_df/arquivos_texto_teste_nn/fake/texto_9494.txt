in fly over country  and pretty much anywhere in between the east and west coasts of america  people are sick and tired supporting the arrogant  condescending  anti american  trump hating   liberal actors  and hollywood is finally starting to feel the pain in their pocketbooks  over the weekend  the  year old actor  liberal activist  and harvey weinstein bestie  george clooney  told the sunday times hollywood isn t a priority for him anymore  look  i acted for a long time and  you know  i m    explained clooney   i m not the guy that gets the girl anymore  i shouldn t be the guy that gets the girl  however  there s a more obvious reason why the father of  month old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting    look  if somebody s got paul newman in  the verdict   i d jump   he said   but there aren t that many like that  acting used to be how i paid the rent  but i sold a tequila company for a billion f g dollars  i don t need money  back in june  clooney confirmed that he and his business partners   nightlife businessman rande gerber and real estate mogul mike meldeman   sold their tequila company casamigos for   billion   fox newsbut are the clooney twins and george s enormous net worth really the reason he s  taking a break  from acting or could it have more to do with the fact that middle america has lost their appetite for actors who fund and use their positions to propagandize for leftist causes and politicians george clooney s  suburbicon  that debuted over the halloween weekend  notched one of the most dismal wide release debuts in recent years despite debuting on more than   screens   suburbicon  managed just    million  making it one of paramount pictures  worst performing wide releases ever and marking a new box office low for clooney as a director and star matt damon perhaps one of  clooney s biggest problems is that americans aren t willing to support the leftist actor  after that little prediction he made about donald trump s chances of winning the presidential election in  the arrogant clooney  who according to page six was accused by vanessa marquez  a former  er  actress  who claims she was sexually and racially harassed daily on set   and george clooney helped  blacklist  her from hollywood when she complained george clooney is also going to have some trouble shaking his association with accused rapist and serial sexual assaulter harvey weinstein  who was at one time  a close personal friend of the actor   say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely  he was quick to tell the sunday times that the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics  however  the hollywood star stressed he s not ready to tackle that role the sunday times   clooney won t say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely  he was quick to tell them that the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics  however  the hollywood star stressed he s not ready to tackle that role  so many people since trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics  specifically at the highest office   he explained   i don t have political aspirations  he added   i have always been involved in politics  my father ran for congress  it s been in our family forever  but  mostly  i can help in ways i actually know very well  like messaging   our advice to clooney would be to stick to the fake world of hollywood because real americans don t even want to see your movies  let alone see you making laws on our behalf
