contrary to what the media would like us to believe  obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that president trump put in place by executive order  neither he nor his democratic henchmen remained silent when president trump desperately tried to convince congress to repeal and replace obamacare  or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the charlottesville controversy  the media celebrated obama s post charlotseville tweet designed to make our former president look like he was in favor of uniting the nation  which we all know is a bald faced lie   while falsely giving the impression that president trump was choosing sides before the media gets into a full blown tizzy about obama using social media to bash our current president over daca  they might consider that most of america aren t stupid enough to believe that valerie jarrett didn t move into barack obama s dc home because he needed a friend to play checkers with  he may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president  but one thing we do know is that he and valerie jarrett aren t sitting on their hands  while president trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen  including daca hotair   you know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option  a  trump vs  obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and o knows it  the most brutal thing he can do to trump is to deny him that our guy versus their guy dynamic  i don t think it s crazy to believe that trump s job approval would be five to  points higher if obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly  by withholding his criticism  he s made it possible for  soft  republicans and right leaning independents to criticize potus without fear of being accused that they re carrying o s water two days before president trump s inauguration  obama warned him that he would come out against him if trump rescinded his unconstitutional daca why attack trump now  i think there s more to it than daca just being near and dear to obama s heart  he knows that congressional republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree  immigration is a fraught issue for the gop under the best of circumstances but dreamers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children  they re the one class of illegals about whom even trump speaks warmly  in fact  the president s going to end daca not because he wants to but because republican ags are squeezing him to do so  replete with the threat of a court battle  even then  trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months  the entire gop  apart from steve king  will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing dreamers  all they ask in return is some face saving security measures so that they can semi plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty having obama wade in publicly on the side of dreamers will complicate all of that  with o banging the drum for amnesty  republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty  populists will have a field day attacking ryan and mcconnell  and trump   for essentially doing obama s bidding by negotiating for a dream bill  some congressional republicans might start to get cold feet  the more hostile trump and the congressional gop become towards a dream deal as part of a backlash towards obama  the more ammo schumer will have to say that republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government  the whole gop  we like dreamers too   messaging effort will be scrambled  either negotiations will end up collapsing in congress  with dems using the dream failure against republicans next fall  or trump  ryan  and mcconnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by barack farking obama  which is about the rino iest move a modern republican is capable of making  either the gop base ends up angry at the white house or everyone else does  obama  speaking out  is tinder for the match trump is about to strike let s hope president trump will be able to locate and tweet this pesky little video of candidate obama telling his constituents how he disagrees with law breaking illegal aliens living and working in america
