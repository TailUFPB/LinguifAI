donald trump isn t the guy you would think would be the republican frontrunner  for the presidential nomination  because republicans are typically more slick about wanting to implement backwards and draconian policies  trump  however  has taken gop voters by storm with his calls for violence  his chauvinistic stances on women  and his blunt racist rhetoric against muslims and mexicans yet  somehow  trump always finds a way of justifying his policies to the satisfaction of his vast support among a segment of america that has found its hero  that was all on display as cartoon trump made on appearance on the late show with stephen colbert to justify his latest shenanigans  colbert began the segment with  speaking of stupid and  mad men     donald trump   and then the funny man unleashed his humorous fury on the republican golden boy among trump s wacky moments of the week was his exchange with anderson cooper when cooper said trump was acting like a five year old child in response to trump saying that ted cruz started the wife bashing contest   every parent has heard a kid say that about another kid   cooper said  as trump clearly looked embarrassed  yet cartoon trump found a way yo defend himself then there was his defense of corey lewandowski s alleged assault on a female reporter   she had a pen   donald said   it could have been a bomb  the segment is brilliant because it highlights the absurdity of trump  perhaps with the hope that voters can see the insanity and danger of voting for this person watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
