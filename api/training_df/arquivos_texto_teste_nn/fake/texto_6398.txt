police in this country had a great run  let s face it   if you remember the      anytime before  million cameras went online nationwide  a policeman s word was gold  now  with an increasing number of people filming nonstop and the introduction of mandatory body cams for more conscientious departments  police can t simply corroborate with each other  sign a report and move on with their day  they re beginning to be held accountable for their actions  ironically it all began with the killing of michael brown in ferguson  which wasn t recorded  multiple witnesses said they saw brown shot while he was standing a safe distance away and unarmed  a grand jury failed to indict officer darren wilson for brown s death thus sparked the  blacklivesmatter movement  as more and more it became evident that the narrative  pretty much nationwide  plays out differently for black men than for anyone else in society  they are killed more often  murdered in cold blood in many cases  black men are routinely beaten after they submit if they aren t shot for looking scary and black first  conservatives fired back with  bluelivesmatter and started talking about all of the cops killed by black people ever and so here we are  politics has managed to take yet another issue all americans should be behind and turned into a political circus  conservatives  who are the political ideology that inspires standoffs with federal agents and wildlife refuge occupations  suddenly believe that if you don t conform with the law and do whatever a police officer tells you  you should be executed on the street  why  because the issue is black people  make it about white people and all of a sudden they re holed up in their bunker with   rounds of ammunition and a pallet of canned peaches conservatives have been awfully quiet this year about cop killings  however  even though they are up substantially  at this time last year there were ten police officers killed in the line of duty  this year there have been   certainly we should hearing about the  thugs  who murdered these public servants  no   percent of the cops killed this year were killed by white men  not scary black guys wearing bandanas  shooting at them with uzis from the blacked out windows of an escalade on  inch rims  white guys  nutjobs  psychopaths  career criminals  come to find out white men are pretty darned dangerous   and they don t need uzis so where s the news coverage of the major increase in cop killings  where s the outrage  where is  bluelivesmatter  do blue lives only matter when they re killed by black men or do they matter all the time  the double standard is so easy to see it s ridiculous   blacklivesmatter isn t about cops or all lives  it s not about being an equal part of something when you re not treated as equal  black men are routinely treated as dangerous  often at the end of a young  hair trigger finger featured image by wp getty images
