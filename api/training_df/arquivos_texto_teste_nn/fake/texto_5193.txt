donald trump is an idiot  ben carson  a literal brain surgeon  is so stupid that the phrase  what are you  a brain surgeon or something   loses all meaning  carson  who was fired from trump s campaign after leaking sarah palin as one of the clowns on trump s vp shortlist and who was illegally promised a position on trump s campaign in exchange for his support  said something on wednesday that almost  almost makes donald trump s recent string of dumber than normal statements and stunts not seem all that bad at all by comparison   you know  if carson s dumbass remarks weren t an attempt to defend trump s dumbass remarks with pretty much the entire universe condemning trump s disgusting attacks on the family of a muslim veteran  the trump camp is working triple overtime to defend his actions rather than acknowledge that he s a horrible human being  trump s supporters have suggested that the father of the deceased hero thinks sharia law is above the constitution  he doesn t   that he is a muslim brotherhood  agent   once again  this is an unfounded claim   and any other number of ridiculous things they can come up with  the right is even blaming cpt  humayun khan s death on president obama even though he died years before obama took office  trump himself has attacked the grief stricken mother  because he s an asshole but what can be worse than someone who dedicates his life to attacking the parents of a fallen soldier  how about demanding that they apologize to trump  that s exactly what ben carson did when wolf blitzer asked him about the trump khan situation  we have important issues to deal with  let s just call a truce   carson told blitzer  adding that trump and the khans should just  move on   asked if trump should apologize to the khans  mr  brain guy explained that they should be apologizing to trump for who knows why   i don t think it would be harmful if they apologized to him and he apologized to them  but i don t see that happening  well  of course it s not going to happen  they did nothing wrong besides stand inside the donald s cross hairs  asked why they   the family of a dead soldier whom trump attacked   should apologize to them  carson upped the derp a bit  well  for one thing  if you accuse someone of something that s not true  it usually is a reasonable thing to acknowledge that  he s right  if someone lies about someone else  they should apologize  but that s not what happened here  they have not lied about him at all  in fact  they even offered to loan him a copy of their pocket constitution since trump is running for president and apparently has never read it  it s unclear what carson means by  not true   but it s sort of hilarious that he doesn t think that statement applies to trump watch carson insert his foot in his mouth below https   www youtube com watch timecontinue  v  image via screengrab
