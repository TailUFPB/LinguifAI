we are all aware by now of donald trump s racist rhetoric  one young but very intelligent and articulate student understands how the media can at times sensationalize everything  so he decided to see for himself by attending a trump rally  his findings were not surprising  trump s followers are very racist  james patterson  whose high school assignment was for him to volunteer at trump s campaign as part of a student based civics activity  perfectly analyzes the trump phenomenon and he exemplifies what racists are afraid of  the baseline of his campaign is to make america white again  it speaks to fundamentalist christian  white middle class americans who feel like their power has been taken  even though that s a false accusation  they feel like because minorities are making strides that they re losing power  patterson was also stunned to see just how many people actually support donald trump  he said  that s the scary part about the trump campaign  they re everyday people  people we work with  people at schools  people who hold these resentments  as an african american  that s very scary  that i can talk to somebody and they can hate me because of my skin color  patterson said that what concerned him the most was how nice people pretended to be to him  yet they were in favor of trump s racist policies  policies that have come out against minority populations  specifically muslims and mexicans  they were very friendly  they were normal people but in the back of their mind  and openly  they were advocating for trump s policies which are inherently exclusive for people who look like me  however  as he made his way through the crowd  patterson said that the pretense of friendliness went away and he could feel the hostility  when i would bump into various members of the crowd  there were hostile looks when i would attempt to excuse myself  many people in the crowd looked me up and down as i was walking  if i had to describe the feeling it would be that of isolation  this all reminded patterson of what he s made to feel like as an african american in this country  the difference with trump and his followers is that they normalize all this and make it fine the most effective response to trump and his racist army is for minorities to continue the march toward self empowerment through education and activism  this young man is an excellent example and an effective counter punch to the racists  featured image from wikimedia commons
