not to let us be disappointed in hearing something ludicrous come out of his mouth in so long  dr  ben carson just dropped a doozy on us while he was being interviewed on fox news still unable to keep his eyes open for more than half a second at a time  carson was asked his opinion about harriet tubman being placed in the twenty dollar bill  he seemed flabbergasted at the notion and said that former president andrew  trail of tears  jackson  who is currently on the    was a  tremendous secretary  err  umm  president  and he believes he should get to hold his place on currency when asked what he thought of harriet tubman  he said  i love harriet tubman  i love what she did  but we can find another way to honor her   and that not being bad enough  he said  maybe a   bill  tubman risked everything to free herself and others who were being held as property  and then was a key participant in trying to get women the right to vote  being recognized on the   bill is the least we can do to continue to honor her and her legacy  to say that she belongs on currency that is barely in use  and could likely be considered a joke  is not only condescending  but outright insulting   realbencarson  maybe harriet tubman should go on the   bill https   t co  pic twitter com   politico   politico  april    photo by alex wong getty images
