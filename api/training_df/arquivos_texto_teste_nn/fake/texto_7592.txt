when a bunch of kids were recently asked what they thought about republican front runner donald trump  they proved to america just how braindead trump s conservative supporters were with their answers  now   year old jackson wheeles from jamestown  north carolina is giving us another great example of the sort of intelligence we wish every voting american possessed jackson has not only been watching the  presidential election with a close eye  but he has a message for the gop s most popular candidate   and it s going to sting  jackson was inspired to write his feelings in a letter addressed to trump after his teacher at millis road elementary showed her class the news  jackson s message to the business mogul is a stark reminder that even those who are too young to vote in this election are watching   and judging  jackson wrote  i have read several articles about you and have seen you on the television  i think you have been very rude to many people  i know that you are talking to adults when you give your speeches  because they are the ones that can vote  it is important for you to remember that children are watching and hearing you  too  someday  we will also be able to vote  photo credit  kelley wheelessjackson also gave trump a priceless lesson on manners and the  golden rule    do unto others as you would have them do unto you  honestly  this is a lesson in human decency that someone as old as trump should have learned by now  i learned about the golden rule when i was very young  how would you feel if people said some of these terrible things about you that i have heard you say about them  do you ever feel sorry about the things that you say that are hurtful to others  i have never heard you apologize  jackson demonstrated just how closely he s been watching trump when he called out trump for mocking a handicapped reporter in november  what would happen if young people decided that it was ok to make fun of handicapped people after watching you do that on national tv  bullying is already a huge problem  and it is not ok  i feel like you could make that problem much worse  trump also got slammed by the third grader for stating that he could shoot someone on fifth avenue in new york city and still rise in the polls  jackson spoke for both children and  level headed  adults when he told trump that he flat out terrifies people  you make kids afraid when they hear that someone who could be our next president would even think of doing something like that  jackson left trump with this epic piece of wisdom  start thinking of america s youth and how his words and behavior will impact them  we may not be able to vote yet  but we are the future  i think it is important for us to have a kind  honest  caring person as our leader that we can look up to and respect  i am in the student government this year at my school  i try to be a student that everyone can look up to  i will grow up to be a husband  a father  hopefully a police officer  and a good friend  i will choose to be a better person than what you have been teaching me to be  you can read jackson s full letter to trump below photo credit  kelley wheelessjackson is one amazing  year old and is a wonderful example of the kind of americans we want voting in our elections  every conservative that supports trump should be forced to read his letter   maybe it ll make them actually think for once featured image compilation via kelley wheeless via wcnc tv
