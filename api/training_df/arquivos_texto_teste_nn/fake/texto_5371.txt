america got i s first true glimpse of a trump presidency on the final night of the rnc  instead of a speech focused on the economy and bringing back jobs to the united states  the charade delivered by the republican presidential candidate was filled with hate and fear  resembling an almost nixon esque rhetoric not seen in almost fifty years the nation needs to wake up  luckily  we have elizabeth warren to help us do that while appearing on cbs  late night with stephen colbert immediately following trump s speech  warren  who has been rumored as a potential vp choice for hillary clinton   slammed the republican candidate for sounding like a  two bit dictator  and chided him for his divisive rhetoric  what donald trump says is there s a problem out there and what you have to understand is that it s all about each other  what you need to be afraid of is every other american  i ve got to tell you  that speech tonight  he sounded like some two bit dictator of some country that you couldn t find on a map  through the applause and a hilarious  defense  of trump from colbert  warren doubled down  he sounded like a dictator of a small country rather than a man who is running for the highest office of the strongest democracy on the face of the earth  that s what he sounded like  and just like that  elizabeth warren summed up exactly how we all feel  to put it plainly  as warren did   donald trump is a bad guy  elizabeth warren has been a special thorn in donald trump s side  no one  not the media or even hillary clinton  has gotten under trump s skin more than she has  an attack dog in her own right  warren has been absolutely spot on in her criticism of the potential fascist in chief  he s a thin skinned  dictating fraud we learned earlier this week that trump has no plan to actually take on the domestic or foreign roles needed to make a great president  that s what mike pence will be for hopefully warren will reiterate her observations come the democratic national convention  where substance  not just venom  will be front and center for the whole country  and indeed the whole world  to see featured image via win mcnamee getty images
