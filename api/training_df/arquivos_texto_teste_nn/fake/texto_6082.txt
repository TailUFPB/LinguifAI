donald trump s idiotic followers may believe that trump is going to eradicate the islamic state  especially considering the fact that he threatens to  bomb the sh t  out of them every chance he gets  but quite the opposite is actually happening  according to former cia director michael hayden  who was also the head of the nsa  trump s anti muslim rhetoric is probably helping the terror group instead  in a recent interview with the guardian  hayden explained that  the jihadist narrative is that there is undying enmity between islam and the modern world  when trump says they all hate us  he s using their narrative  he s feeding their recruitment video  hayden is correct  no one has slammed muslims more than the donald  no once can forget his comments in december  which came a few days after a terrorist shooting in san bernardino  california  trump s reaction to the muslim shooters  attack was  until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses  our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad  and have no sense of reason or respect for human life  islam is a religion of   billion people and trump threatened to ban every single one of them from entering the united states  if that s not a major motivator for terrorists to attack america  i m not sure what is  even after trump s horrific anti muslim comments  the xenophobia didn t stop  in fact  it was just the beginning  trump s anti muslim rhetoric has inspired violence and harassment toward muslims all over the united states   for example  people wearing hijabs are being called  terrorist  or are being physically attacked for no reason other than their religion  it s not a coincidence that these attacks were all performed by trump supporters  hayden isn t the only one to recently suggest that trump s anti islamic rhetoric is actually a good thing for the terrorist group  just a few days ago  new york times columnist thomas friedman said that the islamic state would love it if donald trump got elected  friedman said  they would want someone who they think would do something more extreme than the other  push america back in the middle east  and therefore inflame the situation in a way that isis thinks would benefit them  featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
