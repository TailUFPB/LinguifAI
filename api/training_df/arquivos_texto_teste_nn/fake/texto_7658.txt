if there s one thing that s certain about donald trump   you know  aside from his racism  misogyny  islamophobia  and fascist tendencies   it s that almost every speech and interview sounds basically the same  trump loves to bloviate but rarely provides his listeners with actual ideas  facts  or even an answer to questions he is asked george takei decided to have a little bit of fun with this idea in  a facebook post  providing a trumpanese answer to a rather simple question   what is two plus two   takei perfectly captures the donald s rather impressive ability to ramble endlessly about nothing while avoiding providing an actual answer to even the simplest of queries  i have to say a lot of people have been asking this question  no  really  a lot of people come up to me and they ask me  they say   what s     takei writes   and i tell them look  we know what   is  we ve had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine  oh my god  i can t believe it  addition and subtraction of the  the  and the   takei continues  adding  its terrible  its just terrible  look  if you want to know what   is  do you want to know what   is  i ll tell you  first of all the number   by the way i love the number   it s probably my favorite number  no it is my favorite number  you know what  it s probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it  a lot  if i m being honest  i mean  if i m being honest  i like a lot of zeros  except for marco rubio  now he s a zero that i don t like  though  i probably shouldn t say that  he s a nice guy but he s like      on and on  like that  this trump  impression  is spot on  takei even manages to work in trump s penchant for including not so subtle jabs at his opponents  his depiction of the donald s modus operandi is so clear  you can almost hear the racist  hopeful s voice as you read it good job  mr  sulu featured image via screengrab
