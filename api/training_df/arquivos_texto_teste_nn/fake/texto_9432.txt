joe biden is thinking about running for potus in  but this type of anti gun comment is a huge deal breaker for voters if biden had used common sense he would realize that the texas hero stopped the gunman from proceeding with any more deaths when he used his weapon does biden believe that if you outlaw a certain type of gun that they won t be out there anymore  two words  bill clinton joe biden says that the man who stopped the texas church shooter should not have been armed  pic twitter com   ryan saavedra     realsaavedra  november    biden   well  first of all  the kind of gun being carried he shouldn t be carrying   biden said   assault weapons are i wrote the last serious gun control law that was written and was law for  years  and it outlawed assault weapons and it outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets and so you can kill a whole lot of people a lot more quickly  joe biden wants to run  not gonna happen if he starts to go down this path remember gun sales always skyrocket when there is an effort to ban them  the left s logic on this is upside down  just because you ban guns or put a sign up banning them in a public place does not mean that people will obey them  the hero who shot the gunman was a brave american  shame on joe biden
