israel is in a class all by itself when it comes to perpetuating some of the worst human rights violations of any country on earth today  for decades  israel has had a policy of ethnically cleansing and robbing the indigenous palestinian population of its lands and resources and killing them when they resist the atrocities committed against them under the guise of self defense  now  an israeli military general  someone who is one of the leaders of israel s killing machine  has come out and admitted that israel today shares many of the same elements as nazi germany addressing an audience at tel yitzhak in central israel on holocaust remembrance day  israel defense forces major general yair golan dropped a bombshell on the israel s racist establishment when he said  it s scary to see horrifying developments that took place in europe begin to unfold here  the holocaust should bring us to ponder our public lives and  furthermore  it must lead anyone who is capable of taking public responsibility to do so  because if there is one thing that is scary in remembering the holocaust  it is noticing horrific processes which developed in europe   particularly in germany       and  years ago  and finding remnants of that here among us in the year   the general was immediately attacked by israeli government officials  justice minister ayelet shaked told local media that golan was  a little confused  and that he showed  a lack of understanding  if not a disrespect of the holocaust   yet  it is shaked who has shown disrespect for humanity when she advocated for the genocide of palestinians  here s what she posted on her facebook page two years ago    they are all enemy combatants  and their blood shall be on all their heads  now this also includes the mothers of the martyrs  who send them to hell with flowers and kisses  they should follow their sons  nothing would be more just  they should go  as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes  otherwise  more little snakes will be raised there  the next day  palestinian teenager muhammad abu khudair was kidnapped and burned alive in jerusalem  neftali bennett  leader of one of israel s right wing parties also called on general golan to retract his statements  bennett is at the forefront of israel s genocidal and war mongering saber rattling  he has said of palestinians  i already killed lots of arabs in my life  and there is absolutely no problem with that  we should keep in mind that these are not two government ministers with fascist tendencies in the midst of a normal government  israel today is inherently driven by beliefs that makes the general correct in comparing israel with nazi germany  zionism  which drives israel  is an ideology whose adherents advocate for a pure jewish state  in a land where the majority of the population was not jewish     in the early  century  zionists have always advocated for the destruction of the inferior non jewish palestinians to create and maintain their jewish state   years later  with   of the palestinian population ethnically cleansed and not allowed to return to their ancestral homeland  the israelis see the remaining palestinians in the occupied west bank  gaze strip  as well as those inside of israel  as a demographic threat the rhetoric of shaked and bennett is not the exception to the rule of the state of israel  it is the norm  for the palestinians  this will continue to mean their oppression and gradual destruction  it is up to the american people to say no to the billions of dollars a year we send to a country that is thirsty for the removal of an entire people in order to achieve its pure state featured image via video screenshot
