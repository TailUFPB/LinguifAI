they re calling them  y all qaeda   it s all at once appropriate and ridiculous  the fact that a group of armed traitors are occupying a federal building at the malheur national wildlife refuge shouldn t be treated as a cute internet meme  but there it is rather  this is serious business made more serious by the infuriating reality that local law enforcement appears to be allowing it to happen without much interference according to the oregonian  police officers were nowhere to be found during the saturday rally at the site which led to several members seizing the headquarters at the refuge  furthermore  law enforcement hasn t revealed its plans   if any   to repel the militia from the government land  and now that ammon bundy  the son of nevada secessionist ranched cliven bundy  has taken over as the leader of the occupation  the militiamen are sure to be joined by more attention seeking seditionists but going back to the lack of law enforcement presence  do we really need to underscore the lopsided injustice here  do we really need to emphasize the fact that if this had been black lives matter activists or  hell  islamic terrorists  how the facility would ve been surrounded and the situation greeted with law enforcement gunfire  if just one african american gunman has stepped foot into the building  recent history and more than enough video footage has proved that the black gunman would ve been decimated in an onslaught of police gunfire  full stop instead  a group of secessionist weekend warriors with enough disposable income to play military dress em up are being allowed to seize government property   taxpayer owned land and facilities   in an effort to exert their independence from the rest of the nation  law enforcement appears to be completely blas  about it  why  the answer should be obvious so  what next  if these bastards want a fight  and if they want to die for their stupid cause  give it to them  they ve seized our land  mine  yours  it s time to stop dicking around and show them they re not above the law just because of their white privilege featured image via twitter
