when listening to congress discuss matters of importance lately  you d think you were listening to children on the schoolyard fighting over who should have more time in the sandbox  it s almost obscene how both sides are unable to get along and work together to get the job they were elected to do done clearly noticing how childlike both republicans and democrats are behaving  the daily show put together a correspondent s piece featuring a play at home game for children depicting what it s really like within the walls of congress trying to get anything done the segment features children reading a giant rule book and trying to understand the rules  but then it shows one player not wanting to follow any of the rules in favor of how they want to play the game  that one side likely being an example of republicans who lately have made it impossible to get anything done  including using their own interpretation of the constitution on when and how supreme court justices should be confirmed by the end of the segment it shows one child utterly frustrated with the other kid s absolute inability to play the game by the rules  so they both end up giving up  this unfortunately is all too accurate of a depiction of the way the real united states congress has been working lately  that s why it s very important to make sure we re voting the right people into congress and not just focusing on who s in the white house  but rather in every branch of government all in all  the daily show absolutely nailed the reality of congress  watch here featured image  youtube
