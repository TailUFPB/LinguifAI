last week  cnn hired donald trump s disgraced former campaign manager  corey lewandowski  that should have been enough to convince the nation that cnn didn t care at all about balanced coverage  on monday  though  they even outdid that  by completely gushing over the gop frontrunner and calling him mature  because his latest wasn t completely racist as of the publication of this article  trump s twitter account has been uncharacteristically quiet for  hours  ironically  his last tweet was complaining about cnn   cnn is all negative when it comes to me  i don t watch it anymore   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    also very characteristically insulted both hillary clinton and elizabeth warren  crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u s  senate  goofy elizabeth warren  who lied on heritage   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    those  silent hours  though  trump released a press release and he was interviewed by an nbc reporter  cnn s panel was very impressed with the interview and with trump s press release  well  because it didn t call warren  pocahontas   he only called her  racist  because warren once claimed  thanks to family lore  that she was five percent native american okay  he actually did call her pocahontas during the interview  we call her pocahontas for a reason   said trump   she said she s  percent native american  she was unable to prove it  she used the fact that she was native american to advance her career  elizabeth warren is a total fraud  she made up her heritage  which i think is racist  i think she s a racist  actually  because what she did was very racist  to cnn  though  this was a sign of a mature donald trump  he has been calling elizabeth warren   pocahontas   repeatedly   brianna keilar said   this is the more grown up way to put what he is   what his allegation is  nia malika henderson agreed  saying that it was a kind of  mature version of a non fifth grade version of the  pocahontas    what some people think is an insult   it is unclear if she meant that trump had graduated to more middle school attacks like  i know you are but what am i  he is talking about policy  he is saying she is a sellout to the cause   henderson continued   i do think we are seeing a slow maturation of donald trump  again  he sort of is still doing the same thing calling her goofy  nodding to the heritage  which is sort of a weird thing  we don t typically talk about people s ethnic backgrounds in presidential politics  but  this is where he is  you see this creeping professionalism  professionalization of trump s campaign  where he personally  when he tweets  it is usually sort of a  frankly  a schoolyard taunt   ryan lizza explained   if you look at the stuff they are sending out in press releases that is done by the campaign  it is a little bit more of a targeted  the way to get at elizabeth warren is to argue she is selling out her principles by endorsing clinton  source  raw storyhere s the video is this trump benefitting from low expectations or is it something more nefarious  it s probably a bit of both  his rhetoric is so divisive and so immature  that anything above the  grade level seems  adult   but beyond that  trump is a ratings bonanza and cnn doesn t want to risk being cut off from the billionaire as for elizabeth warren  well  she never claimed that she was native american to get into harvard  or anywhere else  that was made up
