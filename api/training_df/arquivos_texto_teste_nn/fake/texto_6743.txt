republican delusion never ceases to reach new ridiculous heights of absolute stupidity in their race to make oklahoma the most anti abortion state in the nation  republicans passed  in the house this week  the legislation now moves to the senate where it will likely also pass before then heading to the desk of gop governor mary fallin  who will likely sign it into law  you know  because hating women and costing taxpayers millions of dollars to defend an unconstitutional law is what republicans obsess with these days but one republican actually argued that oklahoma taxpayers shouldn t worry about the cost of the legal expenses because according to him  god will pay the costs despite the fact that oklahoma faces a    billion deficit  gop state rep  david brumbaugh excused passing the bill by claiming that god will fix the state s crumbling economy and pay all the legal expenses resulting from forthcoming lawsuits if they do the  moral  thing and ban abortion  everybody talks about this    billion deficit   brumbaugh said on thursday   if we take care of the morality  god will take care of the economy  i ve heard almost every argument today about judicial challenge to this legislation and after much prayer and study  i ask myself this question   he continued   do we make laws because they re moral and right  or do we make them based on what an unelected judicial occupant might question or overturn  no  rep  brumbaugh  we make laws in this country based on the constitution and the supreme court has ruled that the  amendment prohibits banning women from making private choices regarding their own bodies  and that includes the right to choose to have an abortion but if  passes in oklahoma  women across that state will no longer get a choice because the bill makes it a law that doctors who perform an abortion other than for a woman who has suffered a miscarriage or their life is in danger to have their license revoked  in short  women would not even be able to get an abortion within the first  weeks of pregnancy when  percent of abortions occur because doctors would be faced with having their license to practice medicine taken away from them  basically  republicans are trying to ban abortion by punishing doctors who perform the procedure brumbaugh went on to compare abortion to slavery and then scoffed at the fact that the bill is unconstitutional  don t let people tell you   unconstitutional arguments  roe v  wade   all this   he said once again  a republican insanely believes that passing certain legislation will please god enough that all of our problems will be magically fixed  taxpayers in oklahoma should be outraged that one of their own representatives is trying to dupe them in this way to excuse a bill that would strip millions of women of their reproductive rights featured image  youtube
