when republican indiana governor mike pence signed hb  into law last week  he wasn t expecting women to personally keep him informed about their bodily functions  but that is exactly what is happening since pence and republicans made a new law banning abortion based on race or gender  requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals  and forces doctors  to provide information about perinatal hospice care to a pregnant woman who is considering an abortion because the unborn child has been diagnosed with a lethal fetal anomaly  in other words  women considering an abortion will be lectured by their doctor after being informed about any lethal fetal anomaly  once a woman is informed of such an anomaly  she will no longer be able to get an abortion because the new law prohibits abortions in such cases  that means women are going to be forced to carry fetuses with anomalies to term  regardless of viability  which means women could end up giving birth to babies that will suffer and die soon after being born in response to this latest attack on a woman s right to choose  women are actually calling in to inform governor pence of their reproductive cycle status and the phone conversations are comedy gold  i need to get a message to the governor that i am on day three of my period  my flow seems abnormally heavy  but my cramps are much better to  she tells the person who answered before being interrupted  ma am  what is it that i can help you with   the person asks  oh  i don t need your help  i just wanted to keep governor pence informed of my reproductive cycle  since he seems so concerned   the woman replied the phone calls are the result of a call to action campaign led by a group known as  periods for pence   which seeks to give women a voice in the state since pence and republicans didn t really consider what women think before imposing their anti abortion agenda on all women in indiana  the more i read this bill  the more vague language i found and the more loopholes  and it just seemed incredibly intrusive   the creator of the campaign told wrtv   so i wanted to give a voice for women who really didn t feel like they were given any kind of input into a bill that would affect our life so much  the campaign s facebook page even generously provided the number to reach the governor s office  which is     for those of you who want to know  and women started calling the number to keep pence updated on what s going on with their uterus since pence and the gop want to know so desperately  and it led to the call above and this one  good morning   a woman said upon reaching the governor s office   i just wanted to inform the governor that things seem to be drying up today  no babies seem to be up in there  okay  upon being asked her name  the woman replied that her name is sue magina   that s m a g i n a  it rhymes with  she said before being cut off here s the video yeah  this campaign is perfect and i m sure governor pence is super stoked about receiving constant updates on what s going on with women s reproductive cycles  so women should definitely call him and make sure to provide as many details as possible  after all  he clearly wants to know since he can t stop invading women s privacy to regulate their reproductive health decisions  featured image via indiana talks
