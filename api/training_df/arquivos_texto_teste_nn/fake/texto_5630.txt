anti abortion advocates were dealt another heavy blow on friday after a federal judge blocked parts of a bill that would have put new restrictions on clinics that provide abortion related health services  the bill    was signed into law by florida s republican governor rick scott  the bill aimed to cut funding for health clinics that provide abortion services such as planned parenthood  if this bill had been allowed to remain law  it would have cost planned parenthood    dollars a year in funding it s important to keep in mind that florida law already prevents government funding of abortion services  that means that the relevant funding portions of the bill were not going to actually stop funding of abortion services but every other service that planned parenthood provides u s  district judge robert hinkle put in place a last minute injunction after planned parenthood affiliates challenged some of some of the provisions in the bill on conditional grounds   the state s only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions   hinkle wrote according to reuters  hinkle based his injunction on the reasoning that  clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other health care services they also provide  such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases  this comes just days after the united states supreme court ruled in favor of women s reproductive rights  the decision in woman s health v  hellerstedt has had a domino effect when it comes to women s reproductive rights  since monday s ruling  six states have had similar abortion laws struck down either permanently or temporarily  that s a major setback to the republican party s war against planned parenthood and women s rights it s almost laughable at this point that republicans are trying to spin their attacks on our health care system as being an attempt to protect women  as this bill was described by its proponents featured image from photo by joe raedle getty images
