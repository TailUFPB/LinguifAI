texas conservatives are cheering after britain voted to leave the european union because they believe it means they can secede from the united states upon learning of the results  conservatives took to social media to urge texas to declare independence texas should leave the failed american union   rejoin the world as an independent  self governing nation   texit https   t co   trey mays   treymays  june    now  texas  louisiana  and oklahoma secede and form a new country called the united states of awesome   texit   collin o scopy   crapplefratz  june    the event that  hillaryclinton becomes potus     govabbott can we begin plans for  texit   thanks for your superb leadership   tcot    stan weber     june    please please please now can we have a vote for texas to leave the us   texit     jeff tiedrich      jefftiedrich  june    over   fellow texans who have pledge to vote for texas independence https   t co  texit pic twitter com   tnm   texasnatmov  june    forget  brexit i want to know when we re going to start a  texit pic twitter com   modern rebel   mamericanrebel  june    one is happier about the the british exit from the eu than texas nationalist movement president daniel miller in an interview with the guardian  miller claimed that britain leaving the eu is the exact same as texas wanting to leave the united states  you could take  britain  out and replace it with  texas   you could take  eu  out and replace it with  us   you could take  brussels  out and replace it with  washington dc   you could give you guys a nice texas drawl and no one would know any different  so much of it is exactly the same  the vast majority of the laws  rules and regulations that affect the people of texas are created by the political class or un elected bureaucrats in washington   he continued it s not likely that texas will be able to secede  however  shortly after the civil war  the supreme court ruled in texas v  white when  therefore  texas became one of the united states  she entered into an indissoluble relation  all the obligations of perpetual union  and all the guaranties of republican government in the union  attached at once to the state  the act which consummated her admission into the union was something more than a compact  it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body  and it was final  the union between texas and the other states was as complete  as perpetual  and as indissoluble as the union between the original states  there was no place for reconsideration or revocation  except through revolution or through consent of the states in short  the only way texas can secede is if a majority of the states agree to let texas do so and perhaps it s time to let them the republican party would suffer a serious blow if texas exited the union  texas has  electoral votes and sends  representatives to congress   of whom are republicans  the two senators texas sends to congress are also republicans  so not only would democrats win the presidency handily  they could take back the house and the senate furthermore  the united states government could stop sending federal dollars to texas you can also bet that conservatives would flock to texas in search of a conservative paradise and when the new country of texas becomes a failed state  we can just build a wall around it and let them deal with their own mess instead of coming to their rescue again as america did in  when texas begged for entrance into the united states because it was in severe debt it s time to cut the cord  america  texas has been dragging this country down for too long  we survived as a nation for nearly  years without texas  we didn t need texas then  we definitely do not need texas now  the republican party needs texas  but we don t  so let s kill two birds with one stone and let texas go  because once texas goes  so goes the republican party  texas entered this country in what they call a  marriage of convenience   this would just be a divorce of convenience  except that america would finally progress into the future we deserve while texas continues to go backwards featured image via wikimedia
