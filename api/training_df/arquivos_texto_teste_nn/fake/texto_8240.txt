when appearing on the late show with stephen colbert it s probably best to expect the unexpected  and in the case for fox news host bill o reilly  it was probably best to expect his far right wing humor to not be appreciated whatsoever by either colbert or his audience within the first few moments of his appearance  he alienated pretty much everyone by saying those over on cnn and msnbc are  on crack   he was trying to convince people that fox news is   in the ratings for a reason  little does he realize that if people want their right wing hate tv  they only have one place to go  whereas facts are dispersed everywhere else  so when o reilly made his remark about the other networks  the crowd audibly booed him and was not impressed whatsoever then  just moments later  o reilly thought it wise to do a bernie sanders impersonation while also saying that sanders and trump are the same person  here s the thing  colbert and his audience  are likely going to have a liberal response  so you can only guess how this sanders bashing was received   not well  colbert even asking the fox news host after his sanders impression   are you having a stroke  after a huge back and forth about what o reilly deems best for the nation  and when colbert explains what actually is best for the nation  they end their debate cordially  but it was obvious the late show host was visibly annoyed with the fox news toady colbert ended the interview with this amazing statement  you re a great model to do an impression of for ten years  which is a complete slam at o reilly s ridiculously conservative viewpoints and show all in all  this was one of the best smackdowns of o reilly ever here s the full appearance  part  part  video featured image  youtube
