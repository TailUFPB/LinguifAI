paul ryan is learning quickly that john boehner had good reason to cry all the time  the speaker of the house of representatives is the leader of his or her party  the third most powerful person in the free world  speakers enjoy visibility and influence above and beyond any other representative in the chamber that s how it used to be  anyway  when the speaker was a position respected by their own party  from the days of tip o neil and tom foley to dennis hastert and even newt gingrich  the speaker of the house commanded respect unfortunately for republicans  their base began to die off and they needed to replenish  so they decided to go ahead and back the super zealots of the tea party  who have now morphed into the  freedom caucus   and things will never be the same  there have always been fringe right congressmen and women  michele bachmann wasn t the first complete moron to deny science on the house floor  but she was one of the first to be counted among dozens who have actually come together to mold the republican party platform into something even more conservative and stubborn than we re all used to they pushed john boehner right out of office and back to ohio  they held the seat hostage until they found someone they could agree would do as much damage as possible  they grudgingly allowed ryan to be elected  lest nancy pelosi steal the seat out from under the party  but promised that the honeymoon wouldn t last long so far it s been easy for ryan  everything coming down the pike has been party line and cut and dry  all of that will change when the budget process comes around again and the deal struck last year to pass the omnibus package has to stay glued together  the last thing ryan and the republicans want is for the democrats to be able to point at them and laugh  yet again  because they couldn t be bothered to put aside their internal differences and govern  to quote william wallace in braveheart   paul ryan said on wednesday morning   we have to unite the clans   it was the single sound bite he released to the press before a meeting of congressional conservatives  uniting the clans  as he is finding out  is going to take a lot more than condescending looks towards the president during state of the union addresses he was fresh out of a meeting just half a day earlier that the huffington post said  did not go well  with those freedom caucus members whose entire purpose in washington is to return the united states to  and force a do over  with the several states ruling themselves and the federal government being a non existent figure head good for dinners with world leaders and state funerals ryan probably expected a long run when he accepted the job as speaker  if he can t gain control of his own party  he may be looking for a new job sooner than later featured image by gage skidmore
