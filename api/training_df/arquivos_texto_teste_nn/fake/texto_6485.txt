it s no secret has built a national coalition of minority voters  in the democratic primary  black and hispanic voters came out and brought a sweep of the south for clinton  thus edging her closer and closer to the nomination it is this same minority population that might flip the southern state of georgia in the november general election  and could tilt the electoral college in favor of democrats for the first time since   before that  democrats won in  and   when jimmy carter was president a new poll from wsb  in georgia shows a surprising result  clinton and trump are tied   percent to  percent  with trump winning whites and men and clinton clinching women  african americans  and independents clinton is no fool  she knows perfectly well where she stands with georgia  while appearing on abc  the democratic frontrunner pointed out that the state s demographics are growing in the democrat s favor in the last decade  georgia s minority population has gone from      eighty one percent of the state s population growth has come from minorities  blacks and hispanics account for georgia s population growth  and those two groups of voters are why the clinton campaign seems to be gearing up to make a serious push to win georgia the only thing that could tip the scales in favor of clinton is independents  although she leads trump with them  percent to  percent   percent remain undecided if clinton can tap into the independent voters  and highlight just how crazy and destructive donald trump is  not only would georgia turn blue  other southern sates could follow and that s what clinton is aiming to do and i particularly want to support democrats in states that have been voting against democratic candidates for awhile now to rebuild the democratic party  we re going to try to make georgia competitive  and we re going to fight hard in north carolina and virginia and florida could there be a southern uprising in favor of clinton  as the frontrunner looks towards the general election  stops in ohio and appalachia may also turn other red leaning states blue if clinton keeps up her appeal to all  instead of just angry  white men   democrats could have a great year  georgia s latest poll is just one of more to come featured image via justin sullivan getty images
