roy moore s attorney just called political hack don lemon a funny name on air  the cnn host was not pleased with the attorney s quip of  don easy peasy lemon squeezy roy moore attorney calls cnn host  don easy peasy lemon squeezy    pic twitter com   josh caplan   joshdcaplan  november    character assassination of republican candidate roy moore continues  infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the facebook page of one of judge roy moore s accusers  debbie gibson  who came out in a washington post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place  years ago debbie wesson gibson says that she was  in the spring of  when moore spoke to her etowah high school civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney  she says that when he asked her out  she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a  year old man  gibson says her mother asked her who the man was  and when gibson said  roy moore   her mother said   i d say you were the luckiest girl in the world  among locals in gadsden  a town of about   back then  moore  had this godlike  almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good   gibson says   west point and so forth  gibson says that they dated for two to three months  and that he took her to his house  read her poetry and played his guitar  she says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club  looking back  i m glad nothing bad happened   says gibson  who now lives in florida   as a mother of daughters  i realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate  debbie gibson hates donald trump  but that s not all  she s pretty fond of judge roy moore s opponent  doug ross for us senate in alabama as well here are a few anti trump posts that were found on gibson s facebook page  one of senatorial candidate roy moore s accusers is apparently a fervent democrat who has worked for the dnc as a sign language interpreter for hillary clinton and joe biden  a revelation which the washington post never included in its original report the accuser  debbie gibson  had also publically supported moore s opponent doug jones before the accusations came to light gibson openly bragged about signing for hillary during a campaign appearance  on a side note  we re not sure who she s signing for  the crowd behind hillary  that is usually packed with the democrats hand picked  diverse  crowd  appears to be pretty thin here s a post from gibson s page proving that she s supporting judge roy moore s democrat opponent for us senate she even posted a video of moore s opponent  doug jones to promote him to her friends on facebook  the screenshot below shows the post on her page  interestingly  when attacking moore ally steve bannon for suggesting the washington post was politically motivated in its reporting  the newspaper implied that gibson wasn t  down with democratic propaganda   a statement which seemingly conflicts with gibson s political activism that s not what the photos say the washington post reported  according to campaign reports  none of the women has donated to or worked for moore s democratic opponent  doug jones  or his rivals in the republican primary but notice the precise wording  it s lawyer speak  it might very well be true that gibson didn t donate or work for doug jones  but according to her facebook profile  she did actively campaign for him  which doesn t help her credibility and it should have been reported   yet the washington post conveniently left it out
