at this point  pretty much everyone knows that failed vice presidential nominee sarah palin hates the media  she hates being called out  and she hates being asked questions she just doesn t know the answer to   which is pretty much every question  she clearly gets embarrassed  and instead of owning up to the fact that she just simply doesn t know an answer  she blames the press for depicting her as a moron  little does she know  she does that to herself however  people with narcissistic personality disorder seldom see the error in their own ways and will often shift blame  you can see this with donald trump and in his new   fan  sarah palin  they only see themselves as perfect and anyone who dares make them look otherwise is clearly just wrong case in point  palin  upon leaving iowa  met up with some lovely students at the des moines airport  she could have just left it there and said something nice  but instead she had to throw a jab at the press calling them  media jackals   she also openly admitted that she prefers being interviewed by these children over credentialed professional journalists palin wrote on facebook  as she does   willow and i find it nice to be stuck in des moines airport with great kids like this santa monica class that traveled to the iowa caucus on a field trip   preferable to some media jackals weather delayed in here  too  i asked a few of them to take lessons from these  graders   such polite students  asking the best questions about our political system  told them it was the best interview of the week          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt willow and i find it nice to be stuck in des moines airport with great kids like this santa monica class that traveled posted by sarah palin on tuesday  february    while some may say that going after her for this post is pretty petty  let s think about that for a second  palin has consistently gone after the  lamestream media  for asking her  gotcha questions  all the time   gotcha questions  of course being questions she has no clue how to answer and doesn t want to be perceived as an idiot  so she flips the script back on those posing the question it makes perfect sense that palin would want to be interviewed by a bunch of  graders  individuals that she may actually know more than   or at least they won t know when she s lying and making things up  even better that they won t call her out  so  if palin is going to make a point of telling the world that she prefers  graders over the  media jackals   well  she deserves to be called out on it  she hates the media  because the media holds her accountable featured image  flickr
