some political pundits have been unable to describe how donald trump manages to maintain his popularity  with his escalating hateful rhetoric  personal insults  and generally obnoxious behavior  many have settled their confusion by pretending there is no way he can win the republican primary  the problem with that is  all polls show he can rachel maddow uncovered what seems to be the secret to trump s success  it appears that he took his complete strategy for how to run a presidential campaign from  s racist alabama governor george wallace  this explains a lot about how trump s campaign of disgusting hate has been able to flourish so easily among regressive conservatives in america if you use a little imagination and think trump and muslims  instead of wallace and african americans  the parallels will suddenly become clear  like rachel said   close your eyes and just listen to the news reports from that election  it s almost like they re talking about donald trump  watch rachel s presentation comparing trump and george wallace below what rachel pointed out was incredibly significant  the comparisons are eerie and even if you were to take the direct comparisons of trump and wallace out of the picture  the supporters   who you couldn t possibly say were imitating each other intentionally   are virtually identical in the thoughts they convey about why they support their candidate rachel finished the segment by making a great point  donald trump has something that republican voters like  they liked it the last time that he offered it to them for a short period of time   she said   and now they like it this time  as well   it s the same type of significant popularity  it just hasn t gone away this time around because he hasn t stopped running this time around like he did in   she s right  trump offered up the same fare in the  presidential campaign and got a huge amount of support from it  if he had chosen to invest himself fully the last time around  he could have taken the nomination from romney  who was universally panned by the republican establishment right up until he was their only choice the question now is  what will happen when trump ends up on the ballot  a couple years after wallace was officially in an election  he was shot  could trump s hate speech eventually become that kind of liability featured image via youtube
