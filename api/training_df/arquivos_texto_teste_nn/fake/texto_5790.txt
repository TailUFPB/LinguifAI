if there s one thing most progressives   both bernie and hillary supporters   agree on  it s that citizens united needs to go  in fact  most americans   nearly  percent   agree that citizens united needs to go  you d think that would be all congress needs to propel them to do the right thing  but unfortunately  thanks to the very supreme court decision everyone hates  congress won t do anything about it  there s too much money involved  the states  though   that s another matter  five have already voted to reverse the decision and you can bet that more are coming soon this year  over a billion dollars will be spent electing just the president  millions will be spent on down ticket candidates  much of this money is coming from pacs and super pacs  with donations from corporations and billionaires  the money goes right into the coffers of candidates  who in turn give the money to media outlets who inundate us with ads  everyone wins except the american people  neither the media nor the politicians complain  mostly because they don t want to bite the hands that feed them  so  it s up to grass roots movements  and the grass roots will win out the cliche is that the way to fight fire is with fire  that s what an organization called wolfpac is doing  they have opened a pac that is designed to get rid of pacs and super pacs  here s what they want to do to restore true  representative democracy in the united states by pressuring our state legislators to pass a much needed free and fair elections amendment to our constitution  there are only  ways to amend our constitution     go through congress  single digit approval rating  or    go through our state legislators via an amendment proposing convention wolf pac believes that we can no longer count on our federal government to do what is in the best interest of the american people due to the unfettered amount of money they receive from outside organizations to fund their campaigns  we point to the failure of the disclose act as rock solid evidence that this would be a total waste of our time  effort  and money  we also point to the recent decision by the us supreme court to not even hear a case filed by montana claiming it did not have to abide by citizens united  as proof that state legislation is not a sufficient measure to solve this problem  we believe that we have no choice but to put an amendment in the hands of our state legislators  who are not  at this moment in time  completely blinded by the influence of money  and might actually do what   of the country wants   take away the massive influence that money has over our political process the list of states that have jumped on board is hardly surprising  it started with vermont  the one state brave enough to elect a democratic socialist as a senator  in   vermont passed a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment saying that only people are people and that corporations are just made up entities  then came california  the largest state in the country  then came new jersey and illinois the latest to join the call for a constitutional amendment if rhode island  in a unanimous vote  the state of rhode island became the fifth to take matters into their own hands here s the video and more from the young turks sure  this is a drop in the bucket  a constitutional amendment needs to be ratified by  states and there aren t  blue states in the country  but that might not matter  people are sick of our elections being purchased by the highest bidder  people are sick of billionaires having a much larger voice in our democracy than anyone else  people are sick of the constant barrage of political advertising  the only people to lose out of turning corporations back into non people are corporations and the politicians whose pockets are being lined featured image via alex wong with getty images
