it s not just white american men who fight and die for this country  women  muslims  and hispanics have as well and this military veteran wants donald trump to know it during a protest against the republican nominee in new york  u s  army veteran perry o brien declared that he proudly put on the uniform and defended the nation against terrorists in afghanistan alongside women  muslim  and hispanic soldiers who also wore the uniform donning the red  white  and blue american flag patch  when i served in afghanistan i served with women  i served with muslims  and i served with latinos   all groups that donald trump has maligned or even threatened   o brien said   all of those folks actually donned the uniform  they actually served the country  as far as we can see as veterans in the military community  donald trump only seems interested in serving himself  indeed  donald trump has never fought for this country  in fact  he repeatedly dodged the draft during the vietnam war through a series of deferments  and even though he was too cowardly to serve his country during wartime  trump has repeatedly disrespected vietnam war veterans ever since in   trump infamously referred to his sleeping around with various women his  personal vietnam  because he didn t get an std  i ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world  it is a dangerous world out there  it s scary  like vietnam  sort of like the vietnam era   trump said   it is my personal vietnam  i feel like a great and very brave soldier  and last year  trump insulted senator john mccain by questioning his war hero status because he was captured by the enemy and tortured relentlessly to the point where mccain can no longer lift his arms over his head   he s not a war hero   trump claimed   he s a war hero because he was captured  i like people that weren t captured  ok  trump has also repeatedly insulted women  referred to mexicans as rapists  and called for banning muslims from the country from the first day of his campaign so it s no wonder why veterans like perry o brien are pissed off about the possibility of trump becoming commander in chief o brien even slammed trump for not donating money to veterans organizations before running for president because it looks like he is only doing it to improve his image right now  i think we all believe in the veterans community that it would be fantastic if trump had decided he was interested in donating any of his vast wealth   which he loves to talk about so much   to veterans organizations in any substantive way before he decided he wanted to be the next commander in chief  here s the video via youtube a trump presidency also makes it more likely that more american soldiers will come home as wounded vets or in flag draped caskets since ole small hands himself has suggested the possibility of waging nuclear war along with waging wars against other nations that would definitely require ground troops donald trump is not the presidential candidate our veterans deserve  they need a president who will do everything possible to avoid war and they need a president who will make sure they and their families are well taken care of if war is necessary featured image via screenshot
