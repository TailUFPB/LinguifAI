when you re a salesperson  you try your best to identify the need of the customer to convince them to buy what you re selling  and in the case of republican presidential frontrunner donald trump  he knows the republican base has a  need  for someone who claims to be  christian   this was apparent at the last gop debate when rev  senator marco rubio kept bringing up jesus christ time and time again  when sen  ted cruz seems to claim to be the chosen one  and now when donald trump brings out his childhood bible to prove how  christian  he really  truly is you see  there is no religious test in order to be president of the united states  in fact  it would be unconstitutional if it were to be required of candidates to prove their faith or deem themselves worthy of being elected  however  republicans aren t known for following the constitution  as much as they like to say they do  so we end up seeing things like this pathetic display to pander to evangelical christians who are apparently so dimwitted that they can t see straight through the farce evangelicals  he s selling you a line  that s what salespeople do so you buy into whatever it is they re selling  and in regards to who would be the best candidate for the job of president  if they have to tell you how much they  love jesus  to make up for the fact that they have zero policy experience  realize you re being duped  please         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt christian valuesi want to thank evangelical christians for the warm embrace i ve received on the campaign trail  i will not let you down   makeamericagreatagainposted by donald j  trump on saturday  january    featured image  facebook
