after the release of nude pictures  that might have been meant as a distraction from trump s disastrous two weeks beginning with the democratic national convention  it s been revealed that melania trump may have been modeling without proper documentation  in other words  she  gasp  may have been an illegal immigrant  now  it appears as there have been more very strange things happening with melania s immigration status  she might have married another american just four years before becoming mrs  trump the story was broken by univision  proving that taking away reporter access can backfire on a candidate  they claim that an immigration attorney who worked for the trump organization said melania obtained a green card  based on marriage  in   that was four years before she married trump but  michael wildes  an immigration attorney who worked for the trump organization  told univision s investigative unit that she obtained a green card four years earlier in    based on marriage  melania and donald trump were not married until jan     at bethesda by the sea episcopal church in palm beach  florida wildes asked the trump campaign for more  and so far  crickets when asked to explain the marriage discrepancy  wildes said he would seek clarification  presumably from the trump organization  he later sent an email saying  i didn t hear back  sorry  wildes is someone who should know  he was the immigration attorney for trump s models and for the miss universe pageant when it was run by trump  according to univision  he s not a defector from trump  in fact  he was authorized by the trump campaign to speak on their behalf still  wildes says there are some things he can t discuss because of privacy issues the clinton campaign  officially  anyway  is refusing to make anything of this story  one former federal prosecutor  who is a hillary supporter said that it s all  moot and ridiculous  here s the video the clinton supporter is essentially right  but it does point to complete hypocrisy from the trump campaign  trump doesn t care about immigration issues  he never has  trump almost prefers to hire immigrants over americans  and well  his marriage history proves that he prefers his wives come from elsewhere  i m sure democrats would be happy to drop the issue if  in exchange  we received a little intellectual honesty from the trump campaign  instead  trump will continue bashing immigrants  and even people born in america to immigrant parents  while going home at night to a woman who very well might be one of the  illegal immigrants  trump and his supporters love to rant about
