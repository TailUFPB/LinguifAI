in his final  white house correspondence dinner  a sharp tongued president obama unleashed a scathing but hilarious barrage of humor on republican presidential hopeful donald trump and pretty much everyone who had ties to the gop  the president drew many laughs in front of journalists  celebrities  and politicians  both democrats and republicans  however  one person wasn t there  donald trump  the president said of trump s absence i m a little hurt that he s not here tonight  we had so much fun the last time  and it is surprising  you got a room full of reporters  celebrities  cameras  and he says no  is this dinner too tacky for the donald  what could he possibly be doing instead  is he at home eating a trump steak  tweeting out insults to angela merkel  what s he doing the president also had lots of fun with how the republicans have reacted to the fact that donald trump is their most likely nominee  the president said the republican establishment is incredulous that he s their most likely nominee  incredulous  shocking  they say donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president  but in fairness  he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world  miss sweden  miss argentina  miss azerbaijan  and there s one area where donald s experience could be invaluable  and that s closing guantanamo  because trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground the president also took a shot at the media for their lopsided coverage of trump s campaign which often times has been absurd in term of the amount of free press he s received  the president told the audience full of reporters and journalists   i hope you re all proud of yourselves  let s hope that when all is said and done  the ascendancy of donald trump doesn t go beyond november and we can all breath a sigh of relief when we no longer see trump s face plastered all over the media watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
