tuesday night  after president obama gave his final state of the union address  governor nikki haley  r sc  delivered the republican rebuttal  during her speech  though  she accidentally supported the democratic party s syrian refugee policy while trying to exploit the charleston massacre to take political shots at donald trump after she was finished calling president obama a failure  governor haley turned her attention to our immigration problem and the syrian refugee crisis  saying  at the same time  that does not mean we just flat out open our borders  we can t do that  we cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally  and in this age of terrorism  we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined  that line about refugees is one republicans often say to justify their refusal to help the desperate families fleeing from unthinkable violence in syria  while this comment was not surprising  later on she said something that sounded an awful lot like a contradiction towards the middle of her speech  governor haley spoke about the mother emanuel massacre that took the lives of nine black churchgoers when a white supremacist decided that he wanted to start a race war  she said  this past summer  south carolina was dealt a tragic blow  on an otherwise ordinary wednesday evening in june  at the historic mother emanuel church in charleston  twelve faithful men and women  young and old  went to bible study  that night  someone new joined them  he didn t look like them  didn t act like them  didn t sound like them  they didn t throw him out  they didn t call the police  instead  they pulled up a chair and prayed with him  for an hour  she went on to take a not so subtle shot at donald trump  we didn t turn against each other s race or religion  we turned toward god  and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world  so  while trying to exploit the charleston massacre and taking shots at trump  she accidentally supported obama s policies  she said even though dylann roof did not look like the mother emanuel churchgoers  they embraced him because those are real american  values   haley is absolutely right  that is what our country is all about the united states was built on the intrinsic belief that we are a free nation that welcomes everyone   especially the desperate  downtrodden souls of other nations  we are also a nation the does not let the fear of  others  overcome us and scare us into not helping people  obviously  by this statement  she understands that the syrian refugees perfectly fit this description and we should open our arms just like the beautiful victims of the charleston did  i m sure that if you ask her if she meant her comments in this way  she ll say  no  and that is what makes them so great thanks for the support  governor haley  obama appreciates it watch her rebuttal below featured image via video screenshot
