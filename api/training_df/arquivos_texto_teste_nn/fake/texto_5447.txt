foreign nationals  including lawmakers and other political types  cannot legally donate to or influence u s  elections  however  the donald trump campaign  even after they have been called out on this unlawful activity  continues to send fundraising emails to foreign leaders msn reports foreign members of parliament from the united kingdom and australia confirmed to the hill that they received fundraising solicitations from the trump campaign as recently as july   two weeks after a widely publicized fec complaint issued on june  by non partisan watchdogs democracy  and the campaign legal center australian progressive mp terri butler spoke with reporters from the hill via telephone  and says that the emails she received were unsolicited spam from team trump   i haven t signed up for any trump lists   she said united kingdom house of commons mp bob blackmon has also received these solicitations to his official government email address  he says that they were unsolicited spam as well  i did not sign up  these are sent unsolicited  yet another foreign mp  uk member peter bottomley  says he reached out to the trump family for an explanation for the spam  he said  neither  sons nor anyone else has answered my questions about how they acquired my email nor why they were asking for financial support that i suppose to be illegal for  to accept  democracy  president fred wertheimer  who watches out for campaign finance violations  says of trump s activities  this is kind of absurd  i don t know of anyone else in this situation who would just go on keeping on soliciting money from foreign interests  i think the fact circumstances here are unprecedented if they are put on notice that their fundraising solicitations of potential foreign donors are illegal and they keep doing it  then you potentially have knowing and willful violations of the law which moves this from civil violations to criminal violations it s open and shut that federal candidates can t solicit contributions from foreign donors  there s kind of an arrogance about this  it s trump  so of course he s being arrogant  he s the man who literally said he could shoot someone in the middle of fifth avenue and people would still vote for him  he seriously believes he can do no wrong  and that apparently also includes flagrantly breaking the law in an effort to raise money for his pathetic  broke campaign larry noble  an attorney for the campaign legal center  described the trump camp s illegal activities as  really outrageous   and continued  it is a serious violation of federal law to solicit political contributions from foreign nationals there is no reason this should be happening  while u s  citizens do live abroad  they usually don t have foreign government email addresses or are members of parliament  so they can t try to explain this by saying they thought they were soliciting u s  citizens abroad if the trump campaign has continued to solicit foreign nationals after the matter first came to light in june  this looks like either gross incompetence  gross negligence or willful conduct  exactly right  this is either incompetence or willful and knowing violation of federal law  either way  everyone involved in this needs to be investigated and charged  trump needs to learn that no  he isn t above the law  even if his ridiculous supporters seem to think he can do no wrong featured image via john sommers ii getty images
