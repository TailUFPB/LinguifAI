anti terrorist views my friend ali yazdanshenas has passed away yesterday after being beaten to death by the basij militia of iran for his anti terrorist views  pic twitter com   imam tawhidi   imamofpeace  october     there is a barrier preventing australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric  and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative  instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion  tawhidi demands modification  rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community  the imam has called for immediate action  encouraging a ban on islamic schools and islamist organizations like hizb ut tahrir  through this  tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than ayaan hirsi ali   perhaps the most famous anti islamist  and islamic  activist in the world   who has suggested that tawhidi should be  elevated  to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders tawhidi is  therefore  one of those rare public figures  a reformer who not only denounces elements of islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations  however  in the current global environment  the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger  the threat of violence is so present that tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life   the spectator one might believe that a courageous person like imam tawhidi would be a valuable ally to america in their efforts to defeat radical islam in the united states   based on the imam

 i was willing to point out serious cases  ignored   imam tawhidi   imamofpeace  october    tawhidi explained that he s not some crackpot imam trying to get attention  he actually holds a certificate in counter terrorism not only am i a muslim imam who understands the threat of islamic extremism  i also hold a certificate in counter terrorism  now what    imam tawhidi   imamofpeace  october    really blasted deblasio and all of the wasted energy he expends on trying to bring down president trump and not islamic extremists fact  in the last two years  de blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down president trump and not islamic extremists  imam tawhidi   imamofpeace  october    tawhidi went on to slam the mayor deblasio of nyc and mayor sadiq kahn of london who offered nyc his condolences after the terror attack london stands in grief and solidarity with the great city of new york tonight  pic twitter com ojrxsdnzos  sadiq khan   sadiqkhan  october    is tawhidi s reply de blasio griefs about london and you grief about nyc  how about you both swap positions since you don t really care about your own people   https   t co   imam tawhidi   imamofpeace  october      it was during this overseas study  in   that tawhidi saw it as his duty to speak out against the questionable elements enshrined in his religion  on a sunny day in the iraqi city of karbala  tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when  within earshot  a bomb exploded  as crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors  the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that islamic state forces had invaded mosul  if ever there was a time to speak out against islamist terrorism  it was then however  tawhidi s campaigning has attracted many critics within the islamic community itself  calling for the closure of islamic schools is bound to court controversy  but it is his contention that islamic teachings are the causal link to islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders  following the manchester bombing  tawhidi appeared in a fiery tv exchange with dr  jamal rifi  imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the islamic holy scripture  teach es  the beheading of people  perhaps tawhidi is just the kind of person america  and the know it all liberals in european nations  who are being overrun by islamic extremists posing as immigrants  need to be listening to  and perhaps next time  they might want to consider taking his warnings seriously
