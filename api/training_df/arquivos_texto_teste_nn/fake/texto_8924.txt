apparently the only thing the national rifle association and the white house can agree on is that president obama would smoke them in a debate on gun control cnn extended an invitation to the nra  the nation s most powerful gun lobby  to join obama during a live town hall on thursday evening in virginia to discuss the issue of gun violence  they gracelessly declined nra spokesman andrew arulanandam seemed willing to assume the nra would come out of the debate looking very badly  he claimed the white house would rig the event and turn it into a  public relations spectacle  in other words  the nra believes it would lose and arulanandam is desperate to think of a good excuse as to why that is undermining this excuse  however  is the fact that it is cnn  not obama  that is organizing the event a cnn spokesperson said that it was the network  not the white house  that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns  and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the second amendment including nra members as well as groups that back gun regulation the only ones too afraid to show up to this mixed crowd are nra representatives and while it s laughable that the nra already threw in the towel before the debate even began  they are justified in being worried about what they would face if they were brave enough to show up  as obama proved numerous times during his two presidential elections  he s a formidable debate opponent  it is also clear that the issue of gun control is an area that obama is fired up about  for years  republicans in washington and their pro gun benefactors have stymied any and all attempts to address mass shootings  entering his last year in office  obama is done playing games  earlier this week  he gave an emotional and powerful speech about the need for better gun control   and what he plans to do about it  each time this comes up  we are fed the excuse that common sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre  or the one before that  or the one before that  so why bother trying   obama said   i reject that thinking  we know we can t stop every act of violence  every act of evil in the world  but maybe we could try to stop one act of evil  one act of violence   he added the nra seems content to fight against any conceivable campaign to stop needless gun violence  this includes floating reckless lies that obama is a tyrant seizing people s guns  on social media  the lobbying group regularly promotes misinformation to its gullible followers  they aren t used to being called out on it now that it is time to actually face obama  it s no wonder they can t do it feature image via gage skidmore flickr
