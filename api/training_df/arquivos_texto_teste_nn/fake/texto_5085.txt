this truth doesn t hurt donald trump  it amuses him that s probably why he flashed a smile after a heckler at a kissimmee  florida campaign rally on thursday called the republican nominee  putin s b tch  over his ties to russian oligarchs trump paused during his speech after someone in the audience drew his attention and yelled  you love russia  you re putin s b tch   before being escorted out of the building by security as trump said  goodbye  to the unidentified man several times a few seconds later trump asked   where the hell did he come from  here s the video via youtube i don t know where the heckler came from but i know why he called trump  putin s b tch  donald trump has borrowed a lot of money from his russian business pals and they just so happen to be close with russian president vladamir putin  so  let s just say trump owes them and if he can t pay them back with money  becoming president would give him the power to pay them back in other ways  you know  like lifting sanctions placed on the russians after they attacked ukraine  like trump advisor carter page suggested earlier this year  or weakening nato so that russia can continue their aggressive stance  or softening the republican party s condemnation of russia s attack on ukraine which trump actually fought to make part of the gop platform in short  trump would essentially be putin s puppet  and it s not like russia and putin have not been enthusiastic about this prospect seeing as how putin directed state media to tout trump s campaign and russian hackers broke into the dnc in what amounts to a cyber watergate in an effort to hurt democrats by giving trump fodder to use to attack democrats so the heckler at trump s rally was absolutely right to call him  putin s b tch   and trump could only smirk because deep down he knows it s true featured image  screenshot
