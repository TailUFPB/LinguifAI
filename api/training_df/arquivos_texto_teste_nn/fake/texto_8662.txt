during the state of the union address  president obama made the remark that our enemies aren t getting stronger  if you listened carefully  you could hear the grunts and groans from the republican side of the aisle  where doom and gloom aren t just political talking points  they re a way of life the president  briefed daily on the status of the islamic state  knows better than anyone exactly where the enemy stands  yet republicans still try to sell fear of a domestic attack by people half a world away like it s as certain as the sunrise  as it turns out  even fox news is better informed than the people it stumps for  reporting monday that isis announced it had to cut salaries for its terrorists by half in a sign the islamic state terror group could be pressed for cash  a new report claims its leaders slashed the salaries of all its fighters in half the  treasury ministry  of isis blamed  exceptional circumstances  the jerusalem post reported they also reported that the pay cuts were announced well before a massive money stash in mosul  iraq was announced  meaning not only were obama s tactics working  he managed to follow up with a crushing blow to the treasury as well isis says regardless of the pay cuts  fighters are still responsible for their taxes  the lunatics have decided to not only twist the koran into something that allows for indiscriminate killing and world domination  but as a way to keep more of the money they owe the jihadists they ve brainwashed it s clear that the president was right to call out the political hot air of the republicans in his most watched sotu speech to date  as the rhetoric they spread defocuses the country from domestic issues in desperate need of more attention  fox  while reporting the truth in this case for some reason  felt it necessary to include an older video with the article about how strong isis has gotten and how impressive their weapons are screen capture from foxnews comit doesn t matter what the propagandists at fox news  the republican party or even isis have to say about what s going on in syria  the fact is  the jv team the president spoke of was underrated at first  but are now showing their inexperience and lack of playing time  on top of being shunned by the majority of the muslim world  they re being pushed back geographically and decimated financially that doesn t matter to the right  fear begets votes featured image via wikipedia
