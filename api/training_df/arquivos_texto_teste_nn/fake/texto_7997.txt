there have been plenty of accusations made against president obama before and during his presidency  birthers  led by donald trump  have for years  accused the president of being foreign born  he s even been  accused  of being a muslim  as if being a muslim is somehow indicative of being something bad  now  a gop politician has come out with another accusation  that president obama has a soft spot for homosexuals because he was once a gay prostitute  mary lou bruner  a retired teacher and a republican candidate for the texas state board of education said  that s how he paid for his drugs  he has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals  but he hasn t come out of the closet about his own homosexual bisexual background  what is her evidence  well  as is the case with republicans when they make terrible accusations  they usually have no evidence but they simply play on the fears of people  what s especially troubling about this case is that bruner s a serious contender for the  member education body which already has a vein of lunacy  this is the same body that enacted  curriculum guidelines requiring students to learn about confederate heroes  and required teachers to explain the equivalency of abraham lincoln s and jefferson davis s inaugural addresses  as well as the ways international institutions such as the united nations threaten u s  sovereignty  bruner fits right in with the lunacy and she should be perfect  in the past  she s made other interesting accusations  she s claimed that  evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of atheism   she also said that scientists have hidden hard evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time despite these crazy accusations and far fetched theories  bruner is not an anomaly  she has become a standard bearer of the republican party  featured image from wikimedia commons
