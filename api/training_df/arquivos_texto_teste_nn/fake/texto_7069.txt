much like the republican front runner himself  donald trump s supporters also have a tendency to invoke violence any chance they get  as we ve seen proven time after time on tuesday  ohio pastor and trump fan darrell scott went on cnn to discuss trump s plan for the u s  border wall  and in no time caused the segment to completely derail  in speaking to fellow panelists ben ferguson and margaret hoover  scott started by giving an absurd example of how trump would force mexico to pay for the wall  even though mexico s president has flat out refused and basically told trump to f ck off   scott said  mexico is going to pay directly  or mexico is going to pay indirectly  it reminds me of a friend that i had years ago  ok  let me say this for the record  he said   you re going to give me my money or i m going to break your legs and you re going to give me my money   mexico will pay for the wall or trump will break them down  ferguson was quick to point out just how ridiculous scott s example was as he fired back  we re not  years old  this is not your lunch money  scott completely missed the valid point and continued on  i m tired of that  year old stuff  they re gonna pay it directly  or they re gonna pay it indirectly  and putting a tax on western union transfers is not unreasonable  these comments came just shortly after trump s campaign stated that if the business mogul wins the election  the candidate would ban money transfers from the united states into mexico unless mexico contributed    billion for his precious wall scott and ferguson got into a heated back and forth  and ferguson told the ignorant pastor  you have no idea what you re talking about  you can watch the chaotic segment below  in which all the panelists get themselves all worked up over trump  featured image via screenshot
