hillary clinton delivered an amazing speech on thursday night and the dnc convention was a unifying success  so of course donald trump threw a temper tantrum about it  our country s motto is e pluribus unum  out of many  we are one  will we stay true to that motto   the former secretary of state asked americans before going after donald trump s agenda of fear and division  well  we heard donald trump s answer last week at his convention  he wants to divide us   from the rest of the world  and from each other he s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise  he s taken the republican party a long way  from  morning in america  to  midnight in america   he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well  a great democratic president  franklin delano roosevelt  came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than eighty years ago  during a much more perilous time   the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  hillary went on to slam trump for claiming that he alone can fix america and blasted him for claiming that he will put america first  which led to one of the best passages of the night  he also talks a big game about putting america first  please explain to me what part of america first leads him to make trump ties in china  not colorado  trump suits in mexico  not michigan  trump furniture in turkey  not ohio  trump picture frames in india  not wisconsin donald trump says he wants to make america great again   well  he could start by actually making things in america again  the democratic nominee also questioned trump s temperament to be president  which also led to one of the best lines of the night  he loses his cool at the slightest provocation  when he s gotten a tough question from a reporter  when he s challenged in a debate  when he sees a protestor at a rally  imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons  indeed  and trump not only lost his cool during clinton s speech  he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone  including the media  michael bloomberg  and general john allen  but he began his temper tantrum on thursday night by whining about hillary not saying certain magic words that trump believes will defeat isis hillary s refusal to mention radical islam  as she pushes a   increase in refugees  is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    then he threw a broader tantrum hillary will never reform wall street  she is owned by wall street   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    hillary s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power  no jobs  no safety   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    s wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction  terrorism and isis across the world   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    should be pointed out that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were not  hillary s wars   they were george w  bush s wars  no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton   corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    trump picked up where he left off and continued his hissy fit the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke   cnn and the little watched  morningjoe   sad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me  and  forgot  to mention the many problems of our country  in her very average scream   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     anncoulter   i believe in science  dem code for  we re shutting down coal mines  steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    crooked hillary clinton mentioned me  times in her very long and very boring speech  many of her statements were lies and fabrications   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    john allen  who i never met but spoke against me last night  failed badly in his fight against isis  his record   bad  neverhillary  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     little  michael bloomberg  who never had the guts to run for president  knows nothing about me  his last term as mayor was a disaster   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    michael bloomberg ran again for mayor of new york  he wouldn t get   of the vote   they would run him out of town   neverhillary  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    crooked hillary said that i  couldn t handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign   really i just beat  people and am beating her   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     this is who the republican party actually thinks is qualified to be the leader of the free world  how will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him  and keep in mind that trump only has twitter to attack people with  as president  he would have the military  drones  and nuclear weapons at his disposal  how can anyone feel safe with trump as president when he has such a thin skin that he could start a war at any time just because another nation insulted him featured image  christopher furlong getty images
