the new york times has done a major new study on the effects of the affordable care act   aka obamacare   on the lives of americans  the times analyzed what happened in the first full year of the implementation of obamacare between  and   and the results are mind blowing in how they ve fundamentally altered the lives of some of the most vulnerable americans for the better the first full year of the affordable care act brought historic increases in coverage for low wage workers and others who have long been left out of the health care system  a new york times analysis has found remember  obamacare passed without a single republican vote in the house or senate  and has survived two supreme court challenges and other court challenges made up by the obstructionist right  the last republican presidential nominee ran on a platform of repealing it  and so has every gop presidential candidate running this year obamacare has also survived dozens of republican votes to repeal it  while six years later the gop has still not offered a plan to replace it after the passage of obamacare  the amount of people insured in every slice of america went up in a major way  between  and   this is how much those increases were  as a percentage for decades the gap between the wealthy and poor on access to health care has been steadily growing wider and wider  but after the passage of obamacare  that gap has stopped growing  it s the one area where inequality has actually been halted in its tracks nevertheless  the times s analysis shows that by the end of that first full year    so many low income people gained coverage that it halted the decades long expansion of the gap between the haves and the have nots in the american health insurance system  a striking change at a time when disparities between rich and poor are growing in many areas here s an infographic from the times illustrating this amazing moment in american health care  policies like obamacare are just abstract ideas until they are implemented  but now we have one concrete example of what happens in just one city thanks to obamacare  the st  john s well child and family center in south los angeles explained that   new patients were enrolled thanks to the new law   mostly black and latino people who didn t have insurance before  the clinic has reported a   increase in cervical cancer screenings    increase in tobacco cessastion therapy  and a   increase in the share of patients who now have their hypertension under control that s in one clinic in one city all of these improvements have happened even though republicans have refused to expand medicaid in many of their states  even with assistance in the form of federal dollars  that s why the law has helped far fewer blacks than it could have because blacks  especially in the south  tend to live in gop dominated states like georgia  alabama  mississippi imagine if instead of stubbornly refusing to help obama  those red states bought in and brought the kind of health care revolution being felt in that los angeles clinic to hundreds of thousands more people featured image via flickr
