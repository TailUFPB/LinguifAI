donald trump has attracted all sorts of fringe individuals and organizations as of late  he s attracted the most extreme elements of the republican party  and even the ku klux klan is on board with his demonization of minorities and women  now  trump s extremist fan base has gone international with an endorsement from  golden dawn members  a far right neo nazi party in greece which has a presence in the greek parliament  in the new video  trump is praised as a man who  doesn t fear to speak the truth  watch video here ilias panagiotaros is a leading member of the party and he s on board with trump s policies  penagitaros has praised hitler for having a  great personality   panagiotaros  along with golden dawn  has been linked to multiple offenses like murder  aggravated assault  trafficking  kidnapping  money laundering and extortion by the greek government of particular excitement to panagiotaros is when trump infamously used a mussolini quote to describe himself and then defended himself from the outrage  saying   what difference does it make if it was mussolini or somebody else   trump said   it s a very good quote  as a result of the greek economic collapse and the syrian refugee crisis  golden dawn  which has an anti capitalist platform and is anti immigration  has gained more of a following  thus  it should be of no surprise that donald trump has some racist fans in the international arena since his platform of denying muslims entry into the us and building a wall to keep mexicans out are comparable to that of this organization the hope is that donald trump  along with the creepy ted cruz  who is likely even more racist than trump with his personal brand of xenophobia  will never get to the presidency because if one of these men do  this country and its people are in deep trouble  featured image via video screenshot
