the things that republican presidential nominee donald trump says and does seem completely indefensible  but abc news anchor david muir somehow found a reason to protect trump for one of his most horrific qualities  his blatantly obvious racism  and unfortunately for him  he did it in front of the wrong person on wednesday night  muir interviewed massachusetts senator elizabeth warren at the democratic national convention to talk about her ongoing feud with the brash republican nominee  in asking warren about trump s latest attack on her in which he  once again  called her  pocahontas   muir basically baited the iconic liberal into calling trump a racist and then criticized her for telling the truth when she did when muir asked warren if trump calling her  pocahontas  was racist  warren had responded  donald trump has proven that he is a thin skinned racist muir scolded her and said   but is that calling him a name  too   it was the wrong thing to say to warren  because she fired back with pure logic and gave him the education that he so desperately needed  she said  no  it fits the facts  come on  then she provided  off the top of her head  a list of some of trump s greatest  most racist hits  look at what he has said about mexicans  look what he has said about muslims  look what he says over and over  as a matter of fact  you don t have to quote me on this  when he had rulings against him over trump university he tried to attack the judge on the basis of his mexican american heritage  muir should really be thanking warren for helping him put a childish nickname and an actual prejudice and human rights offense into perspective  there is no defending trump for all of the disrespectful things he has said about minorities  and we all need to be better educated in calling his bigot remarks out instead of brushing them off  or worse yet  likening them to smaller offenses you can watch warren school muir in the clip below featured image via screen capture
