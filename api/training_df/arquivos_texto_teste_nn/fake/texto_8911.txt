the black residents of dothan  alabama are  quite literally  living in fear   and with good reason  their police chief  steven parrish  is an open member of a neo  confederate organization by the name of the sons of confederate veterans  even worse is the fact that officials in dothan are fully behind parrish keeping his job as police chief  despite his ties to a clearly racist organization during a tuesday government meeting  dothan mayor schmitz allowed just one person in support of parrish and one against him to speak  paul carroll  one of dothan s black residents  said to the meeting  this would never happen to the jewish community  you would never see someone who s a neo nazi being made chief of police  but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo confederate  carroll also said to local paper the dothan eagle  we are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections  i don t  feel safe   sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority  and carroll has good reason to feel that way  as parrish openly says he is a sons of confederate veterans  commander   so  it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization  but he has to be a commander  it is also believed  but not proven  that parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force another of the city s black residents  ruth nelson  says of parrish s reign as chief  this is a nightmare  and when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this  they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth  resident kevin saffold alluded to the idea that the city of dothan would soon be in an uproar if the parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction  if you don t want this to be another ferguson  if you don t want civil unrest  if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative  then you should do something about that  i believe in the court system and i believe in justice   i don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field  all of these residents are right  and they have every right to be outraged and afraid  after all  there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist pos featured image via screen capture from raw story
