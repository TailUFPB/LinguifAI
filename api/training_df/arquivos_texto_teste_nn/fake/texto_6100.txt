ann coulter  throughout her seemingly long career  has managed to offend just above every group that is not white  male or christian  or american   although the last one is arguable  she hates african americans  muslims  women  hispanics  latinos  jews  catholics  immigrants  atheists  scientists  veterans  the lgbt community  and just about everyone else  but the other day  coulter managed to offend another group of americans  asians appearing on msnbc s hardball with chris matthews with joy ann reid  the self described  mean spirited  bigoted conservative  struck again when she referred to asian americans supporting donald trump as  mandarins   and in true coulter fashion  she insisted that it was the correct term even after being told that is was in fact not here s how the exchange went ann   you have mandarin chinese people with signs for trump   make america great again   written in mandarin   whether they are hispanic or mandarin  the ones inside the stadium are americans and think of themselves as americans and want the laws enforced    as i said before they have mandarins in the audience and hispanics in the audience  joy   what does mandarin mean  you mean asian american  they re called asian americans  ann  not mandarins  ann  it has nothing to do with demographics  joy  it s throwback language  it s not   they are called asian americans  ann  anyways  as i was saying  it has nothing to do with demographics  it has to do with if you re here legally or illegally  whether you consider yourself american  whether the laws on the books are going to be enforced  we have an invasion of people who are   joy  if your default when discussing asian americans is to call them mandarins  we are not bringing back archaic language here  ann   just talk about people as americans   asian americans  ann  no  you are not going to police my language  they are mandarins  it is written in mandarin  and there it is   the big bad liberal is policing the poor  innocent conservative like a big old bully  those damn liberals  not wanting to be grossly offensive and racist  how dare they now some people may not wholly object to this term  but for starters  it s always important to remember that not all asians are  mandarins   also known as chinese  when one blanket terms an entire race of people  they dismissing the importance of other cultures  ethnicities  and people of different origin  which is in itself racist  coulter chose to brush off the importance of these people just because they are asian  not white   by referring to them with a slur second  the term mandarin was used to describe the public officials of china s imperial government  a government that has not been in place since   so coulter referring to these supposed trump supporters as  mandarins  shows just how stupid she really is  and that she really doesn t care about non white people or their history but then again  do any trump supporters watch ann make a fool of herself  yet again  featured image via stephen lovekin getty images
