the polls are not looking good for donald trump   and he s the king of polls  hillary clinton leads him in arizona  kansas and georgia and florida  ties him in texas and north carolina  and is now leading him nationally in a new blowout poll according to a new reuters ipsos poll  clinton leads donald trump by a staggering  points the june   poll showed that   percent of likely american voters supported clinton while   percent supported trump  another   percent said they would support neither candidate trump had enjoyed a brief boost in support following the june  mass shooting in orlando  florida  as he doubled down on his pledge to ban muslims from entering the country  cutting clinton s lead to nine points clinton s   percentage point lead is about the same as she had before the orlando attack so after exploiting a national tragedy to his advantage  trump managed to botch even that and now clinton has settled back into being the obvious frontrunner for the presidency  one of the reasons trump has now slumped in the polls is that confidence in his campaign is falling  in contrast to clinton s well oiled money machine campaign  trump s reportings of an almost broke campaign has left a bitter taste in voters  mouths and it would also appear trump s hackneyed racism and islamophobia is getting boring with voters  unlike his heightened popularity in the wake of san bernardino  trump s numbers declined after doubling down to ban muslims from entering the country and these feelings are all across the country  the poll measured   respondents from all  states but another telling number from the poll is that  percent of the american public said they will not be backing either candidate he s broke  he s fired his campaign manager  he has less than  staffers across the country  and now he s losing in the polls   badly  president obama s approval rating is in the steady mid   so he s certainly not unpopular  not only that  delegates at the convention are planning a coup to oust him before he even becomes the nominee  things are not looking good for the  billionaire  mogul americans are getting tired of donald trump  it s about time featured image via sara d  davis getty images
