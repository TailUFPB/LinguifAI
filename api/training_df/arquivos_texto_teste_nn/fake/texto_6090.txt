when your presidential candidate is supported by the media of a corrupt tyrannical regime  that s a bad sign north korea is a sworn enemy of the united states  threatening us with nuclear strikes for many years and demanding that we pull our military out of south korea  a move that would almost certainly be followed by a north korean invasion of our ally and that s precisely why north korean media is enthusiastic about donald trump according to nknews org the article published in state media outlet dprk today also referred to trump s proposal to hold direct talks with kim jong un  praising the likely republican nominee as a  wise politician  and  far sighted presidential candidate  in my personal opinion  there are many positive aspects to the trump s  inflammatory policies    wrote han yong mook  who introduced himself as a chinese north korean scholar  trump said  he will not get involved in the war between the south and the north   isn t this fortunate from north koreans  perspective  indeed  it would be most fortunate for north korea because they wouldn t have to fight our military and south korea s military at the same time in their effort to unite the two koreas under a single banner  of course  uniting would come at a great cost to south korea since kim jong un would still be the dictator of a united korea  that is non negotiable as far as the north korean leader is concerned trump has already threatened to pull us forces out of south korea unless the government in seoul increases domestic military spending  furthermore  he has indicated that he would like to negotiate with north korean dictator kim jong un dprk today especially likes this and urged trump to do it  yes do it  now   who knew that the slogan  yankee go home  would come true like this  the day when the  yankee go home  slogan becomes real would be the day of korean unification  they even went so far as to attack hillary clinton on trump s behalf  which every single american should be concerned about  the president that u s  citizens must vote for is not that dull hillary   who claimed to adapt the iranian model to resolve nuclear issues on the korean peninsula   but trump  who spoke of holding direct conversation with north korea  seriously  north korea is part of the  axis of evil  former president bush spoke of during his tenure in the white house  now the republican party has gone from that to being endorsed by north korean media aidan foster carter of the university of leeds  who is honorary senior research fellow in sociology and modern korea  viewed the media support as concerning  admittedly it is not exactly pyongyang speaking  or at least not the dprk government in an official capacity   foster carter conceded   but it is certainly pyongyang flying a kite  or testing the waters  for the rest of us  this is a timely reminder   if it were needed   of just how completely trump plans to tear up established u s  policy in the region  and what an irresponsible  unthinking menace the man is  again  the republican presidential nominee has the support of north korea because he has threatened to weaken south korea if seoul does not comply with his demands trump has even expressed admiration for the way kim jong un kills people to retain power  you ve got to give him credit  how many young guys   he was like  or  when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden  you know  it s pretty amazing when you think of it  how does he do that  even though it is a culture  and it s a culture thing  he goes in  he takes over  he s the boss  it s incredible  he wiped out the uncle  he wiped out this one  that one  i mean this guy doesn t play games  every american should be very concerned and very scared about this  especially republicans who claim they care about our national security and the security of our closest allies featured image  joe raedle getty images
