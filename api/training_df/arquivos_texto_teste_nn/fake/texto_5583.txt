vox com in conjunction with morning consult  a media and tech company  conducted a survey of voters and found what we ve all known for a very long time  most of the people that bitch and moan about immigrants stealing american jobs don t give a damn about the economy  rather  they care about those people coming into  their  country because they think they re criminals and terrorists  and yes  this is an explicitly race based attitude complementary to that analysis  americans  views about immigration differ substantially according to where the immigrants are from  immigrants from europe and asia are viewed much more positively than immigrants from africa and latin america  and immigrants from the middle east are viewed least positively of all  the poll also shows that this dynamic is heavily influenced by the specific views of white americans   while black and hispanic americans evaluate the impact of european and latin american immigrants similarly  for example  white americans are much more enthusiastic about immigration from europe than from latin america in other words  white people are racist assholes and it s even more depressing that it sounds if you look at the break down of responses don t know no opinion is   so that s a little ray of sunshine  but  weakens the economy   the only semi legitimate complaint  is just    that leaves over   of the remaining answers in the  complete bullshit  category  the totally made up complaints of  hurts national security  and  increases crime  are a combined    and the most insulting of all is   for  weakens american values  that last one is obnoxious on so many levels it s hard to know where to begin  somewhere along the line  people forgot that the only  native  americans are actual native americans  the rest of us come from all over the world and brought bits and pieces of our cultures and values with us  socially and culturally  we re one of the most dynamic countries in the world  for good or for bad  our  american values  are incredibly fluid  the only way to  weaken  our values is to calcify them by resisting the very change that has defined us a people since the founding of our country but this overt racism towards immigrants from nonwhite bad  parts of the world perfectly explains why donald trump s message of mexicans being rapists and muslims being terrorists resonates so strongly with white voters  no matter how much the right pretends that racism is dead in america  this poll and the rise of donald trump tells us that it s not only alive  it s thriving photo by chip somodevilla getty images
