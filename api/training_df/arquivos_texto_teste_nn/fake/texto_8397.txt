as iowa voters prepare to head to the state s caucuses on february   candidates on both sides of the political fence are ramping up their efforts in the state  that s to be expected what wasn t quite as expected  however  is this absolutely cringeworthy attempt by conservative candidate mike huckabee to  appeal  to iowa millennials the ad seems to be trying  somehow  to capitalize on the popularity of adele s  hit song   hello  the singer attempting to imitate adele in this video does a really terrible job  that may not be entirely her fault  though the bizarre lyrics are a truly terrible  swiss cheesy attempt to string together a bunch of really awkward keywords like  pizza ranch   and  selfie stick   but it s not just that the lyrics are bad  they also don t fit the music  that means the singer is stuck trying to try to fumble through lines like  hello davenport  amish chairs  casey s jerky  quad cities has quite a port  and then there s huckabee  his desperate attempt to seem cool or relevant or  in the know  just leaves everyone who sees this shaking their heads  saying   please no  the wall street journal published the video to youtube on january   if you want to know how bad it is  just watch it for yourself below  adele filed a copyright infringement notice against huckabee over the use of the song  which he arrogantly ignored during a january  interview on fox  huckabee stated that it s his right to use the song  even though the singer has specifically said he can t  according to huckabee  the bizarre video is supposed to be  political parody   which he says is protected by free speech when told that the attorney general says otherwise  huckabee claimed that people not wanting their work mangled and distorted by his trashy political campaign are just  overly sensitive  not surprisingly  huckabee likened the singer s right to protect her copyrighted property to  an attack on american freedoms  you see  it s his god given right to infringe on her copyright this is so typical of how the right wing operates   i m entitled to everything that belongs to others  no one is entitled to anything that belongs to me and my billionaire buddies  huckabee s not the only republican politician to use adele s music without her permission  as addicting info reports here  donald trump has also been using her music during his campaign events on february   a spokesman for the musician told the uk independent that she does not want her music associated with any political campaigning here s a bit of advice  get ted nugent  he s one of the few musicians that actually agrees with the republican party s agenda  why not play one his formerly popular tunes  like  jail bait   for example i bet huckabee could even get his good friend  josh duggar  to do a parody of that one featured image credit  video screen capture from wall street journal on youtube
