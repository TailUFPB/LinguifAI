as donald trump heads into the general election with virtually no money  little support  and absolutely no dignity  he s pivoting to the group of voters who are already loyal to the republican party  evangelicals trump has had a hard time gaining traction with the influential  religious voting bloc  but when push comes to shove  they always vote republican  and overwhelmingly so  but trump s a special kind of candidate  everyone seems to hate him  so he ll need all the help he can get so that help includes another loser   michele bachmann  the former congresswoman and failed  presidential candidate has been appointed  along with two dozen others  to a special evangelical advisory board in announcing the formation of the board  trump  who of course issued a gushing  pandering statement i have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and i look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to evangelicals  and all americans  and the common sense solutions i will implement when i am president bachmann  who based her entire political life off a warped interpretation of god and the bible  joins jerry falwell jr   ralph reed  james dobson  and a slew of mega church leaders all across the country bachmann  who ran as a tea party friend of the religious right in   lost the contest in iowa  a state with a heavy evangelical voting population  she placed a dismal sixth  while mike huckabee won  bachmann is so hated by the evangelicals that even phyllis schlafly  a hero to the movement  wouldn t even consider bachmann as her replacement for the ultra conservative eagle forum having bachmann on your advisory council for a demographic that hates her seems pretty counterintuitive  but hey  it s the trump campaign   nothing makes sense the board  which will meet regularly  will be prepping trump for upcoming meetings with religious leaders all across the nation  a few of the individuals  including james dobson and richard land  who are both leaders of churches and religious talk shows  actively campaigned for ted cruz and denounced trump as stated before  when all is said and done  the evangelicals will come home to the republicans  so instead of reaching out to women  hispanic and latinos and millenials  trump is actively spending his time appealing to people who will vote for him no matter what it looks like the crazy trump train has added the crazier michele bachmann to the mix  thanks  trump  for making this election even more entertaining featured image via alex wong getty images
