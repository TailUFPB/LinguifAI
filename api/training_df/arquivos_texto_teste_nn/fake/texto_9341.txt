this isn t going to go over well with obama s black lives matter folks veteran actor denzel washington says his latest role as a dogged defense attorney in roman j  israel  esq  reinforced his belief that black men  can t blame the system  because we make it  easy work  when it comes to filling america s prisons  it starts at the home  it starts at home  it starts with how you raise your children  if a young man doesn t have a father figure  he ll go find a father figure   the academy award winner told reporters at the dan gilroy directed film s new york premiere  the new york daily news reports  so you know i can t blame the system  it s unfortunate that we make such easy work for them   washington said the  year old hollywood heavyweight told reporters that the subject of how fatherless young men fall into a life of crime and incarceration is a personal one  i grew up with guys who did decades  in prison   and it had as much to do with their fathers not being in their lives as it did to do with any system   said washington  whose character finds himself working in the overburdened los angeles criminal court system   now i was doing just as much as they were  but they went further  i just didn t get caught  but they kept going down that road and then they were in the hands of the system   the actor added   but it s about the formative years  you re not born a criminal    breitbart news this isn t the first time washington pushed back on the  victim  narrative for black americans  the self proclaimed radical feminist jenn m  jackson wrote a hit piece on denzel washington in december   in her article  jackson expresses concern that denzel  is a little less woke than all of us had hoped   she even suggests that instead of being honest about his thoughts on racism  washington would have been better off keeping his mouth shut  lol  from jackson s hit piece on washington  in a recent interview with bet  washington was asked if he thought colorism  the discrimination against people with darker skin tones  was holding back darker skinned black actresses in hollywood  as bglh reports  washington was initially confused about what colorism was  asking the interviewer  smriti mundhra   what does that mean  moments later he said  one of the best roles for a woman of any color in the last  in a good good while or at least any movie that i ve been in  a dark skinned woman has in this film  so as long as you re being lead by outside forces or just being reactionary then you won t move forward  you have to continue to get better  however  he goes on to add   you can say   oh i didn t get the part because they gave it to the light skinned girl  or you can work  and one day  it might take twenty years  and you can be viola  he continues  the easiest thing to do is to blame someone else  the system  yeah  well  there s a possibility  maybe  that you re not good enough  but it s easy to say it s someone else s fault  but there s a possibility that you re not ready and you can still blame it on someone else instead of getting ready
