across the country  conservative groups are working to pass anti lgbt legislation that would bar transgender people the right to use public restrooms  the faulty logic at play is that transgender people are simply dressing up as the opposite gender to gain access to young boys and girls this  is  not  happening but rather than take a moment of reflection and realize that what s really at work here is regular old transphobia and fear mongering being used to hit back at the lgbt community for having scored a number of recent victories at the state and federal level  conservatives are trying to invent the problem to justify their barbaric solution  for an obvious example  look no further than designated hate group american family association  whose director of governmental affairs  sandy rios  just admitted that her organization has been sending men into women s bathrooms at target in the hopes of eliciting a reaction why target  the store recently outraged republicans by publicly standing with the lgbt community and saying its customers can use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable with  this set in motion the usual calls for boycotts  the usual right wing smears  and now this  a movement to harass women in target bathrooms so they are scared enough to demand the policy change  i think there s no question that when you say that there are no barriers in the bathroom   rios said   and that if men or women feel like they are men or women  the opposition of however they are equipped  and you have no restrictions  the net effect will be that people will not be stopped  we ve already had people testing this  going into targets and men trying to go into bathrooms  there is absolutely no barrier  and so the chief concern   she continued   even more than just  i think  trauma  certainly for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms  the chief concern of the american family association is the predators who will take advantage  afa is correct in believing that having a right wing christian fundamentalist storm into a women s bathroom for no discernible reason would be deeply traumatizing  unlike other women  whether transgender or not  these afa volunteers aren t there to use the bathroom  they are there to scare people  it s unclear how that translates to a need to ban transgender people  instead  the scariest people are   yet again   the ones who are actively pushing for discrimination it cannot be overstated just how little evidence there is that transgender people pose a danger to young girls if they are allowed to use the gendered bathroom they identify with  no case has ever been found that demonstrates that this is a tactic child predators seriously use  it s so non existent  in fact  that a right wing hate group like the american family association has had to get male volunteers to do it themselves ironically  afa s efforts have done absolutely nothing to show that transgender people shouldn t be allowed in public bathrooms  on the other hand  there seems to be mounting evidence to suggest employees of afa should be kept as far away from target bathrooms as possible  who knows what they ll do listen to rios brag about harassing women in the bathroom below  via right wing watch featured image via crooks and liars screengrab
