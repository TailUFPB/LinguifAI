former new york city mayor rudy giuliani had his ass handed to him so badly that he resorted to spouting trump talking points to distract from the whipping he just received during an appearance on cnn on tuesday  host chris cuomo slammed giuliani for refusing to say the word  gay  in reference to the orlando mass shooting that occurred over the weekend  thus following other republicans like mitch mcconnell and florida governor rick scott who would rather pretend there is no such thing as gay people giuliani claimed not saying the word is okay because president obama won t say  radical islamic terrorism   but cuomo had the perfect response to that bullshit by asking giuliani how he would feel if people referred to mob violence as radical italian terrorism  calling this gay and not using that word and not running away from it because of some sense of identity politics is wrong and you agree with that   cuomo began  saying  radical islamic terror    you used an analogy  let me reverse it on you  if every time the mafia made a killing or a murder  they said  well  those italians  well there s something about  em  and the mob  there s something about the giuliani and the cuomo   how would you have felt  you would have been disgusted  it s one of the things that motivated you as a prosecutor to distinguish the mafia from the rest of the italians  that is the same point  is it not  that you can t talk about all of islam you talk about these perversions  of course  giuliani claimed that they weren t the same thing but cuomo quickly countered   but if you said  radical italian murders they call themselves the islamic state   giuliani said  which gave cuomo the opening he needed to smack down the right wing mayor for making isis happy  they do because they want the credit of owning the religion   cuomo informed giuliani   they want that  why would you give them what they want  rather than admit that he s helping isis in their crusade to own islam  giuliani quickly changed the subject to blaming president obama for the attacks in orlando and san bernardino and repeating trump s suggestion that president obama is in league with the terrorists cuomo didn t buy the bullshit giuliani was trying to sell  i think there s some politics being played with this  with donald trump coming out and seeming to suggest that president obama has some sympathy  some compromise personally that doesn t keep him from being tough  with all the troops  with taking out obl  osama bin laden   i mean  it just doesn t seem like the right kind of rhetoric  i don t think if you were running you would ever suggest anything like that about a commander in chief  but giuliani just continued to blame president obama and claimed he is weak on terror  conveniently forgetting that the   attacks occurred on his own watch as nyc mayor in   president bush was also in charge on that day  yet giuliani somehow believes that bush was strong against terrorism despite the fact that   americans died that day in attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon that are far worse than any terrorist that has occurred before or since here s the video via youtube in addition  president obama stated recently that the fbi has been tracking isis sympathizers but are unable to keep them from buying guns like omar mateen did because republicans refuse to ban people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms  if republicans had done that when president obama asked a long time ago this shooting could have been prevented because the fbi would have been able to make sure that every time mateen walked into a gun shop  he would be flagged as a possible threat and would have been denied the assault rifle he used in the massacre  someone should ask giuliani why his party wants terrorists to have guns so much featured image  screenshot
