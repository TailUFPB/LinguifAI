people have called former president george w  bush lots of things  war criminal  worst president ever  terrorist  dipshit  f ckface  but it is doubtful that any african american man  woman  or child  especially after his response to hurricane katrina  would ever call him  my nigga  while republicans are understandably confused by larry wilmore s term of endearment for the president at the correspondents  dinner   after all  they are used to calling him the   er  variation of the word rather than the one wilmore used   many view wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine  so  mr  president  i m going to keep it a hundred  yo barry  you did it  my n gga   wilmore said at the dinner  a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the right felt was a reminder of that  n word  thing they don t get to use when referencing president obama upon hearing wilmore call the president  my nigga   fox host todd starnes  for example  nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that wilmore s words were somehow offensive  sharing in starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile jimmy mathis  who threw an almost temper tantrum on sunday over wilmore s ability to use the word suddenly  for the first time in his presidency  mathis feels that barack obama deserves  respect   that s   the jealousy felt by the stupid part of america that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this president   the same one they have been screaming about for years mathis said that public figures like wilmore  and  presumably  fox news hosts and other noted right wing icons  should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media  mathis whined that no one called president george w  bush  my nigga   and then you have larry wilmore correct me if i m wrong  i don t remember anybody while roasting  dropped the n word in the final white house correspondents dinner if i were president obama  i would have walked off that stage  i would have walked off  no way you re going to disrespect me and the office  this is not a p c  society thing  i can t imagine standing feet from the president of the united states and saying that   mathis said  though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams here s a thought for mathis  right now  at this very moment in time  the republican frontrunner is endorsed by the kkk  until you condemn that  the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga  listen to his feigned outrage below  with a bonus caller who says a bunch of racist stuff mathis accepts without question featured image via screengrab
