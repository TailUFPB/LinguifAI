it s becoming clearer and clearer that an america under a donald trump presidency would be racist and nasty  after seven years of an african american president it seems all racists everywhere have come out from hiding  and now trump is making them think its okay to be as horrible as they want to be there s no greater example of this than in a recent story where an opposing high school basketball teams  fans starting chanting  trump  trump  trump   and  usa   at the home teams  players who happen to be very diverse  with players who are latino  native american  and african american  trump   seems to now be synonymous with  white pride  perry  iowa is a small town  but very diverse  their high school principal  dan marburger  describes the school as   really more of an urban school in a rural setting  here at the high school  we are  percent minority   and they embrace the diversity with open arms  unfortunately  not everyone who visits the school for sporting events feels the same way the visiting basketball team from dallas center grimes apparently brought a long with them their fans who seem to hold donald trump s hatred of immigrants and really anyone who isn t white unfortunately  these sort of chants aren t new to the players of perry high school  senior shammond ivory said  it s honestly disrespectful  that s how i take it  i hear it during the game  on and off the court  everywhere i go   however  he takes what he hears and turns it around  saying  as soon as i hear something like that  it just triggers me and it makes me strive for more and to do it for my team  coaches and my community  with the acceptance of trump as a legitimate candidate for president of the united states knowing how openly racist not only his rallies are  but he is himself  we as a nation need to prepare ourselves for more and more racists thinking it s okay to be assholes  we  as a nation  need to make sure he gets nowhere near the oval office watch who s report of the story here featured image via screen capture
