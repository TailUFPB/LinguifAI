oh the irony  left leaning msnbc aired a segment about president trump s proposed border wall  which ultimately proved the u s  mexico border needs a bigger wall how high should we go  the trump administration has approved the construction of eight prototypes of the border wall  these prototypes are nearing completion as the administration s deadline approaches  the prototypes have several guidelines they must satisfy  for instance  concrete walls have to be  ft  tall while walls made from alternate materials have to be  to  ft  tall jumping the fence msnbc reporter jacob soboroff went to preview the prototypes that are being built between two existing border fences along the u s  mexico border  during the segment  soboroff was interviewing border patrol agent roy villareal when several migrants were caught on camera jumping the existing fence into the united states everyday border enforcement   open borders  a small group of three people just jumped over in the middle of the day   soboroff noted   so can you explain to me what s going on  this is the reality of everyday border enforcement  the united states is the draw for people with dire situations where they are at   villareal said   we are going to continue to witness this  it plays out on a regular basis for us  soboroff went to the mexican side of the border and showed how easy it was to cross the border under current conditions this is outrageous  can you imagine how easy it s been for terrorists to cross we just reported on a terrorist who made his way to canada via mexico and the u s   the democrats are fighting against closing our border with mexico at every step of the way  they want open borders it s that simple  if you vote for democrats then you re voting for open borders  they have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to america  one of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from mexico looking for a job or better life  the truth is that our open border has become a global magnet for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons  one of the reasons is terrorism the case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to america and canada the somali terrorist who stabbed a canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the united states through the mexican border and was released by obama s department of homeland security  dhs   allowing him to continue his journey north  the isis operative  abdulahi hasan sharif  was ordered deported  an immigration and customs enforcement  ice  spokeswoman told various media outlets recently  but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again sharif entered the u s  in  through the san ysidro port of entry in california without documentation and was briefly held at the otay mesa detention center in san diego  a local newspaper reported  a year later he crossed the border into canada and settled in edmonton after being granted refugee status  on september  he slammed into an edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife  after fleeing the scene  sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians  canadian authorities found an isis flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder  criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon  two years ago  canadian authorities investigated the  year old terrorist for espousing extremist views  it s disturbing that sharif s northbound trek took him through the u s  mexico border as part of an ongoing investigation into cartels  corruption and terrorism  judicial watch has for years reported that islamic extremists are entering the country through mexico and that isis is operating in border towns just miles from american cities  judicial watch launched the project in  by exposing a sophisticated narco terror ring with strong ties to isis and connections running from el paso to chicago to new york city  two of the fbi s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to mexico  less than a year later  judicial watch reported that isis is operating in a mexican border town just eight miles from el paso  the result of islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes  when judicial watch reported that mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small texas rural town  federal authorities publicly denied the story was true  never the less  high level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to judicial watch that foreigners  classified as special interest aliens  sia   were being transported to stash areas in acala  a rural crossroads located around  miles from el paso on a state road   highway   once in the u s   the sias waited for pick up in the area s sand hills just across highway   at the time a texas department of public safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border last year a high ranking dhs official told judicial watch that mexican drug traffickers help islamic terrorists stationed in mexico cross into the united states to explore targets for future attacks  among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a kuwaiti named shaykh mahmood omar khabir  an isis operative who lives in the mexican state of chihuahua not far from el paso  khabir trained hundreds of al qaeda fighters in pakistan  afghanistan and yemen and has lived in mexico for more than a year  according to information provided by judicial watch s government source  now khabir trains thousands of men mostly syrians and yemenis to fight in an isis base situated in the mexico u s  border region near ciudad ju rez  the intelligence gathered by judicial watch s source reveals  staking out u s  targets is not difficult and khabir actually bragged in an italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men  and kill thousands of people in texas or in arizona in the space of a few hours   in the same article mexico s top diplomat  foreign affairs secretary claudia ruiz  said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the united states  while much of the american mainstream media ignores that sharif made it to canada via the u s  mexico border  it s hardly surprising considering islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years  referring to the recent canadian attack  a think tank dedicated to investigating the operations  funding  activities and front groups of islamic extremists worldwide writes   fears about a terrorist using the u s  mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized  via  judicial watch
