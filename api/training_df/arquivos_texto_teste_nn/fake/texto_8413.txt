just a day before the iowa caucuses  a former field organizer for republican presidential candidate donald trump has come forward with accusations that trump s campaign grossly discriminated against women  paying them less than the male employees doing the same exact work these completely believable accusations were made by elizabeth mae davidson and published by the new york times  the  year old staffer had been working for trump s campaign in davenport  iowa but was fired a month ago   despite being previously described as one of the campaign s most effective organizers on thursday  davidson filed a complaint about the discrimination with the davenport civil rights commission  aside from the gender pay discrimination  davidson reported that she was also given less opportunities to advance her career and skills  to make matters worse  female staffers were also subjected to inappropriate comments about their appearance   from donald trump himself  the times wrote  said in a discrimination complaint that men doing the same jobs were paid more and were allowed to plan and speak at rallies  while her requests to do so were ignored  she also said that when she and a young female volunteer met mr  trump at a rally last summer  he told them   you guys could do a lot of damage   referring to their looks in an interview  davidson revealed that she was paid    per month  because she was also working as a paralegal  she was considered a part time staffer by the campaign  however  one of her male peers with the exact same role in the campaign was paid almost double despite the fact that he also has another job  trump s campaign public filings state that several men filling the same role as davidson were being paid between    to    a month according to dorothy a  o brien  davidson s attorney  the complaint will trigger the davenport civil rights agency to investigate trump s campaign  and after  days davidson can choose to let the agency continue its investigation or follow suit in state court considering trump s horrible track record of sexist  misogynistic comments toward women  it s not a big surprise to hear that his campaign was discriminating against its female staffers  when davidson was asked if she would be attending monday s caucuses  she was undecided  she said  some of the bad things about him i dismissed  because i was working for the candidate  now i m more critical  especially how he treats women  we don t blame her featured image via gage skidmore
