it s become clearer than ever that republicans don t care about women  they also don t care about freedom one iota  and they most certainly don t care about women s freedom to affordable and accessible reproductive health care  this has become more clear than ever especially in florida  and because it s florida it s become a circus of the absurd in a recently passed bill that will be signed by gov  rick scott  r  it basically strips all funding from planned parenthood  because really  why should women have access to affordable care  however  republicans tout the same old fictitious line that planned parenthood is just an abortion clinic  so it doesn t deserve to be funded  let s be clear  though  even if it were only an abortion clinic  it still deserves funding because abortion is legal and it a women s right to make her own medical decisions here s the most obscene part of the whole bill  though   you know  besides stripping freedom away from hundreds of thousands of female floridians   the list of  alternative  clinics for women to receive reproductive health according to the tampa bay times  anti choice advocates  want that money to be spent in other kinds of clinics  like crisis pregnancy centers and federally qualified health centers  what are those other  federally qualified health centers  well  according to the guardian   several state lawmakers who have insisted that plentiful alternatives exist for reproductive and sexual healthcare have cited a list of health centers that includes dentists  optometrists  and elementary schools  when the co sponsor of the bill  colleen burton  was asked about these  alternative resources alternative resources for birth control  pap smears  breast exams and other reproductive services   she answered  we have  federally qualified health centers  the counties have health departments  physicians  offices  independent clinics would be eligible if they applied and met the requirements  fellow state lawmaker lori berman pressed further  saying  i have seen the list of the groups  and some of those groups include podiatrists  correctional facilities  healthcare  school based healthcare clinics  proponents of the bill insist there are ample number of alternatives where women can go to receive the care that they need  but that s a false narrative considering most of the places are in no way capable of providing women s health services it s absolutely reprehensible that republicans are playing politics with women s lives like this  all because they know defunding planned parenthood plays to their base of idiotic voters who don t even know what it is  and rely on the lies being spread by right wing media we need to stop allowing women s lives to be controlled by politicians  and ironically the same politicians who come from a party that boasts it s chef d oeuvre is perpetuating freedom to all  which clearly is a lie planned parenthood is an integral part of community health and family planning  defunding it not only hurts the women  and men  who need their services  but also entire communities featured image via flickr
