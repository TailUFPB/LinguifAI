if there s one thing president barack obama isn t threatened by  it s donald trump after the brexit decision  in which the united kingdom voted to leave the european union  many americans were left upset and afraid that what had happened overseas could be a sign that trump might actually win the election  trump himself has definitely played up those fears in his statements following the decision by making statements such as   i really see a parallel between what is happening here and in the u s   and voters  will have the chance to re declare their independence  in november  luckily  obama is setting the record straight in an interview with npr s steve inskeep  it was clear that obama wanted americans to know that there were distinct differences between america and britain  and that the brexit vote wasn t a warning about what might happen in november  in fact  obama was confident enough to actually laugh when inskeep asked him about trump s statement that americans will be able to reject  the global elite  in the general election  obama took a swipe at the billionaire business mogul  mr  trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life  so  he s hardly a spokesperson  a legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge of working class people on either side of the atlantic  obama urged americans to stay calm  saying that he didn t think brexit would lead to any  major  cataclysmic changes   he said  i think that the best way to think about this is  a pause button has been pressed on the project of full european integration  i would not overstate it  there s been a little bit of hysteria post brexit vote  as if somehow nato s gone  the trans atlantic alliance is dissolving  and every country is rushing off to its own corner  that s not what s happening  obama stated that the u s  and europe still have similar international interests  he said  the basic core values of europe  the tenants of liberal market based democracies  those aren t changing  the interests we have with europe remain the same  and our concerns internationally remain the same  so europe can t afford to turn in  trump might want to sit down  and shut up  you can watch obama s interview below featured image via pete souza  official white house photographer
