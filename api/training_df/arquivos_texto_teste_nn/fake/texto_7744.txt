pope francis has delivered a strong message to corporate types who exploit people for profit and attempt to cleanse their souls by donating to the church  telling them  we don t want your blood money during his general audience in vatican city on wednesday  in which he railed against the exploitation of working people by feckless employers  the pope said  the people of god and the church don t need dirty money  they need hearts that are open to the mercy of god  it is far from the pope s first intervention on the matter of unrestrained and crony capitalism that has come to define  at least  the last thirty years of human history  last summer  the pope referred to the global dominance of capitalism s   as the  new colonialism in a speech in bolivia   pointing to the removal of liberty  human rights and opportunity created by gross inequality and the resulting centralization of wealth and power  he continued  in this third world war  waged piecemeal  which we are now experiencing  a form of genocide is taking place  and it must end  throughout his time as pontiff  pope francis has continued to exercise the message of new testament jesus  a personal show of compassion  and a determination to enable poor and vulnerable people to make the best possible lives for themselves  and the widest possible contribution to their communities what is so interesting about this though  is that the political party that considers itself the party of god on earth  the republican party  asset there delivering the opposite message somewhere along the line  young republicans confused atlas shrugged with the bible and it s radical right wing author ayn rand for jesus  republicans don t worship jesus  they worship ayn rand  republicans don t preach the gospel  they preach the fountainhead  instead of restraining the power of big business to hold unique influence over public and personal life  the republican party has devoted itself to the opposite things have come to such a head  that republican leaders are now openly denouncing the pope and his interpretation of the bible  rather than taking instruction from his leadership and questioning their own  in doing so  they are by their own definition  committing the sin of pride   and we all know what pride comes before  a fall you can see how the young turks handled pope francis  assault on crony capitalism in the video below  featured image via flickr creative commons
