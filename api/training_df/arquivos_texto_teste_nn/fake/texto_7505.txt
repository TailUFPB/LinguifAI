asher edelman inspired the character gordon gekko in oliver stone s  film  wall street  played by michael douglas  the infamous stockbroker  who made a fortune buying and selling companies in distress  was recently asked on cnbc s fast money  who he would endorse for bernie sanders  his answer was surprising  but his reasoning is not  bernie sanders  no question   said edelman     i think it s quite simple again  if you look at something called  velocity of money  that means how much gets spent and turns around  when you have the top one percent getting money  they spend five ten percent of what they earn  when you have the lower end of the economy getting money  they spend a hundred  or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn  as you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top  and a transfer of income to the top  you have a shrinking consumer base  basically  and you have a shrinking velocity of money  edelman argued redistributing wealth  especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing  is what is best for the economy  greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits  but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened  the economy begins to sputter into stagnation senator bernie sanders  economic policies aren t radical  socialist  or unrealistic  they are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken  rigged economy  edelman may be a member of the top one percent  but he is intelligent enough to realize trickle down economics doesn t work  and the republicans who insist on perpetuating economic policies surrounding that myth continue to damage the united states economy the rich getting richer don t create jobs  customers do  if there aren t any customers to purchase goods and services  such as a middle and working class who earn enough to have disposable income  the economy will falter featured image via addicting info archives
