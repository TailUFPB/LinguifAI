when it comes to donald trump  it sure as hell seems as though a lot of republicans are playing dumb when it comes to how ill prepared the presumptive gop nominee actually is to be commander in chief  many seem to be just falling in lock step without considering how dangerous a person like trump would be as president not giving republican rep  marsha blackburn any wiggle room for bullshit  msnbc host tamron hall grilled the tennessee congresswoman about certain things she s been saying regarding donald trump after several questions where she just avoided answering at all  and giving generic answers like she hadn t yet  had a conversation with him   blackburn argued that she s  curious  about what he has to offer  being that he s an outsider hall didn t let her get away with being so mind numbingly vague and said  i m wondering about the curiosity  there seems to have not been curiosity about the person who has been leading in the votes for a very long time  donald trump did not happen overnight  you have yourself  and speaker ryan  all trying to get to know him now  backpedaling  blackburn said  i ve known mr  trump for several years  this back and forth went on for a bit  with hall finally saying  but a few minutes ago you said you still need to get to know him and sit down and talk to him  which is it  you re either familiar with his policies and where he stands blackburn  not liking being caught floundering  came interrupted with  that is not what i said and you know that  i said that let s give him and speaker ryan they ve had a good statement  they are going to develop these policies and it s going to be a great campaign in the fall  mr  trump has wonderful people working with him  they are working very quickly  bear in mind  he has not been in the halls of congress  he has been out running companies  which still wasn t an answer  so hall stated the obvious  he s been on the campaign trail for months speaking to your base  it was at this point that blackburn seemed to struggle with her earpiece and told hall that she couldn t hear her  convenient timing  to say the least  truth is  trump doesn t have solid policy proposals and gopers like blackburn know this  they just don t care watch the interview here featured photo by scott olson getty images
