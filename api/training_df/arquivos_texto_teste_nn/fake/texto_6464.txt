now that the side show is essentially over and the republicans have committed their party and resources to a delusional lunatic  those left ion the rubble of hurricane trump are desperately seeking answers  those answers came from the cruz campaign  who informed us that carly fiorina wasn t ted s first choice for vp  they say that had marco rubio warmed up and showed any interest at all in working with uncle ted that a cruz rubio ticket would have changed the course of history they felt that strongly because in the course of doing their job  they polled in five upcoming states and found that if rubio were on the ticket there would be a  blowout   according to a source inside the cruz campaign  the states polled included illinois  arizona and wisconsin  the numbers were as high as  percent to  percent over trump and if true  that means that ted cruz owes his demise to himself because that puts rubio on a growing list of people who just refuse to work with ted cruz that s fairly consistent with the general consensus about ted cruz  there came a turning point in ted s career  a  come to jesus  if you will  after he failed to get his way about defunding planned parenthood over a series of cleverly edited videos  cruz went on an infamous rant on the senate floor that cost him whatever small amount of political capital he had left in washington  he called every member of the republican leadership out for betraying god and the party  he claimed that republicans no longer cared about what mattered and he called them out by name  it s just not something you do  especially if you re a united states senator and you need to work with these people to do your job effectively cruz now has to head back to washington to sit in his chair alone in the corner of the congressional lunchroom  with little left but shattered dreams and still enough ego to blame someone else for it  cruz has a long way to go until his next election in   rubio  on the other hand  has already decided not to run  so he gets to sit in the private sector wondering if he would have been happier with an office in the west wing a little more rectangular than the one he was hoping for featured image via screen capture
