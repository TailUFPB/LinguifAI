the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia has raised many questions and left the fate of the supreme court up in the air  especially since the gop is flat out refusing to allow president obama s potential nominees through  no matter who they might be  however  scalia s sudden demise also had another unintended   and very unexpected   effect  it made notoriously silent justice clarence thomas open his mouth for the first time in literally a decade the case before the court involved the  law that stopped domestic abusers from owning firearms again  being the staunch conservative that he is  thomas didn t agree with this  and seemed to imply that wife beaters should be able to own guns  despite the very good reasons for prohibiting them from doing so  so  thomas s first utterance on the court in the last ten years was also incredibly stupid  he asked  can you give me another example where a misdemeanor suspends a constitutional right permanently  there was an audible gasp of surprise from the court  after all  many folks there probably don t even know what clarence s voice sounds like  but  now  we understand why he didn t speak  he s clearly a f cking moron  as winning democrats reports  thomas decided to go to bat for the gun rights of violent men and engaged in the following tit for tat with ilana eisenstein  a justice department attorney  you re saying that a misdemeanor conviction results in a lifelong ban on possessing a gun   thomas said   which at least right now is a constitutional right  in these cases  did any of the petitioners use a weapon  eisenstein responded that they had not  so it is not directly related  to the original crime  thomas asked well  it seems that with scalia gone  thomas will be the one to fight for the rights of abusers everywhere to go on and kill the partners they victimize  way to carry a monumentally stupid and dangerous torch  justice thomas  shame on you featured image via screen capture from dailynebraskan
