with all of the stories of  tv hosts involved in sexual misconduct  it s a mystery why nobody brings ups the  accidental  death of joe scarborough s female staffer  last november  president trump called for an investigation into the death of lori klausutis  a  year old staffer for then congressman joe scarborough  many morning joe viewers probably have forgotten  or never knew  that the body of a female aide once was found in scarborough s congressional office  investigators quickly saw that a blow to the head  delivered accidentally or intentionally  was involved in lori klausutis  death  there are also some serious questions as to the mental competency of the doctor who performed the autopsy  as well as an important question about why there was no time of death recorded on his autopsy according to the daily kos  joe scarborough  a u s  congressman from florida s  district from  suddenly resigned only  months into his  term in september   his reason  the classic  in order to spend more time with his children curiously  just  months before he resigned  his  year old staffer was found dead in his office while mainstream media was hounding democrat u s  congressman gary condit about his missing ex intern  chandra levy  viewers heard next to nothing about joe s intern  a healthy  year old woman was found dead in his congressional district office in fort walton beach  fl only two days after scarborough s staffer was found dead in his office  the   terror attack happened  and this huge story was mostly ignored by media outlets  in a tweet calling for scarborough and msnbc president phil griffin to be terminated in the wake of matt lauer s firing  the president mentioned an  unsolved mystery  that took place in florida years ago  so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin  and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the  unsolved mystery  that took place in florida years ago  investigate   the president wrote to his   million followers so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin  and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the  unsolved mystery  that took place in florida years ago  investigate   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    was referencing lori klausutis   year old office staffer who worked for scarborough when he was a representative from florida  klausutis was found dead in the congressman s district office in july    the hillthe autopsy of lori klausutis makes no reference to a time of death  that raises new questions about an investigation that started when the  year old woman s body was found in the office of then u s  representative joe scarborough in summer  accidental death was the official finding in the klausutis case  with a cardiac arrhythmia causing her to fall and hit her head on a desk  but the recent discovery of human remains at a storage unit in pensacola  florida  casts doubt on that ruling  that s because the storage unit was rented by dr  michael berkland  the man who conducted the klausutis autopsy  years earlier berkland now faces a felony charge of improper storage of hazardous waste  and the grisly nature of the discovery calls his competence and perhaps his sanity into question daily mail   florida was not the only place berkland ran into trouble over his work  in   he was fired as a contract medical examiner in jackson county  missouri  in a dispute over his autopsy reports berkland had incorrectly stated on the reports that he had taken sections of several brains to be preserved as specimens for medical conferences and teaching purposes  ap reported he claimed they were  proofreading errors  and the missouri attorney general s office found they did not jeopardize any criminal cases berkland complained the actions against him were unfair because he was unable to present evidence in his defense  his doctor s license was ultimately revoked there  independent blogger  legal schnauzer suggested in  that berkland s findings be dismissed and that his autopsy of the deceased staffer should not be trusted  was the lori klausutis autopsy conducted in a professional manner  was foul play prematurely ruled out  should the investigation be reopened  perhaps with renewed scrutiny for scarborough and others who might have had access to his office at the time so it s hard to figure why the autopsy makes no reference to the time of death   see full autopsy report here  why is that a key omission  consider this from an online document titled  determining time of death  tod   why is it important to know the time of death   tod can set the time of murder  eliminate or suggest suspects  confirm or disprove alibiswhy did berkland not include this critical detail  it s not as if his report does not provide plenty of other details  he tells us that klausutis was wearing a white thong on the day of her death   page    he tells us that she had a  shaved genital region    page    but no time of death the core of the autopsy report can be found in the comment section  pages    this probably is the central finding there is no doubt that the head injury is as a result of a fall  rather than a blow being delivered to the heading by a moving object  lori has a classic  contrecoup  injury  or bruise to the brain  meaning that her brain was bruised on the opposite side from where the external force was applied  the left side of lori s brain was bruised while the external abraded contusion  scratch and bruise  was in the right temple region  the contrecoup contusion results when a freely moving  mobile head strikes an unyielding  firm  fixed object in a fall  as in the floor  or in this case  the desk  this finding is in marked distinction from the  coup  contusion  or that injury which results from a moving object  example a ball bat  that strikes a stationary head  in the coup injury  there is bruising of the brain on the same side as the external injury  there was no coup contusion in lori klausutis what would cause a seemingly healthy young woman  an avid runner  to collapse and lose consciousness  unable to break her fall  berkland rules out some of the common causes of such an event a pulmonary embolus  a brain hemorrhage  a ruptured aneurysm  drug issues  he concludes these facts leave only a cardiac arrhythmia as the reason to go unconscious and subsequently fall and strike the desk in an unprotected fashion  if lori s heart was normal  it would be problematic to postulate a plausible reason for a cardiac arrhythmia in such a young person  however  her heart was not normal  the heart contained an abnormality  floppy mitral valve  that is known to result in cardiac ectopy and dangerous cardiac arrhythmias all of this sounds reasonable  but given recent events  can michael berkland s work be trusted  why on earth was he keeping body parts in a storage unit  and did any of those parts once belong to lori klausutis according to the daily kos  dr  berkland and his supervisor at the time  dr  gary cumberland were known to be high giving donors to scarborough s congressional campaigns  did their relationship with scarborough influence any and all the results issued by the m e  s office
