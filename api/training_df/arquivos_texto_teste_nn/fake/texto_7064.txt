no matter how much republicans and fox news say otherwise  there is an unmistakable pay gap between men and women in america  there are a few legitimate reasons  childbirth child rearing  but a lot more illegitimate ones  women aren t as hard working they re too emotional not as smart   but another  more fundamental  reason has been identified by two researchers according to travis wiseman  director of the international business program at mississippi state university  and nabamita dutta of the university of wisconsin  researchers have largely ignored the cultural factors that shape gender roles in the workplace  as the two researchers note in a recent working paper  there has been little attention given to one cultural factor in particular  religiosity yes  it s our old friend religion that s contributed to racism  anti lgbt bigotry and bucket loads of misogyny  now it s helping suppress economic opportunities for women  it seems like this would be obvious but apparently it wasn t to test that variable  wiseman and dutta looked at how two different measurements of religiosity among residents of different states   belief in god and participation in religious activity   correlated with the gender wage gap in those states  even after controlling for age  education  marital status  occupation  time in the workforce  and other factors  they found that this correlation was rather significant  specifically  that a three percent increase in a state s religiosity related to a one percent increase in its gender wage gap so what s happening here  the study doesn t draw any conclusions beyond the correlation but it s not hard to guess in the view of most of the abrahamic religions  judaism  christianity and islam   women are not meant to work outside of the home  much less be the primary earner  this definitely applies to conservative religion but it s not exclusively relegated to the right  even if left leaning employers don t realize it  they ve been conditioned  to a degree  to view women as the caregiver in a family traditional religious attitudes might also affect employer behavior  shaping managers  decisions about whom to hire or lay off  or a family s decision about who should be the primary breadwinner  zooming out  the state government s distribution of resources   like education  health care  and parental leave   can also be shaped by prevailing cultural norms that are shaped by religious attitudes  cultural norms  is the key phrase there  until we break the social model that men are the natural breadwinners and women are the natural diaper changers  it s going to be nigh impossible to get people to stop discriminating against women  even unconsciously  in the workplace featured image via getty
