bobby jindal abandoned his home state of louisiana to mount a completely pathetic campaign for president  he pranced around with cast members of duck dynasty  cheered the far right  and made a fool of himself  exiting the race long before a single vote was cast behind him  he left louisiana  which has a republican dominated legislature and is facing an unprecedented calamity which now has to be repaired by its new democratic governor  john bel edwards louisiana now stands at the brink economic disaster  without sharp and painful tax increases in the coming weeks  the government will cease to offer many of its vital services  including education opportunities and certain programs for the needy  a few universities will shut down and declare bankruptcy  graduations will be cancelled  students will lose scholarships  select hospitals will close  patients will lose funding for treatment of disabilities  some reports of child abuse will go uninvestigated  doomsday   said marketa garner walters  the head of louisiana s department of children   family services  if the state can t raise any new revenue  her agency s budget  like several others  will be slashed  percent jindal  cut taxes for the wealthy during his eight years in office  and created brand new giveaway subsidies to big business   that created a giant deficit  even though conservative republicans claim to be fiscal geniuses and now louisiana may be forced to raise taxes on a population where   live below the poverty line  as well as implement cuts on services helping those same people who need it the most the state is a mess  but it isn t out the ordinary for republican run states that often claim they are perfect examples of the right s philosophies  in a positive way on the same day that the overall national jobs report beat expectations and the country continued its jobs growth record under president obama  republican dominated kansas again had a major failure  the state lost   jobs all in the month of january  and has only added   jobs across the entire state in the last  months  the state has only grown   percent while the country has grown   percent republican run states have a terrible future in front of them  but their gop leaders are so blinded by ideology they don t even notice the lives they are ruining featured image via flickr
