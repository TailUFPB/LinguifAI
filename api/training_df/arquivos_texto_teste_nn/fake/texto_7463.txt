just five days before the next republican presidential debate  scheduled to be hosted by fox news  donald trump seized control of the gop political process  in a live phone call to fox and friends  trump informed the network that he wouldn t be participating  on hearing the news  ohio governor john kasich also decided to drop out  leaving fox with no choice but to cancel well   that or let ted cruz screech into the camera for two hours while america engaged in uncontrollable vomiting trump s reasons were pretty clear  he says that there have been enough debates  and he s right  they could force the voters to watch yet another round of in party bickering over who hates women  minorities  immigrants  muslims and donald trump more  after the blonde fox news actress reminded trump that the voters love the debates  he schooled her on the truth of the matter  it s the networks that love the debates republican debates get great ratings  which can be attributed to donald trump  if it were just the whining of ted cruz and company  nobody would bother  republicans and democrats alike tune into the debates this election cycle to see what stupid thing donald trump will say next and to watch the candidates go at each others  throats  trump pointed out that the democratic debates get terrible ratings  which is only true if you consider they re being pitted against nationally televised  primetime versions of the jerry springer show trump did give an actual reason he couldn t be talked out of dropping out of the debate  citing a  very important speech to a very important group of people  he couldn t name  the hosts of fox and friends begged him to reconsider  which in and of itself is hilarious  but still trump declined  he declared that the debate was a surprise to begin with  that nobody had bothered to tell him it was even happening  with only three candidates left and one of them being a single digit non threat  a debate without trump would be pointless it would appear that this isn t just a shot at fox  either  trump said he thinks the republicans have had enough debates  it s a well played card for the guy the debates are   let s face it   aimed at destroying  the state party leaders have done everything in their power to see to it that the halls are packed with establishment candidate supporters  leaving trump in a sea of boos when he uses the bully tactics that are necessary for him to keep control of the idiot vote watch fox and friends get caught off guard when trump announces he won t be doing any more debates https   www facebook com foxandfriends videos  featured image from screen capture
