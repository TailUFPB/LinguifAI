the armed militants occupying federal property in oregon still haven t been arrested   but they are absolutely continuing to do damage  unsatisfied with tearing down fences and building roads  disrupting the delicate ecosystem  y all qaeda is on a hunt for something even more dangerous to humanity than a tyrannical bird sanctuary  cameras the pretend militia chose perhaps the only person whose hands aren t covered with some of the  gallons of lube a good samaritan sent them to climb a ladder and investigate the creepy science box the box itself  which has a sticker reading  scada circuit   on the outside  doesn t try to hide what it is   scada  stands for   supervisory control and data acquisition   as a simple google search can tell you  but these folks apparently lack the computer expertise needed to do more than visit world net daily s website  there s also a blinking red light  an antenna  and a  wifi in use  sticker   in other words  it is very clearly a not so hidden camera while most would expect cameras to cover a federal wildlife preserve  the armed and stupid were completely taken aback by this development  the  militiaman  up the pole struggled to open the housing  so he solved the problem in the traditional bundy way   by hitting it with something  what s that look like to you   he yelled to his posse   this is united states federal government surveillance  welcome to america  i m tellin  you  who s spying on us   a woman yelled  as though the cameras were in place simply to keep an eye on them  your federal government   utility pole guy replied   wake up people  ammon bundy  a product of generations and generations of inbreeding  shared his thoughts on the matter  this tells me that  uh  the government wants to be oppressive  they gotta watch us  control us  and use these things to do that with  this is not what it means to be free  a free people does not need to be watched  a free people needs to be left alone  wake up america   bundy said   let s get our freedom back   adding that the cameras are a  sophisticated piece of equipment    though to be fair  a spoon is a sophisticated piece of equipment to bundy the bundy terrorists then dismantled the cameras because they re  sick of being spied on  as they illegally occupy property that is nowhere close to theirs  then  of course  they were off to hunt for more signs of government oppression the footage of the bundy idiots discovering that cameras exist is downright hilarious  of course  there s always the possibility that the cameras are not government cameras at all   there s also the possibility that the cameras belong to the electric company  since they seem to be pointed directly at a substation located near the property   winning democrats  charles topher notes   wouldn t that be a hoot  in any case  this monumental display of stupidity is hilarious to see featured image via screengrab
