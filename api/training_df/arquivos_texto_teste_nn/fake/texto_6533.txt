a lot of people have said that donald trump would start sounding more  presidential if he managed to secure the republican nomination  this meant that he would tone down his rhetoric  maybe try to bring the country together inside of dividing us and attempt to gain the support of independent voters by sounding like an intelligent human being  trump  however  has proven that he has different plans and he doesn t give a f ck about uniting this country on wednesday evening  the presumptive nominee for the gop sat down with nbc nightly news host lester holt for an interview and promised more of the same holt asked  as you try to appeal to the whole country  do you stand  for example  by the idea of a ban on foreign muslims coming into the country   trump responded  i do  we have to be vigilant  we have to be strong  we have to see what s going on  there s a big problem in the world happening with the migration in europe  you look at germany  it s crime riddled right now  lies  germany is absolutely not  riddled  with crime  trump is so full of shit  last year the german federal office of criminal investigation studied crime rates in the country to see if there was a rise due to the syrian refugees fleeing to the country and found crimes committed by refugees stood at the same level as those committed by native germans  these findings are the result of an initial evaluation conducted by the bka in cooperation with all federal states and commissioned by the ministry of the interior interior minister thomas de maizi re said that based on the numbers presently available  he would forecast refugees to be as prone to committing crimes as native germans are  he explained that he had ordered the report in early october in order to provide proof to  dispel rumors about an increase in criminal acts in germany  this another lie just like the one about only  bad  mexicans coming to the united states  the interview with holt proved that   trump has not plan to tone down his hateful rhetoric and   he has no plans to start telling the truth  there is no way he is going to win over the voters he needs if he continues down the path that he is on  unless he wakes up one day and starts talking about equality  inclusiveness and apologizes to all of the people he offended  he has no chance in hell of ever sitting behind the desk in the oval office  but if a miracle happened and he somehow won  he would absolutely destroy our country   he just let us know watch featured image via video screenshot
