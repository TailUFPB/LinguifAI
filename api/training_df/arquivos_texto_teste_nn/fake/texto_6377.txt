ever since the supreme court effectively legalized same sex marriage nationwide  a few things have happened  the number of anti lgbt hate crimes has seemed to rise  the christian right has gone on the offensive  and  in the process  has been very offensive   and republicans just can t stop talking about men kissing and the possibility of penises in women s restrooms  a kentucky woman was a victim of one of the aforementioned hate crimes on thursday simply because a man thought she looked too masculine   and that s not even the worst part brittany nicole wallace wrote on her facebook timeline that a man assaulted her because she looks like a  dike   she recounted the horrifying experience he told me that he would  beat me like the man i want to be   he said   people like me make him hate the world   he started by hitting me over and over in the face until he got me down  after i was down he began to kick me in the stomach  side  and face  anyone that knows me knows that i tried my best to fight back  the truth is he was bigger and stronger than me then it gets heartbreaking  despite a number of onlookers  not a single person stepped in to help  not a single person had the decency to recognize that a man beating a woman even after she was on the ground is wrong i believe that if i had long hair and dressed more feminine this would not have happened to me  the sad part is that no one would come help me either  several people stood around and watched this happen to me  again  i truly believe that if i had a more feminine appearance someone would have helped despite the attack  wallace says that it has strengthened her resolve to fight against this kind of hatred this has not only physically but mentally and emotionally damaged me  i will do everything i can to try to put a stop to this hate and violence  i love people and try to help people all the time  all i ask if you read this is to please stop the hate  and help people when you see them getting hurt verbally  emotionally and physically she even included photos of her injuries this sort of hatred needs to stop  unfortunately  half the country follows a party whose entire platform is built on hatred  whose frontrunner practices almost every form of bigotry possible  unfortunately  with right wing media and politicians constantly reminding their  poorly educated  followers of the alleged evils of the lgbt community  even more unfortunately  we can expect this sort of thing if republicans manage to win not only the presidency  but seats in the senate and house we can t allow this to continue  vote blue in november   not just for the oval office  but for every office both local and national  let s start undoing the damage done by the republican party featured image via facebook
