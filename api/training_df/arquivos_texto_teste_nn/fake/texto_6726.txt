it s a wonder why donald trump has been divorced so many times  he s clearly such a good catch  note sarcasm  trump s going to tell us time and time again how wonderful he is  how great is for the nation  and what fantastic things he s going to do  here s the thing   he s all talk  and now buzzfeed has reminded us that he s not that great of a father either   or at least in the sense that a  great father  is one that actually wants to spend time with their kids while he touts how well he can provide for his family  he apparently thinks that money can by love  and who knows  maybe it does  yet  he most certainly made if very apparent during a  interview on the opie and anthony show that he wants nothing to do with actually taking care of his children  besides monetary support when asked if he changes diapers  he said  no  i don t do that there s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that  so you know  they go for it  they  go for it   like their being conned into actually caring for their child  god forbid a father actually want to take part in raising a child he added  if i had different type of wife  i probably wouldn t have a baby  ya know  cause that s not my thing  i m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t  it s just not for me  no  that s not being a  great father   that s being a sperm donor that provides monetary assistance to reiterate  he doesn t seem to think men should be acting  like the wife  he also said  i mean  i won t do anything to take care of them  i ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids  it s not like i m gonna be walking the kids down central park  and apparently during a  howard stern interview trump brought up how he hated the fact his ex wife marla maples had the audacity to suggest he bring their daughter on a walk  well  marla used to say   i can t believe you re not walking tiffany down the street   you know in a carriage  right  i m gonna be walking down fifth avenue with a baby in a carriage  it just didn t work  this really just goes down deeper to the fact that donald trump doesn t respect women   at all  he seems to thoroughly believe in gender roles  and i bet the fact that he may be running against hillary clinton in the general election sends shivers down his spine  how dare a woman think they can do a man s work after all  right  i mean  he s made it clear a man shouldn t do  women s work  trump can tout how  great  he is with women until he s blue in the face  but it s all a lie  just like with most everything else he says  he s a businessman trying to sell himself on being president  but he s clearly not remotely qualified  the fact that he s doing as well as he is speaks to the fact that he does know how to sell  however  come the general election with a far smarter electorate  that s reaches beyond the republican base of voters  they will make sure he never sets foot in the oval office featured photo by spencer platt getty images
