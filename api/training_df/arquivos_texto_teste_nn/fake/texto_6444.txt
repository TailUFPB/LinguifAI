cliven bundy and his unstable group of family and followers have been refreshingly quiet in recent months in the aftermath of their ill conceived hijacking of an oregon wildlife refuge and subsequent arrests  it s hard to  occupy  anything behind bars except  perhaps  a   slab of concrete  however  cliven is already jonesing for yet another stand off   and as his mental state deteriorates  the risk of danger grows bundy  currently jailed for his instigation of the previous armed standoff in   has hooked up with crazed anti obama right wing  lawyer  larry klayman  who has filed lawsuits against people ranging from obama to iran s supreme leader to  as the southern poverty law center points out   his own mother   the pair   which a judge ruled couldn t legally work together  but appear to be doing so anyway   have concocted a new lawsuit claiming sen  harry reid and president obama sent  federal storm troopers  to attack what they referred to as a gathering of  peaceful cowboys  peaceful  cowboys other parts of the lawsuit include accusations that reid wants to sell the land to the chinese and that the judge in the case should recuse herself because she s latino but even more troubling than the frivolous lawsuit is the fact that the bundy family has made no secret about wanting to kickstart yet another showdown with federal agents  the bundy family is still illegally grazing their cattle on federal lands  and the bureau of land management is getting pretty fed up with it  environmental groups are also urging the blm to act  because bundy s cattle   often times half starved and neglected   are destroying the wildlife in what was meant to be protected land angie bundy  wife of the currently locked up ryan  said her husband and his family being locked up is a conspiracy to make it easier to seize their land  in response  she said she and the family are prepared to face another standoff  she even sees a silver lining in the men being locked up  putting women and children in danger  she reasoned  would encourage other  patriots  to join the cause  just like last time  they plan on using children as shields  we re not afraid   angie added   if you have a bunch of women and children standing out there and protesting  it ll probably get more people out  what started as an inane property dispute over one man s right to ignore the law and enrich himself at the expense of the american taxpayer has increasingly become a sad spiral into some of the most toxic right wing conspiracy theories around  the heavily armed  patriots  that flock to bundy s side whenever he feels like pointing some guns at federal agents have detached themselves from reality  they quite literally believe they are at war with the united states government  and that means the odds that they react violently has skyrocketed  a third standoff almost guarantees tragedy   and the bundys are rushing headlong into it featured image via david becker getty images
