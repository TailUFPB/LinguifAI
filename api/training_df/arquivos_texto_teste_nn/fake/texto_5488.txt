donald trump has not yet officially received the republican party s presidential nomination   and there is a small effort still alive to derail him  though it is highly unlikely to be successful   but already a major official in the u s  government has spoken out on why one of trump s positions would cause him to leave his post cia director john brennan was speaking at an event at the brookings institution and was extremely blunt about his standing on waterboarding torture  if a president were to order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else i can say as long as i m director of cia irrespective of what the president says i m not going to be the director of cia that gives that order   he said at a wednesday event at the brookings institution   they will have to find another director  trump has often argued that he is in favor of waterboarding and torture  whose practice was encouraged by the george w  bush administration after   and the invasion of iraq  earlier in the year at a republican presidential debate in new hampshire  trump said   bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding  president obama barred the military from using waterboarding after he took office in january of   experts have said that waterboarding and other forms of torture not only violate the geneva conventions of war  they are also simply not a good tool to fight terrorism studies have shown that people subjected to torture give up information in order to stop the abuse  and more often than not the information given is faulty  since stopping the abuse and not accuracy is at the top of their minds most republicans have called for the use of torture to fight terrorism  but some oppose it  most notably senator john mccain  r az  who was subjected to torture when he was a hostage for the vietcong army during the vietnam war featured image via flickr
