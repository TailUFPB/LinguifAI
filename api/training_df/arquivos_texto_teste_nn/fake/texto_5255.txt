yes  seriously  republican delegates all received a trump themed gift bag after they suffered through the train wreck that was the republican national convention  the bags  which read  make america great again  on the sides  contained all sorts of trump related goodness including glasses and trump s political fiction novel  crippled america  these lucky recipients also got themselves a  make america great again  hat so their neighbors and friends know they have no problem wth racism and willful ignorance  kleenex they can use when hillary clinton trounces trump in november  and a fetus action figure  the fetus figure doesn t have kung fu action grip  but it does come with a stupid little card that serves as a reminder that republicans are entirely against women s rights  this card  which accompanies the disgusting fetus figures  is produced by the pro life company  heritage house bust reports that the heritage house site itself describes the models as  the most realistic fetal model ever developed  it s beautiful detail  softness and weight can really move hearts and change minds   well  i think if you re receiving one of these goodie bags as an rnc attendee  your mind is probably already made up this is just another reminder that a trump pence ticket is extremely dangerous  the republican party  at this point  has dedicated itself to radically dismantling planned parenthood  and they have worked hard to put as many roadblocks as possible between women and their legal right to choose to have an abortion  although  let s hope this soon changes due to a recent supreme court case  it may seem shocking that trump would include this in a self serving  self promoting collection of products that celebrate himself  but let s remember that he thinks women should be  punished  for having an abortion  pence has also signed a law that mandates funerals for aborted fetuses  so an item dedicated to making things harder on women during a time in which they are forced to make a difficult decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is absolutely something important enough to shove in a trump gift bag watch trump speak on the importance of punishing women for their health care choices below featured image via screengrab
