donald trump is stuck in a court battle over his failed trump university scheme  and because he will do anything to win  he has  of course  gone out and gotten the best attorney money can buy for this  to that end  he hired daniel petrocelli  who has represented everyone from enron s jeffrey skilling  to major companies like warner bros  and disney  petrocelli is also the lawyer who represented the goldman family in their successful wrongful death suit against o j  simpson so trump has a skilled  powerful attorney  and in other news  fire is hot  however  petrocelli is both a strange and notable pick for the donald  why  his political donation history shows that he s not anything like a trump supporter  or even republican  in fact  he s a registered democrat  and he s already maxed out the amount he can personally donate to none other than hillary clinton while trump rails against the law firm representing the plaintiffs in this case he claims they ve given hundreds of thousands of dollars to hillary s campaign he s ignoring the fact that his own lead attorney has those kinds of ties to hillary  too  if the plaintiffs  attorneys are out to get him because they re hillary supporters  then it follows that he should worry that his own lead attorney can t be trusted to represent him skillfully and fairly for that very same reason for instance  petrocelli has been very quiet while trump rails about everyone being biased against him  especially in this court case  he also directly contradicted trump s racist whining that judge gonzalo curiel  who is presiding over the trump u  case  can t be fair to trump because of his  mexican heritage  the judge is doing his job   said daniel petrocelli  shaking his head  when asked if planned to seek curiel s recusal  we re not seeking to recuse the judge   this doesn t worry king donald  how many brain cells does he have rattling around in his head of course  trump himself has come under fire from republicans for his past support of democrats  however  petrocelli s support isn t exactly in the past  records show that his most recent donations to hillary were in january of this year he also has a long history of giving financial support to other democrats  too  such as dianne feinstein and even al gore  he might be able to separate his political leanings from his work  but this is a very high profile case involving a presidential candidate  and the fact that he s a major supporter of his client s opponent won t help trump s falling poll numbers  or his terrible image among conservatives this actually speaks more to trump s intelligence and foresight   or lack thereof   than it does anything about petrocelli himself  he s completely undermined his own  everyone is against me  argument  and proven that he s nothing but a dimwitted  walking contradiction who looks for sparkle and jazz  yes  he hired petrocelli for his skill in the courtroom  but he s so paranoid and distrustful that this makes no sense  chances are  a lot of his other picks for a lot of other positions will make no sense either featured image by dave einsel getty images
