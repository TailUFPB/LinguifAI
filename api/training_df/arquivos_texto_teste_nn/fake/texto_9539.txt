pam geller is not the person you d ever want to go up against in a debate but cocky geraldo rivera tried it you guessed right if you guessed she at his lunch  she s one tough cookie pamela geller  he hates me more than the terrorists so i can t take much of what he says seriously fox is imploding right now  pam geller is attacking geraldo rivera for saying he needs to take a shower after she appears on the network    pic twitter com   thomas bishop     november    that geraldo insulted geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in texas geller has long been a target of radical islamists  her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight pam geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists  she spoke with the hollywood reporter about how she feels hollywood is  in the pocket  of jihadis  very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady pamela geller has been on a rampage against radical islam for years  beginning notably in  by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the  ground zero mega mosque  near the site of the destroyed world trade center  her most recent controversy was the organization of a  draw the prophet muhammad  contest in texas at the event  two self described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them  then  on june   police killed a knife wielding muslim man in boston whose goal was allegedly to behead geller in retaliation for the contest  even though the contest was a major news story  few media outlets published the winning cartoon  geller s group  american freedom defense initiative  put the image on billboards   of which debuted in st  louis on monday with the tagline  support free speech   she spoke to the hollywood reporter about how the  largely hostile  media is portraying these events why are you being overly provocative  purposely insulting muslims i am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting muslims  islamic jihadists  not i  made muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them  if we don t stand against them on that point  the only alternative is surrender and submission  i did not make the cartoons a flash point  the jihadis did but if you just don t insult their prophet  they ll leave you alone  no no  the death penalty for insulting muhammad is just one aspect of sharia  there is much  much more of infidel behavior that violates sharia  if we refrain from drawing muhammad  more demands to adhere to other aspects of sharia will follow  millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under islamic sharia law in muslim countries  islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the west there is no hate speech exception to the first amendment   hate speech  is a subjective judgment  if it were outlawed  the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate   if a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence  that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear  while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group  this results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others  cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire   especially in our country   and no one gets a pass  not the pope of rome  president of the united states or hollywood s biggest movie stars   if you don t like it  don t look at it  boycott the network that airs it  don t buy the publication  make counter images  make a million  fine  but you have to adjust to us  not we to you  and if that s too much  don t come here  threaten violence  commit violence  the consequences are yours to bear it seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the first amendment aren t persuaded by your arguments they are afraid of being killed by islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as  respect  for islam and muslims are there any tv hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews yes  martha maccallum  erin burnett  alisyn camerota  chris cuomo   although he let me speak and make my case how about behind your back yes  bill o reilly and laura ingraham  they said i was insulting the entire religion  one held by our moderate allies such as egypt and qatar  they are wrong in assuming that we must submit to sharia to placate moderates  rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech  roman catholics don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions  but roman catholics don t kill when their religion is mocked   and so no one talks about  provoking  them or  respecting  them  in any pluralistic society  we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked  roman catholics have learned that  mormons and others have learned that   look at the book of mormon on broadway  why must we condescend to muslims and think they cannot learn that  it s the low expectation of soft bigotry so this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don t no  chris hayes stuck up for me on msnbc  this is not a left right split  it is a free person slave split did any tv host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded they all say i have the right to draw muhammad but shouldn t out of respect  they don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands  cnn s erin burnett said i relished being the target of a beheading  it s madness  who self promotes to get killed so you re not purposely courting danger  as burnett and others have insinuated of course not  i love life  but i will not live as a slave are there any tv hosts you d like to face off with but who won t have you on bill o reilly  i expect he knows he would be shown up we know about the man arrested who intended to behead you  any other threats you can share i have received many threats  the fbi and nypd are aware of them and on the case anyone in hollywood reach out to you to offer support no should hollywood care about threats against you they may think they re exempt  but they aren t  islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to sharia as well  of course  most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend muslims  including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity  so hollywood is mostly already in their pocket  but this is their issue  and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space  the jihadists aren t just coming for me  they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom so why do you think hollywood  which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art  hasn t supported you they re afraid of being ostracized your  draw muhammad  event certainly got a lot of news coverage  should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon every media outlet should publish the muhammad cartoons  they can t kill us all  by kowtowing to violent intimidation  they are inviting more of it  instead  they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech  if the media had published the danish cartoons back in   this would never have become an issue  the submission by media  entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages the southern poverty law center included you on their list of  hate groups   are they right of course not  they re the hate group  using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hard left agenda  the splc smear machine does not profile jihad groups  but they target and libel patriots  veterans  tea party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom  they named  ben carson as a hate group  that should tell you everything you need to know about them  their  have violently attacked family groups  and one tried to assassinate tony perkins  president of the family research council  and a few months back an splc  killed three muslims in a parking dispute in north carolina email  paul bond thr com
