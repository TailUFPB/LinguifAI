harry reid is frightened  as all americans should be  donald trump is about to receive security briefings  and with trump s apparent complete inability to censor himself  and with his apparent ties to russia  that s a very dangerous thing  reid wants trump to get fake security briefings  how would the cia and the other intelligence agencies brief this guy  how could they do that  i would suggest to the intelligence agencies  if you re forced to brief this guy  don t tell him anything  just fake it  because this man is dangerous   reid said in an interview with the huffington post wednesday afternoon   fake it  pretend you re doing a briefing  but you can t give the guy any information  this guy  he s part of a foreign power   reid continued   we knew he liked putin before this  but this is quite ridiculous  while trump s big mouth has long been a matter of concern when it comes to the security briefings  we ve known for a long time that trump s top advisor  paul manafort  is in bed with the russians  but more recently   on wednesday  as a matter of fact   trump asked russia to hack us again and  find hillary clinton s missing emails  trump denies he does any business in russia  but as mother jones reports  that might be because of russia  trump has been trying to open the russian market since before the soviet union fell  in other words  republicans  trump was trying to do business with our enemies  the commies reid fell short of calling trump a traitor  but he does compare it to modern history s biggest political scandal  watergate  i think watergate was something that people understood  it was wrong  morally wrong  for the president of the united states to be involved in such trivia   he said   what trump is talking about is much worse than watergate  absolutely  trump hit back with his typical  i know you are but what am i   answer  he wants hillary clinton to be prevented from receiving security briefings  i have a real problem when hillary clinton  who gives open access to a phony server  is allowed to get these  briefings how does hillary clinton get a national security briefing  when she s been probably hacked  source  real clear politicstrump doesn t seem to understand that what clinton did was nowhere near what he is engaging in as we speak  harry reid is right  trump is dangerous  if they brief him  they should tell him nothing featured image via alex wong at getty images
