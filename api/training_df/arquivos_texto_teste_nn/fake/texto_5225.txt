ever since donald trump had the nerve to insult and attack the parents of a slain muslim soldier who sacrificed his life for his country  he s been getting backlash from both democrats and republicans  and it turns out  it s getting difficult for even the most die hard trump fans to defend him that s why when cnn contributor and trump lover scottie nell hughes was asked to defend the attacks trump made on the khan family  it didn t take long before she gave up and started complaining that there weren t enough trump supporters to back her up on the panel  completely disregarding the fact that there happened to be a well respected republican strategist on the panel as well  hughes accused cnn of being biased and whined  look at this panel  four versus one  co host kate bolduan tried to keep hughes focused to discuss the real matter at hand  and said  criticizing the makeup of a panel does not help the argument for donald trump  but they never could get to the real discussion  because hughes kept insisting that her nonstop complaints about the panelists were helping because she was calling out  continued media bias   embracing behavior that she might have learned from trump himself  hughes continued to have a childish meltdown to avoid getting to the real issues  hughes also accused prominent republicans like house speaker paul ryan  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  and sen  john mccain of  anti trump bias  because they d had the decency to speak out against trump s attacks on the gold star parents but the conversation eventually went back to the panel  which according to hughes  was not necessarily fair and balanced  it took a few minutes  but bolduan finally lost the last bit of her patience and said  oh my god  scottie  really if you want to waste more airtime talking about the weight of the panel go right ahead  i m actually really surprised that you would go on this route rather than making a cogent argument for your candidate  you can watch hughes throw a trump like temper tantrum below featured image is a screenshot
