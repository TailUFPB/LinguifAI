since the supreme court s ruling that legalized gay marriage  no state has worked quite as hard as alabama to see to it that the christian right s dependency on bigotry to exist is protected at all costs  this week the state senate took the next step in the battle against bigots and zealots having to acknowledge the law of the land by passing a bill that eliminates marriage licenses in the state altogether yes  rather than forcing clerks and judges to put their stamp of approval on what will undoubtedly cause the end of civilization as we know it  senate bill  takes the state completely out of the marriage game  residents would instead sign affidavits of a civil union  which clerks would receive and record  that way  when the trumpets sound and the archangel gabriel descends to turn mobile into salt  those who issue marriage licenses will be able to stand at the pearly gates and plead their case to st  peter with a clean conscience the bill  which reads  all requirements to obtain a marriage license by the state of alabama are hereby abolished and repealed  the requirement of a ceremony of marriage to solemnize the marriage is abolished   has been dubbed the  three way bill  by critics because it makes marriage between two people and their attorney  state senator greg albritton told reporters  when you invite the state into those matters of personal or religious import  it creates difficulties  early twentieth century  if you go back and look and try to find marriage licenses for your grandparents or great grandparents  you won t find it  what you will find instead is where people have come in and recorded when a marriage has occurred  early twentieth century  if you go back and look  was a time before marriages had to be legal for income tax purposes because there was no income tax  it makes no difference what way alabama republicans try to spin it  this is bill is designed to save christians from having to treat the gay community as people under any circumstances  the proposed law would still maintain a few state requirements for a civil marriage contract  minors between the ages of  and  would still need parental permission and the state would refuse to record a marriage contract if either party was already married or related by blood or adoption the funny thing is  had every state adopted a law just like this one when the issue came about  there would have been no need for a court case or a scotus ruling  two people dedicated to each other could enjoy all of the legal and tax advantages of their union while still being free to marry as their faith allows or requires  without interference from bigots at the clerk s office we would also have had the added advantage of never having to hear the name kim davis featured image from alabamaconnection org
