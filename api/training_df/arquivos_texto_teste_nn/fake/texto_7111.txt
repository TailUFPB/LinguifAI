we have always known that the republican party is filled with xenophobic  racist  misogynist  islamophobic  everythingphobic imbeciles  when president obama was elected in   this became very  very obvious as right wingers went full on racist because an african american man was suddenly the most powerful leader in the world  however  while we saw this hate all across the internet and sometimes on bumper stickers  they managed to sort of keep it under wraps  donald trump changed that all last year when he skyrocketed to first place in the gop primary by running on a platform made solely of the hate mentioned above  in fact  he is so vile and divisive that the huffington post reminds their readers of it on every single article they publish about him i was recently reading an article about trump on the huffpo s website when i noticed this at the bottom of the piece editor s note  donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar  rampant xenophobe  racist  misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims     billion members of an entire religion   from entering the u s this struck me as odd  so i investigated it a little further and saw the trump disclaimer on every article about the billionaire while huffpo has always been left leaning  it is a well respected news organization that is read by people across the political spectrum  that s what makes this editor s note so shocking  when politico asked the organization about their decision to add this to their articles  a spokesperson responded  yes  we re planning to add this note to all future stories about trump  no other candidate has called for banning   billion people from the country  if any other candidate makes such a proposal  we ll append a note under pieces about them  there is no doubt that this disclaimer will make some republicans declare the huffington post biased  but that s because they can t face the fact that it is true  trump is a serial liar  he lies seventy six percent of the time  he is a rampant xenophobe  just listen to what he has to say about mexicans and refugees  the frontrunner hates women  his feuds with conservative  fox mouthpiecemegyn kelly shone a bright  glaring spotlight on that  and we all know that his proclamations about president obama not being a real american is what originally made trump so popular the huffington post should be commended for this decision  they are the only mainstream media organization to do something this bold bravo  huffpo  bravo featured image via scott olson getty images
