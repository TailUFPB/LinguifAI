north carolina s republican governor allowed his own sexual hangups to influence his state and it has cost tens of millions of dollars  and counting  in lost business  a pr nightmare  and a justifiably outraged population who think fixing a problem that doesn t exist is a massive waste of time  in short  he tanked his state and has nothing but headaches to show for it rather than  say  fix the screw ups by reversing the anti lgbt bill that he signed into law and which allows north carolina businesses to legally discriminate against transgender people  he has instead doubled down and focused on changing the narrative  it s not going well on sunday  governor pat mccrory desperately tried to repair his reputation by appearing on meet the press  instead  he blundered into a series of cringeworthy  self owns  that make one wonder how he ever got elected in the first place  in almost slapstick fashion  mccrory managed to step on just about every rake in the yard as he stumbled from weak talking point to weak talking point putting on his tough guy voice  mccrory told host chuck todd that he wouldn t be bullied by the boycotts  the loss of business  the national condemnation  or his own citizens  desires  he also said he would stand against the human rights campaign  which he misidentified as the  human relations commission     because if there is anything that will help prove you re not a monster  it s proudly attacking an organization that fights for human rights in an awkward exchange  mccrory said his critics were trying to silence him by not holding a  dialogue  on the issue  which prompted todd to point out that republicans had repeatedly refused to debate the discriminatory bill before forcing it through the state legislature and hurriedly signing it into law mccrory also acknowledged that he didn t meet with a single trans person before signing the bill  but that he has met a few at some point in his life   he also claimed a guy at an all you can eat buffet hugged him   the fact that he didn t meet with the people who would be most affected by his legalized discrimination speaks volumes  notably  south dakota s governor had a similar bill on his desk around the same time  he actually spoke with the trans community   and ultimately decided to veto it  it s almost as if talking to the potential victims can impact the decision  go figure however  the best blunder came near the end  when finally pressed into a corner over the fact that north carolina has become one of the least gay friendly states in the country under his eye  mccrory did the only sensible thing   he blamed batman  this is basically a restroom privacy issue  versus equality  and these things need to be discussed  not threatened by hollywood or anyone  you know  hollywood  with all due respects to the hollywood  the new batman and robin movie is playing in china  which has anti gay  terrible  terrible human rights violations  the new batman and robin movie  the argument is complete and utter nonsense  it s safe to say that even his supporters were probably watching this interview with a mixture of bafflement and terror  when the greatest advocate for your hate bill is reduced to claiming batman playing in chinese theaters justifies his own intolerance  you might as well just hang a sign around your neck that says  we lost  watch pat mccrory s very bad day below featured image via nbc news screengrab
