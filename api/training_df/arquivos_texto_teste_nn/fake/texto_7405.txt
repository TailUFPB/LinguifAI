while i don t believe donald trump can possibly win a general election against a coma patient  much less hillary clinton or bernie sanders  i am growing concerned with how eager the police seem to be to attack his detractors  from arresting peaceful protesters after they were physically assaulted to pepper spraying protesters for little to no reason  the police appear to be casting their votes early in a video uploaded to youtube  police can be seen attempting to shove protesters behind barricades as a a chant of  f ck trump  can be heard officers can also be seen moving through the crowd taking pictures as the protesters are pushed from multiple directions according  lukewearechange  who uploaded the video  police did resort to pepper spray and arrests were being made here s the video the police shoving the protesters back considering the police have been almost completely ignoring the escalating violence of trump s brownshirts  it s worrying how quick they are to arrest and abuse anti trump protesters  at what point will they do their jobs and protect all citizens  not just the conservative ones the biggest question is going to be this  when republicans figure out how to deny trump the nomination and his cult members riot  will the police treat them like they treat liberals or will right wing privilege kick in  i ve been trying to think of a single time that the police have pepper sprayed conservative protesters  i personally watched a group push past barricades and march right up to the steps of the capitol and the police did exactly nothing  sure  they kept them from going any further but i also saw how the police treated the occupy wall street protesters and they would have been hosed down with pepper spray before they got within  feet on the building it makes you wonder just how much support from the police a president trump would have if he declared martial law and suspended the bill of rights featured image via screen capture
