cnn s brian stelter called out  fox   friends  for doing a  disservice to viewers   but his reasoning may leave you scratching your head   in fact  we re sure it will leave you puzzled as you probably know  it was reported on thursday that trump s approval at the end of his first year in office is on par with obama s approval rating at the same time during his presidency daily caller reports  fox   friends  shared this fact on air friday morning  leading the president to tweet this out while the fake news loves to talk about my so called low approval rating   foxandfriends just showed that my rating on dec      was approximately the same as president obama on dec      which was   and this despite massive negative trump coverage   russia hoax   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    brian stelter  according to stelter  it is a  disservice  to make any comparisons of poll numbers that are favorable toward trump  it is especially bad if trump signals that he is happy with what has been reported  this is a prime example of how  fox   friends  does a disservice to viewers   stelter tweeted this is a prime example of how  fox   friends  does a disservice to viewers  https   t co erjbotahbo  brian stelter   brianstelter  december    s review the facts on dec      according to a rasmussen poll  obama had a  percent approval rating  on dec      trump had a  percent approval rating  obama s approval rating on december      just one day later   was  percent  the exact same as trump s so brian stelter is apparently angry that fox news reported poll numbers that are factually accurate because they happen to be favorable to the president  very unbiased fox could start telling lies like stelter and cnn do all the time watch this classic moment where the weather channel ceo calls  baloney  on the global warming claims by stelter  john coleman  founder  the weather channel  appeared on cnn s reliable sources with host brian stelter  after writing an open letter to ucla denying the existence of anthropogenic global warming  this is a great takedown coleman told stelter that  cnn has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus  well there is no consensus in science  science isn t a vote  science is about facts   and that he was  terribly disappointed  by his former network  the weather channel  because it  has bought into   but so has all the media  that s no big surprise  coleman notes that he is  not a  paid shill   as has been claimed  of the koch brothers   concluding his letter with a link to heartland s nongovernmental international panel on climate change  nipcc  website  coleman s open letter to ucla was sent to numerous local television stations in the los angeles area  as well as the los angeles times coleman produced a special report for kusi tv  entitled global warming  the other side  the program suggests that global warming is a scam and presents what colemen contends is evidence of a deliberate manipulation of world temperature data by nasa and other groups
