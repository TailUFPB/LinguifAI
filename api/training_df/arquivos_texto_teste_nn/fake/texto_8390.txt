texas senator ted cruz has won the  republican presidential caucus in iowa  cruz won with   of iowa precincts reporting in  he earned   of the vote  with about   republicans casting their vote for the social conservative cruz beat out donald trump and marco rubio  beating out the result of the highly respected des moines register poll  that had put trump ahead of cruz by   many observers believe that cruz was able to overcome trump s constant media appearances and a campaign that sucked up a lot of the oxygen in the political world while cruz has won the caucus  history has not been kind to recent winners  the last two winners  rick santorum and mike huckabee  received a bump in support after winning the caucus  but were not able to martial the religious right on to success in other states like south carolina and new hampshire cruz also faces headwinds from senator marco rubio  r fl   who did better than expected in a third place finish  it can be expected that money from the republican establishment will flow to rubio  continuing the stampede away from jeb bush who only managed a single digit in iowa and is not expected to be a strong contender in new hampshire in a strange turn of events  trump could act as a spoiler candidate  wedged between cruz and rubio but without being beholden to big ticket donors or the party elite for the general election  many democrats are probably salivating over a candidate like cruz  he is anti choice  a darling of the extremist right  and a candidate who has based his entire run on turning out far right voters instead of even remotely attempting to appeal to moderate  swing voters  trump may have scared the party so much that cruz now appears  acceptable  to them  but not to america featured image via flickr
