donald trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory  but this time he has targeted a fellow republican  ted cruz cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls  particularly in evangelical heavy iowa  so as he has done in the past trump went on the attack donald trump said in an interview that rival ted cruz s canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the texas senator vulnerable if he became the republican presidential nominee  republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question   do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years   that d be a big problem   trump said when asked about the topic   it d be a very precarious one for republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision  you don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head  trump added   i d hate to see something like that get in his way  but a lot of people are talking about it and i know that even some states are looking at it very strongly  the fact that he was born in canada and he has had a double passport  trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory  before the  election  trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that president obama release his birth certificate  trump even claimed that he had enlisted right wing arizona sheriff joe arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to hawaii to investigate obama s past the reality tv star even made a bizarre video requesting obama s college records in order for the hawaiian born president to prove his citizenship senator cruz s mother was a u s  citizen when she gave birth to him in calgary  canada  which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural born citizen  of the united states  while cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens  he is easily eligible to be president of the united states after years of trying to de legitimize president obama through two terms  it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates  like so much of their rhetoric  it resembles frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies featured image via flickr
