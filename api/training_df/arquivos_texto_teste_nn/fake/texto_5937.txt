kansas  education system is a mess  thanks to the republican led legislature s budget cuts  funding allocation is heavily biased against poorer schools  and the state s supreme court ordered the legislature to fix it so it was both fair and in line with the state s constitution  so what are these republicans doing instead  they re looking for ways to undermine the supreme court instead of doing their jobs the kansas supreme court said that all schools would remain closed across the state until the legislature fixed the funding problems  they re supposed to meet on june   ahead of the june  deadline set by the court  to work on the issue however  in a move that s oh so typical of crooked republicans  they re going to meet next week to discuss an amendment to the state constitution to limit the power of the court  instead of understanding that they screwed up and putting forth an honest effort to fix education funding the house and senate judiciary committees will put their heads together and plot this out next week  the plan  find a way to stop the court from ever halting funding in the future  they re wrapping the issue in the pretty paper of  the people of kansas should be deciding this  not the courts   and tying it neatly with a satin bow of  we need to have discussions on this  not court orders  in other words  they re sounding the gop s trumpet of alarm on what they think is a runaway court system because the courts aren t doing what they want what they re not thinking about  and they re republicans so why would they   is all the innocent students  teachers and administrators caught up in this  special education students  for instance  could see some necessary summer classes cancelled if the schools lose their funding  along with federal funding the state is mandated to evaluate students with disabilities and create individual education programs that fit their needs  and  for some students  that includes summer school in order to ensure they continue to progress throughout the entire year there are also teachers who are starting to look for jobs out of state because they ve had it with republicans  inability to do anything for the people  one teacher said  they need to do what the kids do  sit down and solve a problem  that would be so nice if they did  but  in light of the gop s political crusade against the courts  they d rather hamstring their state courts than actually solve the problem  of course  they ve acknowledged that this amendment  if it went through  wouldn t affect the current crisis  however  it could ensure that the courts have a harder time addressing future funding problems that hurt innocent people featured image via alex wong getty images
