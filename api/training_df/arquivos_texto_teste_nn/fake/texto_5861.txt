more and more people have had just about enough of donald trump s ridiculous shenanigans  trump has been racist  misogynistic  islamophobic  and has catered to groups that hate lgbt equality  he s a person who has no right running for president of the united states  not only because of his bigoted views  but because he has absolutely no experience whatsoever with donald trump being so scrutinized by so many  including the press that has the freedom to ask him questions and report what he says  trump has taken action against the press  he s been prohibiting news organizations from attending his events  an action that goes directly against the freedom of press listed in the united states constitution  the latest publication trump has gone after is the washington post now  taking action against trump in the same regard  is late night host seth meyers  on his latest show  meyers brilliantly went after trump for his reaction to the orlando shooting  but also stated  as for the washington post  we here at late night believe in freedom of the press and therefore have decided to stand in solidarity with them  so as long as the washington post is banned from donald trump s campaign  donald trump will be banned from ever coming on this show  good on you  seth  hopefully that becomes a trend featured image via video screen capture
