the house select committee on benghazi  which was actually just an attempt to smear hillary clinton all over the sidewalk  has pretty much concluded  and they found exactly nothing  republicans should all hang their heads in shame and leave it alone now  particularly the conspiracy theorists  they aren t  though  betrayed  the right wing conspiracy nutballs are turning their anger over benghazi to trey gowdy trey gowdy  who was supposed to deliver a verdict that benghazi happened because of hillary  all wrapped up in a neat little package and tied off with a pretty pink bow  trey gowdy  who was supposed to be the only one who could successfully investigate benghazi  because the other zillion investigations likewise turned up nothing and republicans weren t satisfied with that   trey gowdy  who was supposed to be able to turn the heat up so high on hillary and everyone else that they d crack under the strain and spill everything trey gowdy  who is now disgraced in the eyes of republicans and democrats alike  albeit for very different reasons michael savage  a far right wing radio host that pushes conspiracy nonsense  actually said  trey gowdy should be impeached for wasting my time  he promised us a lot  remember  he totally forgot the fact that members of congress can t be impeached  they can just be kicked out entirely  that little tidbit aside  it was the house that voted for a new investigation and put gowdy in charge  shouldn t they all be thrown out now for wasting two years and millions of taxpayer dollars  not to side with gowdy here  but he hardly acted alone the citizens  commission on benghazi  which is made up primarily of right wing douchecanoes looking for anything they can find to topple hillary  is likewise angry with gowdy  during a meeting  retired admiral james lyons said  chairman gowdy is not a stenographer        he was there to make findings and conclusions  he had the information  he copped out  which is consistent that we ve seen with all our congressional leadership  retired general thomas mcinerney is likewise wheeling around on gowdy  he american people want to know from a group that spent almost two years on it what the conclusions are  that s what we pay you for  mr  gowdy  but perhaps the silliest  most ridiculous moment came when a woman from the crowd at that meeting asked a truly out there question  has someone in the gop leadership gotten their fingers involved in watering down some of this to benefit secretary clinton  because she can t possibly be innocent  they know things  nobody on this commission argued that question in fact  that less than reputable group has put together its own report  full of inventive accusations   as the washington post s dana milbank put it  this report claims to know that obama and hillary both are in bed with al qaeda  that the u s  government submitted to islamic law on slander  and that the obama administration switched sides in the war on terror and since gowdy couldn t deliver what they wanted in an official report  he s now solely to blame for the failure of what was supposed to be the investigation that would finally prove hillary guilty  this is absolutely hilarious gowdy s career will probably end in disgrace  it s hard to feel sorry for him  though  he did everything he could  no matter how dishonest or unethical it was  to help the gop bury hillary featured image by mark wilson getty images
