the credibility of beverly young nelson  the woman who accused roy moore of making sexual advances toward her when she was a teen  has been shattered   shortly after nelson appeared on television with leftist attorney gloria allred   her stepson made the difficult decision of coming out and saying that his stepmother was lying in a facebook video he made to set the record straight about his father

wictor made his case through a series of tweets that the alleged roy moore signature in a high school yearbook nelson used as  evidence  of her story was forged  conservative media outlets began to demand that the yearbook was examined by a neutral party  nelson and her attorney  gloria allred refused  nelson remained silent for weeks while the controversy about the allegedly forged high school yearbook continued to catch fire in the media breitbart news reports that beverly young nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney gloria allred used as proof of her accusations against u s  senate candidate roy moore and in yet another blow to the credibility of abc news  the disgraced  left wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding  notes  to the inscription  worse still  the reporter actually coaches nelson  puts words in her mouth  downplay the enormous significance of her deceit beverly young nelson  one of the women accusing gop senate candidate roy moore of sexual misconduct  tells  gma it  sickens  her to think what might happen if moore is elected  https   t co  pic twitter com   abc news politics   abcpolitics  december    nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription   abc news tells us   but the message was all roy moore  abc news reporter tom llamas just couldn t help himself  as he coaches nelson to make sure she is still able to cling to a portion of her story llamas   beverly  he signed your yearbook  nelson   he did sign it  llamas  for his part encouraged her to get her story straight   and you made some notes underneath  nelson replied   yes  and then  after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the republican nominee for the u s  senate in alabama  abc news quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence llamas also fails to ask any follow ups  such as  if the explanation is this simple  why wait all these weeks to offer it   or   why did you lie  nelson is accusing moore of attempting to assault her when she was just  years old  with the election just four days away  this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for moore  nelson and allred are planning a news conference friday  but nothing will overcome the forgery admission how can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing  early reports are that nelson and allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery  so a proven forger is bringing in her own expert  what an insult to the people of alabama another problem with nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge  as a circuit judge  moore ruled against her in a  divorce case the moore campaign has been pressuring nelson and allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis  now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored with nelson now thoroughly discredited  this leaves two accusers against moore one is leigh corfman  who claims moore molested her as a  year old child  she is the most credible of the three  but the narrative behind her story  that moore s abuse resulted in corfman s living a troubled life of  drinking  drugs  boyfriends  and a suicide attempt   is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records moore s final accuser is tina johnson  a woman who claims moore groped her butt in his office in   but  again  as was the case with corfman and nelson  the left wing media outlets reporting these allegations  the washington post  al com  either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context thanks to new media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting  we now know that johnson did not tell the entire truth  she was not in moore s office  on business   if she was in moore s office at all  it was due to a bitter custody battle where moore represented johnson s mother  who was trying to gain custody of johnson s  year old son based on the claim that johnson was an  unfit  absent  and unstable mother  if the media and the accusers and gloria allred told the full truth to begin with  they would all be more credible here are close up versions of the signatures  note  that when viewed close up  the signature is signed in both black and blue ink here is a closer version of the yearbook signature here is wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink    the light is reflecting off of the ink the ink that looks blue is actually black  it s different ink than the original ink therefore it reflects light differently   thomas wictor   thomaswictor  november      so  to recap the signature is a forgery  and everything after the name  roy ray  was added later with different ink  pic twitter com   thomas wictor   thomaswictor  november    like the  th  doomed dan rather   da  will doom the anti roy moore forces  they copied his signature on nelsons divorce order not realizing  da  was his assistants initials  not his title  the sheer stupidity  pic twitter com   truthhurts     november    the yearbook signature came into question  moore s attorney came out  with a statement regarding the signature in the high school yearbook  here s what he had to say roy moore s attorney    said that ms  nelson after the allegations had never seen or had any contact with judge moore  in   ms  nelson filed a divorce action  the judge assigned was roy s  moore   pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  november
