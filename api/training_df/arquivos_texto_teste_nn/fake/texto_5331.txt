democratic national committee chair debbie wasserman schultz is stepping down as chair of the dnc  effective the second she gavels the philadelphia convention closed   this move comes on the heels of dnc insider emails that were leaked that appear to show that the dnc was in the tank for for former secretary of state hillary clinton to win the democratic nomination over unlikely rival vermont senator bernie sanders  the leaked documents were simply the straw that broke the camel s back  though  wasserman schulz has been a divisive figure within the party leadership for sometime now  and after this democratic leaders decided that she had to go  wasserman schultz says of the decision  going forward  the best way for me to accomplish those goals  is to step down as party chair at the end of this convention  as party chair  this week i will open and close the convention and i will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for democrats  but for all americans  wasserman schultz will now speak on monday afternoon  though originally she had been removed from all speaking slots at the democrats  big event  however  it seems that her supporters  and even the outgoing dnc chair herself fought for her right to be able to speak  senator sanders had this to say on the subject what does this mean for the democratic party  it means more party unity  that s what  we cannot win in november   or any other election   if the party splits  in the beginning  everyone underestimated the power of sen  sanders  message  and it seems that rank and file  establishment democrats and party leaders saw him and his supporters as a distraction and an annoyance rather than someone whose ideas and policy proposals should be taken seriously  this was a mistake  we can never assume that everyone is as loyal to any political party as said party s leadership would like them to be now  as a firm clinton supporter  i have had my issues with bernie sanders and his supporters  however  party unity and beating donald trump is the top priority  not petty infighting  sanders had great influence over this year s party platform  the most progressive in the party s history   and he and his supporters should be proud of what they have accomplished now that dws is out of our way  let s go forth and kick butt and elect democrats from the top of the ballot down in november feataured image via andrew burton getty images
