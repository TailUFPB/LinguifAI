maury is perhaps one of the trashiest shows on television today  it s right in line with the likes of the gutter trash that is jerry springer  and the fact that those shows are still on the air with the shit they air really is a sad testament to what americans find to be entertaining  however  maury really crossed the line with a facebook post regarding one of their guest s appearance with a vile  disgusting caption on tuesday evening there was a young woman on there doing one of their episodes regarding the paternity of her child  however  on the page  the show posted an image of the woman  who happens to bear a striking resemblance to senator and presidential candidate ted cruz  the caption from the maury show page read  the lie detector test determined  that was a lie   ted cruz is just not that sexy  as if that weren t horrible enough  the caption underneath the imgur upload reads   ted cruz in drag on maury  here is an image from the official maury facebook page here is the embed of the post itself this is beyond despicable  it s bad enough that this show preys on desperate people to keep their trashy show going and their audience of bottom feeders entertained  but now they publicly mock them as well  this young woman cannot help how she looks or who she resembles  that is not her fault  shaming someone s looks on social media is something we d expect from the morons who watch this crap on a daily basis  but it is not something the official show page should be doing  then again  what can you expect from a show that rolls in the mud for a living and continues to show the world that there is now low they will not stoop to  this was more than a step too far  though maury  you owe this young woman a public apology  a very public apology  there s just no excuse for this  no matter the demographics of your audience or what you do on that disgusting show of yours  i suppose it will be too much to ask that you lose viewers over this  because the people who watch your trashy ass show likely aren t educated enough to understand why this is so wrong in the first place  i don t watch  so i can t deprive you of my viewership  but i can call you out shame on you  maury show and everyone associated with this despicable facebook post  you really showed your true colors here today featured image via facebook
