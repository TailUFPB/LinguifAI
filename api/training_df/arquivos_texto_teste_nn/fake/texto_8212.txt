when you ve never been taught what a figure of speech is  you will take everything everyone ever says to you very literally  same goes for christian fundamentalists who practice the literal interpretation of the bible  candace cameron bure seems to be both while appearing on fox   friends  the fuller house star and sister of the uber fundie christian kirk cameron  decided she would weigh in on what madeleine albright joked about while introducing hillary clinton at a recent campaign event  albright said  there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other  it was meant in jest  and clearly not to be taken as telling women they literally belong in the hell as described in the bible  however  bure didn t see it that way at all  visibly upset  she tells the fox hosts  anyone that can even joke  if it was a joke  about hell  there s nothing to me that s funny about that if anybody actually read their bible and saw what   the description of hell  it s disgusting  to be honest  what would be scarier for a lot of people would be   there s a special place at the bottom of a chuck e cheese ball pit  but i digress bure took this comment made by albright very personally and then somehow magically linked it to abortion  because why not  then she said  to say that they re not feminists  that they re anti women if they re not supporting another woman is   you know  that to me is what s wrong with feminism  that is a turnoff for me as a woman  someone clearly missed the day in her women s study course that explained part of feminism is empowering all women  even women who in their abortion choices  choose life and those who advocate for that cause  that s their right if they so choose  no one is telling bure how to think  and albright was simply pointing out the fact that if any woman were to tell another woman  say candace cameron bure  that they were wrong for the mere fact that they re a woman  then there s a special place in h e  double hockey sticks  for them all too often in society  women s voices are placed on the back burner  this happens in the home  it happens in the workplace  and in happens in politics  and yes  women  who don t help each other are of detriment to not only those in their immediate surroundings  but in all of society  women can sometimes find themselves trying with all their might to compete in a male dominated world  and while men pat themselves on the back regularly help each other rise up  women don t often have that luxury  because they are working hard on themselves  that s why feminism is important  that s why what madeleine albright said is true  and that s why women everywhere need to make sure we are making all women inclusive in the workplace  in politics  and in society so  bure  while your concerns are heard  they are unfounded  you are more than allowed to be pro life and still advocate for other women to be heard and seen as well  and no  madeleine albright doesn t actually want people to go to hell  it s a figure of speech  video featured image from raw story youtube
