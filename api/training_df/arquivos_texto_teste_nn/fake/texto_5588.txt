shortly after midnight tuesday morning   year old alton sterling was standing outside a triple s food mart in baton rouge selling music cds when the police responded to a call that he had threatened someone with a gun  the police have yet to say if a gun was found at the scene  although a witness claims the police removed one from his pocket  but we do have a video showing the police throwing sterling to the ground  pinning him and then shooting him several times while yelling about a gun that is never seen in the video  the entire scene was caught on camera by some bystanders and the community is furious at what appears to be yet another black man unnecessarily killed by white cops warning  this video contains graphic violence while the police were  forced  to tackle sterling  once they wrestled him to the ground  he puts up little struggle  considering how big he is  he appears to be about at least  feet tall and well over  pounds   if he was resisting  one would expect a lot more movement  and when the cops pull their guns on him  it s not all clear that sterling was in any position to shoot them amazingly  the officers involved were given time to get their stories straight in a statement  baton rouge police cpl  l jean mckneely jr  said two officers  have been placed on administrative leave per standard procedure   though it is believed that only one officer fired shots the officers have not been named  our guys will most likely review the video tomorrow   mckneely told the washington post in an email tuesday night  we give officers normally a day or so to go home and think about it  before being interviewed  mckneely told the advocate it s good to be a cop in america the police are almost certain to claim that sterling was  reaching  for a gun but an eyewitness is already disputing this  abdullah muflahi  the owner of the triple s  said the police clearly had a chip on their shoulder when they confronted sterling and there was no reason to pull their guns and shoot him muflahi told the advocate  his hand was nowhere  his pocket   and that sterling was not holding a weapon then  muflahi said that the officer who fired the shots began cursing and that both seemed to be  freaking out  finally  the store owner said he heard one of the officers say   just leave him  muflahi said he saw police retrieve a gun from sterling s pocket after the shooting  just leave him   there s that compassion and humanity for minorities that american law enforcement is known for unfortunately  sterling had a criminal record that included  aggravated battery  domestic abuse  possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute and illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance  so there is literally no chance the cops involved will face any kind of justice even if the security tape from the store shows sterling s hand nowhere near his pocket at any time featured image via twitter
