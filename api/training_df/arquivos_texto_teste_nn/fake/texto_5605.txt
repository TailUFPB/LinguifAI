donald trump is an embarrassment to the gop and  more importantly  to the nation  he is also the most outrageously dangerous major party presidential candidate that america has seen in recent memory   perhaps ever  well  many people on both the left and the right know this  and have jumped on the  nevertrump train  now  there is a very interesting development  a group of women who have been lifelong republicans doing all they can to elect presumptive nominee hillary clinton the group is calling itself  republican women for hillary   and spent their  of july evening holding the first meeting of their fledgling organization at washington s st  regis hotel  these women are definitely not your typical hillary supporters  one of them admittedly spent copious amounts of time campaigning against abortion rights  and another is a southern baptist who is basically against everything hillary clinton and democrats in general stand for  however  their mission is to make sure donald trump never gets anywhere near the oval office   even if it means doing all they can to elect hillary clinton u s  chamber of commerce employee and staunch republican jennifer lim  who helped found the group  explains the logic  it s really important that republican leaders  especially republican women leaders  stand up right now and say we re not ok with trump representing our party  this is not a position i ever wanted to find myself in  but it s important that when things like this happen that people speak up  it is important to note that this group is in no way affiliated with the clinton campaign  but they do intend to do their own campaigning and activist activities  including urging people to vote for clinton  while also helping conservatives facing political backlash for condemning donald trump and his destructive  dangerous campaign here is the tweet from the group s twitter  endorsing clinton we re with her   gopwithher  imwithher https   t co   rwfh   gopwomenwithher  june    milloy  who is a member of republican woman for hillary but also works for a conservative think tank called american action forum  seems conflicted and it is clear the decision was not easy to join this group  however  her resolve is solid  she says   it has been tough for me to come to this point where i can vote for a candidate who has been very against what i ve been working for for most of my professional career  that being said  i can t vote for someone like donald trump because he s overtly racist and misogynist  jennifer lim goes on to clarify the group s position  are you a republican who thinks  realdonaldtrump should not become president tell us why  https   t co ovweppnxoc  hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  may    image via david mcnew getty images
