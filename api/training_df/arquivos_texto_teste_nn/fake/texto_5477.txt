anyone with a brain knows that donald trump is an embarrassment to the united states on the world stage at best  and dangerously unqualified to hold the office of the presidency at worst  despite these facts  many in the gop establishment have lined up behind the billionaire who unexpectedly became their presumptive nominee  however  there is a problem  there are gop delegates who are doing all they can to deny trump the nomination at the gop convention in cleveland  which is just days away because of the apparently inevitable convention floor fight  the rules committee meeting that began at   am as scheduled was suddenly halted once a delegate put forth the idea of a rule that would disallow lobbyists from joining the republican national committee  rnc   after that  rnc chairman reince priebus scuttled away into a private meeting with senator mike lee  r utah  and some of the  nevertrump delegates  also present was colorado delegate and  free the delegates  leader  kendal unruh  who wants the rnc rules committee to unbind the delegates and allow them to vote against trump  no matter what the voters in their state decided there were surely clashes in this meeting  as fierce  nevertrump types like unruh were in that impromptu secret meeting with people such as platform committee member jim bopp  who vehemently opposes any and all efforts to stop trump  there was also former virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli  who seems to wish to dismantle the amount of power the rnc has altogether in other words  just days before the gop convention  the event that is supposed to be the party s big coming out  there is utter chaos  and it is all because of donald trump  the illustration of just how chaotic it all has become is all in the excuse that was given to the press for the abrupt disruption of the rules committee session  a printer had jammed and they were making sure that got fixed first  absolutely hilarious  to democrats  at least featured image via mark wilson getty images
