denver broncos quarterback and two time super bowl champ peyton manning makes a great commercial  his boyish looks and unassuming southern drawl combined with a squeaky clean image make him the perfect poster boy for just about any product aside from being a papa john schnatter loving  jeb bush supporting republican who sends maximum donations to gop campaigns regularly  peyton manning has what appears to be a polished past with nothing but daisies  rainbows and nfl records dotting it  as with most republicans  however  the illusion at some point comes crashing down  as it turns out  the already famous manning was reportedly responsible for an assault of a sexual nature and subsequent cover up that changed the course of a woman s career while he was in college at the university of tennessee the woman  dr  jamie ann naughright  wasn t a random female student who could be bullied into silence the way so many in the twisted world of men s college sports are  she was a student volunteer on the training staff and a pioneer in a field where only men had previously prevailed according to court records recently uncovered by the new york daily news  a  page scandal was swept under the rug and a great woman was forced to leave a campus and a job she loved because peyton manning was a foolish and vulgar scumbag  after months of abuse by the misogynist coaching staff  who joked that she must be a lesbian and called her  c nt bumper   dr  naughright s glass ceiling was raised to impossible heights by none other than number  the story begins with manning suffering a typical football injury and naughtright  whose name was whited at the time  attending to him  she said that manning had first asked her personal questions  including if she  hung out  with people she worked with  then things got infinitely worse after turning down his advances  manning decided to drop trou while dr  naughright had her head down  when she hears chuckles from the others in the room  she looked up to see manning s privates in her face  according to the court documents  naughright said  it was the gluteus maximus  the rectum  the testicles and the area in between the testicles  and all that was on my face when i pushed him up  to get leverage  i took my head out to push him up and off  such blatant lewd behavior and disrespect for a woman who was trying to help him shows a different character than the one the nfl has sold its fans for nearly two decades  not only did manning stick his privates in this woman s face  he and the coaching staff tried to blame the incident on a black player  according to documents  and went on to downplay it as  mooning  they went so far as to involve yet another player  who was supposedly the target of said mooning  who rebuffed the theory that naughright accidentally placed her own face in the path of manning s ass  yes  it really did get that ridiculous  the other player rebuffed the claim  telling manning in a letter that he should  take responsibility  for what he did after the incident was reported  manning was punished with the removal of his  privilege to eat at the athletic facilities dining room  and requiring him to run at   a m  for two weeks   the dining room ban was then reduced to two weeks as well  dr  naughright ended up being forced out of the university with a   settlement and a confidentiality agreement  for her  the incident was over for manning  however  the incident needed to be put into his own context  most likely as a pre emptive strike against the truth ever coming out  in a book released by him and his father  archie  manning tells a completely different story of a woman he called  vulgar   while he admitted his behavior was  inappropriate   he placed most of the blame on dr  naughright  claiming she had a foul mouth and that she yearned to be  one of the guys   in his book  manning described his feelings towards women in the manly man s world of football  never mind that women in the men s locker room is one of the most misbegotten concessions to equal rights ever made   manning wrote   when dad played  there was still at least a tacit acknowledgment that women and men are two different sexes  with all that implies  and a certain amount of decorum had to be maintained  meaning when it came to training rooms and shower stalls  the opposite sex was not allowed  common sense tells you why  misogyny is what tells you why  peyton manning s need to display his superiority over a woman who had halted his advances tells you why at the time  naughright was working at florida southern college and while she wasn t named  it became common knowledge that she was the trainer manning was referring to in his book  she ended up leaving the school and filing a defamation lawsuit against manning  which is where the  pages of documents came from usa today picked the story up in  but didn t release the documents they obtained that incriminated manning  instead  they ran a piece about an unnamed woman who took a mooning incident the wrong way  clearing the way for manning s squeaky clean image to move forward here we are  on what seems to be the waning days of manning s career  and lo and behold the truth comes out  consequences at this point for manning will probably be non existent  because even though what he did and how he treated this woman were disgusting  he has two super bowl rings and the undying admiration of millions of fans to those of us keeping score  manning belongs in another club of players  the ones who got away with something horrible  featured image via biography com
