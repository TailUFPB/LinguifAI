marco rubio s staff had to exit the building they were working in when the senator began smoking from the trouser region  alarms and sprinklers were set off  leading to an investigation the fire chief was able to dismiss as self inflicted  liar  liar pants on fire  the incident happened when rubio  who tells a wonderful story about how his parents came to the united states to escape the castro regime  meaning they would have come in   unfortunately  records have proven  and rubio has himself admitted  that the actual date his parents migrated to miami was   when castro was still living and plotting from mexico so why the discrepancy  rubio says he was passing along the family s  oral history   yes  oral history  that s when you don t like your family s actual history so you make something up  my family  for example  landed in new hampshire  but since nobody cares about anything in the  but plymouth  i am now a direct descendent of the mayflower according to oral history  that was easy rubio s ridiculous answer fits in with the motif of the republican party of derp  if something doesn t make sense  ignore it until it just goes away  rubio comes along with his  i appeal to latinos  mentality  some of which is a direct result of the lies he told  how much will those same latinos respect his  plight  when they learn rubio s parents came here voluntarily  not on a raft as refugees escaping life in prison or worse  they entered the country and asked to start working and were shown a path to citizenship there is  of course  nothing wrong with that story  it s a similar story to almost every family if you go back to their first generation  for some reason  marco rubio and his family needed to add things that never happened to their lives for effect  featured image from gage skidmore
