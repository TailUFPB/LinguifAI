in two and a half minutes  former u s  secretary of labor robert reich destroys the seven biggest economic lies told by republicans in the short video  uploaded to youtube by moveon  reich uses facts to shred the republican myth of trickle down economics while republicans tell us that cutting taxes on the rich will spur economic growth and fuel job creation  the economic data tells a very different story  as reich points out in the video  both ronald reagan and george w  bush cut taxes on the rich  and  nothing trickled down  the result of republican tax cuts for the rich have been the same across the states  gop governors like bobby jindal and rick snyder have driven their states into economic ruin by imposing experimental trickle down economic policies on citizens  with disastrous results along the same lines  republicans claim that high taxes on the rich are bad for the economy  yet history shows the opposite is true until   taxes on the top earners in the u s  were  percent  it wasn t until republicans started cutting these tax rates that economic growth began to slow reich also tackles the myth that shrinking government creates jobs  the idea that we create jobs by firing people who already have jobs literally defies reason  but that hasn t stopped republicans from pushing it  it doesn t take much to destroy this lie while republicans were remarkably silent about the national deficit while george bush was in the white house  it suddenly became earth shatteringly important on the day president obama took office reich destroys the myth of deficit reduction as a top priority  explaining that the goal is to reduce the debt as a percent of the gdp  something that cannot be accomplished by slashing budgets all over the place reich also looks at how the rising cost of health care impacts the budget  busting the gop myth that programs like medicare and medicaid are negatively impacting the economy what s important to understand in relation to the health care debate is that government programs actually help slow the increase in health care costs for everyone the right has been attacking social security as a  ponzi scheme  ever since they figured out that there was a lot of money in the social security fund that they couldn t get their greedy little hands on is this true  of course it s not  as reich explains in the video  social security is solvent for the next two plus decades  and it would solvent for much longer if we lift the income cap the video would not be complete if it didn t address the lie that lower income people not paying taxes is horribly unfair to the rich watch the video below  courtesy of moveon on youtube  while the video above was released in   republicans are still using these same debunked economic myths to press their disastrous agenda all across the country as long as republicans continue to try to repackage and sell these same old lies at election time  we ll be forced to keep debunking their myths time and time again image credit  wikimedia commons  video screen capture via moveon
