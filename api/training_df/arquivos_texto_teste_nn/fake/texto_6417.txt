in   conservatives used their   majority of the supreme court to kill a key part of the voting rights act  now republicans are aiming at the civil rights act to bring back segregation during an interview on cnn with jake tapper  north carolina governor pat mccrory actually argued that congress should  revisit  the civil right act of  to make segregation legal again so that the state can make accommodations for transgender people  i think we ought to make special circumstances for those individuals   mccrory said when asked how we should treat transgender kids  he suggested that the federal government is preventing the creation of unisex bathrooms and that we should segregate by forcing transgender kids to use those bathrooms of course  many businesses have already added unisex bathrooms without a problem so mccrory seems to pretending that the federal government is blocking him he whined about the justice department taking issue with north carolina s  law  which allows business owners to discriminate against lgbt customers and employees under the guise of religious liberty  and he blamed  the left  for the discriminatory laws republicans have been passing across the country  i think that this was an argument that we didn t need to have   mccrory said  but this is an agenda by the far left  and for some reason  the national media is saying the far right brought this up  i had no interest in this subject  but the justice department is basically making a civil rights claim that every private sector employer in the u s  and every university in the united states must have gender expression or gender identity bathroom choices for individuals   states and over  cities have simply passed laws or ordinances protecting transgender people allowing them to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity free from discrimination it s the republicans who made this a problem by passing laws overriding local ordinances and legalizing bigotry against lgbt people however  mccrory would like the republican controlled congress to go another step further and gut the civil rights act of  so that segregation can once again be legal in the united states  i think there s a time where the republicans and the democrats in this congress need to revisit the  civil rights act  and revisit all this issue  because these are complex issues and north carolina for whatever reason politically has become the target by the left on this agenda  here s the video via youtube if mccrory had his way  we would not only see transgender people get segregated from from the rest of the population  we would see many southern states segregate black people as well  we would once again have bathrooms for whites and blacks  separate water fountains  separate schools  and businesses could signs outside that say  whites only  basically  mccrory made the justice department s case by admitting that he wants to segregate transgender people into  separate but equal  bathrooms  which is going to be pretty difficult to enforce unless you put a perverted cop in every public bathroom  segregation has been illegal since  for a reason  it goes against our constitutional values and divides americans when we should be united the very fact that mccrory even suggested killing a key part of the civil rights act should make it clear to every american that republicans are just itching to attack the landmark legislation to take the country backward  and if voters allow a president trump along with a republican majority in congress  mccrory could very well get his wish featured image via video screen capture
