the one thing john oliver hasn t talked about on his show so far is donald trump  but that changed on sunday night the hbo host devoted nearly his entire program to ripping apart the republican billionaire as if he had been biding his time waiting for the perfect moment to strike  our main story tonight   and i can not believe i m saying this   is donald trump  and i say that knowing that every time his name gets said out loud  he has a shattering orgasm   oliver hilarious began like a small mole discovered on your back  oliver continued  trump has grown to the point where you have to start taking him seriously trump has not only won new hampshire and south carolina  he is now poised to win big on super tuesday  which could seal the nomination for him but oliver absolutely destroyed trump and it became really obvious that he and his team did a lot of research in an effort to hit trump as hard as possible  donald trump can seem appealing until you take a closer look   oliver said   much like the lunch buffet at a strip club  or the nfl  or having a pet chimpanzee  sure  it seems fun  but someday coco is going to rip your f cking limbs off  oliver took aim at trump s net worth  which the donald proudly claims is at least  ten billion dollars   however  oliver noted that in reality trump is  worth a mere   to   million dollars  then it was time to take a closer look at trump s claim that he is successful at everything he does  and even that doesn t hold water  from trump vodka to trump steaks to trump university  donald trump has repeatedly failed in multiple business ventures  he s even incredibly thin skinned  as oliver discovered when he pointed out that trump sends an occasional letter to vanity fair with a picture of his hand highlighting the length of his fingers after the magazine claimed that he has  tiny  cocktail sausage fingers  the in depth mockery of trump by oliver was simply amazing over the full  minutes the segment lasted  which hilariously concluded with the comedian reaching back into trump s family history to find out that trump s real last name is drumpf  and that inspired oliver to buy www donaldjdrumpf com to make donald drumpf again here s the video via youtube oliver also summed up trump s candidacy as a  bullshit artist selling a shitty lifestyle  to the american people we may have had to wait a long time to see oliver take on trump  but it sure was worth the wait featured image via screenshot
