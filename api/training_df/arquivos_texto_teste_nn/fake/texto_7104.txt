on april      year old walter scott  a father of four  was pulled over by officer michael slager in north charleston  south carolina  the cop reportedly stopped him for a broken brake light  the officer lied and said scott attacked him and took his taser  but a bystander recorded the incident on a cell phone to the horrifying dismay of the country  the video clearly shows an unarmed scott running away from the officer  instead of pursuing scott  the officer fires eight shots  killing scott the city agreed to pay scott s family    million  and a grand jury handed down a murder indictment for officer michael slager  such settlements and indictments for police officers who shoot people are extremely rare  and walter scott is one of many black victims over the past few years to be killed by a white police officer  while police departments across the country fail to assume accountability for these constant occurrences  freddie gray  eric garner  tamir rice  tanisha anderson  john crawford iii  michael brown jr   the list goes on and on people of color are increasingly at risk for being at the wrong place at the wrong time when it comes to excessive force used by many police departments  instead of holding the officers and their departments accountable  the victims are often subjected to attacks and criticisms to disregard the outrage  unrest  and civil disobedience in cities like ferguson  missouri or baltimore  maryland  they don t acknowledge the pain and trauma inflicted on these communities by police departments who police in ways that render unarmed people being shot to death  the officer is currently out on bail of    awaiting trial later this year  this is a travesty  as given the nature of the crime  no bail should have been granted  non violent criminals have received stricter bail bonds  slager also tried to sue the southern states police benevolent association for not helping him with his defense hopefully  there is a murder conviction in this man s future featured image via flickr
