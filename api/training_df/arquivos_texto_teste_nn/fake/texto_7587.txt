bernie sanders is not known to mince words and isn t shy about speaking his mind  during the democratic presidential debates  he couldn t have been any clearer when he summarized republican front runner donald trump  he said  i think the american people are never going to elect a president who insults mexicans  who insults muslims  who insults women  who insults african americans  and let s not forget that several years ago  trump was in the middle of the so called birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the united states of america  sanders makes it crystal clear why a trump presidency has the potential to legitimize racism in the eyes of racists in america  since his statements against muslims  scores of attacks on the muslim community have occurred throughout the united states  in addition  trump s support of violence at his rallies with those who disagree with him have sent a message to his supporters that it s alright to use violence against those who refuse to accept the racism they support bernie sanders eloquently rejected this racist ideology  he said  you know  i find it very interesting  my dad was born in poland and i know a little bit about the immigrant experience  nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate  maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin we need someone like bernie sanders to unite all americans  regardless of religion or color watch a video comparing these two vastly different canddiates below featured image via video screen capture
