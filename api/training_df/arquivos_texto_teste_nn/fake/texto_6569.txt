the battle between republican presidential hopefuls ted cruz and donald trump continues to intensify  as both candidates keep fanning the flames by directing insults at each other on tuesday  cruz s emotions seemed to get the better of him as he snapped on a reporter for simply asking him if he would be supporting his front runner rival if he became the gop nominee  this public meltdown came just a few days after meet the press host chuck todd had tried to ask cruz if he would keep his pledge to support the eventual republican nominee regardless of who it was  and cruz repeatedly dodged the question cruz had been busy insulting the business mogul at a press conference in evansville  indiana when nbc news correspondent hallie jackson tried to get a straight answer from the texas senator on whether or not he would back trump  hoping to get more of an answer than todd was able to  jackson asked  these are some of the strongest words you ve used against donald trump yet  you know i ve been with you  i ve heard you talk about him  today feels different for you  so  i m going to ask you a question and you re going to say that i sound like a broken record    while it was clear that cruz didn t want to answer the question  his rude response was shocking  jackson was abruptly cut off by cruz  who aggressively said   you sound like a broken record  someone else have a question  jackson tried to object and get a straight answer from the candidate  she pressed  why not say once and for all  cruz continued to give jackson a nasty attitude and angrily replied  you ve asked one already  hallie  you ve asked already  frustrated  jackson continued to badger cruz to answer her  will you support him as the nominee  i don t understand why you won t answer the question  senator  if you think he s a liar  if you say he s a pathological liar  and you say that you can t cruz continued to scold jackson and ignore her request  making the situation tense and uncomfortable  you can watch cruz completely disrespect and ignore jackson below it looks as though cruz doesn t want to accept the harsh reality that he might lose the republican nominee to trump  anything that reminds cruz that he s in second place will easily send him into a full blown temper tantrum featured image via eduardo munoz alvarez   getty images
