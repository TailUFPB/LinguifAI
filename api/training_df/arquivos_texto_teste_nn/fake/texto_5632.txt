republicans have found a new way to hurt the pockets of the working class   and this time they re going so low as to strip pay away from military personnel  in june  the republican controlled senate passed military budget cuts that no one asked for  part of the budget calls for reforming how service members are compensated each month for their housing expenses the way the current system works  service members receive a monthly stipend called the basic allowance for housing  bah   the amount of money service members received each month is based on several metrics such as rank  the number of dependents  and marital status  service members are able to pocket any cash they have left over after they re housing expenses have paid for  that s all about to change mother jones reports  the measure in the senate bill  which passed with approval from the armed services committee  would make the housing stipend cover only soldiers  actual bills   soldiers would provide copies of their rents or mortgages and get reimbursed only for what they spent  up to a maximum payable limit  soldiers sharing housing would have their allowances divided by the number of service members sharing the space  the changes would cost many soldiers hundreds of dollars of a month  the congressional budget office estimates the move would save   billion over the next five years  that    billion dollars in savings is just pennies compared to what has already been saved due to reforms in tricare  the military s medical program  todd harrison  who works as the director of defense budget analysis for the center for strategic and international studies told mother jones that  just the minor changes that congress has made to the tricare program over the past four or five years  now saving more than   billion a year each year in the defense budget   he says   and i think a lot of people would be hard pressed to identify what those changes are   harrison went on to add that   they re cutting back on exactly the types of compensation that people value most  fortunately  the changes to how the bah runs are not included in the house s version of the spending bill  furthermore  the senate s version still has many legislative hurdles to jump over before it actually could be implemented it shouldn t be too surprising that republicans would seize the opportunity to turn the current the current need to reduce military spending into an austerity program  after all  the lower rungs of the military   those who will be impacted by this bill the most   are much more likely to be racial minorities and those with a poor working class background  it s just like the gop to create programs that do not do much more than increase inequality in the name of fiscal responsibility featured image via john moore getty images
