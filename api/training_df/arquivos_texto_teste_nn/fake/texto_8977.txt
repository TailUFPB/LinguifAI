a man known primarily for posting videos of himself making the sounds of different types of guns   yeah  apparently there is a market for that   was arrested after he threatened to shoot his underage girlfriend and then kill cops in a rampage  just another day in gun crazy america bryan silva    has over two million followers on facebook and vine  where he thrills fellow gun lovers with short videos of his obsession with firearms however he went from  good guy with a gun  to violent nutcase in a hurry  on january   charlottesville  virginia  police received a call from a distraught  year old girl who said she had just escaped silva s home after he held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her  she also told police that silva was planning on killing cops police responded to a domestic dispute call around  a m  sunday at the home where the barricade situation occurred according to police  the call was made by a neighbor  it was a domestic disturbance   said longo   a female caller said that she was threatened with a firearm  we responded and began an investigation  apparently  a  year old girl had been at the residence when a dispute occurred  she then left go to the neighbor s house the girl told police she had been held against her will by her boyfriend and that he had also threatened her with a handgun  she also told officers that he had threatened to shoot the police virginia is one of several republican states that recently pushed to make it easier for people to have and carry guns  it seems to be working out well the police surrounded silva s house  and silva took advantage of his infamy by   what else    posting to his social media accounts about his siege with police and chatting with friends but while silva would have loved to posture himself as a gun toting badass  things didn t work out that way  he eventually surrendered   and was promptly arrested with his pants falling to his ankles  in the ultimate bit of karma  the vine  star  was immortalized in this hilarious vine i can t believe this vine of bryan silva being arrested with his pants down  gratata https   t co   ryan broderick   broderick  january    turns out that silva was not legally allowed to have all those guns he was bragging about daily on social media  silva was already a convicted felon  on top of the new charges of abduction  he was slapped with another felony  illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon his legions of gun nut fans will probably be disappointed  but the streets are probably much safer with bryan silva off of vine and the streets feature image via newsplex
