republicans in congress may not support raising the minimum wage  but most mayors in america say they want to do exactly that a politico survey reached out to  mayors in cities across the country asking them if they would consider raising the minimum wage like had been done in seattle  los angeles  and new york city  all three of which approved a   minimum wage over the last two years in a stunning result   percent of the mayors surveyed said they would definitely consider raising the minimum wage   percent said they would consider raising wages as high as   an hour while  percent said they consider raising wages but not quite as high as    suggesting they would support president obama s call to raise the minimum wage to at least   an hour  percent of the mayors are like the republicans who control congress  in that they refuse to consider the idea of raising the minimum wage at all income inequality and poverty ranked as serious issues among the mayors with  percent identifying both as great challenges to overcome of course  raising the minimum wage would do a lot to close the income gap and provide families with more resources  and because families would spend that extra money  it would be a huge boost to the local economy  it would also help americans pay for housing  which is getting much more difficult now  in addition  it would save the federal government millions of dollars because higher wages would mean less people needing federal aid such as food stamps to get by sadly  efforts to raise the minimum wage have been largely left to cities as republicans in control of state legislatures and congress refuse to take up the issue so as not to anger their corporate masters  despite the fact that studies from both sides of the aisle support wage hikes indeed  republicans would rather eliminate the minimum wage all together so that corporate ceos can pay their employees slave wages that would make america look more like it did during the gilded age  when workers were kept in poverty due to low wages  and the top  percent controlled more than a third of the nation s wealth and once again  unless the issue of low wages and income inequality is addressed in a meaningful way  america will be repeating history  which means that the middle class will cease to exist and workers will struggle to keep their families and themselves afloat as the wealthy use their money to buy politicians to ensure that nothing ever changes raising the minimum wage and tying it to the rate of inflation has never been more important to achieve  and as seattle  los angeles  and new york city have demonstrated  it can be done  but if we want it to happen across the entire nation  the  election would be a great place to start  republicans think they can keep forcing americans to work longer and harder with inadequate pay while they continue to make    a year working only for  days out of  clearly  there is something terribly wrong when lawmakers can raise their own taxpayer paid salaries at will while they continue to reject the pleas of working people across the country to have their own efforts rewarded with a much needed wage increase featured image  pr watch
