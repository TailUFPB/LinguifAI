donald trump has singled out many people during his campaign  but none have remained a target in trump s eyes and twitter feed quite like fox news anchor megyn kelly trump s issue with kelly exploded after the first republican debate  when kelly understandably called trump out on his long winded history of sexist  misogynistic comments toward women  trump  being the abrasive a  hole that he is  blew the incident way out of proportion and continued to slam kelly both on and off twitter for weeks after the debate  now kelly is speaking out against trump  claiming that the business mogul had actually tried to  woo  her in some incredibly creepy ways   which may have influenced why he was so bitter when she called him out vanity fairthis month kelly graces the cover of vanity fair magazine  in which the  year old journalist spoke about her interactions with the donald at length  kelly said that trump used to send her press clippings that were signed  donald trump   and called her numerous times to tell her how much he enjoyed certain segments of her show  ironically  after the debate trump criticized kelly s show extensively   kelly didn t think much of this at first  but when trump announced he was going to run for president  kelly said  it became more clear  but  kelly said that trump s efforts were completely futile  she said  i can t be wooed  i was never going to love him  and i was never going to hate him  i would have crawled over a pile of hot coals to make it to that debate  no one was going to be sitting in for me  reading my questions  and i can say with confidence that neither bret nor chris wanted to read my questions   for many reasons  kelly revealed that her decision to focus on trump s sexist remarks was because she knew democratic frontrunner hillary clinton would zero in on them if they faced each other in the general election  part of what kelly said to trump was  your twitter account has several disparaging comments about womens  looks  you once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president  and how will you answer the charge from hillary clinton   who is likely to be the democratic nominee   that you are a part of the war on women  it was one of the most reported moments from the debate  and kelly received attacks from both trump and his loyal followers for holding him accountable  trump lovers sent her death threats  called her a c t  and a  hag  on social media   even trump s top deputy retweeted  gut her  trump was especially immature about the situation  and he took his disdain for being confronted to new heights when he told cnn s don lemon that kelly had  blood coming out of her eyes  blood coming out of her   wherever   then  the republican frontrunner threatened to boycott fox and continued to diss kelly for weeks after the debate   only further proving her point about trump s misogyny featured image via vanity fair
