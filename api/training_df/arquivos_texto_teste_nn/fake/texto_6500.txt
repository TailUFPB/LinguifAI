now that donald trump is the presumptive gop nominee  it s time to remember all those other candidates who tried so hard to beat him in the race to the white house  after all  how can we forget all the missteps  gaffes  weirdness  and sheer idiocies of such candidates as jeb bush  marco rubio  john kasich  ted cruz  ben carson  and carly fiorina there s a video making the rounds on twitter that does just that  and eulogizes three of these failed candidates as though they re dead  and the gop itself might as well be dead at this point anyway   appropriately titled   a eulogy for the gop   people make short speeches about each of these candidates once past the man who actually says jeb bush was qualified to be president  there are fake tears  with journalist and comedienne francesca fiorentini saying  dearly beloved  we re gathered here today to commemorate the candidates that are no longer with us  one man  speaking to an amusing  circus y rendition of chopin s funeral march  remembers jeb this way  jeb  we hardly knew ye  it s too bad that your policies couldn t find their way out of the republican morass  indeed  it was like jeb and his policies were invisible sometimes  although many felt that he would win the nomination early on  his best performances often came during debates  when he d get into out and out fights with donald trump over virtually everything under the sun  he also had a bad habit of defending his brother s actions in iraq  memorably saying   as it relates to my brother  there s one thing i know for sure  he kept us safe  moving on to marco rubio  fiorentini herself says  he was called so many things   young  charming  lil  marco   that last nickname is  of course  a reference to trump s penchant for name calling  then  a man speaking spanish remembers rubio this way  marco  why aren t you a normal boy  another said that his involvement in the gang of eight immigration bill killed him as a candidate  to which fiorentini replies  some people die of gang violence  he died of gang of eight violence  the makers of this video saved the absolute best for last  of course  which is ben carson  on our dear dr  carson  one of the speakers says  he would gently rock me to sleep with his monotone voice  carson was especially well known for seemingly being asleep half the time  if we saw his eyes open wide  it was surprising  and likely because he was surprised himself  his voice is soft  his speech is slow  and it really can be hard to stay awake while he s talking  imagine him giving a state of the union address to see the whole video  especially the spectacular ending after carson s eulogy  watch below take a moment to say your g byes to these gop candidates    https   t co   aj    ajplus  may    featured image via screen capture from embedded video
