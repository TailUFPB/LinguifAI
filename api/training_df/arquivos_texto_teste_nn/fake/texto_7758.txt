one of the biggest democratic themes of the  election is  building on president obama s legacy   it has come from many establishment democrats during the  primary season  even debbie wasserman schultz has used this theme in a statement released by her office  and she isn t even running in the primaries  this all makes it rather strange that with this in mind  wasserman schultz has decided to help republicans to destroy a very popular obama created governmental office of which he is very proud and voters absolutely love the consumer financial protection bureau  which was set up by elizabeth warren after president obama personally appointed her to do so  is coming under heavy attack by the ultra predatory payday lending industry  the industry is also enjoying the assistance of republicans and a few democratic sellouts   which now includes wasserman schultz among their number the cfpb is approaching a point where they are going to be able to adopt better rules to protect consumers from predatory lending practices  which disproportionately harm the poorest among us and can throw an otherwise financially stable family into a long and sometimes inescapable cycle debt  this has caused the industry to rally republicans to assault the cfpb by attacking its budget  burdening it with impossible amounts of regulation  and creating outright lies about the agency unilaterally shutting down businesses wasserman schultz is co sponsoring a new bill that would completely gut the cfpb s approaching payday loan regulations and she is trying to lobby other democrats in washington to join her in this unprecedented attack on the poorest and most vulnerable americans the upcoming republican sabotage is wrapped in a misleading name  the  consumer protection and choice act   what exactly it has to do with protection and choice is not clear  since it actively blocks protections and poor people who are in desperate need tend to have no choice when it comes to resorting to a payday loan  the legislation would delay the cfpb s new regulations by two years  and would allow for state level nullification of their federal authority in states that adopted their own laws regarding payday lenders  it s important to note that it doesn t have any classification for a level of protection of consumers   only that the state has adopted  a law  regarding payday lenders  it could be a mostly anti consumer measure  but if it fulfills the letter of the law it would make it literally impossible for the cfpb to help an entire state the consumer federation of america  the naacp  the national consumer law center  the national council of la raza  the southern poverty law center  and dozens of others sent letters to every member of congress urging them to oppose the law  this isn t an online petition by regular people on some website  these are some of the biggest progressive social justice movements in america a typical florida payday loan customer takes out  loans per year and is stuck in debt for almost half that year  the average interest on florida payday loans is  percent  which is less than the national average but still huge wasserman schultz is partially reacting to a state level law she helped create in florida  that her office claims  sharply reduced  the need to go after bad actors  curbed predatory practices  and created standards and protections for low income borrowers   the problem with this is  it simply isn t true   percent of payday loans are  turned   which means that they are made to help the borrower pay off a previous payday loan  this is exactly what the cfpb wants to help stop   a cycle of debt that the poor can t escape where they need to keep taking out loans to pay off previous ones debbie wasserman schultz is quickly becoming a pariah among democrats  her management of democratic primary debates has garnered her a fair amount of infamy  and many have been calling for her to resign from her position as dnc chairperson  she will also be facing a primary challenge for her seat in the next election cycle  with this latest assistance to republicans  will it mean the end of her seat at the dnc as well as in congress featured image via flickr
