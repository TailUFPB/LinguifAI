ted cruz got his wish  after weeks of fear mongering about transgender people and encouraging conservatives to lash out  men and women across the country are being harassed by self appointed  bathroom cops  who have taken it upon themselves to barge into public bathrooms and demand their victims  prove  they are the biological gender they say they are in cruz s home state of texas  a confused woman began recording her confrontation with a man as he walked into a women s bathroom and told her that her short hair and manner of dress made him suspect she was secretly a man  it s a perfect example of how republicans have fixed a non existent problem  transgender people do not use public restrooms to sexually assault young girls   and created a bigger one  an unregulated militia of angry men who now feel it is their duty to go into public restrooms and inspect people s anatomy jessica rush is not transgender  but she has a short  fauxhawk  hairstyle and dared to wear a t shirt and shorts when she went in to use the women s restroom at baylor medical center in frisco  hot on her trail was an unidentified man who came into the bathroom with her and asked if she was a man  when i saw you enter i thought you was  the man says  a boy   rush offers  yeah  it was kind of confusing   certainly she can see why   you dress like a man   he says several times as he walks away rush was understandably flabbergasted by the exchange  later  she said she approached the man to ask why he felt compelled to approach her  he said his mother was using that bathroom  somewhere on the campaign trail  ted cruz just nodded in approval  his fear mongering is working currently the issue of the right for the transgender community to use the bathroom of their choice has engulfed several southern states  with a few more  including texas  on the way   the conservative argument is that trans people are little more than sexual predators dressing as women in order to gain access to young women  this has been shown both by scientific research and by example to be utter nonsense despite it s fictional roots  north carolina s republican governor has chosen it to be his hill to die on  in the wake of massive boycotts to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and incalculable national humiliation  governor pat mccrory says he is standing firm and keeping his discriminatory bathroom bill on the books  sen  ted cruz  desperate to find a wedge issue to separate him from republican front runner donald trump  has made bashing trans people the central plank in his platform and while most people are rightfully outraged by this latest stab at discrimination  the talking points are clearly working with some people  many americans who may never have even thought about the non issue  have become consumed with fear that their loved ones will be attacked in a bathroom stall  it s hardly surprising  then  that some  like this man  have taken it upon themselves to interrogate people trying to use the bathroom  it s the inevitable conclusion to this level of transphobia watch the incident below  video apr      pm from voice media group on vimeo featured image via vimeo screengrab
