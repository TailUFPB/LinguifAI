everyone paying attention to the  presidential election  regardless of politics  realizes that donald trump is not fit to hold the office he seeks  the man is clearly dangerously unqualified to take the oath of the presidency  and the idea that he might do so in january is absolutely terrifying well  the democrats have put together a star studded event to make sure that voters understand what is at stake here  and to make sure that people vote blue from the top on down this november  and one such star was none other then vice president joe biden  vp biden is likeable  adorable  smart  charming and funny  he s also incredibly knowledgeable  he knows what he is talking about  and he knows that the difference between the two choices this year is like night and day  here is what biden said  in part  to make his case against trump  via daily kos let me say this as clearly as i can  if you live in the neighborhoods like the ones jill and i grew up in  if you worry about your job and getting a decent pay  if you worry about your children s education  if you are taking care of an elderly parent  then there is only one person in the selection will help you  only one person in this race who will be there  who has always been there for you and that is hillary clinton s life story  not just who she is  it is her life story   she is always there  she has always been there   and so has tim kaine  ladies and gentlemen  let s say the obvious  i really meant  that is not donald trump story  just listen to me a second without doing or cheering   booing or cheering  his cynicism is undoubtedly his lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in that phrase he is most proud of making famous  you re fired  i m not joking  think about that  think about that  think about everything you learned as a child  no matter where you were raised  how can there be pleasure in saying you re fired  he is trying to tell us he cares about the middle class  give me a break  that is a bunch of malarkey  whatever he thinks  whatever he thinks  and i mean this from the bottom of my heart  i know i m called middle class joe and in washington  that is not meant as a compliment  it means you are not sophisticated  i know why we are strong  i know why we are held together  i know why we are united  it is because there has always been a growing middle class  this guy does not have a clue about the middle class  not a clue   because folks  when the hill class   middle class does well  the rich do very well and the poor have hope  they have a way out  he has no clue about what makes america great  actually  he has no clue period  not a clue  not a clue  not a clue folks  let me say  let me say something that has nothing to do with politics  let me talk about something that i m deadly serious about  this is a complicated and uncertain world we live in  the threats are two great   too great  the times are too uncertain to elect donald trump as resident of the united states  let me finish  no major party  no major party nominee in the history of the station has ever known less or been less prepared to do with our national security  deal with our national  security our vice president is right  this is not about politics anymore  trump is incompetent  and dangerously so  he has no clue about the economy  national security  or anything else  he doesn t understand what makes the nation function  even on the most basic level  and he certainly doesn t understand what makes it great  the choice is clear  my fellow americans  vote for a demagogue who peddles in hate and fear who is completely unprepared to occupy the oval office  or vote for the woman who knows what she is doing and will continue to keep america great watch vice president biden s incredible speech below featured image via video screen capture
