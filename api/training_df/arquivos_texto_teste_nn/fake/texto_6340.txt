donald trump has so many feuds going on at the moment it can be hard to keep track of them all  one of the most potentially damaging feuds  though  is with the united kingdom s prime minister david cameron  now  that feud continues with trump s latest comments directed towards cameron cameron has made his opinion of the guaranteed republican presidential nomination very clear  back in december  cameron publicly stated that he thinks trump s proposal to ban muslims from entering the united states is  stupid  divisive and wrong   cameron s statement couldn t be more accurate  as trump s proposal goes against the very basic principles of the united states and would be logistically impossible to enforce during an interview with piers morgan  trump spoke out against cameron s comments  offering a sad attempt at an olive branch towards cameron  where he insisted that he is not stupid and is a unifier  it looks like we re not going to have a very good relationship  who knows  i hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he s not willing to address the problem either   trump said in the interview  according to the jerusalem post   well  number one i m not stupid  okay  i can tell you that  right now   just the opposite  number two  in terms of divisive  i don t think i m a divisive person  i m a unifier  unlike our president now  i m a unifier   he trump concluded as bizarre as it is to hear a grown man insist to another that he is in fact not stupid  cameron never actually called trump himself stupid  he called his policy stupid because it is  it s also nothing more than an incredibly xenophobic  racist  and ridiculous bit of fear mongering  it s one of the first policy proposals that trump introduced  it sounded the alarm bells that trump is more than just a buffoon looking for attention  it showed the world that he could actually be a very dangerous threat to the united states and the world if given the opportunity to seize actual political power featured image from  photo by isaac brekken getty images
