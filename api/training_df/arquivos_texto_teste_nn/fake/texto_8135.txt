superdelegates can  and very likely will  have an impact on the democratic primary process  but how much influence remains to be seen as nate silver of fivethirtyeight writes here  superdelegates are democratic insiders who hold voting power apart from that of ordinary delegates silver explains  superdelegates were created in part to give democratic party elites the opportunity to put their finger on the scale and prevent nominations like those of george mcgovern in  or jimmy carter in   which displeased party insiders  while silver agrees with many progressive voters  who say that the superdelegate system is  profoundly unfair   he also notes that the amount of influence superdelegates have on the outcome of a primary race depends largely on how close the race is there are approximately  superdelegates  these delegates equal about one sixth of the   delegates who will determine the outcome of the primary  in order to win the party s nomination  a candidate needs to secure at least   delegates according to silver  superdelegates are mathematically relevant when a candidate has   percent to   percent of elected delegates  below that range  a candidate couldn t win a first ballot majority even with the votes of every superdelegate  above that range  the superdelegates  help wouldn t be necessary to clinch the nomination  to clarify  the following chart was published on fivethirtyeight  on february  the chart shows the percentage of superdelegate votes a candidate would need to win the primary  in correlation to the percentage of regular delegates  which are awarded based on the outcomes of state primary elections image credit  screen capture nate silver fivethirtyeight comas the chart illustrates  the closer the race is  the more impact the superdelegates have on the outcome currently hillary clinton holds a tremendous lead over bernie sanders among pledged superdelegates  clinton has the support of  superdelegates  while sanders has only captured the support of eight superdelegates thus far but silver also points out that superdelegates are free to change their vote at any time during the race  and notes that they often do just that  unlike elected delegates  superdelegates are unbound to any candidate even on the first ballot  they can switch whenever they like  and some of them probably will switch to sanders if he extends his winning streak into more diverse states and eventually appears to have more of a mandate than clinton among democratic voters  additionally  silver states that it s highly unlikely superdelegates would back a candidate who had lost the popular vote by any significant margin  since doing so would likely alienate over half the party s base so while at the moment it may appear that party insiders are attempting to override the popular vote  it s not likely that the superdelegates will ignore or deny the will of the voters  should they favor sanders by a significant margin silver points to  as an example of how fast things can change  clinton had a large superdelegate lead over then senator barack obama early on during the  democratic primary  as well  but as the election wore on  several dozen superdelegates changed their original vote from clinton to obama  at the same time  uncommitted superdelegates came out in support of his candidacy so while superdelegates definitely have the power to influence the outcome of an election  especially in the case of very close race  it s important to keep in mind that voters also have the power to influence the decisions of the superdelegates view a state by state list of democratic superdelegates here  image credit  hillary clinton photo  marc nozell via wikimedia commons  bernie sanders photo  gage skidmore  via flckr com
