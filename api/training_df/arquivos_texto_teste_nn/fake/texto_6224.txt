some of donald trump s biggest fans and supporters are working and middle class americans who often struggle from paycheck to paycheck and are fed up with how our current system operates  that current system being  of course  where all the money is on top  the middle is taxed too much  and regular working people aren t given a fair shake what these people fail to realize is that the person they want as commander in chief is merely pandering to that anger and using it for his own selfish goals of achieving the highest office in the land  even though he lacks any of the required experience in what can only be seen as the best foreshadowing of what a trump presidency would be like  a trump themed lamborghini was driven up to the white house by a car enthusiast and parked outside  the car  like trump  screams unattainable opulence  when a man refers to a million dollar loan from his father as a  small loan  you know he has no grasp on reality according to the man in the video  the car is in town for goldrush rally  which apparently is an  automotive lifestyle rally  secret service did show up to see what was going on  the man from the video said  they just wanted to come take a look at who i was and what s going on  because  especially being in front of the white house with donald trump plastered on the front of the car  i can see why they d be questioning what s going on  ya think however you look at this  it s probably one of the most obnoxious things you ll see this year  if not you re entire life  only to be outdone by an actual trump presidency  which  by the way  we need to make sure never ever happens check out the video here featured image via video screen capture
