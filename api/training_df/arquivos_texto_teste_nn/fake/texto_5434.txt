with the republican national convention tomorrow  and the democratic convention next week  hillary clinton is maintaining a comfortable  average lead over donald trump  and that s with trump s vp pick announced  leading  to   clinton maintains her advantage even after a month of serious setbacks and criticisms stemming from the fbi and justice department s decision not to indict her over the use of a private email server nbc news  poll also shows that clinton is thrashing trump among black  hispanic  female  and young voters  while trump leads in  not surprising  whites and men  surprisingly  trump only leads men by seven points  while clinton leads with women by  percent as nbc has shown  these numbers have been virtually unchanged in a month  it seems americans are settling for their candidates  and that s even before clinton announces her running mate and it s worth noting that trump is hated far more than clinton  while the media likes to remind the people about her  likeability issues   they have been  not surprisingly  mum about trump s  the nbc poll shows trump  heading into the convention  with a  percent positive  percent negative rating  a net negative of  percent  clinton  on the other hand  will walk into the democratic convention with a  percent positive  percent negative  a net negative of  percent currently  only  percent of republicans are satisfied with trump as their nominee  while  percent of democrats are satisfied with clinton a sizable chunk of the population hates donald trump more than clinton  but only one candidate is constantly questioned on why people  hate  them it s important to remember that at around convention time in   in early september  president obama was ahead of romney by  points  according to ipsos reuters tracking  obama won by  percent   clinton is following the same trajectory as president obama  and  again  that s without a running mate announced but in the coming months after the conventions  out of the  national polls ran  romney beat president obama in  and tied in  clinton is in a good position  but democrats know all too well what happens when they get cocky  the only way to ensure clinton beats trump is to not underestimate his abilities and supporters  and to show up to the polls to vote featured image via darren mccollester getty images
