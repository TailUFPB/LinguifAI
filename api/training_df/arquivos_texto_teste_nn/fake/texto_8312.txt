nothing shows a person s character more than their willingness to be properly interviewed  because a proper and honest interview is going to yield proper and honest answers  this is something new jersey governor chris christie is apparently very nervous about doing  because he just told msnbc host rachel maddow  to her face  that he won t go on her show while at a christie event  maddow tries to grab the governor s attention  but he responded  rachel  you beat the crap out of me for years  you expect me to voluntarily come on your program  come on  so she replied  oh  come on  you love the back and forth and you know that he does  because he loves to argue  however  instead he admits he s absolutely terrified of the msnbc host by saying  with a lot of people  maybe not with you  he s likely terrified of her because she doesn t let him get away with any of his asshole shenanigans that he loves to regularly display  maddow holds him to facts and doesn t let him finagle himself away from what s being discussed  between his hatred for hillary clinton  and his fear of rachel maddow  it seems powerful women make him very nervous  good thing he ll never be president does he seem surprised  he was probably surprised     watch tonight  pic twitter com   maddow blog   maddowblog  february    image  twitter  video  twitter
