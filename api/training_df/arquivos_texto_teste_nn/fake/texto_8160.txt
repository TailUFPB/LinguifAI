political pundit joe scarborough has a donald trump problem  and that makes msnbc have a joe scarborough problem while other networks  including the ultra conservatives at fox news  have been combative with republican front runner trump  msnbc s joe scarborough is cozying up to the unapologetic bigot in a way that has almost everyone at the progressive network extremely worried  it s one thing to have a conservative pundit who can represent  the other side  of the aisle  it s quite another when he s the turning out to be a big fan of a racist  sexist demagogue cnn s dylan byers spoke with numerous sources within msnbc and found that there is broad agreement that scarborough is embarrassing both himself and the network with the trump love in background discussions  nbc news and msnbc journalists  reporters and staffers said there was widespread discomfort at the network over scarborough s friendship with trump and his increasingly favorable coverage of the candidate  people don t like that joe is promoting trump   one msnbc insider said  others described scarborough s admiration for trump as  over the top  and  unseemly  four of those sources also said that the growing media scrutiny over the two men s relationship has caused the network s leadership to more closely monitor scarborough s comments   the higher ups are definitely aware about what s going on   said another person within msnbc   it s an issue  this comes just a few days after scarborough was very publicly called out for visiting trump in new hampshire on the night of the election to celebrate his landslide victory  the next day  trump went on morning joe to personally thank scarborough and co host mika brzezinski for their  support  for his campaign  it raised more than a few eyebrows hilariously  scarborough seemed to deny both that he went to trump s hotel room  he did  and that he  supported  trump  he does   this sharply contrasts with the reality  which is that scarborough has consistently painted trump in a positive light in recent weeks  scarborough has spoken about trump in increasingly glowing terms  praising him as  a masterful politician  and defending him against his political opponents and media critics  the washington post has noted that trump has received  a tremendous degree of warmth from the show   and that his appearances on the show  in person and over the phone  often feel like  a cozy social club  scarborough also confessed that he coached trump during his debate prep listening to scarborough talk about trump and it s obvious there is a lot of admiration there  trump s blustering stupidity scarborough mistakes for decisiveness  he may be a small government ideologue  but he likes that trump wants total control over everything  it s a tyrannical bent that appeals to a guy like scarborough who views anyone who uses diplomacy or thoughtful  measured responses as  weak  hey iran  you have exactly  days left to push a us president around  enjoy it while you can  after that  there will be hell to pay   joe scarborough   joenbc  january    is  of course  a nightmare for msnbc s reputation  donald trump might rev scarborough s engine  but the republican candidate has consistently demonstrated that he is a racist  xenophobic  hate mongering narcissist  he has absolutely no realistic policy plans  building a great wall on the border with mexico doesn t count  and no political experience  watching one of msnbc s star hosts worship a guy like this is difficult to endure featured image from msnbc
