you wouldn t think it  but the question of  how to attack donald trump  has been a difficult one  the man is such a buffoon  such an angry lunatic  and so proud of it all  that very few genuine critiques seem to get through  republicans learned that the hard way during the primaries  where not a single attack leveled at trump seemed to land  if anything  every barrage only made him stronger  he s like an orange tinted godzilla marching slowly towards washington but hillary clinton seems to have found trump s weak spot and during a speech in ohio  she went after it with full force  what could make trump lose his mind with rage  exposing how unsuccessful he really is  and clinton didn t hold back clinton   he s written a lot of books about his business  they all seem to end at chapter     sam frizell   samfrizell  june    also noted that donald trump has occasionally admitted to and even bragged about the fact that as a businessman he often ripped off taxpayers by exploiting debt and bankruptcy laws for his own advantage  the  successes  that trump has had are really due to the hard work of american taxpayers that he has shown no hesitation to fleece  during her speech  clinton remarked that trump once dubbed himself the  king of debt    not a great look for a guy who sells himself as the savviest businessman in the world trump s response to all of this was a freakout of monumental proportions  we just got a taste of what it s like to see trump have a nuclear meltdown in real time  it s not pretty first trump sent seven  count them  emails in a row  attacking hillary clinton with literally anything he could think of  including a few conspiracy theories he seems to have lifted directly from the internet  hillary clinton attacked donald trump on the economy  and trump responded with seven rapid response emails  pic twitter com oxeemehgve  phil elliott   philipelliott  june    he grabbed his phone and started tweeting furiously  inadvertently sending a message that could very well be what historians note as the tweet that finally ended his campaign  in response to clinton s charge that he was the  king of debt   trump said of course he was  and that he knew it was bad for the country but it made him rich i am  the king of debt  that has been great for me as a businessman  but is bad for the country  i made a fortune off of debt  will fix u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    you re wondering how trump s campaign team would allow him to send such a bone headed tweet  the answer is   he fired his campaign manager yesterday and   trump appears to have done this with zero oversight looks like trump grabbed the wheel  pic twitter com   rob flaherty   robflaherty  june    s take a brief moment to sum up the current campaign for the republican presumptive nominee things seem to be going pretty well featured image via branden camp getty images
