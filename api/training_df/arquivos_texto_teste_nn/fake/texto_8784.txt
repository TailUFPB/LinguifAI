sometimes in life  with all the negativity that seems to saturate our media outlets  it s important to be reminded that there are still extraordinarily kind human beings still out there  one great example of this could be found in a recently taken video on a new york city subway train nyc in the winter can be brutal  it s even more brutal if you re homeless and don t have much of anything to your name  including the necessary items of clothing to stay warm  on one subway train a man was without a shirt and visibly shivering as he sat by himself  however  what happened next was absolutely breathtaking another subway passenger strips down and takes off his shirt  at this point you can see this is where the video recording of the event begins  the man walks over to the man without a shirt  and not only offers him the shirt off his back  but also helps him put it on  and he didn t stop there  he went back and got his warm stocking cap and placed it on the downtrodden man s head this good samaritan s name is joey resto  and according to abc news    was taking the downtown  a  train to his home in brooklyn after work this past friday when he noticed a homeless man without a shirt shivering from the cold  at the time  temperatures in the city were hovering around  degrees  resto said  he looked cold  hungry like he had just gotten beat up he looked so weak and frail  i had to help him  or he would not put it on  it just came from the heart  i don t know how anyone could have walked past him and had extra clothing and not given it to him  on top of everything he did  resto still wishes he could have done more  and maybe had something warmer to offer him not everyone is the type of person to do what seems so innately right  many stand by and watch as others suffer  but then there are people like joey resto who did what he could  no matter how big or little  to make someone else s existence just a little bit better  well done           if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  amp version       span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    fjs  span  parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script     span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    facebook jssdk  span            gt watch  good samaritan gives shirt off his back to shivering homeless man on nyc train  abcn ws  by good morning america on tuesday  january    featured image  facebook
