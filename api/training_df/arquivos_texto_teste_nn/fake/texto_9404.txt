you d think reporters would learn to ask questions on policy but they obviously still want to challenge sarah sanders with trash talk about president trump  april ryan should know  she s had many run ins with sanders that never end well for her  the one below is no exception sure  april ryan just happened to be chatting with hillary clinton yesterday april ryan  i was talking to hillary clinton today about the president s past and she said   look i worry about everything from his past because it tells you how he behaves in the present and the future   what do you say to that as it relates to these allegations of the president and then this from sarah    i think hillary clinton probably should have dealt with some of her own issues before addressing this president boom one of our previous zingers from sarah sanders to april ryan sarah huckabee sanders shut down white house reporter april ryan during a press conference today  she said that the san juan mayor made  zero comments  when president donald trump opened the table for discussion during his visit to puerto rico  the fake news claimed trump didn t call on her to speak when in reality it was an open discussion that mayor cruz could have participated in when mayor cruz joined joy reid on the  the rachel maddow show  tuesday night  she called trump s actions during his visit  terrible and abominable   and criticized the round table discussion as a  pr  minute meeting  huckabee sanders responded to ryan s question by saying the visit was not  controversial  and was in fact  widely praised  even by a democrat governor  she argued the mayor of san juan was  politicizing  the visit rather than  focusing on the relief efforts  i think that it is sad that the mayor of san juan chose to make that a political statement instead of a time of focusing on the relief efforts  the president invited her to be part of that conversation  he specifically asked in the meeting where many were present  including a couple dozen other mayors who were very happy with the recovery effort  the governor  the congresswoman   he opened the floor up for discussion and she actually made zero comments  the press secretary then suggested the round table discussion was her time to  weigh in and ask for what she needed  for san juan  to me  that would have been the time and the place that she should have weighed in and asked for what she needed and laid out what she was asking for  for san juan  she didn t   huckabee sanders said huckabee sanders concluded with a word of advice for the mayor  instead  she chose to wait until the president left  and then criticized him on tv  which i think is the wrong thing for her to do for her constituents  and i hope the next time she is given the opportunity to help her constituents  she ll take it   she said
