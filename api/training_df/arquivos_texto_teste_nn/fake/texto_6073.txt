if you ve been following donald trump at all  you re aware of how many times he s threatened to sue everyone on the planet  he s flat out said he wants to loosen libel laws so that the press can t say anything bad about him  usa today looked into his background of litigation  and what they found is absolutely appalling an exhaustive investigation of trump s background shows that he s been involved in at least   legal actions in state and federal courts  they deal with everything from casino customers to multi million dollar real estate battles  to his ongoing tax battles and more  over the past  years  after summarizing all of this  usa today said  the sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee  no candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of trump s courtroom entanglements   even more interesting than that is how these actions break down in addition to all of that   new cases have been filed since trump formally announced his candidacy trump loves litigation  and this analysis demonstrates that  during the gop primary season  trump threatened to sue ted cruz over his  natural born  status  and the republican national committee over his loss in louisiana  he recently threatened to sue the new york times  and even threatened a copyright lawsuit over an artist s nude drawing of him in other words  he threatens to sue at the drop of a hat  so it s not too terribly surprising that he s been the plaintiff in at least   different cases this analysis isn t the first that usa today has done on trump s legal problems  in mid may  they released a report that tied trump to over  lawsuits involving his businesses and tax evasion  at the time  five of trump s companies had warrants against them  just from the state of new york  for over    in unpaid and late taxes  all told  his businesses owed over    in back taxes at one point  which were eventually paid in full  he also sued the new york city tax commission  times over roughly  years for their property value assessments of properties his father once owned alan garten  the general counsel for the trump organization  calls this  the cost of doing business   and said that he believes they have less litigation than other companies of similar size  that s probably what trump himself would say  too  however  usa today compared trump to five other big name real estate developers and found that to be untrue  trump has actually been involved in more legal actions than the other five combined what does this mean for a potential presidency  the overwhelming amount of litigation that trump has been involved in does provide clues as to how he ll lead the country  usa today s assessment of that says  the legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief  he sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force  he doesn t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources  such as homeowners  he sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers  lawyers and other vendors as he campaigns  trump often touts his skills as a negotiator  the analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools  he turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the trump brand to secure investments  there are all sorts of problems that a trump presidency would bring  not the least of which involves starting wars with countries that piss him off  when china  russia  iran  or anybody else with whom we re on shaky terms  refuses to cooperate with him  what will he do  if lawsuits are a primary negotiating tool for him in the business world  what will play that role in the world of foreign policy  what will he do to congress when they don t do as he tells them the questions  and their possible answers  paint a terrifying picture that boggles the mind featured image by spencer platt getty images
