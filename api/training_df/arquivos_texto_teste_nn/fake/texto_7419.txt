texas senator ted cruz is a weirdo  even his republican colleague  senator john mccain has called him a  wacko bird  a few weeks ago a disturbing video from when cruz was  years old   aspirations  is that like sweat on my butt   said cruz in the beginning of the video  cruz then goes on to add his life goal is to take over the world and be rich and powerful  the horrifying thing is if he is elected president  he would certainly use it to succeed in the latter  and his foreign policies would probably align with aspirations for world domination most recently  a high school yearbook photo of ted cruz has surfaced  and there is nothing endearing or nostalgically relatable about the photo  ted cruz went transferred to second baptist high school in his junior year of high school  not surprisingly  cruz desperately tried to assimilate with the cool kids  and by all accounts failed miserably  he was very active in drama club though  cruz loved being on stage  even if it meant being the villain   reported npr in july   in junior high school  he had played rolfe  the young nazi in the sound of music  he landed the role of the murderer bill sikes in oliver during high school  the yearbook photo taken depicts another one of cruz s creepy roles in high school  as a biblical mime  supposedly depicting the first man  adam  in an interview with the daily dot  the photographer of the yearbook photo  mark neath  could not recall taking the photo  but did remember cruz s strange life aspirations  i do distinctly remember him boasting that he would become president one day   neath wrote to the daily dot   that s my greatest memory of him  in fact  since that was a pretty unusual life ambition for a high school student  featured image courtesy of second baptist high school
