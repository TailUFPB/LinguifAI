honestly  while republicans may be quaking in their boots over the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia  right wing con artists must be squealing in glee  the sudden death of scalia is a veritable gold mine of fear and anger that the conservative entertainment complex can mine for years to come  despite there being absolutely nothing suspicious about a  year old overweight man that smoked and drank dying of a heart attack  the right is building a delightful cottage industry of  scalia conspiracies  and warning of the all the horrors to come because he died on his most recent  prophetic perspective on current events broadcast  right wing televangelist rick joyner declared that  something smells like a rat  in the recent death of justice antonin scalia and warned that america could descend into civil war over efforts to replace him on the supreme court joyner said that  you can t help but think  that something suspicious is going on regarding scalia s death since no autopsy was performed  they rushed him in there and started the embalming process like they didn t want an autopsy   he said   i m not saying that he was murdered  but you can t help but wonder  joyner went on to say that just as the supreme court s dred scott decision eventually plunged this nation into the civil war  the court s recent marriage equality decision is likewise tearing this nation apart and could soon result in a violent conflict of course  the lawd jaysuz christ will save you from the coming civil war and collapse of civilization but only if you donate    a month to his servants on earth to prove how much you love jayzus hundreds of other sleazy fear profiteers are following suit and whipping the right wing into a frenzy of paranoia that the liberals have begun their war on  murika and may be coming to get you any time now  but not if you buy this doomsday prepper set for  easy installments of    but all of their disgusting exploitation of the stupid and gullible  the right does have a point about the impending violence  even if obama is forced to appoint a moderate conservative to the court  that tilts it sharply away from the far right  even worse  all signs point to a democratic president and congress in  and anthony kennedy will be  years old next year  with a   left leaning court  everything the right has built in the last  years with the help of massive judicial activism will fall apart with scumbags like rick joyner happily egging them to make a quick buck  there is literally zero chance we will not see an increase in domestic terrorism as the conservative base loses their  freedom  to oppress everyone else  murika featured image via motherjones
