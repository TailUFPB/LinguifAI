in a growing trend to keep backwards thinking idiots voting on the issues that really matter  like a woman s right not just to choose but her right to accessible  affordable healthcare  the gop is going to even more ridiculous lengths than ever to enshrine their antiquated beliefs into law  between that and teaching your children to love god and worship him like the founders intended and making sure what happens in your personal life is regulated by overwhelmingly christian beliefs  the zealots of the right have their hands full  to prove they can be bought with taxpayer money  missouri republicans are willing to spend    million so planned parenthood doesn t get   it s so simple it s stupid  which is why it s the perfect play for the gop  first  you decline all federal funding for healthcare costs associated with women s health care  which in this case is    million  you then take that money  less the cut intended for planned parenthood and anyone else who performs abortions and pay it out of the state s general fund  go ahead and tack it on the deficit  you can call it the cost of saving lives you ll complain about having to feed  considering abortions aren t funded with a single federal dollar unless a life is in imminent danger  this really shouldn t matter  but it does missouri is spending    million to block planned parenthood from receiving about   in federal funds https   t co   reid wilson   consultreid  april    parenthood and other local women s health clinics that offer abortion also offer pelvic screening  cancer screening  std screening and family planning services  every dollar of the   cut is taken from those programs because federal dollars can t pay for abortions unless someone s life is at risk  so at great cost to the taxpayer  great cost to the community and without a second thought about how dumb a move this is  republicans are applauding a victory over that evil planned parenthood in the end  they ve shot themselves in the foot  healthy  informed women starting at a young age have a huge effect on the teen pregnancy rate  which in turn has a huge effect on the public assistance rolls  trying to destroy planned parenthood over some bogus videos  knowing that the funding you re blocking doesn t cover what you re opposed to and allowing your lie to cost the people   million to perpetrate are all signs of desperate people preying on the emotions of pro lifers  we know them as republicans senator kurt schaefer  r   who heads the state s appropriations committee  said that planned parenthood is free to do whatever it wants  but that the taxpayer wasn t going to pay for it anymore  that statement is mostly true if you consider that the taxpayer wasn t paying for it to begin with  the taxpayer will still be paying the health care costs for those women who need it  but it will be coming from state revenue and not federal dollars already allocated that your legislature turned down  it s so sad when an idea backfires so bad that there s nothing to do but hold an entire party to blame featured image from lifenews com
