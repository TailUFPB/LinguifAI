the san jose police department has been plagued with accusations of racism and racial profiling  and now they re getting sued for it  a black family alleges that an officer followed them home from picking up their seven year old daughter  and held them at gunpoint for absolutely no reason other than they were black  and the father  emmanuel stephens  might have matched the description of a  suspicious black man  in the area  the family is suing for an unspecified amount in damages the first question that many people will ask themselves when faced with a like this is  what did this family do that caused the officer to draw his gun according the lawsuit  they did nothing  and it s that kind of question that perpetuates racism in the justice system  because nobody asks themselves that when the victim is white  officer alexander keller followed them home  and then when they got out of their car  he got out of his and drew his gun  the officer also put stephens in handcuffs and held him in the back of his patrol car for a while  their car was searched  and stephens was cited for possession of a small amount of pot  despite having it for medical reasons and producing a prescription to prove it worse  when their  year old daughter came out  she was threatened with a trip to juvenile hall if she went back to get her cell phone and record the whole sordid incident their lawyer said  what happened to my clients happens all the time and is a real problem this type of police misconduct only gets attention when someone ends up dead  but this type of non lethal harassment is much more widespread and also need to be brought to light and stopped  the department  however  says that there isn t any bias in their policing methods despite strong evidence to the contrary  and this situation would seem to be another piece of that evidence  another cop later said that someone had reported a suspicious black man with a purple backpack in that area  but stephens had no such backpack  keller proceeded to profile him anyway even if stephens did have such a backpack  there was no way for this officer to see that from his car when he decided to follow them  hold them at gunpoint  detain stephens  and search their car without a warrant and without probable cause  being black does not constitute probable cause san jose s police department is like many others  though  black people are guilty until proven innocent  and are treated as such  had this been a white family  and someone had reported a suspicious white man in their area  would keller still have followed them home and drawn his gun on them  searched their car without a warrant or evidence of wrongdoing  cited him for medical marijuana for which he had a prescription very likely not featured image by david paul morris getty images
