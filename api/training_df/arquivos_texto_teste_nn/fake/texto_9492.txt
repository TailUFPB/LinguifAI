it s hard to shame someone when they have no shame if you live in virginia and you haven t voted for ed gillespie  r  for governor yet  this ad  and the dnc chair s unapologetic tone for its disgusting content will make you want to run to the polls before they close  hopefully  this ad will be the push ed gillespie needed to get him across the finish line in virginia while most condemned the latino victory fund ad that ran during the closing days of virginia s gubernatorial race  which showed a supporter of republican candidate ed gillespie driving a pick up truck and running down hispanic  muslim  black  and asians kids  democratic national committee chair tom perez seemed to be fine with it  it also appears that the democratic candidate  ralph northam  coordinated with lvf to push that ad  lvf listed the ad as a     in kind media contribution  there s nothing wrong with that  but northam said this ad was totally outside his campaign operation  not true speaking with meet the press s chuck todd  perez said that there s been a lot of dog whistling in this race and that northam was trying to unite people  right so  you do that by apparently coordinating with the lvf to push an ad that says white people are all racists  drive pickup trucks  love the confederacy  and just cannot wait to run over nonwhites in the street  the roanoke times  which isn t a republican friendly paper  aptly noted that what this ad conveys is that republicans are bad people  and if you support them you re a bad person  it portrays white rural voters as genocidal  and while they offer hillary clinton some cover they say her remarks were misinterpreted the lvf ad conveys a  deplorable  like tone    townhallthe nbc meet the press host  chuck todd commits a courageous and unexpected act of journalism  when he asks the unapologetic dnc chair tom perez   aren t you stereotyping  i drive a pickup truck  are all pickup truck drivers racist  do you understand why some people think the ad implies that  watch the exchange here  here is the disgusting ad that has since been pulled off the air in its entirety
