on tuesday  republican front runner donald trump shocked everyone by announcing that he was boycotting the fox news gop debate on thursday  as it was being moderated by his nemesis  megyn kelly  and in his childish haste to get back at fox news for giving kelly another chance to make him look like an idiot  trump sent the network a message of blatant disrespect  he would be throwing a competing event  a benefit for america s veterans on the very same day as the gop debate on trump s event page for veterans and wounded warriors  the front runner promised to raise money for the men and women who have been treated so horribly by our all talk  no action politicians   well  it turns out that veterans have a message for trump  we don t want your donations on wednesday  iraq and afghanistan veterans of america founder paul rieckhoff announced that his organization would not accept any contributions that came from trump s event  he tweeted twittertwo other veterans  groups have also decided they want nothing to do with trump s publicity stunt  the wounded warrior project  which has recently come under fire for using its donation money for wasteful purposes  has denied having any awareness of trump s efforts to fundraise for the organization  votevets org  however  was willing to send a more direct message to the goper  the organization  which boasts that it is america s largest progressive veterans group  issued a statement that said  don t hide from megyn kelly behind us   iraq war veteran and chairman of the organization absolutely burned the donald  let me put this in language donald trump understands  you re a loser  you re a third rate politician  who clearly doesn t understand issues  and is so scared of megyn kelly exposing it  that you re looking to use veterans to protect you from facing her questions  the veterans  scorn is honestly well deserved   a look into trump s past can easily prove that this is just a stunt for trump and there s no sincerity in his charity event  the gop front runner has actually been whining about  homeless veterans  for decades  complaining that they bring his property values down  and before he ran for president  trump actually wanted to get rid of america s troops  so don t be fooled by trump s benefit for vets   he doesn t care about them and is just using them to gain more support featured image via gage skidmore
