tomorrow  alabama residents  including thousands of felons who have been registered by al sharpton s alleged brother  will go to the polls to decide who they want to represent them in the us senate  the democrats have contributed over   million to their leftist  virtually unknown candidate  doug jones  so  why are they so eager to take this senate seat in june   the democrats spent an astounding   million in georgia s  congressional district  to lose a house seat in a special election  they falsely believed that the only thing they needed for democrat candidate john ossoff to win the race  was enough georgians who hated donald trump to come out and vote is history repeating itself in alabama democrat senate candidate doug jones raised nearly six times moore s amount ahead of the dec   special election to fill the senate seat vacated by attorney general jeff sessions  jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his gop opponent jones raked in nearly    million compared to jones     million  jones also spent roughly  times as much as moore during that period  nearly    million compared to moore s    million conservative pat buchanan asks   why would christian conservatives in good conscience go to the polls dec   and vote for judge roy moore  despite the charges of sexual misconduct with teenagers leveled against him  answer  that alabama senate race could determine whether roe v  wade is overturned  the lives of millions of unborn may be the stakes there is  however  so much more at stake than the single issue of abortion in this hotly contested senate race  democrats are not going to sit back and allow president trump a pathway to remaking the radical leftist judicial system they ve worked so hard to put in place  today  the gop  holding congress and the white house  has a narrow path to capture the third branch  the supreme court  and to dominate the federal courts for a decade  for this historic opportunity  the party can thank two senators  one retired  the other still sitting the first is former democratic majority leader harry reid of nevada in   harry exercised the  nuclear option   abolishing the filibuster for president obama s judicial nominees  the senate no longer needed  votes to confirm judges  fifty one senate votes could cut off debate  and confirm iowa s chuck grassley warned harry against stripping the minority of its filibuster power  such a move may come back to bite you  he told harry  grassley is now judiciary committee chairman and this year a gop senate voted to use the nuclear option to shut down a filibuster of supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  who was then confirmed with  votes yet the democratic minority still had one card to play to block president trump s nominees   the  blue slip courtesy  if a senator from the state where a federal judicial nominee resides asks for a hold on proceedings  by not returning a blue slip  the judiciary committee has traditionally honored that request and not held hearings sen  al franken of minnesota used the blue slip to block the trump nomination of david stras of minnesota to the  u s  circuit court of appeals  franken calls stras too ideological  too conservative but grassley has now decided to reject the blue slip courtesy for appellate court judges  since their jurisdiction is not just over a single state like minnesota  but over an entire region not only are the federal court vacancies almost unprecedented  a gop senate and trump are working in harness to fill them before january   when a new congress is sworn in if republicans blow this opportunity  it is unlikely to come again  for the supreme court has seemed within republican grasp before  only to have it slip away because of presidential errors both trump  by whom he nominates  and a republican senate  with its power to confirm with  votes  are indispensable if we are to end judicial dictatorship in america    pat buchanan  yellow hammer news
