 republican governor rick scott of florida had a big smirk on his face and was talking with confidence during an interview with morning joe co host joe scarborough  the fun scott seemed to be having abruptly ended when scarborough asked him one simple question  would you tell your friend donald trump that he should walk back his statements that muslims  that islam  hates america  do you think muslims in the state of florida hate america  scarborough was referencing trump s recent statement that muslims hate america  not only did rick scott refuse to refute trump s statement  but he dodged the question multiple times  talking about how great his state is in terms of being a melting pot and other stupid statements  scarborough pressed scott again  i want you to answer the question  do you personally think that islam is a religion that hates america  scott again refused to answer the question with more red herrings and continued to talk more about his state    no  no  that s not answering any questions   jumped in co host  mika brzezinski  she then cut him down  had his mic shut off and when rick scott attempted to speak again  it became clear his mic had been shut off  back from commercial  brzezinski stated to the viewers   that s just not what we do on our show  it was an amazing display of a journalist taking control of an interview  more importantly  brzezinski sent a message that refusing to condemn hate speech is no different than actually spewing it when she kicked this idiot off the show watch here   featured image via video screenshot
