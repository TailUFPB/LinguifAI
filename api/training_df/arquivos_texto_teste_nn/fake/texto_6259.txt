on top of failing to pay charities for months after the fundraiser  despite already having beneficiaries listed  it turns out donald trump actually lied about how much was raised   to the tune of around a million and a half dollars  and now  four months later  his campaign is admitting it in fact  as of this time  only a little over three million has actually been paid out  meaning it s possible that even the new number given by the trump s campaign is false  that  or worse  it simply disappeared  according to his campaign  donations were pledged that were not received  but that begs the question  if    million was definitely raised  where did it go in any case  the amount of time between the fundraiser and actually paying the money is questionable  and trump has been called out by many people for it   including sandra miniutti  the vice president for charity navigator  a service that rates charities in recent weeks  trump and his campaign repeatedly declined to give new details about how much they have given away  why should i give you records   trump said in an interview with the post this month   i don t have to give you records  in the past few days  the post has interviewed  veterans charities that received donations as a result of trump s fundraiser  none of them have reported receiving personal donations from trump did trump make good on his promise to give from his personal funds  the money is fully spent  mr  trump s money is fully spent   lewandowski said who did trump give to  and in what amounts  he s not going to share that information   lewandowski said of course not featured image by christopher furlong getty images
