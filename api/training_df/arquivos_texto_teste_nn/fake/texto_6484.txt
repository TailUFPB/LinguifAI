on thursday  failed  presidential candidate mitt romney met with william kristol  kristol  considered an influential voice on the right  is leading the effort to draft an independent candidate to challenge the party s presumptive nominee  donald trump according to the washington post  kristol and romney met privately at the j w  marriott hotel in washington to discuss the possibility of romney entering the race as a third party candidate kristol confirmed the  little meeting  during a phone interview with the washington post on friday  saying  he came pretty close to being elected president  so i thought he may consider doing it  especially since he has been very forthright in explaining why donald trump and hillary clinton should not be president of the united states  the washington post reports that kristol has been desperately seeking  a prominent political or military figure who could be drafted into the general election contest   in hopes of stopping donald trump kristol previously attempted to draft retired marine gen  james n  mattis  who turned down the proposition according to statements made by romney later on thursday  the former candidate said he is not interested in launching an independent run  however he appeared to wholeheartedly support the idea the washington examiner reports that romney said  i m certainly going to be hoping that we find someone who i have my confidence in who becomes nominee  i don t intend on supporting either of the major party candidates at this point  he continued  saying  i am dismayed at where we are now  i wish we had better choices  and i keep hoping that somehow things will get better  and i just don t see an easy answer from where we are  no republicans  there really is  no easy answer  from where you are  where you are is totally screwed there is no super hero republican  political or military figure  who is going to save the gop from the monster it created  even if there was  it certainly wouldn t be mitt romney  who was already trounced by democrats in  lest we forget  the  primary season began with  republican candidates the candidates included a long list of republican  all stars   rick santorum  ben carson  bobby jindal  carly fiorina  mike huckabee  rick perry  jeb bush  chris christie  john kasich  ted cruz  marco rubio  jim gilmore  rand paul  george pataki  lindsey graham  scott walker  jack fellure  andy martin  dennis michael lynch  mark everson  jimmy mcmillan and of course  donald trump  needless to say  none of the other  primary candidates managed to stop donald trump the fact that republicans are now hoping against hope that somehow mitt romney can save the republican party from certain death is almost comical the republican base clearly doesn t want another candidate  if they did  they could have picked any one of the  other morons who entered the  primary race sadly  they want donald trump  sadder still  they want trump because his politics of hate aptly represent the dregs of society that the right wing has been recruiting into the party for decades image credit  john tlumacki the boston globe via getty images
