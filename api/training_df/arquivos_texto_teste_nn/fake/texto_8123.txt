you may have seen the latest republican debates held on saturday night  if so  chances are you caught the pre debate moment of silence held for the belated supreme court justice antonin scalia  who recently passed away in his hotel room in texas  what you may or may not have noticed  depending on how attentive you were  was that donald trump stuck out like a sore thumb  instead of bowing his head like every other republican candidate up on the stage  he just stood there and seemed just to stare the entire time so  this begs the question  does donald trump know what to do during a moment of silence  or  does he just not care to show respect to dead supreme court justices once they pass away  a right wing one at that   either way   it makes him end up looking like a jackass   even more so than the one he already is which brings us to another point  remember that time conservatives threw a fit when president obama was accused of being  unpatriotic  after a photograph circulated in the right wing media showing him not placing his hand on his heart during the pledge of allegiance  well  guess what  that was a total lie  it was the national anthem  and the star spangled banner was playing also   remember that time  not too long ago  when republicans also tried to take jabs at the president when he showed up late for a moment of silence held by world leaders in turkey to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks in paris  he got an earful in the media for that one pic via screen capture where is the outrage against donald trump  that s really the question being posed here  there isn t any  no  it s okay for president donald trump to do that  but not a president barack obama  trump is going to make  america great again   and   he s off to a great start at that excuse me for one second while i go throw up now  president trump is something nobody on god s green earth should ever have to say featured image via screen capture
