just about every day  rush limbaugh s big fat lies are systematically exposed and debunked online by a variety of sources  and it never stops being awesome  but when it comes from one of his own dittoheads   and on his own show  no less   it s especially entertaining  not only is it fun to hear callers stick it to him  it s even more fun to watch limbaugh squirm and pluck his chest  desperately struggling to wiggle out of the call such was the case on tuesday following president obama s executive order to expand background checks and to provide additional funding for mental health treatment and new resources for the fbi and the atf during the january  edition of his radio show  limbaugh was ranting about something he yanked out of his diseased bunghole  suggesting that obama s executive order forces patients to tell their doctors where they re storing their firearms and ammo  of course  this is total hooey  and limbaugh would ve continued to elaborate on his lie if it hadn t been for an industrious and  pro gun  caller who totally undermined limbaugh s entire rant with the  you know  facts hashtag flop sweat the caller noted that there are  in fact  state level statutes in place already that mandate doctors to ask mental health patients if they believe they re a danger to themselves  but there s nothing in either state law or obamacare or in obama s executive order demanding that doctors known where patients are hiding their weapons  nothing  it doesn t exist  limbaugh made it up via media matters caller  ou re telling a half truth  at least for my state   a half truth for my state  you need to get the information from the pamphlets that were sent out to health professionals at that time for each state  and we weren t   it does not say you ask where the gun is  it asks sensible things like  are you going to hurt yourself   if they are  of course  stupid enough to say yes  you re  you know   do you have access to ways   are you planning on hurting someone else  but nothing on that says that i have to ask him   where is your gun   and so forth  i got that information and that was from my state  not from obama  that was from my state  and i know federal trickles down to state  but i take a little issue with some of your blanket statements when most of it was common sense prior to that  but it is state statute in illinois a long time ago that if  say grandma has dementia and she lives with you  that you have a certain way to store that  and that s just called gun responsibility limbaugh stammered and tried desperately to dodge the truth  the caller  meanwhile  kept hammering away  noting that it s perfectly acceptable to  for instance  call the police if we think someone in our household is a danger to him or herself  the caller refers to this action as a  civic responsibility  needless to say  limbaugh s call screener will likely be spending the new year looking for a new job by the way  you have to listen to the audio of the call just to hear limbaugh completely choking on the truth featured image via video screen grab
