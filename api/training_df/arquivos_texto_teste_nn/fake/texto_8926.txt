it s no secret that nra executive vice president wayne lapierre is totally fricking nuts  unfortunately for him  his newest online video won t ameliorate his reputation for being a well financed escaped mental patient cutting to the chase  lapierre s video goes something like this   background checks should be expanded    background checks shouldn t be expanded    the nra helped create background checks i m not exaggerating  lapierre opens by discussing how the nra has been actively pushing for the background check system to be augmented to include mental health records  which  lapierre says  would ve prevented a long list of recent mass shootings  by the way  smart move  wayne  thanks for reminding us about some of the most tragic gun related killing sprees of our lifetime  i m not sure whether acknowledging the roster of homicidal killers is the best way to pitch the nra s pro gun position  but there it is he continued by taking a sharp right hand turn   criticizing the expansion of background checks to include gun shows and internet sales after having just seconds earlier supporting the idea  see  apparently expanding background checks to include mentally ill people is somehow better than expanding them to include gun shows the video wraps with yet another whiplash inducing pivot  lapierre explains how the nra was instrumental in establishing the national instant check system in the first place  an obvious admission that the nra once supported a gun regulation measure  the expansion of which is now inexplicably forbidden okeedokee the bottom line  yes  the system could be heftier  the problem is that lapierre and his flying monkeys spend millions of dollars intimidating or buying off lawmakers who render ineffective any efforts to improve the system  in other words  any weaknesses in the system can almost entirely be blamed on the nra  and if a bill that fortifies the system is introduced  the nra will inevitably kill it  why  anything that makes it more difficult for consumers to buy guns will be opposed simply because the nra is solely tasked with selling guns  lapierre knows the second amendment is nothing more than a convenient marketing gimmick for selling deadly weapons to sociopaths featured image via video screen grab
