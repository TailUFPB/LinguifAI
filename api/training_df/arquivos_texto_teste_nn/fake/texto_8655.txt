governor rick snyder and his emergency management team have literally poisoned the water in flint  michigan  the city is literally in the middle of a public health emergency  and snyder is being roundly criticized for his actions that could have permanent effects on the lives of the children living there who have been drinking and bathing in lead poisoned water politicians and emergency workers around the nation have been gravely concerned about the situation in flint  and many are doing what they can to bring an end to the water crisis and aid those poor residents affected by it  one such politician is democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  she sent two of her best and most trusted campaign staff to the suffering city of flint  to do whatever they could to help in this time of dire need  clinton s proactive response has earned her the endorsement of flint s mayor  karen weaver  the mayor said of clinton s response to the crisis  if this was a test  she has really come to the forefront and passed it because we in flint need some help and we need it now  the statement came during a conference call that was the work of clinton s campaign  it seems as if the endorsement wasn t part of weaver s planned press releases from the call  but  nonetheless it happened  she said  when asked if she was giving clinton her endorsement  yeah it does sound like it  doesn t it  i want hillary  weaver went on to mention that others had expressed outrage and concern over what was going on in flint  but action was what got hillary her endorsement  we do want some accountability  but as far as what hillary clinton has done  she has actually been the only candidate  whether we re talking about democratic or republican  to reach out and talk with us   we want a friend like hillary in the white house  this is a very important endorsement from a mayor who has suddenly found herself thrust onto the national stage because of reckless decisions by a gop governor who doesn t give a damn about the people he is supposed to serve whether it s hillary clinton or bernie sanders  hopefully both would work to get rick snyder and those like him out of positions of power before they can ruin anymore lives there have been at least three class action lawsuits filed on behalf of those living in flint who are affected by the poisoned water  according to attorneys for the city of flint s residents  the consequences for what rick snyder has done could be dire  and those responsible must be held accountable  and taken from their positions  public officials must never again be permitted to give assurances to the public about public health conditions when they know the assurances are false  public officials must never again be permitted to ruin the lives of our children by remaining silent in the face of a public health emergency  that is exactly right  hillary and other democrats  thank you for doing what you are doing  these people need your support so much right now  this isn t about politics  it s about people s lives  hopefully others follow in clinton s footsteps and send desperately needed aid to flint  michigan featured image via twitter
