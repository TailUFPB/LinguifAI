after they were crushed in the  election  republicans wrote a post mortem document that advised the party to reach out to latino voters more than any other group if they wanted to be a viable political entity  romney lost latinos by      an increase from the  margin of    which was a huge jump from john kerry s advantage with those voters of only   in   it was a disaster  and in that same time latinos have gone from   of voters to   of voters in   and that is expected to continue rising and now along comes trump  thanks to his blatantly racist rhetoric and attacks on latinos  it now appears that latino immigrants are signing up to become american citizens just to stick it to the current republican front runner over all  naturalization applications increased by  percent in the  fiscal year over the year before  and jumped  percent during the six months ending in january  according to federal figures  the pace is picking up by the week  advocates say  and they estimate applications could approach  million in   about   more than the average in recent years while naturalizations generally rise during presidential election years  mr  trump provided an extra boost this year trump started his campaign by calling mexicans drug traffickers and rapists  and it has only gotten worse as the national spotlight has shone on his campaign  he s gone after blacks  muslims  women  and asians among others  but his campaign of hate against latinos has been non stop  even targeting the current and former presidents of mexico and his target audience has responded  trump fans have beaten up latinos  while citing their hero for their motivation  as children have begun using trump s rhetoric about building a wall on the southern border in order to insult latino kids the republicans have turned a blind eye to racial intolerance for a long time  choosing to court the support of racists in close elections while pretending not to hear their hate speech  trump s rise shows that it s too late  and that this strategy could now spell complete doom for the republican party  featured image via flickr
