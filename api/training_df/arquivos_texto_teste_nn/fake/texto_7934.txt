supreme court justice clarence thomas is the epitome of conservative obstructionism  as the court evolved over the years  participation from the justices  specifically in the form of questions for petitioners  became a regular part of the system  clarence thomas  however  just sits and listens a man in that kind of position of power who doesn t speak isn t giving petitioners the right to prepare to counter the views he s known to have through his past rulings and written opinions  which people say are stellar  still  something doesn t sit right with a justice who hasn t asked a question from the bench in exactly one decade there is some speculation that thomas is self conscious about his georgia accent  he has also admitted that he doesn t like to compete with the louder voices on the court  there was no louder voice than antonin scalia  scalia never missed the opportunity to ask a question he felt needed answering  he may very well be the reason why clarence thomas went into super secret quiet mode  chatting small talk with fellow justices only and cracking a joke once a few years ago  the last time he asked a question was on a death penalty case in  scalia covered what clarence thomas needed to hear  their voting records nearly identical  the well known thomas written opinion is nothing but a mirror of what had already been spoken in open court  so what will clarence thomas do without antonin scalia  he s still got justice alito and chief justice roberts  but with justice kennedy moving further to the left as america evolves as a society and an open seat that will likely be filled by a democratic appointment  the days of hobby lobby jesus law and  citizens united  the repeal of the voting rights act  could very well be over it will definitely be interesting to see if clarence thomas changes with the court featured image from biography com
