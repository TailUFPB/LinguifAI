while ted cruz would say that he is possessed by the spirit of his lord and savior jesus christ  some would argue that he is instead possessed by a more insidious force  according to two men who attended one of the texas senator s rallies  he s plagued by demons  likely the sort that cause a person to say and do things so stupid that they have a chance of becoming the gop nominee for president the dallas morning news reports that cruz had just begun a speech when two men wielding mirrors and crosses appeared  one of the men shouting  ted cruz look in the mirror and let the evil spirit depart  he s possessed by a demon  cruz s supporters began to boo as their allegedly demon possessed leader joked that the men were sent by the bernie sanders campaign  as police forced the men to exit for simply expressing a religious opinion   something conservatives would normally oppose  even if it was crazy or in jest   the men managed to stay in character  he s possessed by a demon   the man yelled   the demon has to leave  that s why the body is so disgusting to look at  this  of course  is something with which cruz s daughter seems to agree  as she was unwilling to accept her father s forced affection at another recent campaign event in which he tried to use her as a political prop  further evidence that cruz is possessed can  of course  be found in the words of the senator s former college roommate  who has stated that ted leaves behind a disgusting greasy film on anything he touches  even science struggles to explain what  exactly  is so unsettling about cruz but one neurologist explained that he is  at a loss  to explain why cruz s face leaves him  cold  while it s unlikely cruz is actually possessed by a demon  it is easy to see why one might assume this is the case  yhe other man urged the senator to look at himself in the mirror so  the evil can confront itself  evil body  evil spirit  look yourself in the mirror   the man said as they exited the building  one of the unnamed men explained   still impressively in character   that  we just had to get rid of the evil spirit  i hope it works   one man remarked  motioning that he was sick to his stomach   he s very hard to be in the same room with  we had to exorcise some sort of disgusting evil spirit  there s a reason that the body is so haggard and disgusting  and the face  and it s all so weathered and gross and hard to look at and it s because he s possessed by a demon  being in the room with evil so close  it s just hard to even comprehend  the evil is so deep rooted and maybe if it had to confront itself  watch the  exorcism  below  abc breaking news   latest news videosthe men explain their actions here featured image via screengrab dallas morning news
