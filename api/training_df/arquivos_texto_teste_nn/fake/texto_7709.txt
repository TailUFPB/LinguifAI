the gop presidential primary hit a new low on thursday night as the debate descended into a literal cockfight  with donald trump attempting to convince us all about the satisfactory size of his manhood  this is not satire  this actually happened the weirdest campaign moment yet came after a plea by marco rubio that the gop candidates end their war of insults  and keep the debate to a battle of ideas instead  at which point  trump took us on a tangent  which ended with him telling us all about the size of his penis basically  trump has been smarting for a quarter of a century over a slight made against him by journalist graydon carter  the vanity fair writer wrote a negative piece on trump  in which he called him a  short fingered vulgarian  last october  carter published a piece in vanity fair entitled  why donald trump will always be a  short fingered vulgarian   in which he detailed trump s thin skinned response to the criticism  and his refusal to let the matter go  he writes like so many bullies  trump has skin of gossamer  he thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else  but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self image  he coils like a caged ferret  just to drive him a little bit crazy  i took to referring to him as a  short fingered vulgarian  in the pages of spy magazine  that was more than a quarter of a century ago  to this day  i receive the occasional envelope from trump  there is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine  on all of them he has circled his hand in gold sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers and so it was  that trump decided that a primary debate to decide the republican nominee for president of the united states  was the appropriate place to brag about the size of his penis  look at those hands  are they small hands   he told the crowd  holding his  admittedly stubby  fingers out towards the audience and the cameras  he referred to my hands   if they re small  something else must be small   i guarantee you there s no problem  i guarantee  there was awkward laughter from the audience  there was probably much louder laughter around the world  as u s  politics is turned into the kind of embarrassing spectacle that we are more used to seeing from north korea or other banana republics  donald trump is fast becoming the kim jong un of america  an over fed  over indulged  hyper vain authoritarian who embarrasses his nation every time he embarrasses himself   featured image by gage skidmore  flickr creative commons
