one of the most embarrassing moments in politics this week happened in missouri during a debate in the missouri house committee on children and families  gop state rep  mike moon declared that since he was once an embryo that means he is a qualified reproductive health expert who knows what he is talking about when it comes to abortion and whether or not an embryo is a person and yes  people laughed at him the hearing was about house joint resolution   which would ban abortion in the state by enshrining the right to life of  unborn human children at every stage of biological development  in the missouri constitution according to the columbia missourian  moon  opened the hearing by showing a video of an unborn fetus on a display monitor  the fetus was developed enough to make out undeniably human characteristics  such as hands and a face  a precious sight  i think most of us would agree   moon declared   the more you look at that  the more you have to realize that that is a human being  moon went on to compare abortion to slavery before making more of an ass of himself by concluding   as a former embryo myself  i would like protection for all embryos   after the laughter died down  a real health expert testified against the resolution st  louis physician ed weisbart said there is no scientific consensus for when life begins and that women should have the final choice to end their pregnancy or not meanwhile  the united states constitution  which supersedes state law  says plainly in the  amendment that only  all persons born  are granted citizenship under the jurisdiction of the united states in other words  the constitution does not consider unborn fetuses as persons under the law plus  banning abortion would take away the fundamental rights of due process and equal protection from women  which is unconstitutional not only would the supreme court be duty bound to overturn hjr   it would cost missouri taxpayers millions of dollars to fund a losing cause and if missouri conservatives really want to continue to argue  they should consider that even their bible does not consider fetuses to be persons also  being an embryo at one time does not make anyone an expert on reproductive issues  it s like saying you re an expert pastry chef because you once made mud pies as a child  that just doesn t fly the bottom line is that women should have the choice and republicans need to back off and stop trying to force their religious beliefs down their throats  especially when those beliefs contradict what their bibles actually say  but the bible shouldn t matter anyway because the constitution has already clearly defined personhood and it starts at birth featured image  imgur
