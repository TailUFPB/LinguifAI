liz heron  executive editor at the huffington post  tweeted out a photo from their editorial meeting on may   and it has twitter in an absolute uproar  can you see why notice anything about this  huffingtonpost editors meeting         pic twitter com   liz heron   lheron  may    emoji she s got on there clearly show that she s touting  girl power  with this photo  but there is  in fact  a major problem with it that brought twitter s wrath down upon her  and the huffington post itself  it s diversity  or a lack thereof  where s the racial diversity the editorial staff is primarily white  like most executive staffs at most companies  and twitter was kind enough to point that out  along with a couple of other problems  an ed table full of white women  and  huffingtonpost s  readership is in the toilet  shocker https   t co   joe knight   moneyjknight  may     lheron   it seems that the  huffingtonpost has a few kinks left in the cloning process   mennoknight     may      lheron  huffingtonpost i m a suburban harvard educated white guy named white and that room makes me look like shaft  popehat   popehat  may    adam baldwin weighed in on the diversity problem   seanmdav  lheron  jtlol pic twitter com   adam baldwin   adambaldwin  may    bunkerwsmith  cernovich  lheron  soylentopia  huffingtonpost found the token asian minorities pic twitter com   peppercats   peppercats  may     lheron  huffingtonpost white power  soz i meant girl power  pic twitter com   o e p    pyramidports  may    lheron  huffingtonpost the fact that you don t notice what apparently half of the people in the world do says a lot about your pov   all bass  no treble     may    next one is needling huffpo over the fact that it loves painting itself as the liberal answer to conservative media  however  it behaves like a typical  profit mongering corporation that would support conservative business policies to enhance its bottom line  and engages in questionable practices to that same end  like having thousands of writers work for free  lheron huffingtonpost what i notice is that nobody there is more than  years out of college  ignorant  but cheap as dirt to hire   robert tracinski   tracinski  may    going through these tweets  one will see some predictably sexist tweets about how it s just as sexist for a company to have an entirely female leadership staff as it is for them to have an entirely male leadership staff  that s male privilege talking  though   we still live in a man s world here  women have it much harder in the workplace  including climbing that vaunted corporate ladder  than men do an all female editorial team in a man s world is great  however  for a supposedly liberal outlet  whatever attempts they re making at racial diversity suck  we have to wonder whether their hr department screens out resumes of people with  black  sounding names like many other hr departments do  we also have to wonder whether they consider black people to automatically be less qualified  like many other companies seem to perhaps they re afraid they ll lose readers if their readers know they have black people on their editorial staff yes  companies should absolutely put the people they believe to be the best qualified in open positions  oftentimes  however  black candidates are judged more harshly than other candidates  especially white candidates  due to racial biases in a variety of areas  huffpo  this is extremely disappointing image via screen capture from embedded tweet by liz heron
