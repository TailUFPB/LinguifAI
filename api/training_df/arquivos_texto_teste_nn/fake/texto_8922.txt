when we think of school shootings  we often think of those directly involved   the dead  the wounded  the people who saw the gunman s face  desiree palmer was not in the room at marysville pilchuk high school in washington  when freshman jaylen fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students  killing four  before fatally shooting himself  but she  along with an entire community  felt the impact desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than montel williams  williams  a proud  gun owning conservative  recently said that he watched president obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not  of course  by stripping ownership from law abiding citizens as the nra and its acolytes fear  but through a series of common sense reforms while some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that obama is coming for their guns  williams takes a more reasonable stance  as he explained via facebook  i m a proud  responsible gun owner and we ought to be the loudest voices for universal background checks  for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill  that is how to be a proud steward of the     right i and so many others hold dear  if i thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns  i d oppose it   williams told his inevitable detractors   i m a law abiding american   nothing to fear  i think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it easier and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns  truly responsible gun owners  williams says  support common sense reforms the talk show legend told addicting info that palmer s story helped him form his opinions  that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done we agree that palmer s words need to be read by all  though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss  lived through the terror  and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day  while it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families  when violence occurs it hurts everyone around in it  you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many  or most  do not  the fear that someone she knows  a loved one  a friend might pick up a gun  that friends will die far too young  that life will never be normal again i think it is safe to say that i have always been a pretty fearful person  i am afraid of failure  displeasing people  not doing the right thing  but i have never been afraid of the actual world  until now  october  will be a day i always remember because it has challenged almost everything that i believe in  i wasn t in the cafeteria and i wasn t close to the ones we lost  yet still  i am not okay  and i hate the response i have been getting by admitting that  people say   well  you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you   i seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until i realized that i am allowed to feel how i feel  i feel weird  abnormal  dysfunctional  incapable  unsocial  exhausted  broken  and weak  but i also feel nothing at all i go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal i go to school and pretend things are normal and i am so sick of it it has been  days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever behind closed doors  that is  i think all of us realize it  but think we are too crazy to actually believe that maybe it is acceptable for us to still be in pain  teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say  everyone avoids it because they think they are alone i am asking this for myself and my peers at marysville pilchuck  please  someone  say something say something besides  it s time to get back to work  we have tests in may  say something besides  we have to move on  or  you ll get through it  we need to hear   it s okay to not be okay right now   because a lot of us don t think it is it is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened  the most common thing i see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them  some days i am too tired to deal with the emotions  but most days  i m just pissed off  we all need to heal  but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping  we have had enough taken away from us i have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school  often times  one of my peers is the one holding the gun i think that is what scares me the most  this time  it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger  it was a friend to many and a family member  i can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly born fear of trusting other people i guess you just never really know these days i have been trying to write this post for about    months  every few weeks  i go back and read what i had said the last time i wrote  each time  i try to finish it  but never do  when i started  it was november   i explained what i went through on that day from beginning to end  the second entry  was right before christmas and at that point  i was just sad  it s scary to watch myself explain how i have reached acceptance of reality  and then a few short weeks later  describe how i am absolutely falling apart  i have never been so confused in my entire life to be honest  i still don t really know what i am trying to accomplish by writing this  maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day  my hope isn t that you understand me  it s that i start to today i am angry and fearful angry that the world is the way it is  and fearful of the same thing desiree palmermarysville pilchuck high school studentit s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation  after all  we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or  from more callous individuals  that  your dead kids don t trump my constitutional rights  lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear  they are future doctors  lawyers  musicians  artists  police  and more  they are our future  which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action  each time this comes up  we are fed the excuse that common sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre  or the one before that  or the one before that  so why bother trying   the president said of his planned reforms   i reject that thinking  we know we can t stop every act of violence  every act of evil in the world  but maybe we could try to stop one act of evil  one act of violence   obama said   and he s right  if expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life  then they are worth it  period featured image via
