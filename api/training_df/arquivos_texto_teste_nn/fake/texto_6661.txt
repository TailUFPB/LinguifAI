the definition of rape came under fire in oklahoma wednesday when a the state s high court ruled that a girl who had accused a boy of sexually assaulting her was too drunk to be a reliable witness and dismissed the charges against the boy she says raped her while she was either too intoxicated or unconscious  she was  at the time of the assault and he was  the boy claims that the girl  who was four times past the legal limit to drive  engaged in a consensual oral act with him  the court of criminal appeals agreed with him  stating that  force can t be substituted with intoxication under the  law   prosecutors are furious  because the boy gets a walk  and while the court also said   we will not  in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense  enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language   it stated it in an  unpublished opinion   meaning the case can t be cited as precedent that means that nothing has changed  the court has given its opinion on what some poor drunk teenage girl forever changed because a poor decision led to a boy who is legally an adult in many states raped her and got away with it  by saying it isn t precedent means they certainly don t want to close the door on the fact that people are raped  just not for this girl  who they obviously believe could have possibly been responsible for such a thing at  years old  they don t make good decisions when they re stone cold sober  nevermind when you ply them with booze from what s available  the boy  who had a friend with him  gave the girl a ride home because she was so drunk  he dropped his friend off first  who would testify that the girl was drifting in and out of consciousness  and somewhere between there and the girl s house his dna ended up all over her and she has no memory of the encounter  the court said they wouldn t create a crime to prosecute one offender because the forcible sodomy law says you have to use force  not alcohol or by that logic  date rape drugs  to incapacitate and force yourself on your victim interpreting law is what a high court does  does somebody really have to tell these idiots that rape is about control  not sex  maybe they saw this one kid as some believable victim of a circumstance beyond his control  but what they ve done is fostered a rapist and given plenty of other young abusers  in training a new something to think about  until oklahoma either changes the law or replaces the imbeciles on its high court who interpret it  it s a breeding ground for predatory behavior featured image from okhouse gov
