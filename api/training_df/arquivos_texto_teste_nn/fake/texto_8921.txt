federal authorities have no intention of killing the bundy brothers and their traitorous followers  they d rather arrest them and put them behind bars thus far  the federal government has been incredibly tolerant of the armed white rednecks currently occupying a federal wildlife refuge building in oregon the militants would like to engage federal law enforcement in a firefight to the death  but seeing as how authorities are planning to cut electricity to the building and the fact that the men had to beg for supplies because they failed to prepare for the long haul  it won t be long before the cold winter and hunger force them to surrender the fbi and sheriff s office are counting the felonies and misdemeanors each member of the group has committed since the beginning of their stunt  and according to harney county sheriff david ward  the fbi intends to arrest them and make them pay the consequences for their actions  the bureau has assured me that those at the malheur national wildlife refuge will at some point face charges   ward told oregon public broadcasting on tuesday  he then warned the militant that things will only get worse for them the longer they refuse to surrender   they have an opportunity right now to work towards a better solution  and not face further charges   he said indeed  right now the group faces charges of sedition and treason against the united states  in addition  they also face charges for breaking and entering  carrying guns on federal property  and trespassing  just to name a few if found guilty of a felony  they would also be departed from the ones they love the most their guns so while the federal government isn t going in with guns blazing  they are taking steps to end the pathetic little rebellion and are waiting to place each domestic terrorist in shiny metal bracelets to help speed up the process  sheriff ward also pleaded for people to stop sending supplies to the militants  i think if one person gives them a snickers bar  they re going on national media and claiming that the community supports them  if you re giving them support  you re just prolonging the situation  here s the audio via oregon public broadcasting it s been a rough week for bundy and his buddies  not only have they been roundly condemned by democrats and republicans alike  they can t even catch a break from fox news and have been mercilessly mocked across the country  becoming a national punchline for now  all we can do is wait for bundy and crew tuck their tails between their legs and surrender to see if the fbi keeps their word that they will face charges for their crimes  until then  let the mockery continue featured image  wise geek
