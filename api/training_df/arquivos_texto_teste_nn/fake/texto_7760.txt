there are moments in life when you have to admit you made mistakes  however  for new jersey gov  chris christie  this is not one of those moments  to be blunt  he s having a very bad week  not only is christie no longer in the running for the white house  he made the bizarre choice to endorse donald trump on the same weekend that trump wouldn t disavow the ku klux klan  and it even seems as if trump isn t that thrilled with the support  telling christie that he should just  go home  christie claims he s  proud  to support trump  but his actions at a recent press conference suggest otherwise  he insisted that he only be asked questions that were  on topic   and anytime he was asked about trump he would go off into a rehearsed non answer to avoid the subject  he said things  such as  no  i won t permit you to  i told you that there s going to be only on topic questions today  so  permission denied  that s an off topic question  i think you understand that i m answering on topic questions today  and then when asked why he wouldn t answer any questions related to trump  he responded with the maturity level of a four year old being asked to eat his peas  because i don t want to  at this point the new jersey governor should just go back to his state to take care of business instead of try to hold on to whatever remaining spotlight he can  he should do so not only for his state  but also for his dignity christie  back away slowly while you still can and do your job  both your state and your nation will appreciate it  not only does your endorsement mean nothing to trump  it makes you look like  to use your language  an idiot watch the awkward moments from the press conference here featured image via screen grab
