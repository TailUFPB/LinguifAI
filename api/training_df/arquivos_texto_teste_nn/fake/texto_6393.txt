while the united states has as one of its presumptive party nominees a raging bigot who clearly hates muslim individuals  even going so far as to say that if he were to become president he would ban muslims from entering the nation  london has just elected a muslim mayor now that sadiq khan has been elected mayor of london  he has some very choice words for republican presidential candidate donald trump khan  being the son of pakistani immigrants himself  is none to pleased with trump s divisive rhetoric surrounding the islamic faith  and it s true that if the united states is to embody freedom  especially religious freedom  trump needs to be educated on what that actually is  and khan seems more than willing to provide that education half joking  khan said  i ll need to rush to come to america before november  because if trump wins  i ll be banned from coming  but in an interview with time magazine  he was much more serious with his remarks  if donald trump becomes the president  i ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith  which means i can t engage with american mayors and swap ideas  conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win london and they were wrong  i m confident that donald trump s approach to politics won t win in america  in yet another interview  after hearing trump congratulated him on his victory  khan said  my point to donald trump is  don t make an exception for me  reconsider your views on islam  driving the point home  also hoping to  educate  trump  khan told bbc  this isn t just about me  it s about my friends  my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine  anywhere in the world  imagine if the world were to judge all americans by the words and actions of donald trump  that s exactly what trump does when he judges an entire religion by an extremist few who claim they are of the islamic faith  but yet clearly are just sociopaths trump s rhetoric is not only bad for the united states  it s bad for the entire world  how is a man  who wants to be leader of the free world  supposed to do so by condemning all people of the world s second largest religion watch some of khan s comments here featured image via video screen capture  chip somodevilla getty images
