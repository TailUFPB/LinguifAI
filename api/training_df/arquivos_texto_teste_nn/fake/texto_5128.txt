donald trump s republican issue just got a lot harder  after  prominent republican security expert denounced the republican nomine as a threat to national security  a gop member of the united states senate has finally  after much speculation  come out and said what s music to every democrats  ears susan collins  a moderate member of the gop from maine  has come out and pledged that she will not be voting for nor endorsing donald trump  after months of withholding an endorsement pending a change of heat from the presidential nominee  talking to reporters  collins said plainly i will not be voting for donald trump for president  this is not a decision i make lightly  for i am a lifelong republican  but donald trump does not reflect historical republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country while touching on trump  and bernie sanders   resonating campaigns that struck a nerve with millions of americans who feel disenfranchised  collins ultimately came to conclude that trump  rejecting the conventions of political correctness is different from showing complete disregard for common decency  by  shedding the stilted campaign dialogue  has left her with no other option one major reason collins decided to back out of endorsing trump was his attack on military personnel and their families  like her colleague john mccain to collins  trump isn t just advocating for an abolition of political correctness  he s engaging in a full on assault on decency  and it s that boisterous arrogance that is turning off millions of decent  honest  lincoln republicans like collins collins joins her independent colleague angus king is deciding to forgo a trump endorsement  representing a state that traditionally goes democratic in presidential elections  collins is also now the second republican in the senate to come out and refuse to support trump indefinitely  no contingencies thank you  senator collins  for standing up to trump and his bigoted  shameful scam of a candidacy  and special thanks for standing up the bully pulpit used by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who has been desperately trying to herd his sheep of senators to get behind trump featured image via alex wong getty images
