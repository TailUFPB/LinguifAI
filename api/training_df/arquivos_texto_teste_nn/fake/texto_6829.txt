donald trump s kids may support him in spirit  and terrible tweets   but they won t be going out to vote for him in the new york primary  ivanka and eric trump both failed to register as republicans in time to do so  according to trump  this is because new york s primary registration rules were unfair  after all  the cutoff was in october  and at that point people   including  apparently  his own kids   still sort of expected trump to have dropped out by now on cnn  ivanka claimed new york s voting regulations are  onerous  new york has one of the most onerous rules in terms of registration  and it required us to register a long time ago  almost   close to a year ago  and we didn t do that  we found out about it sort of after the fact  to which the millions of disenfranchised democratic voters who have watched  voter id  laws sweep the country responded by playing the world s smallest violin trump himself told his supporters that ivanka and eric feel very  very guilty   adding   they feel very guilty  but it s fine  i understand that  except here s the thing  the trump kids could probably vote for their dad if they really wanted to  it would just require a little work in a highly informative piece on gothamist  writer nathan tempey explained how someone who missed the primary registration deadline could still vote in the election  it s certainly not ideal  but it s not exactly rocket science  either one is to try to get a court order stating you should be allowed to vote in a certain party s primary  as difficult as this sounds  the city board of elections actually stations judges at offices in each of the boroughs on primary day to do exactly this  for reasons unknown  this information doesn t appear on the board s website  but a spokeswoman provided a list of locations and hours judges will be at them something tells me explaining to a judge  my dad s on the ballot  will be a good enough reason to get your vote counted  however  it s highly unlikely trump s kids will reduce themselves to standing in a busy borough office waiting to have a judge hear their case  fill out the appropriate paperwork  then travel to a voting site  why do that when they can simply complain about it on fox news featured image via grant lamos iv getty images
