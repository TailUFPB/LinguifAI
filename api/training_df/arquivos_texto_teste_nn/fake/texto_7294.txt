sen  elizabeth warren is on a roll with her brutal eviscerations of donald trump  following her epic twitter takedown of the racist billionaire earlier this week  warren spoke to the associated press  it was during this interview that warren once again took the opportunity to give the gop presidential front runner another tongue lashing  warren also took a break from her avowed silence on the democratic primary race to praise bernie sanders warren says that trump s claims about his business successes are major exaggerations   in reality  trump s wealth comes from his father  warren says that the only way that trump has been able to retain his inheritance is by  cheating people  and  defrauding people   warren goes on to say  donald trump claims that the reason he s qualified to be president of the united states is that he is a very  very  very successful businessman  donald trump is not a great business success and it s time he s called on it  this isn t the first time warren has called out trump for his bad business decisions  warren  a former harvard law professor  who specializes in bankruptcy law  wrote about trump s nefarious failed business schemes  she also urged people to  listen to the experts who ve concluded he s so bad at business that he might have more money today if he d put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone  warren also went on to note trump s mussolini quote gaffe warren also spent some time praising bernie sanders and the influence he has had on the democratic party and the nation  he s out there  he fights with the heart  this is who bernie is  he has put the right issues on the table both for the democratic party and for the country in general so i m still cheering bernie on  however  warren does say that clinton or sanders would be far better leaders than what the gop is offering  while the democrats are saying   gee is the right answer to improve the affordable care act in the following six ways or go all the way to single payer    which is a good debate to have   the republicans are saying they are going to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with something they can t quite describe  warren has not disclosed who she voted for in the primary election  however  she did make progressive politicos sitting on the edge of her seat  saying that she will make an endorsement  that being said  she didn t say is she plans on making an endorsement before the primary election is over  should she do so  i guarantee it will be done at a key strategic moment in the race  possibly before the washington caucus or the new york primary  though  a pre nomination endorsement seems unlikely you can read the ap interview with warren here featured image from photo by chip somodevilla getty images
