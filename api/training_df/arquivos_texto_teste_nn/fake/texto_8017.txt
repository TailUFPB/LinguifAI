right wing christians are always talking about how lgbt people having equal protections under the law will mean the end of christianity  well  the supreme court s ruling obegefell v  hodges  which made marriage equality legal nationwide was the worst fears of bigots everywhere becoming a reality   but not because of any actual anti   christian elements to the ruling  the ruling simply says that anyone and everyone can marry whatever consenting adult they like  however  many bigoted christians see the ability of anyone to do anything they don t like is persecution  on that list of morons who think that way is religious conservative and presidential candidate ted cruz cruz sat down to speak with right wing radio host janet mefford on thursday  and of course the conversation turned to his bigoted views on lgbt people  first  he bragged about being endorsed by hate groups such as the family research council and the national organization for marriage  then  he went on along rant about how marriage equality was  illegitimate   and how the obergefell ruling was nothing short of disastrous here is the quote  emphasis mine   i believe that decision was fundamentally illegitimate  it was lawless  it was unconstitutional and it will not stand  and i would note  that is precisely why dr  james dobson has endorsed me in this campaign  it is why tony perkins of the family research council has endorsed me in this campaign  it s why the national organization on marriage  has endorsed me on this campaign and has said it cannot support donald trump or marco rubio because if we re not willing to defend marriage  we are giving up the foundational building blocks of the family  we re giving up the judeo christian values that built this great nation  and that is where you are dead wrong  senator cruz  this nation was not built upon christianity  in fact  our founding fathers put explicit walls into our founding documents to ensure a complete separation between church and state  if you do not know that basic fact of our history and of our laws  then you have no business being in any public office  much less the presidency this is what makes cruz so dangerous  he is determined to turn america in a giant church via the law should he make it to the white house  that is why it is so important to make sure you vote blue in november  listen to the audio below  via right wing watch featured image from gage skidmore flickr
