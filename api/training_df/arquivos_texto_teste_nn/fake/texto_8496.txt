when you think about the sacrifice our men and women in uniform have undertaken for our country  one honestly can t put into words how grateful we are  they literally offer up their lives for service  when they come home  they should be treated with the utmost respect and grace  and most certainly should not be taken advantage of  however  one group that has been very vocal and outgoing in their supposed help of wounded veterans coming home seems to be using them to make money for themselves the wounded warrior project is one of the most visible groups out there raising money for veterans  they have commercials  big events  and publicity  on the surface  they look like a very reputable organization  however  as cbs news investigated  it looks as though they are  quite literally  wasting donation money  and they re not really hiding it either according to charitynavigator org  wounded warrior project only spends   of the money they take in on the actual services that help veterans  that may sound pretty great until you realize that other groups like disabled american veterans charitable service trust  dav  utilizes nearly   of their funds towards going directly to veterans according to army staff sergeant erick millette  who actually worked as a public speaker for wounded warrior project back in   their mission is to honor and empower wounded warriors  but what the public doesn t see is how they spend their money  also telling cbs news  you re using our injuries  our darkest days  our hardships  to make money  so you can have these big parties  let s get a mexican mariachi band in there  let s get maracas made with  wwp logo  put them on every staff member s desk  let s get it catered and have a big old party going to a nice fancy restaurant is not team building  staying at a lavish hotel at the beach here in jacksonville  and requiring staff that lives in the area to stay at the hotel is not team building  a four day conference for  staff members in colorado for  team building  had a price tag of around   million  that s money that should be going to veterans  they are literally using the money to throw themselves lavish events instead of honor the veterans they are supposedly serving  the entire thing is almost obscene wounded warrior project s chief executive steve nardizzi even admits he runs the charity like a for profit company   and while they are still raising money for veterans and using that money towards the needs and services of those who need them  please think twice before donating and perhaps donate to another group instead  if they are pulling in over   million  but only   is going towards veterans  that s nearly   million not going to veterans that should be wounded warriors project s mission is  to honor and empower wounded warriors   however  where s the honor in skimming off the top of all their much needed money to throw themselves parties all over the country watch here to see the cbs news investigation featured image  jacksonville com
