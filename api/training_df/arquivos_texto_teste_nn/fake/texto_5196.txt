this was a treat to watch if you want to see a member of team hillary absolutely destroy a trump mouthpiece and the republican party on the air  you ll want to watch every minute of this panel discussion that occurred on cnn with carol costello on wednesday morning donald trump supporter kayleigh mcenany accused republican establishment leaders of conspiring to defeat him  which is why she says trump refuses to support senator john mccain and house speaker paul ryan in their tough re election bids  they  disrespected  the voters who support the republican nominee  she claimed before adding that  without republican voters  the republican party won t exist  that s when clinton supporter robert zimmerman interrupted to chime in with an amazing takedown of the gop and their new leader  without independent voters  no candidate is going to be a credible candidate for president  donald trump succeeded in a republican party where  percent of them think the president is a secret muslim  to that voter  duck dynasty is a think tank  donald trump still won t even recognize that president obama is an american citizen  so  it tells you just how bankrupt donald trump is ethically and morally and also how dysfunctional  how extreme the republican party has become  that s the real issue here  here s the video via youtube indeed  trump has been an embarrassment to the republican party and the united states he has crisscrossed the country bragging about how he will build a wall and ban muslims from entering the country while demonstrating that he knows absolutely nothing about domestic or foreign policy furthermore  he has a thin skin and has viciously attacked anyone who dares to criticize him republicans have moved so far to the extreme right that they created the hateful and bigoted atmosphere within the party that allowed trump to ascend to the top of the ticket  republicans should be ashamed of themselves and their party and if they truly care about america they will dump trump  sure  they would be giving the election away to hillary clinton by doing so  but at least there will be a nation left to govern  and perhaps republicans will finally change and become an inclusive party with real ideas that make them capable of being elected again  because right now  the republican party is a joke that only appeals to the lowest common denominator featured image  justin sullivan getty images
