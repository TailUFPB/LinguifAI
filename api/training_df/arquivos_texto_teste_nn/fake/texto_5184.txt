this is the hypocrisy to beat all hypocrisies as we all know  donald trump is vehemently anti immigration  in fact  it s the centerpiece of his campaign going all the way back to june  when he rode an escalator to a podium and delivered a speech officially throwing his hat into the ring since then  the republican nominee has accused immigrants of being criminals who steal jobs from americans well  now it looks like the same can be said of trump s own wife melania  who came to the united states from slovenia according to an investigation by politico  melania may very well have committed visa fraud and other immigration laws  and trump s campaign has apparently been lying about her immigration story in january  melania claimed that she often flew back to slovenia to renew an h  visa  a visa type that donald trump despises and has said he would end  it never crossed my mind to stay here without papers   she told harper s bazaar   that is just the person you are  you follow the rules  you follow the law  every few months you need to fly back to europe and stamp your visa  after a few visas  i applied for a green card and got it in   but h  visas last three years and can be extended to up to six years  which means the first lady wannabe did not have to fly back to slovenia for renewal as it turns out melania is describing something people do when they aquire a b  temporary business visitor or b  tourist visa  which means she is lying about the circumstances of her immigration to this country  furthermore  it could also mean she took a modelling job away from an american citizen because her nude photo shoot occurred in the united states in  and b  and b  visa holders are not allowed to work here  so melania may have broken the law andrew greenfield  an attorney specializing in immigration law  made that pretty clear  if you enter the united states with the intention of working without authorization and you present yourself to a border agent at an airport or a seaport or a manned border and request a visa  even if there is not a q a   knowing that you are coming to work   you are implicitly  if not explicitly  manifesting that you intend to comply with the parameters of the visa classification for which you sought entry and were granted entry  another immigration attorney told politico that if melania used a b  visa she would have had to lie about the purpose of her entry into the country  she would not have been authorized to work in the u s  while on a b  visa  in fact  if a customs agent encounters someone entering the u s  on a b  visa and they know that the individual intends to work for a u s  employer  the individual will usually be denied admission  in order to avoid being sent back to slovenia  she may have had to lie about the purpose of her trip  in short  melania trump could be guilty of committing visa fraud which is a crime that would seriously jeopardize her green card status and her united states citizenship if she were not married to the republican nominee and were of hispanic or muslim descent  donald trump would be calling for her to be deported and would be referring to her as an illegal immigrant and a criminal it sounds like donald trump  his wife  and the republican party have some serious explaining to do featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
