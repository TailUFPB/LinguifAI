christian fundamentalists just can t keep their mouths shut  and they wonder why people are turning away from organized religion a supposed  christian  author took to facebook on saturday to condemn women who use sex toys and masturbate to hell  claiming that both are a  direct path to satan  and declared that any christian who disagrees should be ashamed  too many christian women are losing their salvation because they masturbate   author mack major wrote  dildos and all of those other sex toys have been used for thousands of years in demonic sex rituals  it s one of the main ways ancient pagan societies worshiped their demonic gods masturbation is a direct path to satan  there s nothing normal about it  and shame on any christian that says so  hypocritically enough  major seems to only take issue with women achieving sexual pleasure by themselves while avoiding the topic of male masturbation  apparently that s acceptable mack goes on to warn on his blog that women are inviting demons into the world by masturbating  many of you who are reading this have sex toys in your possession right now  and whether you want to accept it as fact or not  those sex toys are an open portal between the demonic realm and your own life  as long as you have those sex toys in your home  you have a doorway that can allow demons to not only access your life at will  but also to torment you  hinder and destroy certain parts of your life as it relates to sex and your relationships  major also has a problem with women getting tattoos and piercings and tells them how to dress in church this is the kind of crap women have to put up with from conservative  christians  every day and it s only getting worse as some  christian  pastors have gone so far as to call for women to lose voting rights and for women to be confined to the home again  it s bewildering how these same  christians  can complain about dropping church attendance and fail to see that they are the ones causing people to walk away from the church in the first place featured image  wikimedia
