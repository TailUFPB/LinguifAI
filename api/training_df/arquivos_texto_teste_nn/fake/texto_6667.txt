former speaker of the house dennis hastert got handed the sentence of  months in prison for monetary payoffs he made to keep his sexual abuse of young boys silent  the judge in the case called him a  serial child molester   and also ordered him to enroll in a sex offender treatment program hastert was accused of molesting  boys aged  to   during his time as a coach at yorkville high school in illinois  the case came to light when one of them finally broke decades of silence on hastert s conduct if you re thinking  months for molesting  boys is outrageous  you d be correct  unfortunately  the statute of limitations has expired on the molestation cases  this forced the court to focus on illegal cash withdrawals that hastert made to pay hush money in order to keep the crimes buried as is always the case with your average republican who does something criminal  there is a news reel of them being hypocritical by attacking others for somewhat similar conduct  hastert was a very vocal critic of then president bill clinton over the monica lewinsky affair  clearly  bill was not in any sense as despicable as hastert  however  that didn t stop hastert from strongly attacking clinton for it dennis hastert on the house floor   when the allegations first came to light  hastert did what all republicans do  blame the victim  his initial response was to claim that the money withdrawal was because he was the one being victimized by a blackmailer over a baseless claim of sexual abuse  this didn t end up working well for hastert because the judge used it to hand down an even stronger sentence to him  with the judge telling him   you tried to make him a victim again  u s  attorney comments on hastert this is yet another case of the universal hypocrisy that is a chronic condition of the republican party  during a time when republicans everywhere are trying to pass bathroom laws to  protect people  from the theorized molestations they believe will occur if a transgender individual uses a public bathroom  their party heroes keep getting nailed for doing the very thing they claim to hate here s a better idea  since republican men do this more than transgender individuals  we will make a  republican men s bathroom   we can do voter id checks to make sure republican men can only use their assigned bathroom because it s a  public safety issue   as they like to say regarding their anti lgbt bathroom laws  while we re at it  we can make republican male only movie theaters  restaurants and stores to help protect the public from mass shooters featured photo by scott olson getty images
