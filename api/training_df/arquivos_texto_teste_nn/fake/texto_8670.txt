when the black lives matter movement started gaining nationwide attention  racists across america were outraged  how dare the african american community speak out against the institutionalized racism in this country  one of the most common statements from the hate filled folks was  oh sure  they complain about  white on black  crime  but ignore  black on black  crime   and that sentiment is what makes the following story so ironic on monday  a group of predominantly black bikers held a rally called  bikes up  guns down  hundreds of young men took to the streets on their atv s and dirt bikes to promote peace in their communities  rapper project stacks  who is involved in the movement  explained what it was all about in an interview with the miami new times in april bikes up  guns down is strictly to stop the youth violence  violence ain t cool  we re saying   let s stick together   we already deep in population  back then  when it was violence  it was probably one person droppin  every three months or every six months  now you got two or three dropping every weekend  or two  three  or four dead bodies every weekend so it s kind of different  and it done raise the stakes  but i know they like to ride them bikes  give  em something to do  i ma buy as many bikes as i can  man however  when dozens of riders took to the streets on martin luther king  jr  day  the white supremacists went wild on facebook  fox  tampa bay posted a video of the riders on the streets  some of them were driving like idiots  but for the most part is was just a bunch of bike riders   but the white folks were very displeased with this          that s right  calling out his vile stereotypes makes you the racist the sad thing about this entire incident was the completely predictable way that the racists responded  the people who participated in the rally were branded  thugs  even when they were trying to do something positive for their community  yet  the same totally inclusive white people have nothing to say when hundreds of caucasian bikers hold rallies and disrupt traffic  hell  they didn t even say anything when a bunch of bikers got into a gun fight outside of a restaurant as a person who is so white i can guide the way in a dark tunnel  i am truly disgusted by the way my community continues to treat other people  it s not that difficult to be a good human being  i promise if you are one of those people who still believes that we live in a  post racial  america  all you have to do is log on to the internet to be proven wrong watch featured image video screenshot
