there is a lot of speculation as to what president obama might do after january  when he s no longer the commander in chief and lead punching bag for the racist right  obama wants to be a businessman  maybe the obama family will be staying in washington  d c   at least for the foreseeable future  but that doesn t mean obama s post white house activities have to be limited to the nation s capital  like all great american pioneers  obama is looking west   this time  toward silicon valley  not wall street  in an interview with bloomberg  obama said  well  i ve said this before and  i think  surprised a lot of people  but if i think about what would stir my passions had i not gone into politics  it d probably be starting some kind of business  the skill set of starting my presidential campaigns and building the kinds of teams that we did and marketing ideas i think would be the same kinds of skills that i would enjoy exercising in the private sector  the president was careful not to repeat the republican talking point  that business skill somehow translates to running a country  now  i m always careful about drawing too many easy parallels there  because sometimes there are ceos who come in and start explaining to me how i should be running the presidency  and i sometimes have to stop them and say   all right  one  i appreciate your advice  but imagine a situation in which half your board and management were actively trying to get rid of you and prevent you from accomplishing anything  and you had  million employees  and you couldn t fire a large portion of them  and your competitors weren t simply promoting their own products  but were continually saying how your products were the worst that were ever invented and will cause a civilizational crisis  if you pull that all together  then you ve got about half of what i m dealing with on a daily basis   as for the type of business  obama wants to help the world  he is interested in science and medicine  like bill gates  obama wants to use capitalism to try to save the world  one small project at a time  you can become bill gates  or  in some cases  you can electrify a village  you can save water in a desert  that s the thing about the u s  economy that continues to be unique  and it s tied to capitalism and markets  but it s also tied to a faith in science and reason and a mindset that says there s always something new to discover  and we don t know everything  and we re going to try new things  and we re pragmatic  and if we ever lose that  then we will have lost what has made us an incredible force for good in the world  if we sustain it  then we can maintain the kind of progress that has been made  i always tell interns and young people who i talk to that as tough as things seem right now  do not believe people when they tell you they wish they could go back to the good old days  because the good old days aren t i m now old enough where i remember some of those good old days  while obama s plans might not be locked in yet  we can be sure of one thing  he won t let his time go to waste painting pictures of feet or living on the golf course  former democratic presidents get s it done  and obama will be no exception  the right will hate whatever he does  though featured image via chip somodevilla at getty images
