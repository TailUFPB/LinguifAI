on wednesday  president obama took a trip to north american international auto show in detroit  michigan  but while he was there he took time out of his itinerary to talk about the water crisis in flint   and he didn t mince his words during a speech  the president let the people of flint know that he hears their cries  i am very proud of what i ve done as president  but the only job that s more important to me is the job of father  and i know if i was a parent up there  i would be beside myself if my kids  health could be at risk  that s why over the weekend i declared a federal emergency in flint  the michigan department of health and human services  mdhhs  has identified at least twenty seven kids with elevated levels of lead in their blood  however  that number is likely astronomically higher when you consider how long the people of flint were drinking the contaminated water governor rick snyder assuredthem was safe   even when he knew it wasn t  unlike obama  snyder didn t think about how terrified parents must be for their children  his main concern was  balancing  a budget  safety be damned the president also blasted republican lawmakers for  short changing  the people of flint  it is a reminder of why you can t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we together provide as a government to make sure that public health and safety is preserved  the horrifying thing about all of this is that if it were up to the gop  this would happen a helluva a lot more often  the republican party absolutely despises regulations that they believe are unnecessary   that includes clean water and air   as a matter of fact  last week while the flint water crisis was raging on  republicans in the house voted to overturn provisions of the clean water act that protects streams  last june  senate republicans voted to repeal the very same thing think about that for a minute  lawmakers on both a state and federal level have known about the crisis in flint for more than a year  and the gop voted to repeal laws related to clean water at least twice in that time  these pro life lawmakers didn t care at all that tiny humans were literally being poisoned  the only thing that mattered was sticking it to obama because they didn t like his new provisions for the clean water act while republican representatives in the federal government were trying to gut the clean water act  governor snyder was busy ignoring the crisis in flint  he knew that people were drinking dirty and instead of fixing the problem he just allowed children to continue to ingest lead  not only did he know it was happening  he didn t care enough to stop it the flint water crisis a perfect example of what happens when republicans are left in charge of anything   and it s terrifying watch featured image  video screenshot
