justice antonin scalia had an impressive career  in his decades long appointment as a supreme court justice  he has worked diligently against the forces of social justice  scalia s insane originalist philosophy has had a major impact on modern conservatism  luckily  president obama will now have the opportunity to appoint a new supreme court justice  which will tip the scales in favor of a liberal court here is a look back on ten of the worst supreme court decisions of scalia s career  sometimes his opinions were in the majority  the ones that were in dissent were oftentimes vicious in bush v  gore  the supreme court decided to stop recounting ballots in florida  this decision is considered by many to be the reason george w  bush became the president  with everything that came after  scalia voted in concurrence with majority  and wrote  the issue is not  as the dissent puts it  whether  ounting every legally cast vote ca constitute irreparable harm   one of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are  under a reasonable interpretation of florida law   legally cast vote   the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner  and to the country  by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election  count first  and rule upon legality afterwards  is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires    citizens united v  federal election commission   in citizen united v  federal election commission  the supreme court decided that corporations are people  this created the situation we are in now  where corporations can donate unlimited amounts of money to superpacs  which are used to influence political elections  scalia voted in concurrence with the majority  and wrote  even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent s approach of excluding from first amendment coverage what the founders disliked  and even if we agreed that the founders disliked founding era corporations  modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion  most of the founders  resentment towards corporations was directed at the state granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed  modern corporations do not have such privileges  and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising founders excluding  perhaps  thomas jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society    burwell v  hobby lobby   in burwell v  hobby lobby  the supreme court decided that private businesses can be exempted from certain laws on religious grounds  justice scalia voted with the opinion of the court  during the case s oral argument  scalia said  well  religious beliefs aren t reasonable  i mean  religious beliefs are categorical  you know  it s god tells you  it s not a matter of being reasonable  god be reasonable  he s supposed to have a full beard    king v  burwell   in king v  burwell  the supreme court decided that subsidies under obamacare could be used through the federal exchange program  scalia dissented  saying  we should start calling this law scotuscare   his court s two decisions on the act will surely be remembered through the years   and the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the supreme court of the united states favors some laws over others  and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites    shelby county v  holder   in shelby county v  holder  the supreme court decided to strike down parts of the voting rights act of   this weakened the voting rights act and is considered by many an attack on the civil liberties of black voters  scalia said  in  in a speech at the university of california washington center  the following  whenever a society adopts racial entitlements  it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes  even the name of it is wonderful  the voting rights act  who s going to vote against that    obergefell v  hodges   in obergrefell v  hodges  the supreme court decided that same sex couples have the right to get married  scalia dissented from the opinion of the court  saying  those civil consequences and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences can perhaps have adverse social effects  but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws  so it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage  it is of overwhelming importance  however  who it is that rules me  today s decree says that my ruler  and the ruler of  million americans coast to coast  is a majority of the nine lawyers on the supreme court    planned parenthood v  casey   in planned parenthood v  casey  challenges were made to pennsylvania law that required women to meet certain provisions in order to have an abortion  the court found that the provisions were unconstitutional  except for one that required women to notify their husband  justice scalia dissented gainst the opinion of the court  saying  the states may  if they wish  permit abortion on demand  but the constitution does not require them to do so  the permissibility of abortion  and the limitations upon it  are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy  by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting    lawrence v  texas   in this supreme court decision  a law that banned sodomy was struck down  scalia dissented from the opinion of the court  he wrote  many americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business  as scoutmasters for their children  as teachers in their children s schools  or as boarders in their home   he wrote   they view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive    romer v  evans   in romer v  evans  the supreme court decided that the state of colorado could not prevent local jurisdictions from creating laws that prohibit discrimination against lgbt people  scalia dissented  saying   prohibits special treatment of homosexuals  and nothing more  t would prevent the state or any municipality from making death benefit payments to the  life partner  of a homosexual when it does not make such payments to the long time roommate of a nonhomosexual employee    wal mart v  dukes   in wal mart v  dukes  the supreme court made the decision that ended one of the largest class action suits in history  more than   million women filed a class action suit against wal mart claiming gender discrimination  scalia voted with the majority of the court and delivered their opinion  scalia said  respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company aside from their reliance on dr  bielby s social frameworks analysis that we have rejected  in a company of wal mart s size and geographical scope  it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction  respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence  but their evidence falls well short  republicans are already hard at work trying to prevent president obama from appointing scalia s replacement  their efforts are in vain  there is no legitimate reason president obama should not appoint scalia s replacement  luckily for everyone  it is likely that president obama s replacement can undo much of the harm that scalia has done during his career featured image from donkey hotey via flickr
