a lot has changed in just eight years  the republican party is witnessing a collapse that may destroy it entirely  and nobody knows it on a more personal level than mark salter  sen  john mccain s former campaign adviser and long time friend  on the eve of the indiana primary  in which all signs point to donald trump shattering the last resistance to his nomination  salter took stock of his party   and bailed in a tweet that may signal the coming flood of political refugees pouring out of the republican party s sinking ship  salter said that trump s antics and the gop s idiotic responses to them have finally settled the matter  in a bold move  he concluded he would be supporting hillary clinton instead the gop is going to nominate for president a guy who reads the national enquirer and thinks it s on the level  i m with her   mark salter     may     loyalty pledges   forget standing with the party  forget coming together to beat the democrats  there is nothing redeeming about standing with donald trump the last straw was trump s use of a ludicrous story published by the tabloid  and trump backer  national enquirer  which alleged that ted cruz s dad was friends with lee harvey oswald  the man who assassinated john f  kennedy  the story was patently bonkers  but it didn t stop trump and his supporters from  just asking questions  about it  this included fox news on the conservative network s fox and friends  the hosts remained silent and deferential as trump suggested   quite seriously   that rafael cruz was somehow implicated in the jfk assassination  apparently nobody at the network wanted to risk angering the republican front runner and potentially losing a ratings gold mine  the inmates are running the asylum cowardice and stupidity have become so entwined in the republican party that an entire day can be consumed by a false story printed by the national enquirer just because donald trump brought it up  it s no wonder some conservatives are looking at the wreckage of their party and deciding it s not even worth saving salter isn t exactly a bleeding heart liberal either  having attached himself to mccain s campaign in  as the senator s speechwriter and  closest aide  he s spent the last eight years bitterly attacking obama and democrats for the crime of beating his friend  the fact he s now saying  enough  must be terrifying for republican operatives  if just a small fraction of republicans abandon the party because of trump  the general election may end in a landslide for clinton for months there has been questions about what the  never trump  coalition of republicans would do if trump won the nomination  many are beginning to walk back their earlier comments  a number of them appear to be drawing the opposite conclusion  if  never trump  is to mean anything  than hillary clinton is the better option  mark salter seems to think so featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
