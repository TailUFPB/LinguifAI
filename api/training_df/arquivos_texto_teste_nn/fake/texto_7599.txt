donald trump is probably one of the most hateful presidential candidates this country has ever seen  but what makes him so unique is that he is not just a vile piece of trash  he is a vile piece of trash who millions of people are in love with  these trump fanboys and fangirls make his rallies very dangerous for people whom they have deemed unloyal   especially minorities jacki schechner recently described what a former colleague told her about their scary experience at a louisiana trump rally  in a facebook post friends  this is important  a former colleague and friend of mine was on assignment at trump s rally in louisiana today  she posted the following account of what happened  i know and trust her implicitly  if she says it was frightening  i believe her  that s the first time in my career i ve felt like press badges weren t given to grant access  but as an identifying  isolating mark  what you ve seen on tv is nothing compared to the real thing  some  people were thrown out  with the mob pointing them out and cheering  the candidate yelling   get them outta here   and   louisiana  i m disappointed in this behavior  why is it taking so long to remove these people  the question of  who s going to pay for the wall   was met with a loud  gleeful response of   mexico  and then calling out the press  in their designated pen   saying  they re the most dishonest people in the world   a chorus of boos followed i had no idea how upsetting this assignment would be  and i am less concerned about the one man than i am the masses who support him  this rally that she spoke of was in new orleans and tons of people were thrown out  other news outlets described trump as becoming  increasingly irate when he was interrupted and nbc news reporter  ali vitali  called it the  most intense  rally she d been to tonight was the most intense rally i ve witnessed so far on the trail  this is just a clip  pic twitter com   ali vitali   alivitali  march    rallies are not just frightening because of his supporters  propensity for violence  they are scary because we are given a glimpse into an embarrassing portion of our citizenry  trump s crowds are huge and most of the people at the rallies wholeheardely support his viewpoints  i have been to one of them and his fans are some of the most ignorant  hateful  nasty americans i ve ever run across  they hurl insults when you are doing nothing but standing there  it is like watching an army of zombies whose one goal is to destory everything this country was founded on what s worse is that these people will continue to support him even in the face of mounting evidence that he is a pathological lying  narcassitic asshat and that is terrifying featured image via flickr
