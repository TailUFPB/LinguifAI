trump s supporters are bloodthirsty monsters by now it is crystal clear that hillary clinton needs the most secret service protection the government can provide because conservatives are obviously too crazy to be ignored one such conservatives is new hampshire republican state rep  al baldasaro  who is also trump s adviser on veteran s affairs on tuesday  baldasaro echoed other conservatives by calling for executing the former secretary of state via firing squad for imaginary crimes conservatives think she is guilty of committing   even though there is no evidence that she ever committed a crime  house panels found nothing during their investigation of benghazi and they couldn t find anything in their investigation into her emails either even the fbi couldn t recommend prosecution because there was nothing to go on but baldasaro and other conservatives don t care  they think they are judge  jury  and executioner  hillary clinton to me is the jane fonda of the vietnam   baldasaro told a right wing radio host   she is a disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in benghazi  she dropped the ball on over  emails requesting back up security  something s wrong there  again  even the house committee headed by republicans could not find any evidence that hillary clinton failed to respond to attacks in benghazi in which four americans were killed  including ambassador chris stevens in fact  even stevens  own family does not blame clinton but regardless of the facts  baldarsaro wants blood  he accused clinton of committing treason and said she should be shot  this whole thing disgusts me  hillary clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason  here s the audio via buzzfeedin addition to right wingers calling for hillary to be shot  hanged  and imprisoned despite the fact that she has not committed a crime  trump s delivery boy chris christie held a  mock trial  at the rnc convention on tuesday evening and charged her with crimes and let the crowd deliver verdicts  they chanted  lock her up  and  guilty   and this is all despite the fact that christie himself is embroiled in a legal scandal of his own  which hillary reminded him of on twitter conservative hatred of hillary clinton has reached fever pitch and is extremely dangerous if left unchecked  calling for the assassination of a political candidate is disgraceful and donald trump needs to tell his supporters that they are going too far  because it is only a matter of time before a conservative gun nut actually attempts to put those calls into action featured image via youtube
