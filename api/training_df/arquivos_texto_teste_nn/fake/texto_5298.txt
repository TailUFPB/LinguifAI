it seems that donald trump has a history of asking hackers for help in furthering his goals  not only did he ask russian hackers to find hillary s missing emails this morning  he also once asked hackers to help him out with taking president obama as the nation s most famous birther  he was all in on proving that obama was foreign born  and therefore couldn t be president  he actually seemed upset that hackers were hacking everything except obama s records obama released his long form birth certificate in   three years before trump posted this tweet  trump is so sure he s right about everything  though  that he wanted to keep digging and digging until he found the mother lode  perhaps he was trying to keep obama from making him look like the complete fool that he is this morning  he pretty much told russia that they would be rewarded if they hacked hillary clinton s email server and found those   emails that republicans have been salivating over  of course  his loyal subjects including those at fox news are saying he was joking about that  and why shouldn t they  asking a foreign government for help in winning a national election  or taking down one of our own  is treason  republicans will not want to admit that they nominated someone willing to commit treason asking hackers  who engage in illegal activity in order to obtain what they want  could be considered treason as well  so trump has a history of seeking illegal means to take down anybody he doesn t like  and he likes neither obama nor hillary  in fact  he s sick and disgusting but don t tell him that asking hackers  foreign and domestic  looks bad  in his warped dimension  he s just doing what needs to be done featured image by gustavo caballero getty images
