on wednesday a  year old special needs man was gunned down by an angry gun owner in landover hills  maryland according to wjla  the shooting occurred as the victim  identified as conrad cole  was walking to a nearby park to play basketball with his two caretakers  witnesses say that the  year old group home resident lost control of his basketball  the ball brushed against a nearby car the owner of the vehicle  who has since been identified as  year old roderick town  aggressively confronted cole during an interview with wjla  prince george county police chief hank stawinski described what happened next  the special needs individual is not communicating clearly  the individual in the car retrieves a weapon and shoots the person a number of times  stawinski called the shooting  a senseless murder  after killing the special needs man  town fled the scene he was arrested on saturday  town faces charges of first degree and second degree murder  as well as additional charges here s more on the story from wjla according to the washington post  maryland has  some of the strictest gun laws in the nation  the state s supposedly strict gun laws do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers  convicted felons or people on the fbi s terrorist watch list  democrats have been trying to change that police have yet to release information on what type of gun was used in this senseless killing  nor have they disclosed whether town was legally permitted to own a gun in md what we do know is that contrary to nra myths  the presence of a gun does not reduce the odds of violent crime time and time again we see minor arguments escalate to this level of violence  as decades of research shows  the mere presence of a gun during a heated conflict contributes to higher levels of aggression and violence guns and anger are a deadly combination  sadly  research also shows that the more angry and impulsive a person is  the more likely they are to own and carry a gun as reported here  a june  study found that   million firearms estimated to be in private hands in the united states are disproportionately owned by people who are prone to angry  impulsive behavior and have a potentially dangerous habit of keeping their guns close at hand  while no one has all the answers when it comes to preventing gun violence  we do know that putting even more guns into the hands of angry people is not the solution image credit  video screen capture via wjla
