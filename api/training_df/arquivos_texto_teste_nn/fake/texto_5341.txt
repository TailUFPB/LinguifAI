donald trump and the gop appear to have finally found the messaging that they are using to sell trump s flip flop on banning muslims from entering the united states during an interview on msnbc s meet the press sunday morning  trump told the chuck todd that he doesn t consider his recent changes to his proposal to ban muslims from entering the united states a  rollback  i actually don t think it s a rollback  in fact  you could say it s an expansion  i m looking now at territory   trump told todd   people were so upset when i used the word muslim  oh  you can t use the word muslim  remember this  and i m okay with that  because i m talking territory instead of muslim  we re going to have tough standards   trump went on to say   and if a person can t prove   that they re from an area  and if a person can t prove what they have to be able to prove  they re not coming into this country  and i would stop the syrian migration and a syrian from coming into this country in two seconds  let s be clear  trump s proposal is a rollback  his initial call for a unilateral ban on muslims entering the united states is both incredibly bigoted and unconstitutional  it also happens to be impossible to enforce and would severely damage the united states  reputation  even if trump were to become president  it is hard to see how such a proposal would actually be implemented that s why this rollbacked version of his proposal is actually far worse  that s because it can actually be implemented  while still divisive among the gop  trump would have far more support for his modified approval  more than half of the governors in the united states want to ban syrians from entering the united states as of last year  there are even a few democrats who would jump on board the xenophobia train so  yes  this is a rollback  it s also an  expansion  as trump refers to it  in the sense that it is something that could actually become policy https   www youtube com watch v  image via video screenshot
