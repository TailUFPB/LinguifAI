yesterday  former gop republican presidential candidate  mitt romney  came out with one of his most incredible statements to date  after months of silence  mitt tweeted about the   year old sexual misconduct allegations against alabama s republican candidate for senator  judge roy moore in his tweet  mitt told americans that judge roy moore was not entitled to a fair investigation and that moore should  step aside   romney tweeted   innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions  not elections  i believe leigh corfman  her account is too serious to ignore  moore is unfit for office and should step aside  innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions  not elections  i believe leigh corfman  her account is too serious to ignore  moore is unfit for office and should step aside   mitt romney   mittromney  november    has remained mostly dormant since he went off on his anti trump rant just before the presidential election   the last time we saw mitt  was when he was in trump towers  pandering to president elect trump for a job in his administration  it appears that  much like john mccain  the anti conservative  bitter  former gop presidential candidate just can t keep his disdain for republicans  who are unafraid to openly fight for their convictions  to himself  perhaps mitt s nasty remarks were intended to help ingratiate himself with liberal voters in utah  as he allegedly is preparing to run for the retiring republican senator orin hatch s seat  it s also quite possible that after the united states watched mitt give up the race after he pummeled barack obama in their first presidential debate  that mitt just doesn t  have the stomach for republicans who actually fight back when they re being attacked by the left is it possible that mitt has already forgotten the lie that harry reid pushed out to the voters only months before the election about mitt not paying taxes for the past  years on july     senator harry reid stood before his comrades on the senate floor and told a bald faced lie about then candidate mitt romney not paying his taxes for the past  years  reid knowingly lied to congress telling them mitt romney s father set the precedent for presidential candidates allowing the american public to view their taxes  but mitt romney can t do that because he s paid no taxes for  years  his father  george romney  set the precedent that people running for president would file their tax returns  let everybody look at them  but mitt romney can t do that because he s basically paid no taxes in the prior  years  watch two years later  harry reid was later questioned by cnn s dana bash about the lie he told to his fellow senators  his response could not have been more arrogant or disrespectful to the american voters who based their votes for barack obama  based on a lie that senator harry reid told only  months before the election so  tell us again mitt  how it doesn t matter if a political candidate is guilty of charges levied against him by the left  that their only response must be to  step down  if they re accused of wrongdoing yesterday  it was revealed that at least one of judge roy moore s accusers was deeply involved in democrat politics  is virulently anti trump  and has been openly pushing for judge roy moore s democrat opponent doug ross on her personal facebook page it was also revealed that stephanie mccrummen  one of the co writers of the washington post article that smeared moore with  unproven allegations has a history of  faking  things to benefit herself  read more here   more and more details continue to emerge about roy moore s alleged  victims  stay tuned  for those of us who are sick and tired of watching republicans get kicked around and watching their careers being ruined  this isn t over yet
