 be careful what you wish for  is an age old adage  earlier this month  donald trump tweeted that  if you want to know about hillary clinton s honesty and judgement   all you need to do is  ask the family of ambassador chris stevens   who died in the horrific terrorist attacks in benghazi on september    via freakoutnationon tuesday  after the house benghazi committee released its report on the attacks   a report that once again exonerated clinton and confirmed that the numerous hearings are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars aimed at smearing the  democratic nominee   ambassador stevens  sister spoke to the new yorker about the hearings  and trump has likely dissolved into a steaming pile of seething rage over her remarks dr  anne stevens  who serves as her family s spokesperson  made it very clear that no matter what republicans say  hillary clinton is not to blame for benghazi  in fact  she says the blame lies with republicans in congress  it is clear  in hindsight  that the facility was not sufficiently protected by the state department and the defense department  but what was the underlying cause   she said   perhaps if congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world  then some of the requests for more security in libya would have been granted  certainly the state department is underbudgeted  prior to the attacks  the gop cut embassy security  a move clinton warned would be detrimental to america s national security  back in  for fiscal   the gop controlled house proposed spending    billion for the state department s worldwide security protection program   well below the    billion requested by the obama administration  house republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by   million in fiscal  and   million in fiscal    negotiations with the democrat controlled senate restored about   million of the administration s request   last year  secretary of state hillary clinton warned that republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to america s national security    a charge republicans rejected  ryan   issa and other house republicans voted for an amendment in  to cut    billion from state operations  including funds for  more diplomatic security positions  under ryan s budget  non defense discretionary spending  which includes state department funding  would be slashed nearly  percent in   which would translate to more than   million in additional cuts to embassy security stevens goes on to drop the hammer on any words republicans want to put in the mouths of her or her family i do not blame hillary clinton or leon panetta  they were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world  and their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had  the benghazi mission was understaffed  we know that now  but  again  chris knew that  it wasn t a secret to him  he decided to take the risk to go there  it is not something they did to him  it is something he took on himself stevens says that the recently released report concluded absolutely nothing new  and that clinton did her best to keep people safe even in spite of fierce opposition from republicans she has taken full responsibility  being head of the state department  for what occurred  she took measures to respond to the review board s recommendations  she established programs for a better security system  but it is never going to be perfect  part of being a diplomat is being out in the community  we all recognize that there s a risk in serving in a dangerous environment  chris thought that was very important  and he probably would have done it again  i don t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her  it is very unjust stevens says that the gop s investigations are nothing but a witch hunt conducted  purely for political reasons  with the many issues in the current election  to use that incident and to use chris s death as a political point is not appropriate   she adds  explaining that  everyone did their very best in response to this event   in fact  her brother had a lot of respect for clinton and her  ability to intensely read the issues and understand the whole picture  could this be the final nail in the coffin of the gop s ridiculous  money wasting witch hunts  probably not  unfortunately featured image via getty images justin sullivan
