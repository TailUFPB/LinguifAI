on tuesday  the world was treated to an awesome video of a woman absolutely reaming florida governor rick scott at a gainsville starbucks  now  we finally get to hear what he had to say about the woman who prevented him from getting his latte and it is absolutely baffling in the viral video  cara jennings yelled  in part   you don t care about working people  you should be ashamed to show your face around here   at the governor she s not wrong  scott has done many  many horrible things to the people of his state  he refused to expand medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor  he changed hospital rules for one of his donors who ran a medical center with an extremely high infant mortality rate   he has attacked women at every turn  most recently with an unconstitutional anti abortion bill on wednesday  governor scott s office issued a statement saying  people with radical views tend to not like civil debate  a self proclaimed anarchist rudely yelled and cursed at the governor  she also refused to pledge allegiance to the flag  it s a free country  but it s not at all surprising that an anarchist prefers shouting over conversation  what  that s his response  jennings didn t stand for the pledge  seriously jennings  a former lake worth city commissioner  was asked what she thinks of scott s bizarre allegations and she said that sometimes she recited it  sometimes she didn t  i was never disrespectful about it  but i was never an avid pledge leader   she said  but i don t know how that bears any impact on if i critique his policies or not  how is it relevant if i say the pledge  it has absolutely nothing to do with her critiques of his policies  but he is doing what republicans often do when confronted  he s deflecting  scott is not the kind of guy who feels like he should ever have to answer for anything he does  a prime example of this was when his former company columbia hca defrauded the federal government out of millions of dollars with the biggest medicare fraud in history and when he was asked about it  he invoked the  amendment  times so  his current deflection is  really  just more of the same from florida s biggest mistake featured image via joe raedle getty images
