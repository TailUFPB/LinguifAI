republican presidential nominee donald trump has reacted to a series of state and national polls showing him losing ground to hillary clinton by promoting the conspiracy theory that this fall s presidential election will be  rigged  at a press conference at the pentagon on thursday  president obama was asked about the baseless claim  and the president reacted with derision and scorn  apparently disgusted that the idea was even being floated  of course the election will not be rigged  what does that mean   obama said at a news conference at the pentagon   that s ridiculous  that doesn t make any sense  the president added americans should not take trump s musings on this seriously   we do take seriously  as we always do   the president said   our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process  obama went on to point out that the move by trump smells of desperation  the president pointed out that a complaint like trump s is usually made on a schoolyard by children  not someone in the middle of an interview for the most important leadership position in the world  obama said that those kinds of comments are like a kid complaining about a loss  before the score is even tallied  trump seems to have gotten the idea from his close ally roger stone  the republican dirty trickster who helped to organize the  brooks brothers riot  during the  recount in florida  stone and   conspiracy theorist alex jones  a trump supporter  have promoted the bizarre idea for some time now the freak out has come as polls taken after the successful democratic convention have shown a major swing in hillary clinton s favor  marist shows clinton with a  percent edge on trump nationally  while nbc s poll shows her up nine percent  state polls taken in so called  rust belt  states key to a trump victory show clinton ahead in pennsylvania and michigan  other polls also showed her in the lead in florida and new hampshire  without those states  it is unlikely that trump would have a path to victory featured image via twitter
