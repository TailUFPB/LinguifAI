there are two things anyone with familiarity with fox news host sean hannity learns quickly  he is one of the most unlikable people working in television and he is really  really sensitive about it on wednesday  hannity managed to exemplify both of those traits when he learned that politico reporter marc caputo quoted a marco rubio staffer as calling hannity a  f cking a  hole   rather than take the high road or  better yet  analyze his own actions to figure out why people despise him  hannity did what comes naturally to him  he threw a very public  very embarrassing temper tantrum here s what caputo said  quoted from an anonymous rubio staffer  that set hannity off   but marco gives donald a taste of his own medicine and hannity gets all offended  he s a pussy and a sellout   boy  they re angry    marc caputo   marcacaputo  march     sure  accurate  definitely  it s no secret that hannity has been a big fan of donald trump s since the very beginning  he once bragged that he encouraged trump to get into the presidential race in   he s been a major cheerleader ever since  in february  trump was facing serious accusations about courting white supremacists   so he booked a  minute softball interview with his friend hannity and  the issue never even came up  instead  the two shared some laughs  complimented each other  and generally behaved as if it was a trump  infomercial paid for by fox news so when it came to defending his reputation against this charge of favoritism  hannity simply ignored his indefensible actions and lashed out  hilariously  hannity didn t blame rubio s campaign staffer so much as the reporter who relayed the message  on twitter  the conservative pundit went a bit nuts he tried  i know you are  but what am i  glad politico let s u use such big words that accurately describes yourself asshole  and u r  impartial  to politics https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  march    tried blaming it on liberals typical lib media  u missed my point  i always liked the real  marcorubio not the guy i saw last night  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  march    finally landing on  do you know who i am   would love to play but i have  million radio listeners depending on me  have fun with your   twitter follows https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  march     this is not the first time hannity has had a public meltdown after being stung by the fact that people don t like him  in   mediaite ran a survey asking  several dozen cable news hosts from fox news  cnn  and msnbc  what they felt about their fellow pundits  hannity was overwhelmingly voted worst  even by his own co workers   he didn t take it well  themattwilstein lets do the best of mediaite concha  all the rest of u mediamatters wannabees suck imho    badge of honor  sean hannity   seanhannity  december    just like his latest tantrum  hannity blamed the messenger  mediaite didn t decide who the  best of  fox news was  fox news hosts did   and they all said they didn t like hannity  likewise  politico s caputo didn t call hannity a  f cking a  hole   rubio s campaign did hannity may have   million radio listeners  from the bitter clingin  proud clingers set  but he gets absolutely no respect from his fellow media personalities  even the peers at his own network see through his hack journalism and abrasive personality  and they have a right to be mad  every time sean hannity runs a doe eyed fluff piece on trump  it reminds us that fox news is shamelessly enabling trump s rise to power  and when you are the guy with  million fans who is cheerleading a bigot like trump  it makes you a f cking a  hole featured image via fox news screengrab
