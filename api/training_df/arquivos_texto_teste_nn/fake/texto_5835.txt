donald trump has been irritating everyone lately  it has gotten to the point that even many of the most horrific conservatives can t look past the hate speech and general insanity that has accompanied the donald s attempt to become dictator in chief  for the most part  they have been fine with trump s bigotry  his suggestion that muslims should be crammed into concentration camps while those not already in the country should be banned  his talk of building walls to keep brown people out of the country  his numerous racist and misogynist statements  and his support of his horrible followers beating african americans at his rallies  they ve even been fine with his itchy trigger finger when it comes to launching nuclear weapons but trump s recent attacks on a  mexican  federal judge from indiana  his rapidly dropping poll numbers  and his slightly more reasonable remarks about gun safety regulations  have the delegates he has earned ready for mutiny  the washington post reports that delegates are hatching plans to stop trump  while many others have attempted to start movements to end trump for good  this time it s different   the people who make the rules are the ones leading the movement the delegates are angered by trump s recent comments on gun control  his racial attacks on a federal judge and his sinking poll numbers  they are convinced that trump is an insufficiently conservative candidate and believe they will find enough like minded republicans within the next month to change party rules and allow delegates to vote for whomever they want  regardless of who won their state caucus or primary  this literally is an  anybody but trump  movement   said kendal unruh  a republican delegate from colorado who is leading the campaign   nobody has any idea who is going to step in and be the nominee  but we re not worried about that  we re just doing that job to make sure that he s not the face of our party  the fresh wave of anti trump organizing comes as a growing number of republicans have signaled that they will not support trump for president  in addition  house speaker paul d  ryan  r wis    who is slated to chair the republican national convention next month in cleveland  said in remarks released friday that house republicans should  follow their conscience  on whether to support trump the new anti trump movement is pushing for a change to party rules that would allow them to vote for whomever they want if their  conscience   term used loosely because our friends on the right don t have those  doesn t allow them to support that person on friday  trump dismissed the plot against him  i won almost  million votes  which is by far more votes than any candidate in the history of the republican primaries   trump said   i have tremendous support and get the biggest crowds by far and any such move would not only be totally illegal but also a rebuke of the millions of people who feel so strongly about what i am saying  people that i defeated soundly in the primaries will do anything to get a second shot   but there is no mechanism for it to happen   the billionaire concluded  but those in charge of the latest effort to shut trump down say they do not have a specific candidate in mind according to those involved  at least  delegates in  states have signed on   a small fraction of the more than   delegates who will be at the convention in cleveland  trump just continues to embarrass himself and his party and this is not going to let up   iowa gop delegate cecil stinemetz told the post  trump just continues to embarrass himself and his party and this is not going to let up  will the movement succeed  will trump continue to embarrass his party and americans as a whole featured image via getty images rob jenkins
