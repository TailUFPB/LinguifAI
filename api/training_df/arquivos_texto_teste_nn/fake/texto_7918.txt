microsoft billionaire and philanthropist bill gates has written a letter directly to america s high school children that could change the world   and it is going to truly p ss off republicans every year  the bill and melinda gates foundation releases its annual letter  but never before has it been directly addressed to high school students  this year s letter was all about energy  how we consume it  how we create it  and how climate change should be the number one issue for us all  now that the republican party has tied itself to the oil industry funded climate change denial  they could have alienated themselves from a generation who can save humanity from itself  the gop has become  literally  the only political party in the developed world to endorse the scientifically bogus denial of climate change as business insider reports the basic premise of the letter is that many people around the world still don t have access to electricity  those people   about   of the world s population   deserve access to cheap  clean energy  and that  clean  part is very important  we need to get carbon dioxide emissions  which drive climate change  down to zero by the end of the century  in order to avoid dramatic  long term changes to the world s climate while achieving this goal will require an energy miracle  gates calls on highschoolers to get involved in making that miracle happen   because it is these lofty aspirations that distinguish human beings from their fellow animals  he writes when i say  miracle   i don t mean something that s impossible  i ve seen miracles happen before  the personal computer  the internet  the polio vaccine  none of them happened by chance  they are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate in this case  however  time is not on our side  every day we are releasing more and more  into our atmosphere and making our climate change problem even worse  we need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas even ones that might sound a little crazy if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century this is the message and the attitude that speaks to the manifest destiny of america  this is the reason that republicans will rail against this message with every tool in their arsenal  because the only thing that ever beats of project fear  is project hope  at it s core  america is a hopeful nation of dreamers and doers  by sending this message to high schoolers  bill and melinda gates might just help change the world  they may trigger that hope and ambition in a new generation  and make it immune to the nay saying and anti intellectualism of the american right  in doing so  they won t just save america from itself  but humanity too featured image via flickr creative commons
