usually  donald trump spokesperson katrina pierson can find sanctuary with the ever conservative leaning fox news  but that didn t seem to be the case for her on sunday while being interviewed by arthel neville shortly after claiming that it was president obama who went into afghanistan with her own make believe version of facts and history  pierson went on fox news to talk about trump s lack of tax returns  something that s been asked of every presidential candidate for decades neville said  as you know  katrina  presidential candidates have consistently released their tax returns since the   and you also know there is no existing law barring people from releasing their tax returns during an audit  so the question is that everyone wants to know  why won t mr  trump release his tax returns  and can you answer the implications that he s hiding something   all very good questions  yet  cue the denial and excuses from pierson  who replied  this really has become much of a novelty in presidential campaigns  a novelty   even a fox news host couldn t let pierson get away with such a ludicrous statement as that  all candidates have been releasing their returns  no matter the party  trump not releasing his returns is clearly indicative that he has something in which he is trying to prevent the public from seeing pierson keeps going back and forth with neville even trying to say that the media is bullying poor tiny handed trump into releasing his returns  however  the fox host wasn t having it  and told her  katrina  we re going to keep going on this because people want to know  it s not about a gotcha with mr  trump  again  he is a successful businessman that he been touting to us this entire campaign  that is why they want to see  why are you saying that it s some sort of corruption or some sort of campaign that people are   including the media   are out to get him  that is not the case  he s running for the president of the united states of america  show your tax returns  it s that simple  and boom went the dynamite  well done  neville  well done pierson then flounders for a few more minutes  but there s no trying to convince people at this point that trump should get a free pass on not releasing his returns just like everyone else to show true transparency watch the segment here featured image via video screen capture   ht raw story
