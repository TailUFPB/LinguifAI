north carolina is in a world of trouble  their bathroom law  which tells transgender people that they must use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate  has led to businesses fleeing or avoiding the state so they don t sully their own brands  that includes the nba and the  all star game  which forced the state s legislature to come up with a  fix  so they could keep the all star game the all star game was supposed to be in charlotte next year  charlotte wants to be friendly  compassionate and inclusive  and they re upset with the state legislature overriding the law they put in place that allowed transgender people to use the bathroom that went with their gender identity without making them feel like they have to produce documentation just to take a piss  the nba feels the same way  and issued the following statement on the matter   nba and the charlotte hornets come out swinging against    saying they re not pleased with the amended version  pic twitter com ohnwajbhcg  kyle griffin     june    we have been engaged in dialogue with numerous groups at the city and state levels  but we do not endorse the version of the bill that we understand is currently before the legislature  we remain committed to our guiding principles of inclusion  mutual respect and equal protections for all  we continue to believe that constructive engagement with all sides is the right path forward  there has been no new decision made regarding the  nba all star game  well  isn t that a nice way of saying   you re still a bunch of bigots  now kindly go fuck yourselves  the  fix  is actually no fix at all  and it does reveal north carolina s gop as the stodgy bigots they are  it actually makes things worse  transgender people have to obtain a  certificate of sex reassignment  in order to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity  imagine all the hoops they ll have to jump through just to get that certificate  then there are all the transgender people who haven t yet had  or aren t able to  for whatever reason  have reassignment surgery  this fix doesn t include them at all the gop thinks they re playing both sides though   anything to be able to continue policing people s genitals and dictating where they can pee while ignoring real problems and avoiding real work the problem is that these hidebound neanderthals in republican legislatures want to eat their cake and have it  too  they re either discriminating or they re not   there s no two ways about it  north carolina wants to appease the lgbt community and all their allies while still being able to push them down  give it up  n c featured image by vaughn ridley getty images
