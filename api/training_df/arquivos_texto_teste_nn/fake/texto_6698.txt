glenn beck has shared his opinion on the bigoted bathroom bill in north carolina which forces transgender people to use toilets contrary to their gender identity  beck s bullsh t defense of the plans is just about the stupidest thing you ll hear all day   and we re in an election cycle beck argues that his support of the bathroom bills popping up across the nation s red states is absolutely nothing to do with bigotry and transphobia  according to beck  it has nothing to do with hate  it has everything to do with common sense  but we have detached from common sense  he then  of course  launches into the same entirely hateful  ignorant  fear mongering which ted cruz and curt schilling have engaged in during the course of the debate  he creates the specter of his young daughter being confronted by a man pretending to be a woman in the bathroom   invoking primal fear  beck and others state is as a fact that this will happen all the time without a bathroom bill  despite the sum total of zero cases to date but beck is far from alone in his stupidity curt schilling was recently fired by espn after sharing a facebook post in support of the anti transgender bill passed in north carolina  the post consisted of an image  featuring a man in a wig  his t shirt cut to expose breasts  and a bizarre black outfit of women s clothing  the image was accompanied by text which read  let him in  to the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow minded  judgmental  unloving racist bigot who needs to die  former player schilling then added  a man is a man no matter what they call themselves  i don t care what they are  who they sleep with  men s room was designed for the penis  women s not so much  now you need laws telling us differently  pathetic  espn later issued a statement claiming schilling s  unacceptable conduct  violated their policy of inclusiveness  espn is an inclusive company  curt schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with espn has been terminated  gop presidential hopeful ted cruz has also come out in support for the bills on the same bigoted basis  cruz told abc news saturday  there is no greater evil than predators and if the law says that any man  if he chooses can enter a women s restroom  a little girl s restroom and stay there and he cannot be removed because he simply says at that moment he feels like a woman  you re opening the door for predators  however  using a caricature of a cross dressing predator to invoke fear about transgender people using the gender identity appropriate bathroom is plain bigotry  one could just as readily argue the opposite  as transgender men did en masse with the hashtag using the hashtag  wejustneedtopee  bearded transgender men posted pictures of themselves in the women s bathroom  next to women entering cubicles and doing their makeup michael hughes  from minnesota  posted the picture below  asking   do i look like i belong in a women s bathroom under the north carolina law  michael would be legally compelled to use the women s bathrooms   despite the fact that he would clearly cause some degree of confusion and worry by doing so surely the long term answer is to remove the gender apartheid from toilets altogether  plenty of countries around the world do just fine using mixed bathrooms  why not us featured image via flickr creative commons
