ted cruz isn t the most likeable guy out there   you ve probably heard this before  and it s not just the media being the media trying to make him look bad   there s a reason senator cruz has virtually no endorsements from any of his fellow senators in congress  it s because the accusations are true  not that many people like the guy  plain and simple that being said  vice president joe biden made everyone s night  at ted cruz s expense  at the annual gridiron dinner on saturday when he capitalized on this sentiment by telling the crowd a joke he told to president obama behind closed doors  ted cruz  an inspiration to every kid in america who worries that he ll never be able to run for president because nobody likes him i told barack  if you really  really want to remake the supreme court  nominate cruz  before you know it  you ll have eight vacancies  that s not the only joke the vice president made  but is probably the most memorable  the event  held in washington d c  is a place where the press and politicians come together every year and  basically  just roast each other  it s supposed to be in good fun   in much the same way you re used to at the annual white house correspondents dinner biden also took a few jabs at trump  as well  one made fun of former speaker of the house john boehner s fake  orange looking  tan  donald has attacked every person of color   except john boehner  chris christie  if you ve been keeping up with the news  has been getting some serious flak for the way he looked standing behind donald trump during a press conference last week  so biden joked about that  as well  chris christie swears he wasn t being held captive by trump  but just take a look at that face  in the video below   but folks  on a serious point  trump said he likes  people who don t get captured  what a terrible thing to say about my friend and a genuine war hero  john mccain  so tonight i call on donald trump to be a man of his word   and release chris christie right now  vice president biden is a man known for saying what s on his mind  sometimes he gets in trouble for it but most of the time he just makes us laugh  that joke about ted cruz was a good one featured image via wikimedia
