liberals have been questioning the intelligence of tea partiers since the movement arrived on the national political scene complete with misspelled signs and idiotic conspiracy theories  their leaders include such great minds as michele bachman and ted cruz  two people with impressive educational backgrounds who can t seem to stop saying incredibly dimwitted things that mentality trickles down to the state and municipal level as well  as members of the crowds of tea bag wearing  patriots  decided to go home to seek public office and crusade for a return to   never has that been more obvious than in the case of hampstead  nh advisory budget committee chairman  jorge mesa tejada the school board in hampstead was seeking approval for upgrades to the local elementary school  using the security of the students as one of their reasons  looking to eliminate the use of remote classrooms outside of the main building  the board cited that the traveling back and forth of students may provide an opportunity for a sniper to shoot children while that may seem a little bit extreme  it is nothing compared to the chairman s argument against the upgrades  in an open committee hearing broadcast on local cable access television  mesa tejada outlined exactly how he would use his military training to wipe out children  killing them at recess from the woods behind them   i would have a field day   he said reaction from the school board was swift  mesa tejada has had a no trespassing order issued against him  banning him from being anywhere near school property  not only did he outline what could only be the delusions of a very sick mind  he also gave other lunatics the perfect plan of attack to pull off the next newtown the chairman has since apologized  but it s too little too late for the school board and the residents of hampstead   when i saw the recording  i had two first reactions   said caitlin parnell  a mother of two children at the school   one was disbelief that an elected official would be talking this way  and my second reaction was to feel sick to my stomach  you can watch mesa tejada s despicable comments below featured image via twitter
