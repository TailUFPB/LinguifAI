donald trump is a misogynist creep and ashley judd had no problem telling the world what she has personally witnessed the actress talked to jezebel writer ellie shechet on thursday morning on the red carpet of the creative coalition gala and judd gave an unprompted story about the republican nominee  whom she has know for over a decade  and let s just say that judd s story about trump takes him to a whole new level of creepy perv  i ve known donald for    years   she began  i m friends with someone who married into the family  anyway  i would bump into him at the u s  open  for example  and i think i can say the amount of time he has spent looking at my chest rather than my face is proportional to his insanity and functionality  and then she demonstrated exactly what trump does  if i may  this is what it s like to talk to donald trump   judd stopped and stared pointedly at my chest   he s a chest gazer  a breast gazer  let s be more specific and  referring to the person who at that time was married into the family  he just sexualized her   doesn t she look great  doesn t she look    he s just revolting  and it s not like trump hasn t publicly displayed his creepiness on multiple occasions  trump has fantasized about his own daughter  during a  appearance on  the view   trump said this about ivanka trump when asked if she would ever pose for playboy  it would be really disappointing   not really   but it would depend on what s inside the magazine  i don t think ivanka would do that  although she does have a very nice figure  i ve said if ivanka weren t my daughter  perhaps i d be dating her  and that was just in   here s what he told rolling stone for an article in  at   he can still carry on like the teen who was yanked out of prep school and delivered to col  dobias  the take no shit instructor at the military academy  after i met ivanka and praised her to her father  he said   yeah  she s really something  and what a beauty  that one  if i weren t happily married and  ya know  her father       so yeah  donald trump treats all women  even his own daughter  as sexual objects  he s disgusting  and he s the person the republican party chose as their leader  if that s how they thought they could reach out to women voters they were sorely mistaken featured image  wikimedia
