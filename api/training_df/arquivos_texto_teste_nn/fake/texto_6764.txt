have you ever really taken a close look at donald trump  you can tell by looking at him that he s a fraud  he never looks genuine  his speech doesn t flow  he uses a fourth grade mentality and he panders to idiots  there s nothing about the man that points to him actually being this staunch conservative republican  and now we have proof  the associated press reports that trump s own republican national convention czar was caught in a behind closed doors meeting telling party officials that everything about trump the party hates is an act trump s newly hired senior aide  paul manafort  informed republican national committee members that trump has a private persona and an onstage persona  and that the onstage trump will be mellowing out to bring electoral results should he be the party s nominee  manafort said in the private briefing  when he s out on the stage  when he s talking about the kinds of things he s talking about on the stump  he s projecting an image that s for that purpose you ll start to see more depth of the person  the real person  you ll see a real different guy he gets it  the part that he s been playing is evolving into the part that now you ve been expecting  but he wasn t ready for  because he had first to complete the first phase  the negatives will come down  the image is going to change  in other words  the guy people are looking to because they don t want  another crooked politician  is playing the political game at a higher level on the republican side than all of the establishment candidates he s run out of town  what exactly can we expect from trump as time goes forward  well  if his past is any indication  he should be whatever suits his mood at the time  it wouldn t be surprising to see him come out in favor of more liberal ideals  he has already stood up for the lgbt community on the transgender bathroom issue  it s obvious he couldn t care less about gay marriage  if he thinks he s gonna reap the same ignorant rewards from the general public on immigration and hate expansion  he s got another think coming trump s only play should he win would be to run his campaign like a democrat  it s not like he doesn t have practice featured image by john lamparski getty images
