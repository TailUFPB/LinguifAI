senate democrats want republican senators to vote on some of gop frontrunner donald trump s racist policies  including his stance on banning muslims from entering the united states senate minority leader harry reid  d nev   said that the republicans should vote on the policies of the front runner since many republicans have refused to distance themselves from trump s racist rhetoric  nor say whether they would support him should he win the republican nomination  senator reid said  these votes will give all senators a chance to take a stand on the policy issues dominating the public debate   and republicans a chance to stand with the frontrunner for their nomination  the senator is correct  after all  trump s the leader of their party for the presidential nomination and despite the fact that some republicans have disagreed with him  the overwhelming majority have not taken a stand on his divisive policies on muslims and hispanic americans  especially mexicans  that s because they fear alienating his popular support in their party  trump currently leads all other republican candidates by a wide margin for the nomination  senator reid said that it s both important and easy to ascertain what other republican senators think of trump and his policies  reid said the votes  can be done easily and efficiently under an open amendment process  with no interference to the light workload senate republican leaders have announced for   reid s move is actually very smart and it could show the true colors of the republicans  it will also put them in a tough spot  there are a few republican senators running for reelection in blue leaning states   republicans are defending a total of  senate seats in november senator reid s suggestion comes as congressional republicans are in baltimore for their annual policy retreat to decide on issues the party will collectively take stances on for the year with trump s enormous popularity among republican voters  senate republicans have been treading water with the first place candidate   whether trump is holding his fellow republicans hostage because of his popularity or whether they secretly feel the same way  the republican party appears to be screwed  some may criticize senator reid s tactic as politically motivated  well of course it is  however  it s also useful  we need the republicans to come out and say who they truly are featured image via wikimedia commons
