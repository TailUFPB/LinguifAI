a  year old teenager is dead today after his  year old friend accidentally shot him in the face with an unsecured gun  now the teen who shot him is facing dire consequences according to the atlanta journal constitution a group of boys were playing with a loaded gun inside an apartment complex when the shooting occurred  relatives of the boys  who ranged from ages  to   told reporters that they were all friends or cousins the  year old was apparently holding the gun just after midnight when it discharged and struck the older boy in the face  after the shooting the  suspect  ran home and told his family that he shot someone  the family members drove him back to the scene where he was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter in   news  found that   children and teens are killed each year in the united states by firearms  to put this into perspective  that means that for every soldier who was killed in afghanistan  over eleven years  at least thirteen kids were killed in america teenagers between the ages of  and  made up over two thirds of all youth gun deaths in america the  findings are compiled in the most complete database to date from records obtained from  state health departments and fbi supplementary homicide reports many of the children who are killed each year die in an  unintentional  shooting  often times these  accidents  happen because they or another child get their hands on an unsecured weapon and it discharges  as a matter of fact  american children are sixteen times more likely to be killed in an accidental shooting than their counterparts in other industrialized nations although the kid in this case was charged with a crime  negligent parents rarely are  twenty seven states  georgia included  and the district of columbia have child access prevention  cap  laws  these laws hold parents responsible when their children access a gun and someone is hurt   but enforcement is almost nonexistent  according to the shreveport times police often feel guilty charging parents who are grieving the loss of a child slate reported even in states where these laws exist  they re both inconsistent standards and penalties for culpability vary widely from state to state and inconsistently applied  with prosecutors often choosing not to pursue cases against negligent parents out of sympathy  perhaps  or a sense that these cases are hard to win  and that s understandable  these shootings are tragedies  after all  and why compound a family s misery by sending a grieving parent to jail  but cap laws are only effective as a deterrent if they re vigorously enforced so parents get away with their negligence  but a scared  year old kid is charged with a crime  as a mother  this appalls me  i would fully expect to be charged with a crime if my son picked up my gun and hurt himself or someone else  as adults we are responsible for keeping our little humans as safe as we can and if we do something that was so neglectful that someone dies as a result  we should be charged to give us a pass  but prosecute a child is mind boggling  meanwhile  this shooting and this shooting and this shooting  all go unprosecuted in the same state featured image via freakout nation
