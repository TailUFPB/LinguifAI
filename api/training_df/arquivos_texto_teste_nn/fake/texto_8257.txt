it might just be time to say sen  ted cruz  in his desperation to win  is running the most disgusting  deceitful political campaign in u s  history  he seems eager to keep using these underhanded tactics  he clearly enjoys it after unapolegetically pissing off the entire state of iowa with fraudulent mailers  cruz immediately traveled to new hampshire and beyond where  he s doing the exact same thing  in new jersey  for example  residents woke up this week to find that cruz had sent them a  check  in the mail for a struggling family  a bit of free money coming in the mail out of the blue could mean everything  tearing it open  what did they find  a shameless campaign tactic designed to get them to give money to cruz s floundering campaign  rather than a check made out to them  cruz s campaign took it upon themselves to write out a check paid to the order of  cruz for president  for    it was all part of cruz s  possibly illegal  money making scheme that he s used in recent weeks  cruz has suggested that he has  secret  wealthy backers that have promised to match donations with regular voters  he begs supporters to give him as much money as they can so that these anonymous  super secret definitely  real  rich friends of his will double the money while these underhanded tactics probably do work to get cruz the money he needs to pay people to like him  it s hard to imagine they are doing wonders for his electability  at this rate  there won t be a state in the country that cruz hasn t personally disgusted with his slimeball campaign  iowa s state government is already floating the idea that they will be looking into legal action against cruz s campaign for the numerous election laws that cruz skated the line of for cruz  all of this backlash might be worth it  he s long been considered one of the most reviled people in politics  people who know him  people who work with him  people who once lived with him in college  all say he s a creep  he s not going to win votes by popularity or policy  instead  his campaign has always been about raising a ton of money from a select group of millionaires and billionaires and then desperately clinging onto fringe right voters who find his homophobia and poor shaming rhetoric  a turn on if cruz s campaign continues to drag for the duration of the primaries  expect to see all the stops pulled out  his team is clearly looking for any possible way to win   ethics and lawfulness need not apply featured image from gage skidmore flickr
