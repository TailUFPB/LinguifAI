the drug enforcement agency released a  page memo on thursday saying that they hope to come to a decision regarding the reschedule of marijuana sometime in early   the dea currently considers marijuana to be a dangerous drug with no medical benefits and is schedule  drug under the controlled substances act that means that marijuana is considered to be as dangerous as heroin  to further drive home how absurd the united states  drug policy is  methamphetamine is in the schedule  drug category  as far as the dea is concerned  marijuana is less harmful than crystal meth marijuana s current schedule status is a slap in the face to science  at this point  no one can seriously deny the medical benefits marijuana has  marijuana has already been proven to be an effective treatment for many illnesses  and as a means of managing the side effects of harsher treatments such as chemotherapy  that s why  states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes the u s  has a major problem with prescription painkillers  between  and   more than   have died from overdoses related to prescriptions opioids  marijuana has not only proven to be an amazing alternative to opioids as a pain management treatment  studies have also shown that marijuana use can help people suffering from opioid addiction while a decision to reschedule marijuana down from a schedule  controlled substance would help to make it easier for individuals working within the cannabis industry  marijuana advocates say that the rescheduling of marijuana  falls well short  of reflecting the nation s attitude towards the plant paul armentano  the deputy director for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws  norml  wrote a blog post where he said  reclassifying the pot plant from i to ii  or even to schedule iii  continues to misrepresent the plant s safety relative to other controlled substances such as methamphetamine  schedule ii   anabolic steroids  schedule iii   or alcohol  unscheduled   and fails to provide states with the ability to fully regulate it free from federal interference further  the federal policies in place that make clinical trial work with cannabis more onerous than it is for other controlled substances   such as the requirement that all source material be purchased from nida s university of mississippi marijuana cultivation program   are regulatory requirements that are specific to cannabis  not to schedule i drugs in general  simply rescheduling cannabis from i to ii does not necessarily change these regulations  at least in the short term  so yes  it would be great news for the dea to reschedule marijuana  it would make federal drug policy one step closer to reflecting reality  however  a plurality of people in the u s  now wants marijuana to be legal for recreational use  four states and washington d c  have already legalized the sale and use of marijuana for recreational use  those states have had phenomenal success with their marijuana policies  now is the time for lawmakers to take bold action to write the wrong that is marijuana prohibition featured image via joe raedle getty images
