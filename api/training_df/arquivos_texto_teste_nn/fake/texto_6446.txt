there have recently been allegations claiming that facebook is purposefully keeping conservative news and topics out of the  trending  news section of their website  however  facebook has released this statement in response  we take allegations of bias very seriously  facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum  trending topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that are being talked about on facebook  there are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality  these guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives  nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another  these guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in trending topics  according to an article put out by gizmodo  it was claimed that  news curators  for facebook would purposefully pick and choose which topics should be put into trending  and while sure  depending on who is curating the news at any given moment their may be some underlying bias  it appears facebook s algorithms do not allow such bias to rule the roost  in fact  according to facebook s vp of search  tom stocky  it s  not feasible  and if guidelines are violated it is a  fireable offense  here s the full statement by stocky  my team is responsible for trending topics  and i want to address today s reports alleging that facebook contractors manipulated trending topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives  we take these reports extremely seriously  and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum  there are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality  these guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives  nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another  these guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in trending topics trending topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on facebook  popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm  then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not  for example  similar sounding topics or misnomers we are proud that  in   the us election was the most talked about subject on facebook  and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides  we have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically  reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events  and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics  hoaxes  or subjects with insufficient sources  facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible  at the same time  our reviewers  actions are logged and reviewed  and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense there have been other anonymous allegations   for instance that we artificially forced    blacklivesmatter  to trend  we looked into that charge and found that it is untrue  we do not insert stories artificially into trending topics  and do not instruct our reviewers to do so  our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent  such as combining related topics into a single event  such as    starwars  and   maythefourthbewithyou    to deliver a more integrated experience our review guidelines for trending topics are under constant review  and we will continue to look for improvements  we will also keep looking into any questions about trending topics to ensure that people are matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most interesting to them  and to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible  many have been bringing up the fact that facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is a liberal  so he may purposefully promote liberal content and trending topics  now  while the company claims this isn t true  what s to honestly keep them from doing this anyway  the irony in all of this is that conservatives are for freedom within a capitalist society and if a company were to operate in a way that they see fit  that is their freedom  they are not bound to not be biased except for their own rules they put in place  with that being said  facebook is adamantly denying the claims that they are being biased  and maybe  just maybe  liberal opinions are the more popular opinions and thus trend more often  ever think of that featured photo by sean gallup getty images
