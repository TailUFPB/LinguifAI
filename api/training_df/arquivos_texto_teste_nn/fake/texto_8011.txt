donald trump infuriates even the most compassionate and holy amongst us   like the pope  for example  when pope francis was asked on thursday how he felt about the republican front runner  it took every ounce of the religious leader s strength not to erupt while francis was in mexico  a reporter questioned the pope about trump s potential for president  francis brilliantly slammed the racist goper  saying that a person who thinks only about building walls  wherever they may be  and not building bridges  is not christian  francis had been referencing trump s promise to build a wall along the u s  mexican border   something that trump has become infamous for during his campaign  along with his numerous offensive comments about immigrants when trump found out about what francis said about him  he tried to shrug it off  saying  now it s probably going to be all over the world  who the hell cares  ok  i don t care  but he cares very much  thin skinned and never one to take criticism lightly  trump fired back at the pope while at a campaign stop in south carolina just hours after the pontiff was praying at the border for those who died trying to come to the united states  trump issued a press release stating that  no leader  especially a religious leader  should have the right to question another man s religion or faith   calling francis  comments  disgraceful   trump also added in a few jabs at president barack obama  i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened  unlike what is happening now  with our current president  unable to accept that maybe he s just a horrible guy and unequipped to be president  trump whined that the mexican government had soiled his reputation and turned the pope against him so they can  continue to rip off the united states  both on trade and at the border   clearly in a huge amount of denial  trump said  the pope only heard one side of the story   he didn t see the crime  the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states  he doesn t see how mexican leadership is outsmarting president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation  making a case for his offensive approach on immigration  trump suggested that the mexican government is  using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so  especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant   this echoes comments trump had made last week  when he spoke against francis  plans to pray at the border  stating that the pope was being exploited  in an interview with fox news  trump said  i don t think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with mexico  i think mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is  they re making a fortune  and we re losing  in his press release  the donald also suggested that the pope would be sorry for ever doubting him  he said that  if and when  isis attacks the vatican   i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened  keep dreaming  donald  featured image via flickr   flickr
