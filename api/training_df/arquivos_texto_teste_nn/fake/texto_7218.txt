if there were a contest to describe who the most grotesque  misogynistic and outright awful human beings on the planet are  donald trump and those who he surrounds himself with would likely top the list  not only is trump wildly sexist and racist  but he comes to the defense of those who abuse others in his name  he has said it at his campaign rallies for those who go after protesters  and now he s come out in full defense of his campaign manager  corey lewandowski  who was caught on video brutally grabbing a reporter lewandowski  while at a campaign event on march  at trump national golf club  grabbed then breitbart news network reporter michelle fields  she filed charges  and subsequently lewandowski has now turned himself into the police you can see here  via security footage  that lewandowski  without a doubt  grabbed fields newly released security footage of the corey lewandowski incident  https   t co   frank luntz   frankluntz  march     trump is still jumping to the defense of his abusive campaign manager  shortly after lewandowski turned himself in  trump tweeted out wow  corey lewandowski  my campaign manager and a very decent man  was just charged with assaulting a reporter  look at tapes nothing there   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    then he blames the victim like the good misogynist he is why aren t people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened  that is before she found out the episode was on tape   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    he tries to make up an excuse as to why she was being grabbed  turning it back on her victory press conference was over  why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions  can i press charges  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    is this reporter touching me as i leave news conference  what is in her hand   pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    tweets are literally going from bad to worse the right thing to do would be to acknowledge the abuse and swiftly fire lewandowski  but instead he s choosing to victim shame and back up his brownshirt flunky it s beyond belief that people still support donald trump  either they are racist and or misogynistic themselves  hate themselves  or are simply too stupid and likely cannot even tie their own shoe laces  we need to make sure trump stays as far away from the oval office as possible  no matter who  we need to vote blue  don t let a vote of pure conscience and ego let this country slip into the hands of a man who will most definitely have his hands on nuclear codes  wake up  people  this race is bigger than ourselves and even our nation  it affects the whole world featured photo by joe raedle getty images   twitter
