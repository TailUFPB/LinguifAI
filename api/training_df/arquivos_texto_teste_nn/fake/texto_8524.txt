you have to admire conservatives  ability to commit to the lie  after david daledin and sandra merritt  the slimy  lying taint barnacles who produced the fraudulent  heavily edited planned parenthood  baby parts  videos that took the conservative world by storm  were indicted on multiple felony charges  a surprising event that took place during the course of an investigation into planned parenthood of the gulf coast ordered by texas governor greg abbott   one would expect conservatives to turn their anger toward those who lied to them  unfortunately  these are people who still think hillary clinton was responsible for benghazi the indictments against the perpetrators of these agregious lies  ones that inspired robert dear to engage in an act of terrorism against a planned parenthood facility in colorado  were enough to throw  hopeful carly fiorina into a fit of delusional panic and rage on monday  fiorina joined conservative talk radio host hugh hewitt to share her outrage   not against the people whose lies caused her to spout off crazy talk about  baby parts  for months  but against anyone remotely interested in the truth  asked for her reaction  fiorina explained that she is furious that planned parenthood s  trafficking in baby body parts  did not lead to prosecution  yes  well  this is why it s a fight for the character of our nation  we know for a fact that because of planned parenthood s own announcement that they would no longer accept payments for what they call  fetal tissue   and they were in fact trafficking in baby body parts  so guess what  i m not going to sit down and be quiet as i said at the march for life in washington  d c  on friday before the snowstorm descended  i will not sit down and be quiet  i know the value of life  we know what s going on  and i will continue to stand for the character of this nation  from what i read  somehow the charge is that they falsified government identities because that s true obviously  that s not good  but i only know what i read at this point  but i think it s pretty clear that we now know what goes on in planned parenthood clinics   fiorina told hewitt  explaining that the indictments for  tampering with a governmental record  and  prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs   very serious charges   were an outrage because despite all this  she considers the heavily edited videos to be legitimate  here s what i know  planned parenthood has been trafficking in body parts  planned parenthood has been altering late term abortion techniques to this specific purpose of harvesting body parts  in president fiorina budget  there will not be a single dime for planned parenthood  fiorina isn t the only gop candidate who is immune to reality  marco rubio told cnn that he is  disturbed  because planned parenthood   who are the ones that were actually selling off these  body  parts were found having done nothing wrong  the people who tried to expose them are the ones that are now facing criminal charges  it s interesting what happens when people focus on the facts  isn t it mike huckabee called monday a  sick day in america  because  those who expose evil w  a cellphone  are being punished for their criminal actions  but planned parenthood was found to have done nothing criminal  ben carson s campaign promised retribution against planned parenthood  which has been cleared in every single politically motivated investigation against them to date  carson s communication director told cnn  he is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed planned parenthood s heinous and illegal activities  as president  he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization  but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn  unfortunately  conservatives simply don t care about the truth   and the truth is that the only criminals are the ones who made the fake videos that prompted the stupid part of america to lose their sh t listen to carly fiorina lose her mind below featured image via youtube
