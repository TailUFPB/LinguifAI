it s funny how extreme right wing christians always think they know what their god is thinking about politics  especially since most of the candidates who say that god told them to run for president never even get the nomination  much less become president  well  another such right wing christian has added his voice to this narrative  pastor john hagee  on the tuesday edition of his show hagee hotline  the fiery preacher issued a dire warning  vote for donald trump in november  or god will come for you  hagee warned that  god will not hold us harmless   and that voting is an imperative duty  he continued to rant  i m going to vote for the candidate that s going to make the u s  military great again  i m going to vote for the party that is going to solve the immigration problem  not the one that has created the immigration problem  i m going to support the party that brings jobs back from china   i m not going to vote for the party that has betrayed israel for the past seven years  if you can read a newspaper  you know who i m talking about  no candidate is perfect  but i want you to go vote and may god give us a leader who has the courage to put america first and stand up for we the people  now  i don t know about you  but this sounds an awful lot like a preacher putting politics into religion to me  if hagee s ministry is tax exempt  he needs to lose that status if he can t stop the politicking  further  no higher power   if one were to actually exist   would want a dangerous  racist  sexist  xenophobic narcissist as the leader of the free world this election cycle sure has brought out the nutjobs  all thanks to the likes of donald trump  if that man wins  we re all going to need some divine intervention for sure watch the video of pastor hagee s comments  via right wing watch featured image via video screen capture
