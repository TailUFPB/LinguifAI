when people think of rape  they generally imagine some masked man grabbing a woman and dragging her into a dark alley or the woods and assaulting her  however  it generally doesn t happen that way  most sexual assault occurs at the hands of someone the victim knows   this is usually referred to as  date rape   or  acquaintance rape   that is what makes these cases so difficult to prosecute  that is also what makes things like the processing of rape kits and other physical evidence following an assault so vital  however  one idaho sheriff has gotten the idea in his head that most rapes are  consensual sex   and thanks to that  he doesn t think his state needs laws making sure rape kits get processed however  following rightful public outrage  bingham county sheriff craig rowland is backpeddling  he took to the sheriff department s facebook page to try to explain just why he made the outrageous and despicable assertion that most rapes are actually  to use his words   consensual sex   here is this neanderthal s facebook  apology   i want to explain what i was trying to say in the interview  i misspoke when i said the majority of our rape cases are consensual sex  the meaning behind my statement that has been misunderstood is that when a case is called into the dispatch center each and every one is thoroughly investigated  a deputy is sent to every one of these cases and that deputy then in turn contacts the on call detective to help with the investigation  in some of these cases through the investigation it may be determined that the sex was consensual  but not always  in these types of cases after the investigation is complete and it was determined that the sex was consensual  i don t believe that those kits should be sent to the lab  then  as if that sorry excuse for an  apology  weren t enough  rowland then went on to go down the old  i m sorry if you were offended  road  and then proceeded to paint himself as a victim here  talking about  cyber bullying   i know that it is hard for victims to come forward on sexual assault cases  i spoke to a rape victim today and told her that i knew it was hard for her to come forward  i want to apologize to anyone who i might have offended with my statement as my main responsibility is to the public s safety and well being and maintaining their trust    he wrote   i can also say with regret that i now know what it is like to be cyber bullied  not only have i been threatened but so has my family  i hope that this will clear things up a bit  sure  it clears things up  sheriff rowland  but not in the way you think  what you ve said here is no different from what you said before  you re victim blaming  nine times out of ten  if a woman says she was raped  she was  you say yourself that it s hard for victims to disclose  so  why the hell would anyone make something like that up  it s men like you  sheriff rowland  who keep rape culture alive and well you have no business in law enforcement  and i sincerely feel for the rape victims for whom you are their only source of so called  help  featured image via video screen capture
