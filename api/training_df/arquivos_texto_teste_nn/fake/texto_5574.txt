polls have shown for awhile that donald trump has a solid lead among white voters without a college education  what about those with a college education  that group tends to vote republican in presidential elections  but it looks like trump will lose that group of voters for the gop for the first time in  years this is huge  because it means he s not polling as well with white voters as he thinks he is  in fact  he could lose the white vote as well as every minority vote and the women s vote this year  so he might be able to keep it sort of semi close  depending on what happens with the white vote  but his royal narcissism won t understand that since may  our wannabe fascist in chief has trailed by about six percentage points with this group  and has trailed an average of five points with the general electorate  it seems that his xenophobic policy proposals  along with his insistence that sexism and racism are just political correctness run amok and not actual problems  just don t sit well with people who are educated enough to know how to think for themselves  education is king donnie s number one enemy romney won this same group by six points in   romney also held solid leads in states that trump is putting into play for the first time in years  if not decades  much to the gop s dismay  hillary clinton is actually competitive in states such as georgia  arizona  utah and kansas  romney won these states by an average of   points  while we can easily expect utah not to favor his royal dishonesty as much as romney  they could actually turn blue this year because they can t stand trump hillary is polling much better with this group than the dunce in chief  even though overall  they re fairly close together  it seems that the wannabe president who would be king may have to rely heavily on circumstances beyond his control to gain ground in the opinion polls again  like obama losing popularity  an economic crisis  or hillary getting scandalized due to another witch hunt that s a sucky position to be in  although our not so broken hearts only bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for him over this  for now  hillary s growing popularity among white  educated voters could easily give her the presidency featured image by jeff swensen getty images
