sometimes  politics can get so ridiculous that one is forced to wonder if what he or she is seeing is really happening  one of those moments occurred on the second day of the gop convention  after melania trump blatantly plagiarized part of michelle obama s  democratic convention speech  the gop leaped into action  offering every ridiculous excuse they could muster to defend the prospective next first lady   including the trump campaign s official hamburger delivery boy chris christie s  well she didn t plagiarize all of it so it wasn t plagiarism  defense but the most insane thing to come out of this scenario is perhaps republican national committee communications director sean spicer s  my little pony  defense  melania trump said   you work hard for what you want in life   akon said   work hard for what you get in life   john legend said   work hard   spicer offered during an interview on msnbc  you re quoting akon and john legend   asked host craig melvin  hold on  it s

in that michelle obama lifted the phrases from  my little pony   he s not  but let s pretend that this is some alternate universe where rabid  tentacular beasts rule the planet  the sky is constantly on fire  and a smart  classy woman like michelle obama needs to dip into the brilliant and thought provoking scripts of  my little pony  in order to write a speech does it really make it any better that melania trump lifted quotes third hand from a children s tv show  is the fact that mrs  trump couldn t steal from someone more respectable than a show about magic horses actually comforting here s the thing  though  while spicer really  had to reach to connect trump s  and obama s  to my little pony  the difference in wording between the two speeches was minimal  in any case  this tweet from
