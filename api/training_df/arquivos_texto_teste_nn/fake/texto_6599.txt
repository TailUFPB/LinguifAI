republican presidential hopeful and texas senator ted cruz has earned the nickname  lyin  ted  for a reason  and he s in no rush to clean up his tarnished image anytime soon proving that he s completely worthy of being known as the least liked goper  cruz mingled with voters at the pie pan restaurant in evansville this weekend   and lied to their faces  for over an hour  cruz met and took photos with voters  clearly trying to prove that he wasn t  lucifer  as former house speaker john boehner recently suggested during this meet and greet  one of the issues cruz spoke about was obamacare  cruz said  the top two legislative agenda items i ve got are repealing obamacare and passing a simple flat tax  abolishing the irs  everything was going smoothly for cruz until toward the end of his visit  when an older couple introduced cruz to scott  a disabled man in a wheelchair  although some of the conversation is muffled  it is clear that the man is concerned about the affordable care act being repealed  stating that people like him would not be able to get health insurance at all  this concern is completely valid   even current house speaker paul ryan has said that putting people with pre existing conditions into  high risk pools  would make healthcare unaffordable for many americans  cruz began to respond and say  there s no doubt that we need to provide care  before the man interrupted  but it was never done before  it was never done  nobody did it  cruz  heartless as ever  replied with a straight up lie  i can tell you millions have lost their health care at the same time  the  millions  that cruz is referring to are those who had policies that didn t meet obamacare standards  factcheck org has actually straightened this false gop talking point right out   it turns out that those people didn t  lose  their insurance at all   they were offered replacements that did fall in line with the aca instead  but of course  cruz isn t going to bother with the truth you can watch cruz lie to a disabled man s face below the feed unfortunately cut out  but not before the man confronting cruz could point to scott and say  well  but it made a difference to some  those  some  people who the man is referring to are the   million americans that now have affordable health insurance thanks to the affordable care act  repealing obamacare is a huge disservice to americans  and it s a shame that cruz s attitude toward those concerns is i don t give a f ck  featured image is a screenshot
