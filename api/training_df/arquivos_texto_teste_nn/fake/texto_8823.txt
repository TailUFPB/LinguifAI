a few days after christmas in   felicia houston    and two of her cousins were walking in an apartment complex when she was murdered by a former leader of the ku klux klan in monroe  north carolina  now  her murderer wants to be released from prison because he  found  jesus russell hinson was angry that a black drug dealer stole   from him on that fateful day  he told a friend that he was going to get revenge  i m going to shoot a n    r through the heart   so  he and a friend  guy brown  drove around the apartment complex where the drug dealer was living  when he came upon the group of girls  the charlotte observer explained what happened next hinson and brown heard their laughter  then they saw them  hinson reloaded and stuck the crossbow out the window  don t shoot  brown said  they re only girls i don t care  hinson said  one of them is going to pay he fired felicia fell to her knees  her cousin testified  hollering   i m shot  i m hurt  i m shot  i m hurt  felicia died sixteen hours after she was shot and hinson was arrested shortly after  the white supremacist went on trial for first degree murder and it took an all white jury just two and a half hours to convict him  now  twenty three years after shooting a child with a crossbow  he wants to be released from prison early dennis long  hinson s uncle  claims that prison  changed  him  he told the observer his nephew  found the lord  about six years ago and has expressed remorse about killing felicia  the north carolina parole commission will be reviewing his case soon and deciding whether or not he deserves release it s always humourous to me that murderers like hinson murder someone  go into prison and then claim to have accepted jesus into their lives  as if picking up a bible suddenly absolves them of the horrific crimes they committed  what s even more ironic is that this guy  a former leader of an organization that believes in white superiority  would probably spit on jesus if he appeared before him  after all  jesus was a middle eastern jew hopefully  the parole board denies his request and sends him back to his cell where he belongs featured image via charlotte observer
