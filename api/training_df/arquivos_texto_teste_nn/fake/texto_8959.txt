in case you haven t heard  there s a theory going around that bristol palin s baby was actually born in november  but the family held out on the announcement until christmas eve  with a pile of circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that bristol was impregnated during a vegas romp with a known alaskan  adult industry worker  on or around valentine s day   the blog right wing crooks broke a very compelling story bristol  good  christian  spokesperson that she is  responded to her critics in a less than christly way  using her instagram screen name      she first offered a denial  worded strongly enough that people would take notice ok  well that solves that then  right  wrong  if there is no truth to the story the palins could avoid the internet shitstorm headed their way and comply with one request well now we sound like donald trump and the birthers of   don t we  not really  since nobody really cares when bristol palin had her baby or who the father is  things like this are the left s form of divine justice  every so often karma swings at people like the palins who preach how much better they are because they love god and america  building fake reputations off of some purity that doesn t exist where bristol is concerned  it s almost too much to handle  while pregnant with her second child out of wedlock she was defending her position as an abstinence counselor  to find out she got knocked up during a one night stand in vegas wouldn t change any elections  it wouldn t alter the course of human history  and the palins would still manage to somehow stay relevant because people love stupidity  it would  however  be absolutely hilarious  especially if the whole thing comes tumbling down over a piece of tape bristol has already had enough  not bothering to indulge the question or deny it further  she simply abandons her own decency with this whoa  pretty strong  is bristol sending a message that she won t engage in questions about it all  or is this all a part of the ruse  making it seem ludicrous and blowing it off would be much easier than releasing a birth certificate or time stamped images since the story was released bristol has had little to say  she has been posting  however  is this maybe another message to people who would question the abstinence princess and her  illegitimate children  let s hope not guns  guns and more guns  it seems like someone may be using all of the grains of powder at her disposal to deal with some anger issues this is the legacy of bristol palin  teenage girl who should have just hidden behind her couch during her idiotic mother s run for the vice presidency turned  year old woman whose only accomplishment is a high placement on dancing with the stars that she didn t deserve nobody really cares  bristol  if you had your baby to cover up slutty behavior just admit it  if not  then well   good for you featured image via screen capture
