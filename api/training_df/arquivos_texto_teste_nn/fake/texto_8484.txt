donald trump is known for his controversial and often racist comments and he continues to be unrelenting  during his latest feud with fox news and specifically megyn kelly  trump tweeted an image of kelly meeting with a saudi prince and a woman dressed in niqab  drudgereport  realdonaldtrump pic twitter com   brad     january    you can probably guess  the image is a fake and was retweeted by trump from an unapologetic racist who has also tweeted images of michelle obama as a monkey and having sex with an ape not that trump seems to care where he gets his information from in the past  he has retweeted white supremacists  including fans of adolf hitler  and has promoted fake crime statistics fabricated by neo nazis  which he later defended as  very credible  in his latest racist tweet  trump does what he does best which is to play on the fears of individuals  this time  just like many times before  islam was used as a vehicle in which to do so  he has called for banning muslims from entering the united states  stood by and did nothing while a muslim woman was kicked out of one of his rallies for simply being a muslim  and has attacked the religion and its followers to the point where there has been a surge in anti muslim hate crimes in the country because of his comments  thus  the fake image of megyn kelly is designed to associate kelly with islam and muslims  which in trump s as well as his racist associates  warped minds means something terrible and something un american trump is a disturbing and a disgusting individual who appeals to folks just like him  let s hope that when all is said and done in terms of the elections  we can all look back and reminisce at the big bad joke that was donald trump running to be president of the united states featured image via wikimedia commons
