in what seems to be another misspeak moment for the sanders  campaign  bernie s campaign manager jeff weaver appeared on cnn and completely stuck his foot in his mouth for going after hillary clinton s ambition to be president  i mean  is she not supposed to be ambitious  wouldn t ambition be a good quality in a leader  someone that wants to get the job done weaver said  don t destroy the democratic party to satisfy the secretary s ambitions to become president of the united states  what he probably doesn t realize  in his ridiculously sexist remark  is the fact that he just directly ripped off an article from  the onion  that was written back in  before hillary s first run at the white house that story  literally titled  hillary clinton is too ambitious to be the first female president  was of course making a parody of sorts and went after folks who thought it wise to go after clinton for having the audacity to run for president  they said  i think it s about time we had a female president of the united states  i don t care what anyone says  women can be just as smart and qualified as men especially the clowns we ve had in washington lately  but hillary clinton  she s just a little too ambitious to do what no woman before her has ever done hillary seems to think she knows what our country needs better than anyone else  and believes that she  among the hundreds or thousands of qualified politicians  is the only one who can do it  is that really the sort of person we want at the helm of our federal government  also saying  hillary doesn t shy away from tough situations  as she proved with her health  care proposal during her husband s first term  she likes to tackle the hard problems  no matter how entrenched the current failing system seems to be  is it just me  or should the woman who  overturns a  year old tradition not have such a tendency to rock the boat hillary has some very strong opinions  and she certainly doesn t hesitate to voice them  she s got an entire website dedicated to her positions on every last little thing  in debates  she always wants to have the last word  she s in love with the sound of her own voice  that s not the sort of person who should be in politics  much less the white house do we really want the first woman leading the free world to be such an outright take charge type  basically saying everything that every man has ever done who s ever run for office  but you know  since it s hillary  well then she s  too ambitious  now  let it be known that weaver is not sanders  and sanders did not say this  however  this sort of talk doesn t make the candidate look good and should likely be reined in a tad  maybe by tad c mon  weaver  this is just awful here s the video via the hill  featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
