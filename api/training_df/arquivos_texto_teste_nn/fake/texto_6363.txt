it s always been obvious to people with half a clue or better that the hatred towards our president was more because of the color of his skin than anything he could possibly have done politically  had a white man walked into the same mess and turned it around into hope for the future and a better country than the one he was handed  he d be bill clinton a sociologist from stanford university had the idea that the resurgence of racism in america didn t just coincide with the rise of the tea party  it drove it  that left a lot of analysts slack jawed  wondering  what was this latent force that drove the emergence of this movement   said robb willer  according to the washington post willer speculates that one thing connecting these two political earthquakes might be white voters  unconscious racial biases  in a series of psychological experiments between  and   he showed how hostility toward people with darker skin and perceived racial threats can influence white support for the tea party  he and his colleagues published a draft of a paper on their findings online last week  some of the most direct evidence of the importance of race to the conservative resurgence during obama s presidency the experiment was simple  two groups of people are shown images of celebrities that include a picture of the president  one with darker skin and one with lighter  the group that saw the dark skinned obama were twice as likely to support the tea party when asked afterward  because of the color of a man s skin and nothing else  willer s team didn t stop there  either  they moved on to see where else race played a major role and landed smack dab on white privilege the groups were given conflicting innocuous reports about the u s  population and demographics  one report said the white people should hold a strong majority in this country for the foreseeable future and the other says whites will decline into a minority by   the group that heard they were safely white washed were far more likely to support the tea party  when all of a sudden the support of minorities looks like it will be key  support for the tea party plummets all of this  every last bit of it  is due to racism  when the tea party stormed washington dc in   packing congressional offices with morons as far as the eye could see  their number one agenda  along with the rest of the gop  was to stop president obama from accomplishing anything  they failed  but the influence is still there  when lindsey graham stood in front of cameras and declared that his party had gone  batsh t crazy   he wasn t kidding featured image from wikipedia altered by rob willer
