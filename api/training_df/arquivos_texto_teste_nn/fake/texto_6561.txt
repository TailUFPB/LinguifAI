in case you haven t heard  god s chosen candidate  ted cruz  either disproved god s existence or showed the world that the big guy in the sky really hates smarmy  bigoted douchebags  yes  the embarrassment to america that was ted cruz s campaign is finally over  fate swallowed his chances up like that throat booger he ate on national television during a debate  you can all rest assured knowing that the republican party s destruction is finally complete in that donald trump is considered the most qualified candidate for the office of president what better way to end his presidential campaign than to elbow his wife in the face  you may be staring at your screen wondering   did he just say what i think he said   yes  by punching and elbowing his wife in the face  while it was almost assuredly as much an accident as abstinence only advocate bristol palin s multiple out of wedlock pregnancies  it actually happened still don t believe me  watch as cruz was hugging his father  while his bigoted  homophobic  and hateful supporters looked on  the now former presidential candidate accidentally did what most of america wants to do to him  he accidentally popped heidi in the jaw then followed up with an elbow to the face his campaign  which was built on catering to the absolute worst people in society s hatred and stupidity  the ones trump had not already snagged up anyway   was truly an embarrassment to our nation   almost as embarrassing as the fact that his own daughter hates him just as much as the rest of us but what will cruz do now  will he commit himself to the senate  where he can continue to attempt to install a theofascist regime in america and fight diligently to take away the rights of anyone he thinks god tells him to hate  will he come to terms with the fact that he  as the candidate he himself has stated god  chose  to lead america into the promised land  probably isn t the super christian he thinks he is  will he continue his alleged career as the zodiac killer no matter what cruz does  one thing is for certain  he s probably going to spend some time in the  dog house  rather than the white house featured image via screengrab
