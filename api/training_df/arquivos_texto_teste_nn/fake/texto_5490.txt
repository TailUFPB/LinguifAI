it s always depressing when allegations that police target african americans are confirmed not just by eyewitness accounts  but with audio or video evidence  recently  a nypd officer provided gawker with chilling audio that sounds a whole lot like his boss pressuring him into profiling black men michael birch recorded the audio in  when he was called to a performance evaluation meeting with his commanding officer and a lieutenant in august   he told the publication that he was expecting to hear that he wasn t generating enough  activity    which meant he would be ordered to arrest more people and issue more summonses   but  the conversation just turned completely weird to  him when he was flat out told to racially profile  who commits the crimes in the city   commanding officer  constantin tsachas  who was recently cleared for a  promotion from captain to deputy inspector asks in this rather damning clip birch answers that it s  mostly teenagers  anywhere between the ages of  and   mostly male blacks and hispanics   asked who he is stopping  birch explains that he stops  everybody   fifty four  up to     the commanding officer says   twenty five of those are female  half  like i said  i stop everybody   birch replies   i m not targeting anybody  you just told me who the bad guys are   his co presses  yeah  i know that  but there s also other people who are committing violations as well   birch says   i m not saying that there s not violations being made  in other words  people from all demographics break the law  that should have been good enough for the commanding officer  but then the conversation went completely off the rails co  the male blacks  that you told me commit the crimes birch  plenty of people that i write summonses to are male blacks and male hispanics co  you stopped two male blacks birch  not for the whole year  you re telling me for the whole year i only stopped two male blacks on summonses co     from january  to august   fifty four tabs  two male blacks  seven hispanics  seven other  ten white  three asian  so where are you targeting the perps that you just told me birch  like i said  if i don t see a perp jumping over the turnstile  what am i supposed to do to him co  these people are not going to pop birch  how do i know that  a female hispanic that i stopped in sheepshead bay did pop  actually  for a warrant  and i arrested her  female hispanic  the hispanics that we re supposed to be going after  that are committing the crimes  the people that i co  did you think that she was going to pop birch  did i think she was going to pop  i didn t put no thought into it  if you come up for a collar  i m taking you in  pop  is a term for when a warrant pops up and leads to an arrest  tab is a term for a court summons resulting from a transit violation  the conversation continues  getting worse as it progresses co  here s what i see  you just described to me who s committing the crimes  you re fully aware of it  but you re not targeting those people birch  i am  i m targeting everybody co  two male blacks birch  whoever is out there  if i co  so you only saw two male blacks jump the turnstile birch  if you re saying that s what s in front of you  then yes  that s all i saw  is two male blacks for the whole year jumping the turnstile  if you re saying that s what s in front of you  i m not disputing that  if that s what i got there co  that is what you have  that is not disputed here birch  i m saying  we re also talking hispanics as well  i stopped a lot of hispanics  too co  seven male hispanics  but more than half are female birch  and like i said  everybody s committing violations in front of me  i was shocked   birch said of the meeting   i was not only shocked  i was mad  my last name is birch  i look white  they didn t realize i was a puerto rican kid  and they re just saying this to me like it s ok  it s ok  we re amongst friends  i don t want to be stopped because i m puerto rican   he says   i want to get stopped because i did something wrong  birch is suing the department to combat  what he sees as a larger trend of policing that disproportionately affects minority new yorkers   gawker reports  the targeting of minorities by the nypd has caused so many problems throughout our city yet the nypd continues to promote officers who engage in these activities   his lawyer told the publication  it s very hard to have a job where the whole public is against you  including your bosses  and when you actually try to do something right  they don t care   birch says   i can t wait to get away from this place  birch is evidence that good cops do exist  the problem is that  unlike him  most good cops stay silent as bad actors disgrace the profession  unfairly targeting people who are not white  thank you for stepping forward  officer birch  hopefully  your example will lead other good cops to call out the bad ones hear the audio for yourself below featured image via youtube
