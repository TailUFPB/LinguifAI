ted cruz got a brutal lesson in why he should keep his children out of politics on wednesday night  when his daughter let slip a family secret during a live television interview the texas senator and gop presidential candidate appeared alongside his wife heidi and two young daughters for a live town hall on cnn on wednesday night  during the interview  cruz s daughter revealed that there is video footage of her father in women s underwear and a feather boa  the pronouncement left cruz visibly nervous and no doubt has his pr team doing some immediate damage limitation among cruz s evangelical base the cruz family was on stage with anderson cooper on wednesday night  and the whole scene is a perfect reminder of the phrase  never work with children or animals  this week s town halls have placed their focus on the personal lives of the candidates more than the political views  and in a later segment of the event  cruz began a harmless tale of a recent daddy daughter picnic at school  thrilled with the reception  cruz went a little further  in an attempt to up his credentials as a folksy  involved dad   telling them that he often plays dress up with his daughters  she got to dress up daddy in a pink boa and these like  big goofy looking underwear he grinned at his daughter caroline however  caroline then chimed in with a revelation that left the senator briefly stumped  and  it was on a videotape the whole time   she said  as millions of americans watched the scene unfold from home   and that was a class video that they re sending out to all the parents  cruz could only muster a brief  oh oh   while heidi attempted to prevent her daughter revealing anything else ad lib  while host cooper can t withhold a laugh  the audience is clearly as uncomfortable as the cruz parents  you can almost hear ted sending out a prayer to his lord and pr team to double  triple and quadruple check that if that video footage exists  it gets disappeared immediately https   www youtube com watch v  at addicting info suspect that far from caroline making a naive pr stumble here  it might actually be a brutal attack of revenge for this campaign moment a while back it s beginning to look like caroline is reminding her father that if he continues to try and milk her for political ends  she will continue to kick him firmly where it hurts featured image via screen capture
