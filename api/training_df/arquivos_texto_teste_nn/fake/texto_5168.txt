just like donald trump  sean hannity has a thin skin and throws a temper tantrum on twitter whenever someone tells the truth about him that s what happened on thursday when wall street journal foreign affairs columnist bret stephens took a shot at hannity by calling him  fox news  dumbest anchor  for attacking republican leaders for not blindly supporting trump no matter what he does and threatened to blame them on the air repeatedly if trump loses in november fox news  dumbest anchor had a message for y all  https   t co amqutldeow via  yahoo  bret stephens   stephenswsj  august    that was enough to cause the fox news host to explode in rage on twitter with a series of posts attacking stephens  wsj genius  where were u when boehner punted on the power of the purse a added nearly  trillion in new debt  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    were you when r party refused to use the power of the purse to defund obamacare   https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    where were you dumbass when in  r s said the would stop obama s illegal and unconstitutional exec amnesty  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    s arrogant  elitist  enablers like you that never hold r s accountable that created the opening for trump   https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    if hillary wins i will hold assholes like you accountable  you will be responsible for her supreme ct selections     https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    were u when weak pathetic boehner   co allowed the potus to accumulate more debt than all  pres combined https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    s hissy fit even carried over to friday  congress has the power of the purse  why in  did r s promise to defund exec amnesty  why capitulate to obama  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  august    is right that congress has the power of the purse  but not funding obamacare would have resulted in a veto  which is a power the president has  ultimately  a government shutdown would have occurred and republicans would have been blamed like they were in  when ted cruz persuaded republicans to defund obamacare that october  the standoff was a disaster for republicans who were overwhelmingly blamed in multiple polls and would have resulted in the united states defaulting on the national debt had the shutdown not been ended by republicans backing down and funding the law furthermore  hannity didn t care about the national debt when president bush was busy adding trillions to it with two wars that lasted over a decade  bush took a surplus left by bill clinton and turned it into a    trillion deficit that fox news and republicans immediately tried to blame president obama for  and just so hannity knows  president obama s fiscal responsibility has nearly eliminated that deficit this is the second time in a month that hannity has flown off the handle because he couldn t deal with being criticized the first incident occurred just after the republican convention in cleveland when jon stewart took over stephen colbert s desk and delivered an epic smackdown of hannity for being hypocrite by hating on president obama for certain things while loving the same things about trump here s the video of that epic mocking via youtube and of course  hannity responded by losing his sh t on his radio show it s really no wonder why hannity supports trump  he looks at him and sees himself featured image via screen capture
