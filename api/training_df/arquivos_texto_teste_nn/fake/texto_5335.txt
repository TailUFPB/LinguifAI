during an interview on cbs s face the nation sunday morning  president obama lambasted donald trump for his recent comments regarding defending the united states  nato allies  he saw the comment as being indicative of the republican presidential candidate of not having enough foreign policy experience  you know for mr  trump  who has in the past suggested that america s weak and not looking out for its allies  to then maybe not have enough information or understanding to go out and say that america might not stand by its solemn commitment to protect those same allies who stood with us after   when we were attacked i think is an indication of the lack of preparedness that he has been displaying when it comes to foreign policy   obama said president obama went on to say that muslim americans are willing to assist in the fight against the islamic state  he condemned trump and others who have used hateful rhetoric against muslims here at home and abroad  but that requires leaders  political leaders  religious leaders  business leaders  all of us to send a very clear signal that we are not going to be divided in that fashion   obama went on to say   and i think the kinds of rhetoric that we ve heard too often  from mr  trump and others  is ultimately helping do i s i l  s work  president obama is absolutely correct  trump s rhetoric is hurting the united states and our allies  he is too dangerous  xenophobic  and unpredictable to be allowed to have any type of power over the nation s military you can watch the interview in full featured image via video screen capture
