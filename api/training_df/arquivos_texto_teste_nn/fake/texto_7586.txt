 wednesday night was the final democratic debate before the march  primaries  and it was heated  however  the biggest controversy of the night didn t come from the candidates sparring with each other  it came when a mexican american teenager sang the national anthem at the beginning of the debate  apparently  white america believes only caucasians are allowed to sing that song fifteen year old sebastien de la cruz took the stage before the debate and sang a beautiful rendition of our national song  he has an amazing voice for someone so young and of course  given the fact that it was a univision debate  it made sense that a latino a give the performance  racists  however  weren t interested in praising the child for his vocal abilities or using common sense  instead  they decided to spew hate all over twitter  because they are a  holes here are some of their responses   cnn this is the dumbest thing i ve quite possibly ever saw  for a minute i forgot i was in  america until they sang the national anthem   millennial      march    only thing worse than this democratic debate national anthem is that morons mariachi outfit  richard obama     march    gawd   the guy who sung the national anthem looked like the frito bandito    bill maier   billstl  march    dem debate hosted by mexico  the national anthem sung by little  marcorubiohillary promises she won t lie bernie offers free churros  loki anthony   dankbeans  march    berniepride its our  nationalanthem and should be treated with respect how would you like it if i sing  lacucaracha in my unclesam suite  truthsayer     march    isn t the first time this young man has been the target of racism  in   the then  year old sang the  star spangled banner  before game  of the nba finals and the scummiest americans reacted in the same way  they called him all sorts of names  but his response was perfect   my father was actually in the  navy for a really long time   de la cruz told san antonio fox  in an interview about the backlash   people don t know  they just assume that i m just mexican  but i m not from mexico  i m from san antonio  born and raised  a true san antonio spurs fan  fortunately  the positive comments far outweighed the negative this time around  sadly  though  he will probably always be the target of scumbags who hate him just because his skin is tanner than theirs  murica watch his democratic debate opener https   www facebook com univisionpolitica videos  featured image via video screenshot
