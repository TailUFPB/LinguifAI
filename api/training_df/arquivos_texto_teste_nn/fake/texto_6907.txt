it should be the easiest question in america to answer  especially in massachusetts  but the republican governor flubbed it and drew the ire of the audience massachusetts  new republican governor proved that he is just like every other bigoted republican in the country after he failed to throw his support behind a bill moving through the state legislature that would provide anti discrimination protection to lgbt people as governor charlie baker took questions during a corporate networking event  he was asked whether he would sign the bill into law unlike other republican governors in the south who signed laws legalizing discrimination in their states again  this is an easy question to answer  this is the united states and discrimination is not a value this nation holds of course  being a republican  baker chose to sidestep the question instead and refused to give a definitive answer  we should not discriminate against anyone here in the commonwealth of massachusetts   baker said  but then he declared that he would listen to both sides on the issue  which means he would allow bigots the chance to persuade him to enshrine bigotry in the state  likely using the guise of religious liberty as the excuse of choice that s when the audience turned on baker and began booing him and shouting him down until he left the stage and the building lorelei erisis  who attended the event  slammed baker for not distancing himself from the extremist republicans in states like north carolina and mississippi  which passed anti lgbt laws that have brought economic backlash  i mean that s not even a very brave thing to say  to say that he would sign a bill  if it came before his desk  and if he had done that  it would have given him the moderate republican image that he s trying to have   erisis said here s the video via youtube all baker had to say is that he would sign a bill protecting lgbt people from discrimination  that s it but he didn t  instead  he teeter tottered and angered the audience  and to add insult to injury  baker s office issued a statement claiming to support a  law that expanded protections but still refused to say that he would support the new bill  saying only that he would review it to be blunt  baker is a coward who had a chance to distinguish himself as a moderate republican who has no connection to the bigoted republicans who dominate his party at the moment  governor john bel edwards certainly didn t shy away when he had a chance to sign an executive order protecting lgbt people  and he s a democrat in the deep red state of louisiana and when the governor of louisiana is more courageous on the issue of lgbt rights than the governor of massachusetts  that s a sign that massachusetts voters picked the wrong candidate to lead them featured image  screenshot
