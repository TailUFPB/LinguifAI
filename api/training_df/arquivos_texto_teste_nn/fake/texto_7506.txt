nicholas ragin has spent a decade in prison because his court appointed attorney slept through his  trial  this week  his  year sentence has been thrown out by the u s   circuit court of appeals  in richmond  virginia nicholas ragin has waited a long time for justice  when he was first indicted in   like so many americans caught up in the justice system  he could not afford a lawyer to defend himself against the charges  instead  he was appointed a public defender named nikita v  mackey these were serious charges  ragin and several others stood accused to running a prostitution ring in charlotte  north carolina  it was alleged that girls as young as  were being pimped out for   a night  six women testified to being trapped in the service of ragin and his alleged accomplices  this case demonstrated how devastating prostitution  drug trafficking and gun toting can be for the charlotte community   u s  attorney gretchen shappert said in a written statement   the victims were preyed upon by individuals with no regard for their dignity  it took until  for the case to go to trial  and all four of the accused were sentence to a mandatory  year sentence with the possibility of life behind bars however  we would never know if the conviction was sound  due to the appalling behavior of ragin s court appointed attorney  judge roger gregory of the u s   circuit court of appeals has ruled that ragin s conviction for conspiracy and racketeering can be overturned  as he did not receive the defense he is due under the u s  constitution  in his written decision  the judge stated  we hold that a defendant is deprived of his sixth amendment right to counsel when counsel sleeps during a substantial portion of the defendant s trial  nicholas ragin s sixth amendment right to counsel was violated not because of specific legal errors or omissions indicating incompetence in counsel s representation but because ragin effectively had no legal assistance during a substantial portion of his trial  attorney peter adolf testified at the appeal that during ragin s trial  the judge  leaned into his microphone  because we were all sitting there and  mackey  wasn t moving and said   mr  mackey        very loudly  mackey then jumped up and sort of looked around and was licking his lips and moving his mouth and looked sort of confused and looked all over the room    despite this clear ineffective assistance of counsel  ragin s trial proceeded to conviction  without the judge or any other authority stepping in to uphold due process what s worse  is that mackey has form  according to the new york daily news he resigned from charlotte police department after  years as a cop when facing accusations that he falsified time sheets remarkably  four years later mackey was elected as sheriff for the same police department  but the state quickly overturned it after a local news investigation uncovered questionable voting tactics mackey has bungled other legal cases  too  like when he failed to appear in court for two separate trials in  and  and once caused a client s adoption to fall through because he failed to communicate with them about the legal process his job performance shortcomings aside  he was elected in  as a north carolina state representative and served two years in office in   the north carolina bar suspended his license for three years for failing to pay taxes  despite his linkedin page saying he is a tax attorney and so  ragin s conviction has been overturned  either an innocent man has spent  years in jail for a crime he did not commit  or a guilty man has been freed  either way  the justice system has failed  catastrophically  and not just this once as john oliver highlighted during a  episode of  last week tonight   even a gifted and determined public defender is unlikely to be able to offer up any kind of decent defense due to the hideous working conditions placed upon them  many are being loaded up with   cases per year   that s three cases per day  with caseloads that heavy  public defenders cannot possibly prepare an effective defense   oliver said  a study in new orleans  a few years back  found the city had some part time defenders who could only spend an average of seven minutes per case  and that is not long enough to prepare anything  if i only had seven minutes to prepare this show  i would definitely not be talking about public defenders right now  i d be desperately trying to fill time right now by listing the muppets in order of f ckability  those familiar with the adnan syed case made famous by serial and later  the undisclosed podcast  will be familiar with the issues around ineffective assistance of counsel  and the devastating impact it can have on whole communities  syed has spent  years in jail for the  murder of his ex girlfriend hae min lee  in a case founded on so many inaccuracies and prejudices that it simply beggars belief that he was in jail longer than a day the issue of whether we think a person is innocent or guilty of the crime is secondary to the issue of our justice system failing to deliver effective trials  particularly to people who cannot afford to pay for their own defense  without that guarantee  we do not have a justice system  we have a justice system for the rich  where the accused is presumed innocent until or unless they are found guilty  for everyone else  we have plea bargaining system   where guilt is presumed  and it is simply a matter of negotiating the penalty  not only does this strip people of their freedom  but in many states  their right to vote while this situation is allowed to continue  the u s  justice system will continue to lag behind the rest of the developed world   and americans will continue to be denied justice featured image
