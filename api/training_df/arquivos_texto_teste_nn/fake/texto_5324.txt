cnn s supposed law enforcement expert  harry houck  is promoting a new video with what he no doubt thinks is an absolutely brilliant message  he wants president obama to solve violence  and he even has a suggestion for how best to do it  there is a video floating around social media that calls on obama to  ban niggas  not guns   in order to stop escalating violence in america s cities  to a racist like houck  this makes perfect sense he posted a link to the video on his twitter account  and said  he knows what he s talking about  because the man who made the video  tommy sotomayor  is black  and therefore that makes this okay  watch the video in all its racist  bigoted glory below the video appeared on a facebook page called  uncle sam s misguided children  about a week ago  but houck seems to have just now noticed it  and it s awful message resonated with him  because of course  one only needs to look at his twitter feed to see how racist he is  he s called for donald trump  jr   to be the new mayor of new york city  and he s screamed   death to political correctness   there when he hears the word   racism  he also uses his spot on cnn to say that black people are more predisposed to committing crimes  and that black victims of police brutality have nobody to blame but themselves for it  those who survive  anyway   he said that on cnn just two weeks ago  in fact  which threw cnn s panel at the time into an uproar he s even tweeted a link to a white supremacist website  yes  houck is clearly a wonderful law enforcement expert who should definitely be taken seriously  not  in truth  he needs to be removed from the air for promoting racial hatred featured image via screen capture
