justin timberlake gave a speech at the  iheartradio music awards sunday night  and he took a few shots and made a couple of jokes about republican frontrunner donald trump  in a speech dedicated to taylor swift who won the best tour award  timberlake said that swift breaks down walls and others build them in a clear  reference to donald trump  timberlake said   some people are out here to build walls  we ain t naming no names   that was a political joke   the crowd then broke into laughter  he then told the largely underage audience   shut up  you can t even vote   taylor chooses to knock down walls and invites everyone to be on her   squad   timberlake continued one would have to ask the question of why this would even be a story  however  timberlake clearly realizes that he has a very important and rare platform  he s someone who has the potential to both reach and influence tens of millions of people  many of whom both idolize him and at the same time can vote his words have the potential to resonate to many out there to go out and vote and make the right choice when voting  that  choice is clearly not donald trump or ted cruz watch video here https   youtu be  featured image via video screenshot
