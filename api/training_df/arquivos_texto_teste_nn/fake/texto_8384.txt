it hasn t been a very good time for ben carson s campaign to become america s first black republican president  but his very public meltdown after getting trashed in iowa might suggest that he has no place anywhere near the red button anyway carson crashed badly in iowa  picking up just   of the vote  leaving him in fourth place behind ted cruz      donald trump     and marco rubio      his explanation  according to carson  it s all a big conspiracy to keep him out of the race for president  he told supporters in a speech which felt rather more like a public nervous breakdown  i was reasonably happy today until i discovered the dirty tricks that were going on  and people spreading rumors that i had dropped out and that people should caucus for somebody else   he continued   i mean  do you think that that is something that s acceptable  apparently  carson is arguing that people didn t vote for him because ted cruz told them not to the candidate insisted his campaign was not over  and yet boarded an early flight home to florida for  rest    meanwhile  the other candidates headed straight to new hampshire or south carolina to battle the next stage of the primaries so while his opponents were off developing their strategy for the next battleground states  carson decided to write an email to his supporters  and continue his meltdown in public  for months  my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to to detest the games of the political class  but in reality are masters at it   he wrote  even tonight  my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting  texting and telling precinct captains to announce that i had suspended my campaign   in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes  what is considerably more certain than this conspiracy theory  is that mr  carson will be making that exiting from the race announcement soon  hopefully with a little more grace than he could muster in iowa   featured image via screen capture
