ted cruz has been on the warpath recently after republican front runner donald trump made several sexist comments about this wife  however  his tough guy act was tempered by the fact that his loyalty to the republican party meant that he would not refuse to vote for trump if it came down to it  instead  when asked point blank by a reporter whether he would support trump as nominee  cruz fumbled for an answer and quickly became a laughingstock in the days since  cruz seems to have found a spine  and signaled that he would finally be ready to never vote for trump  even if he wins the nomination  i don t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family   cruz told reporters at a news conference at the event  cruz also addressed rumors that he had had affairs with as many as five women by pinning the attacks on trump  we have done nothing to his family  and we will not  but donald was unhappy with the news of the day  unhappy with losing elections  was unhappy with his dangerous ignorance of foreign policy being revealed on the world stage  so he decided to engage in a personal attack directed at my wife   cruz saidbut cruz had to ruin what could have been a moment that showed he had a bit of integrity by immediately making a bizarre bestiality joke directed at trump that was just plain creepy  another in a long line of examples of how something just seems  off  with cruz  trump may be a rat  but i have no desire to copulate with him  and this garbage does not belong in politics  uh  what cruz had perhaps wanted to politely suggest that trump was a  ratf cker   classy   but instead wound up seeming to suggest that he himself likes having sex with rats  just not rats named trump it was decidedly one of the lowest points in a presidential race that has featured more than its fair share of rock bottoms  neither trump nor cruz seem to have any problem lying  cheating  or stealing their way to victory  as the two grow closer in the polls  the vicious attacks have become more personal and more ugly  it seems impossible to imagine a scenario where republicans find a way to come together after this  their two top prospects have run scorched earth campaigns against each others families and friends  the resentment will likely glow red hot for years featured image via ethan miller getty images
