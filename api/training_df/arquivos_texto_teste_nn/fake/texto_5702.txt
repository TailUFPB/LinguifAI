as much as you may want sarah palin to drift off into obscurity  you know you can t get enough of her crazy  it s always entertaining  because you really don t know what she s going to say or do next  then  when she partnered up with trump for his campaign  it was a comedic writer s dream come true  it really doesn t get much better than that in regards to a tag team of lunacy not to disappoint  palin took to the politicon stage in pasadena  ca  to promote trump with what we can only assume are sentences in her own mind  however  she is saying words  so  here a few of them  they whispered that they re going to throw in for hillary against the will of the people in their own primary  and this exposed the establishment s con game  more people learn it doesn t matter to the beltway bubble boys and girls which side wins elections  as long as they get to keep their titles and their ratings and their power and their purses full  they win  we lose  bubble boys    kinky palin keeps going with this  establishment  phrase  because you know  it was probably on her  word a day  toilet paper  she said  the establishment  those profiles in pudding  they bent over for all those things  and now they fret about ideological  lily white purity  i ll let you read that again to really soak that in profiles in pudding    bent over    lily white  yeah  she just said all those things in one sentence then  while trying to say that even many republicans are starting to back hillary clinton  she said  they re not all thumbsuckers  they re not all bad   i m kidding   they are  hillary thanks them  because she knows she can t win without them  actually  palin  she can win without them  but seeing them embrace sanity over crazy is something to admire she then rambles on a bit  then offers us this gem about trump relating to americans  he gratefully shakes skilled  calloused hands and tugs tight the blue collar  and he salutes in awe of sacrifice  the american in uniform  it s connection through appreciation  and i do wish you all could know him on that personal level  palin apparently forgets that he recently threw our military under the bus  claimed to raise funds for them  but didn t  and also got five deferments of his own so he didn t have to serve  he also wouldn t know a hard days work if it was in front of his face and wouldn t know calloused hands if they were the ones stroking his ever ginormous ego  he s an absolute fraud but palin being palin  she ignores facts and reality and continues to say words in no particular order watch palin speak here featured image via video screen capture
