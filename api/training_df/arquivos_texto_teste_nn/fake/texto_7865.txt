you d think that in the year   companies would no longer be bullied by those who advocate for fewer rights for women  but to the contrary  lands  end has just proved that simply not to be the case the company recently featured legendary women s rights advocate and feminist gloria steinem in their catalog and on their website for their  legend series  featuring individuals who have made a difference in both their respective industries and the world at large   however  many anti choice advocates were not amused by lands  end promoting someone who pushes for women to have control over their own bodies  they were  quite literally  bullied into ending their relationship with steinem one pro lifer commented on the lands  end facebook page  those of us who love family  love children  are completely puzzled why you would promote a very vocal pro abortion celebrity  is this who you are landsend  are you anti child  you want to kill off possible future customers  is this your message to those of us who give their very lives to feed  love and clothe our children  some of these children who also live with special needs  clearly not  and whoa  what a devious guilt trip  but upon their threat of boycott and shipping everything lands  end back  the company took no chances and succumbed to the harassment and gave in to the bullying  apparently  a catholic school also threatened to end their relationship with the company as their uniform supplier as well here s lands  end official statement  we understand that some of our customers were offended by the inclusion of an interview in a recent catalog with gloria steinem on her quest for women s equality  we thought it was a good idea and we heard from our customers that  for different reasons  it wasn t  for that  we sincerely apologize  our goal was to feature individuals with different interests and backgrounds that have made a difference for our new legends series  not to take any political or religious stance  they literally just said  we thought it was a good idea  to feature someone who stood for women s equality  but it wasn t  and we apologize way to stand with women  lands  end  sure  you may have lost a few religious zealots  but you could have gained a hell of a lot more back in those who admire your courage to uphold a woman s right over her own body and be equal amongst her peers in society here s the thing   lands  end is still going to lose customers  but this time from people who stand with women s rights  which is the majority of america featured image via flickr
