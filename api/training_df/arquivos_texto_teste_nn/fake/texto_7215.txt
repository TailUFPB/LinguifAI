once again  republican front runner donald trump resorted to acting like a moody  year old by threatening not to take part in cnn s republican town hall scheduled for tuesday night  having seen trump engage in this childish behavior more than once before  rival candidate ted cruz trolled the business mogul relentlessly  explaining that our friend donald finds debates very  very stressful  they make his hair stand on end  it all started on tuesday morning  when trump tweeted out a whiny message to his followers that suggested he might skip the town hall because cnn had treated him unfairly by not given him enough airtime and supposedly favored his opponents by giving them more interviews twittersure enough  this tweet only got the spotlight for two hours   because soon word of trump campaign manager corey lewandowski s arrest for assaulting a female reporter would make headlines and overshadow trump s complaints according to an analysis done by realclearpolitics  both cruz and trump are tied in milwaukee  wisconsin  where the town hall is being held  cruz was clearly up for the challenge when he said that  it s neck and neck  donald trump and i are effectively tied in the state of wisconsin  that means   any candidate running for president owes it to come in front of the state and actually debate  cruz insisted that wisconsin residents deserved to see a debate between the two candidates but that he was unsure it would take place  still  the texas senator continued to challenge trump to a one on one standoff  we re in the same location  they got the tv cameras  they got the moderators   the one thing they re missing is the donald  donald prefers to communicate in  characters or less  cruz s renewed vigor comes just after having received an endorsement from former presidential hopeful gov  scott walker  r   who said cruz was a principled constitutional conservative who can win  featured image via getty images   george frey
