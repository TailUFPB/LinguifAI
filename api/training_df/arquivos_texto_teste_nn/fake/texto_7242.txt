in an article aptly titled   why some republicans are feeling shame   the washington post s sean sullivan describes a party sinking into despair at the ridiculous spectacle of donald trump bickering with ted cruz  gimenez is watching with disgust  as are many republicans across the country  as his party s presidential race turns into a tabloid talk show  after a winter that featured anatomical insults  violent clashes at rallies  and fierce accusations of lying and dirty tricks  republicans say the past week has been particularly dispiriting under normal circumstances  i would be cringing right along with them  in decades past  any presidential candidate that acted with such reckless disregard for civility would be shamed out of the public square  even karl rove  the scummiest political operative in washington d c   always did his smears from a distance by using proxies that could not be directly linked to the republican candidate those days are long gone as the two frontrunners really are just one thrown chair and a paternity test away from turning the republican primaries into a full blown jerry springer episode the luridness has weighed not only on republican elected officials but on voters as well  in a recent cbs news new york times poll   percent of republican primary voters said the campaign has made them mostly embarrassed for the party rather than mostly proud  the survey was conducted before the cruz trump fight involving their spouses erupted i imagine that number is closer to   by now and instead of cringing along with republican voters  i can only point my finger and laugh  a lot by the way  that was   of republican primary voters  the most faithful of the faithful  how do you think republican moderates view the whole thing  independents  democrats  yeah  when trump wins the nomination  he s going to be utterly crushed in the general election no matter who the democratic nominee is  how can i not laugh it s even funnier to point out   you built that   and they did  so very very much  they fully embraced the incoherent rage and hate of the tea party because it won them elections  it didn t matter that your average tea partier was completely detached from reality and common decency as long as they voted republican  attacked obama and did it loudly  the conservative movement let the fringe take over because it was easier than admitting that the bush years were a total disaster of their own making and so the tea party dragged the level of discourse into the mud and buried it  they set the bar so low that it s now allowed donald trump to run the kind of campaign that used to be unthinkable  filled with vulgarity  violence and idiocy that is an international embarrassment  even worse  the democratic primary has been a model of civility between the candidates  if not their followers   it s like watching a family with two well behaved children and then looking down at your two screaming neurotypical brats throwing temper tantrums  you want to be mad at that other family but all you feel is a burning shame that you failed as a parent somehow  featured image via getty images
