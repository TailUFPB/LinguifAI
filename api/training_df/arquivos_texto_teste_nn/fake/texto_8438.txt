rick santorum has been whining about not getting attention from the media  so bill o reilly hilarious broke the news to the conservative extremist candidate that nobody cares about him anymore earlier this week  santorum accused the media of  predetermining  the presidential race before iowans vote  santorum then complained about never being invited on fox news to be interviewed by megyn kelly or bill o reilly despite announcing his campaign last may as you ll recall  santorum ran for president in  and nearly captured the republican nomination  which is in stark contrast to  as his latest campaign is nothing short of an absolute joke  santorum has been unable to climb out of the low single digits in the polls  even though he has name recognition and conservative voters surely remember who he is but clearly  things have changed in four years and santorum is no longer the golden boy of the conservative movement  that mantle is now owned by donald trump and to a lesser extent  ted cruz  a fact which o reilly broke down for santorum in simple words so he could understand  i feel rick santorum s pain   o reilly said  he is absolutely correct  we have not had him on the factor  but there is a reason for that  we re not in the campaigning business  we do not put politicians on the air simply to spout their slogans  that s what ads are for  we cover the news and when a politician is in the news then they get on the program  that s why donald trump gets so much air time  he s dominating the news cycle by injecting controversy into the political arena  then o reilly dropped the hammer on santorum and his remaining hopes to revive his struggling campaign  honestly  we looked for a reason to put santorum on  but we couldn t find any  his poll numbers are very low  his campaign strategy is what it was four years ago  there s simply nothing new  here s the video via youtube poor rick santorum  he ll just have settle for being number one on google for all the wrong reasons featured image via wikimedia
