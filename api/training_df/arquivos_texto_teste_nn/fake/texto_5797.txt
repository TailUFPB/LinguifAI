just a week after the horrific shooting in orlando  florida that killed  people in a gay nightclub  the senate finally took up a vote on gun violence  actually  this happens after every major mass shooting  and like with every major mass shooting  the nra won four bills have gone down in a predictable and fiery death the first bill was proposed by republican senator chuck grassley  iowa  and democrats voted against it because it didn t go far enough and because it could actually put more guns into the wrong people s hands democrats opposed the legislation because it does not expand the types of gun sales that require background checks  and they said some provisions could make it easier for mentally ill individuals to buy guns source  usa todayonly  senators voted for the bill  and while that may have been enough in another time  today  nothing passes the senate without a filibuster proof majority of  votes the second bill to go down was proposed by senator dianne feinstein  d california   it would have allowed the justice department to stop people who are on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns  this one is also backed by president obama minority leader harry reid  d nev   called the republican measures  political stunts  and said they are  meaningless in doing something to stop gun violence  these are amendments to divert attention from real legislation   reid said   why  so republicans  can  say  hey  look  we tried   and all the time their cheerleaders  their bosses at the nra  are cheering  the third bill  which also went down in a blaze of glory  is an amendment by senator chris murphy  d connecticut   who wants to close the  gun show loophole  and require everyone who wants to buy a gun to go through a background check the fourth bill was written by senator john cornyn  r texas  and would give a three day waiting period for people who have been investigated for terrorism within the last five years  of course  with no funding for background checks  nothing could go wrong  right this is a dance the senate that happens after every mass shooting  and the result is always the same gridlock  all the bills were defeated along party lines  this  despite the fact that the majority of their constituents want stricter gun control featured image via getty images
