after yet two more instances of unwarranted police brutality against black men who were simply existing  the nation has once again become divided between those who seek to value life and want to see these senseless killings stop  and those who seek to demonize the recently departed  putting the deceased on trial rather than their murderers one person who seems to understand the full scope and recklessness of these deaths and unjust killings is president obama  he just released his remarks after the recent killings of alton sterling in baton rouge  la  and philando castile of falcon heights  mn here is president obama s statement in full  all americans should be deeply troubled by the fatal shootings of alton sterling in baton rouge  louisiana and philando castile in falcon heights  minnesota  we ve seen such tragedies far too many times  and our hearts go out to the families and communities who ve suffered such a painful loss although i am constrained in commenting on the particular facts of these cases  i am encouraged that the u s  department of justice has opened a civil rights investigation in baton rouge  and i have full confidence in their professionalism and their ability to conduct a thoughtful  thorough  and fair inquiry but regardless of the outcome of such investigations  what s clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents  they are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system  the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year  and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve to admit we ve got a serious problem in no way contradicts our respect and appreciation for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day  it is to say that  as a nation  we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement that s why  two years ago  i set up a task force on  century policing that convened police officers  community leaders  and activists  together  they came up with detailed recommendations on how to improve community policing  so even as officials continue to look into this week s tragic shootings  we also need communities to address the underlying fissures that lead to these incidents  and to implement those ideas that can make a difference  that s how we ll keep our communities safe  and that s how we can start restoring confidence that all people in this great nation are equal before the law in the meantime  all americans should recognize the anger  frustration  and grief that so many americans are feeling   feelings that are being expressed in peaceful protests and vigils  michelle and i share those feelings  rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing  let s reflect on what we can do better  let s come together as a nation  and keep faith with one another  in order to ensure a future where all of our children know that their lives matter  thank you  mr  president  your compassion of life and love for all will be a legacy we all shall remember well past your time in office  you are a man of  by and for the people  and it shows each and every day featured photo by spencer platt getty images
