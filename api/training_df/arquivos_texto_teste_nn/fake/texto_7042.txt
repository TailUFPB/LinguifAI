when mississippi republicans passed a discriminatory anti lgbt law  the last thing they expected was backlash from christians but that s exactly what is happening house bill  or the  protecting freedom of conscience from government discrimination act   as republicans have named it  allows open discrimination by people who claim to have sincerely held religious beliefs against the lgbt community according to abc news  the new law does allows the following   decline to  solemnize any marriage  or provide wedding related services based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions  those services run a full gamut  from wedding planning  photography  disc jockey services and floral arrangements to cakes  venues and limos   decide  whether or not to hire  terminate or discipline an individual whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent  with their beliefs or moral convictions   decide to whom they will sell or rent housing they control based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions   adoptive or foster parents can raise a child they ve been granted custody of by the state with the same beliefs and convictions of those protected by the law   medical and therapy professionals can decline  treatments  counseling  or surgeries related to sex reassignment or gender identity transitioning  and  psychological  counseling  or fertility services  to people whose lifestyles violate their religious beliefs   people can create  sex specific standards or policies concerning employee or student dress or grooming  or concerning access to restrooms  spas  baths  showers  dressing rooms  locker rooms or other intimate facilities or settings   state employees and those acting on behalf of the state may recuse themselves from authorizing or licensing legal marriages  although they may not stand in the way of others doing so in short  religious bigots can hide behind their bibles and exercise their hatred by denying services to lgbt people or anyone else whom they disagree with  even couples who have pre marital sex and interracial couples the law has been roundly condemned across the state and the nation ever since governor phil bryant signed it  with area businesses and national corporations voicing overwhelming opposition and at least one christian business owner is adding to the backlash mitchell moore is a republican who owns campbell s bakery located in the state capital of jackson  mississippi  and during an interview with npr  moore ripped gop lawmakers a new one for passing a stupid law that has nothing to do with christian values  i am here to bake cakes and to sell those cakes   moore declared   i m not here to decide arbitrarily who deserves my cake and who doesn t  that s not what i do  that s not my job  moore then went on to lambaste republicans for focusing on a non existent problem while ignoring the real problems mississippi faces  so leaving aside the stupidity of passing it because it decriminalizes discrimination   which  that really is kind of the biggest issue   but i can actually say i think the law of unintended consequences is going to come back to bite the people who signed this bill  if it is my sincerely held religious belief that i shouldn t serve them  then i can do that  and i can hide behind that language  but that language is so vague it opens a pandora s box  and you can t shut it again  there is no sincerely held religious belief to think that i am better than other people   to think that my sin is different than other people  and so i am a deeply christian man  and those go counter to my belief system the assumption that they think that they re looking out for us   that s not what they are doing  we rank number one   our state government is the most dependent on federal money  we are the third most obese state  we rank at the bottom in unemployment  in education  we ve got crumbling infrastructure  none of them are being tackled  instead  we are passing  hey let s discriminate bills  here s the audio via npr republicans in mississippi are seriously in trouble if even christians are pissed off at them for passing this law  which by the way  could not only cost the state millions of dollars in business  it could cost them them millions in federal tax dollars not to mention the millions of dollars the state will have to use when the lawsuits begin to be filed  so just like in north carolina  republicans in mississippi have chosen to make their state an even crappier place to live by shoving christian sharia law down everyone s throats featured image  wikimedia
