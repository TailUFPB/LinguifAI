pope francis was asked about donald trump  and the famously compassionate religious leader could only barely hold back his disgust currently  francis is finishing up an historic visit to mexico  needless to say  the issue of donald trump inevitably came up  when a reporter asked the pope to weigh in on trump s potential candidacy  he unloaded on the republican front runner  a person who thinks only about building walls  wherever they may be  and not building bridges  is not christian  this is not in the gospel  as far as what you said about whether i would advise to vote or not to vote  i am not going to get involved in that  i say only that this man is not christian if he said things like that  we must see if he said things in that way and in this i give the benefit of the doubt  consider the benefit of the doubt put to rest  trump has spent the last seven months campaigning heavily on the idea that he can block both hispanics and muslims from ever coming to the united states  his policies  such that they are  have been organized around attacking minority groups and advocating for the return of torture  at his essence  trump s campaign is the exact opposite of pope francis  message of tolerance and compassion trump holds the distinction of having both pissed off the pope and also the entire country of mexico  he infamously criticized the catholic leader by dismissing him as just  a politician   francis didn t seem to mind  and in fact turned the tables on the attempted dig  thank god he said i was a politician  because aristotle defined the human person as  animal politicus   so at least i am a human person  as to whether i am a pawn   well  maybe  i don t know  i ll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people  trump is also deeply unpopular in mexico following his repeated attacks against the mexican people  he kicked off his presidential campaign by claiming the mexican government was sending rapists across the border to sell drugs and attack american women  he s never walked back those ideas  he also claimed he would build a massive concrete wall across the entire southern border   at a cost estimated to be in the billions   and get mexico to pay for it the pope s criticisms of trump come at a time when the candidate is desperately trying to prove that he is a very good christian   with humiliating results  trump  who once told shock jock howard stern that having unprotected sex with as many women as he had was his personal  vietnam   hasn t fooled very many people with this false change of heart it takes a whole lot to get the pope to spend time taking you down a peg  trump  for all of his hate speech and vile ideas  falls into that rare category of absolutely deserving it featured image via flickr flickr
