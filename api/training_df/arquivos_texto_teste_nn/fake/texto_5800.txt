a racist trump supporter who couldn t hack it as a police officer is calling for right wing militia members  former police officers  and military veterans to grab their guns and come to cleveland to shoot any black people they find protesting at the republican national convention in cleveland next month  i am encouraging patriots and trump supporters and those that support liberty and freedom to come lawfully armed with lethal and non lethal weaponry   jim stachowiak declared in a video directed at  lone wolf patriots  stachowiak was booted out of the police force for misconduct after only three years on the job  yet he thinks he is capable of patrolling the outside of the gop convention as a pretend law enforcement official after slandering the black lives matter movement by claiming that the group has issued death threats aimed at donald trump  stachowiak called for armed volunteers to join him at the convention to intimidate and even kill black protesters they have threatened to cause riots in cleveland and nationwide   he said   it is our sworn duty and obligation for all those like me and many of you who have taken the oath to defend this country against all enemies foreign and domestic  then he repeated donald trump s suggestion that president obama is a terrorist sympathizer and urged  patriots  to use their second amendment against black lives matter members  whom he also referred to as domestic terrorists  we should answer the call with our second amendment  yes  i m encouraging patriots to come prepared to defend this nation against a domestic terrorist organization supported by the terrorist in the white house  obama come prepared  because this may spark another revolution  it won t be decided if that spark turns into a bonfire by we who love liberty  for we will defend  not attack  we won t act  but we will react  here s the video via youtube stachowiak is nothing more than a right wing terrorist trying to organize another bundy style standoff that he hopes will turn into some kind of bloody revolution  gun nuts like him are the reason why we need serious gun restrictions in this country  if anybody shouldn t be allowed to have a gun it s this guy  he is literally calling for gun violence against back protesters who show up to the gop convention  hopefully  the fbi has seen this video and are planning to take stachowiak into custody before we end up with another mass shooting featured image via screenshot
