sarah palin is having a rough day  it began with an awkward interview with nbc s today show when palin fumbled and gibberished her way through a softball question about whether she really blamed barack obama for her son track s ptsd  she clearly did  and then  during her introduction of donald trump during an iowa rally on monday  she attacked a longtime ally  iowa congressman steve king  and accused the far right member of the house crazy caucus of huffing ethanol from tpm  it s dirty business but why would a conservative guy want to say something that he knows isn t true   palin asked the crowd   maybe he s forgotten some of his heart in the heartland  maybe he s been hanging out in a corn field too long huffing ethanol  steve king endorsed ted cruz and  during an appearance on msnbc  king accused trump of buying off palin in exchange for his  assets  and  resources  a few things here   the first rule of conservatism remains  don t try to be funny  it never works   you might recall how palin expressed admiration for king during her infamous off prompter speech in which she inexplicably blurted   steve very strong  he goin  rogue    if anyone knows the impact of huffing fumes  it s palin  in fact  she might ve been high or drunk during her trump introduction today   like always   i wonder how iowa residents feel about palin insulting their famous congressman  while also insulting ethanol as being nothing more than something one can  huff    it s worth repeating  stop trying to be funny  conservatives   now  ted cruz  ted cruz might actually be more tolerable if he huffed something  anything   palin thinks it s smart politics to emphasize the notion that huffing ethanol can get you really  really high  i m sure the children of iowa republican caucus goers will thank her for it  featured image via video screen grab
