bristol palin has shown yet again not only how incredibly dense she is  but just how her children could suffer from her ineptitude as a parent and reasonable human being  her latest patheos blog post talks about just how lucky her son is to have grown up around guns because of an asinine gun control experiment out of texas specifically aimed at gun sales to families  it s actually quite sickening in the video  children are left into a room full of toys  among which is hidden an unloaded handgun  within  seconds a child finds the gun and begins treating it like any of the other toys in the room  parents stand horrified as their children  cast into an unsupervised play environment  take the gun and point it at each other  in the end  a police officer helping conduct this bogus  experiment  points out that the children playing with the gun come from a home with no guns  where the two children who wouldn t touch the gun come from homes where guns are available and talked about that s what bristol palin decides to jump on  finally  someone is calling her a good parent  which is  of course  ludicrous  but she seems to be comfortable with it  she wrote  only the children whose homes had exposed them to guns knew not to touch the dangerous toy  as other children ran around pointing it at each other  two stood back because their parents understood the importance of teaching and appropriate exposure parents assume their child will automatically know what is and is not dangerous  the danger is not guns themselves  but a lack of education so thankful tripp is around guns and knows how to act around them  the danger is not the gun itself but a lack of education  what a crock of doody  this is america  bristol  the bulk of guns owned by civilians are because of a lack of education  people believe guns make them safer  that they can thwart crimes and that they are somehow more patriotic for having one  the reality is far simpler  if there were fewer guns  fewer people would get shot the entire scenario is designed to portray people who don t own guns as bad parents  because their children have no experience with guns  the two kinds of parents portrayed get the exact result you may expect  but palin  as dense as she is  takes the lesson to the stupid place  arguing that only children who have been exposed to guns have a chance of growing up safe in america the two types of parents not included that would round out this experiment would be the idiots who think kids don t need to learn about gun safety as long as you leave the safety on and parents who refuse to have guns in their home and add the benefit of educating their children why they are so dangerous  those parents aren t needed to prove to someone as ill prepared for parenthood as bristol palin that there may be more to this experiment  the notion that raising your children around guns makes them safer would be much more believable if we didn t have to read about yet another toddler killing his sister or a little guy pulling a gun from the glove compartment and shooting grandpa  if there were no two year olds pulling pistols from their mothers  purse and shooting them in walmart it may be easier to swallow what may be a better gauge of how safe non gun homes are as opposed to homes with guns would be to count the accidental firearm deaths from each  i can guarantee you that my children will never grab a loaded weapon from anywhere in my house and pull the trigger  i can also guarantee that they have seen and been taught exactly how dangerous guns are and wouldn t touch one for any reason in somebody else s home  either it s all well and good to use these parents who probably haven t considered that their kids may run into guns at their friends  houses as bad examples  but in the end  they go home to a house with no guns  to playrooms where no guns will be hidden  those  responsible  children  they may not have touched the gun but they are the only ones with true access  to think that is in any way good parenting is mind boggling here s the full seven minute experiment kwwl   eastern iowa breaking news  weather  closingsfeatured image from gage skidmore
