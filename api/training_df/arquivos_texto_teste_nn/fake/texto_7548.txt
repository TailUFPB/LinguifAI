there s a disturbing trend happening in democratic circles this primary season that  if left to fester  could spell absolute disaster for the party and our country come november  as bill maher pointed out friday night on real time  there are a growing number of bernie sanders supporters joining a movement called  bernieorbust who have vowed to stay home in november if hillary clinton is the nominee this is  of course  the single dumbest thing anyone looking to improve our country s already improving socioeconomic landscape could possibly do  regardless of your feelings about hillary clinton s platform  record or ties to big business  the alternative is complete disaster  by removing support for your party s candidate you are effectively handing the white house to the republicans  that socioeconomic progress i mentioned  kiss it goodbye the country will be thrust right back into economic crisis as regulations disappear  the already established nuclear deal with iran will be tossed aside and the precision targeting strategy against isis will be scrapped in favor of all out  boots on the ground war in the middle east  the judicial branch of our government will see at least one and probably at least three new ultra conservative justices  giving free reign to bigotry in this country under the guise of  religious liberty   gay marriage will be a thing of the past  voter suppression and gerrymandering will run rampant  making it nearly impossible for logic and reason to ever take hold in our country again  roe v wade could very well be overturned  and citizens united will not only be cemented in but built upon  taking the power of the people and handing it to the highest bidder all of that because bernie supporters don t like hillary clinton  it s ridiculous  maher is himself a huge bernie supporter  having publicly endorsed him and shown great enthusiasm about the direction he wants to take the country  but as he points out  if hillary clinton is the nominee  it would be incredibly stupid for anyone calling themselves a liberal or progressive to hand the election to a republican  none of whom amount to half the person hillary or bernie are bernie sanders is a great man who would do great things for this country if elected president  hillary clinton is a great woman who would do great things for this country if elected president  donald trump  ted cruz and marco rubio are all fringe right lunatics who would destroy this country for the good of the one percent  period if your heart tells you that the only option is bernie or a republican  you truly need to have your head examined  bill maher agrees  watch his brilliant breakdown of this incredibly dangerous movement below featured image from screen capture
