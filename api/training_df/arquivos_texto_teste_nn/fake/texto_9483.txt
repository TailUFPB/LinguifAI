the drexel university professor who tweeted  all i want for christmas is white genocide  recently blamed  whiteness  for the texas massacre that killed  people  the outward hate for  whiteness  coming from this so called professor is disturbing  it s no secret that he detests anyone white and wants to especially demonize white men  disgusting george ciccariello maher  who is currently in exile from drexel s campus and is only teaching online classes  argued in a democracy now  interview monday that  whiteness  and white  entitlement  is the motivating factor behind mass shootings although he noted that mental illness is a factor  ciccariello maher argued that  we can t lose sight of these broader questions   asking  what is happening with regard to not only white people  but white men  in particular  ciccariello maher argued that there is an  institutional apparatus  that trains white men  in violence and that encourages them to feel as though they re on the losing side of history   adding that many white males feel like  victims  of society when white men feel like victims  he contended  they lash out  you know  trump makes hay out of the fact that white men  in particular  feel as though they re the victims of this society  despite being in absolute control of it   he said at the end of a lengthy statement regarding the texas church shooting   and this is something that is powerfully dangerous  and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attacks  more generally  and the rise of far right movements  but we re certainly seeing  you know  clearly  sort of some very serious incidents of mass violence  as well  transcript from interview amy goodman  but i wanted to bring george ciccariello maher into this conversation  of drexel university  you have been you wrote immediately after the las vegas massacre  where the  year old white man named paddock had opened fire on concertgoers below  killing  of them  after you wrote  you were banned from the drexel campus  after questioning why mass shootings in the united states are almost always carried out by white men  is that right george ciccariello maher  yes  and to be clear  when i began to write about what had happened in las vegas  i was really writing about this broad question  right  and i think this is a question that we all need to grapple with  when you see these cases of sort of mass this shocking mass brutality  what is it that makes white men so prone to this kind of behavior  and what might be going on today in our country  in which people are stoking a sort of victim complex among white men  you know  what might be happening today to encourage this kind of behavior and to radicalize these kind of actions and i was immediately subject to a torrent of sort of abuse and threats from  you know  right wing media outlets  and  you know  we re talking about breitbart  the daily caller and these kind of websites  and it was on the basis of those  and the purported threats that they represented  that i was excluded from campus  my classes were initially canceled  despite the fact that in my classes we had had conversations about this  despite the fact that my students are very knowledgeable and intuitively grasp what is going on in the world around them  and were open to having conversations about these difficult things amy goodman  so  your response to what happened on sunday george ciccariello maher  i mean  i think we re seeing these kinds of atrocities occurring  and we need to be really asking not only  what can we do   i think these are important questions what kind of immediate institutional reforms  whether it s targeted you know  targeted gun control for domestic violence might be effective  but we also can t lose sight of these broader questions  and ask   what is going on in our society today  what is happening with regard to not only white people  but white men  in particular  what is going on with regard to race and gender as they function together  and in this case  in particular  again  we don t know all the facts  we don t know all the details  but we re talking about institutions  that also serve as breeding grounds for violent behavior  we re talking about not only sexual assault in the military  but domestic abuse of those surrounding it and those outside of it  and we re talking about other institutions  as well  that you could bring into the picture  institutions like policing  in which domestic violence is absolutely rife and in which it s very difficult to keep weapons out of the hands of those domestic abusers and so  we need to think very deeply  i think  about the structural role of what s going in the society  trump is abroad selling weapons  and we ve got someone who  in this case  apparently  was trained  you know  trained to engage in violence abroad  and yet we act surprised when these people have breaks  when they fall into some kind of crisis  when they find maybe feelings of entitlement frustrated  that they then resort to violence  when we re talking about a structure and institutional apparatus that trains people in violence and that encourages them to feel as though they re on the losing side of history  you know  trump makes hay out of the fact that white men  in particular  feel as though they re the victims of this society  despite being in absolute control of it  and this is something that is powerfully dangerous  and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attacks  more generally  and the rise of far right movements  but we re certainly seeing  you know  clearly  sort of some very serious incidents of mass violence  as well amy goodman  you know  what s interesting  yesterday  for hour after hour  after this horror on television you know  it came out that there was this mass killing in texas  and they said the worst church massacre in u s  history  and they said the worst texas massacre no one was saying anything about the killer  hour after hour  but clearly  people had seen him  right  some had survived  people outside  the police  he was dead  whether it was self inflicted or someone shot him  they clearly knew  and they were talking about  one  the tragedy and  two  not saying anything  and it only led us to believe it must be a white man who did this  because we would have known  i think  right away if the person was a person of color or  certainly  muslim  we know that often before when it s a case where someone is a muslim or person of color  that s what they say immediately  now it was just left hanging  and so you knew that this would be the case george ciccariello maher  that s absolutely the case  i think  you know  whiteness is never seen as a cause  in and of itself  of these kinds of massacres  of other forms of violence  despite the fact that whiteness is a structure of privilege and it s a structure of power  and a structure that  when it feels threatened  you know  lashes out  and so  that s the kind of thing that we really need to think about  not only why is it and i think there s a lot of attention to the fact that we demonize often muslims or  you know  other people of color when these attacks occur  the far right  of course  jumps on any violence by people of color and yet  you know  doesn t want to talk about the real deep structures of white supremacy in our society  and again  not just the fringe  not just the nazi movements  but what people are going through every day and what it is that is driving people to these kinds of situations  where they feel so entitled to dominance that when that s questioned  they can explode in these very  very unpredictable ways amy goodman  and then george ciccariello maher   and on targets that  you know  are not you know  it s not a question of white supremacy playing a role simply because someone is targeting people of color  we re talking about people who are having  you know  mental clear mental issues  but again  the cause needs to be identified outside and beyond that  and we need to think much  much harder about what s going on in our society that makes it so sick amy goodman  and very clearly  to clarify  so what is your status now at drexel  and explain how other people have been treated in other situations  you cannot go on campus george ciccariello maher  yes  that s that is the status at this point  i m currently teaching classes online  my students are protesting and mobilizing to have me returned to campus  because there s no reason  certainly  to exclude faculty from campus for having important public conversations and for teaching about hard questions  that s what we re there to do but what you re seeing is a broad wave of aggression against faculty  you ve seen dozens of cases  whether it s  you know  tommy curry at texas a m  keeanga yamahtta taylor at princeton  johnny eric williams at trinity college  you re seeing far right websites creating  stoking outrage  attacking faculty members who dare to speak about white supremacy and racism  that s really the common thread of all these cases  is these are anti racist faculty members  usually people of color  who are targeted  who are attacked  who are threatened  and really having their lives threatened  over being willing to talk about what s going on in the country today amy goodman  well  george ciccariello maher  we want to thank you for being with us  political science professor at drexel
