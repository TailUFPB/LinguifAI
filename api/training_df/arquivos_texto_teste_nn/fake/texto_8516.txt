arguably the most popular myth in the pantheon of republican fiction is the idea that there s somehow a liberal media conspiracy to suppress conservatism and elevate liberalism  horseshit but that hasn t stopped slippery dickface ted cruz from furthering the myth whenever possible  during an interview with howard kurtz  cruz responded to a question about the candidate s base and its distrust of the  mainstream media   i especially like the part about how cruz s face scares small children  which is probably true via crooks   liars howard kurtz  when you bash the media  and you have been treated unfairly at times portrayed as somebody who scares little children  but isn t that in your interest to do that  your base loves that  they don t like the mainstream media ted cruz  there is a reason they don t like the mainstream media because they are partisan liberal democrats kurtz  every single journalist cruz  almost without exception kurtz  almost without exception cruz  almost without exception they have a partisan agenda  and we understand   let s take a substantive issue  police officers  if you have one police officer somewhere who does something he shouldn t have  the press will breathlessly report on this terrible  horrible police officer and all the democratic politicians will jump in and demonize and vilify the cops let me ask you something  how come the press doesn t tell stories of heroism the great news is we don t live anymore in a world of three networks that have a stranglehold on information  we have got the internet  we have got the drudge report  we have got talk radio  we have got social media  we ve got the ability to go directly around  and directly to the people yes  cruz believes every single journalist is a liberal with an agenda and therefore the news media is part of a liberal conspiracy  i suppose that might be true if you completely overlook the fact that the most popular cable news network in american history is decidedly conservative  or that  percent of broadcast radio is controlled by conservative screechers  or that most news media outlets are owned by conservative multinational corporations with little interest in liberal politics  or that one of those corporations  newscorp  owns literally hundreds of news media outlets around the world  even the so called  liberal  cable news network  msnbc  is anchored by a four hour morning show  hosted by a conservative republican former congressman the gop persecution complex is powerful   as powerful as toddlers who think toe monsters are living under their beds featured image via video screen grab
