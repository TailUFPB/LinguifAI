it s no doubt hillary clinton has made gun violence a cornerstone in this election  for the first time  the issue of gun violence and mass shootings are at the forefront of national presidential politics so it should only make sense that the gop s candidate and the nra s newest puppet donald trump would try to hijack that attention and sweep it under the rug after the nra gleefully endorsed the presidential blowhard  trump promised to eliminate gun free zones  while speaking at a gun free gathering  while slamming hillary clinton as  heartless  for wanting to  restrict  people s access to guns clinton didn t take to kindly to former  and brushed off the latter   speaking at a conference organized by the trayvon martin foundation  clinton said this is someone running to be president of the united states of america   a country facing a gun violence epidemic   and he s talking about more guns in our schools  he s talking about more hatred and division in our streets  that s no way to keep us safe the conference  organized by trayvon martin s mother sybrina fulton  aimed to bring together mothers who lost children to gun violence  over  individuals showed up for the conference  including fulton and queen thompson brown  whose son was killed in miami  queen  not budging to the sensationalized claims of gun grabbing  told reporters that their mission is not to take away guns  but to promote  common sense gun laws  clinton continued we have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in  if you want to imagine what trump s america will look like  picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry  picture more anger and fear saying she would not be silenced or bullied  clinton pledged to stand up to the gun lobby  specifically the nra so the american people are faced with two options  one that cow tows to the nra  even though he supported a ban on assault weapons  and one that has never waivered in her support of victims of gun violence  we have one candidate that promises gun free zones while preaching in a gun free zone  and another that sits down with mothers and fathers who have lost their children featured image via joe readle getty images
