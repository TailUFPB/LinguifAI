the same group of people who believed fox when the network was telling them president obama was a kenyan are now rushing to drain their bank accounts for lottery tickets after some characteristically stupid financial advice on fox and friends while fox was covering the record breaking    billion lottery jackpot that has the entire country seeing dollar signs  one of their resident  experts  decided he would share his winning strategy  spend all of your money on tickets to maximize your chances of winning at first blush  fox s expert  richard lustig  does sound like he knows what he s talking about  he s won the lottery seven times  at various amounts   his tips  however  are painfully bad  after saying there is no  magic wand  to help a person win the lottery  lustig says there is one exception  buy as many tickets as you can afford in case you needed a reality check  draining your bank account on the off chance that you win    billion in the powerball is not a good idea  while the large pile of cash may seem enticing  the odds that you   specifically you   will be the one who wins it are vanishingly small   the actual number is around  in  million   buying more tickets only increases your chances by a very small fraction  in all likelihood  you ll simply pay more to still lose and the powerball is this large for a reason  the lotto recently became much harder to win  this is no longer the game lustig used to play  the powerball has become a bigger mirage than ever  as thinkprogress explains in october  the consortium of states that runs powerball approved a series of rule changed thatmade it much harder to win the jackpot  under the new rules you select five of  numbers  up from five out of  numbers  the choices for the powerball was actually reduced from  to   still  this decreased the odds of winning the jackpot from  in  million to  in  million why would the powerball do this  because huge jackpots create a media frenzy that  in turns  gets more people to scramble for lottery tickets  it s a profit making scheme and it is working making matters worse for our hapless fox news viewers  bigger pots don t make it a better deal for the average lotto player  mathematicians have worked out that the pot would need to be vastly bigger  about   billion dollars  to make buying a lottery ticket even worth it statistically yikes the hysteria surrounding the massive powerball jackpot is understandable  who wouldn t want to become an overnight billionaire    but a respectable news outlet wouldn t run around telling its demonstrably gullible viewers that bankrupting themselves is the best way to become rich  fox news  yet again  proves that they are much more comfortable operating as a  hour swindle operation rather than a responsible media giant with its audience s best interests at heart feature image via media matters
