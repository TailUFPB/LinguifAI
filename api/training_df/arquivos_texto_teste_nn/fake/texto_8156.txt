progressive hero alan grayson is best known as the member of congress who has introduced more legislation than any other  he s remembered for his statements on the gop s lack of a plan for health insurance  stating  their plan is  if you get sick  you die   he s also well known for comparing the tea party to the kkk from the outside  grayson is a true american success story  born in the bronx  grayson managed to make his way through harvard law  becoming a multi millionaire as a trial lawyer  on the inside  however  some serious questions have arisen a house ethics committee investigation is underway looking into a trio of hedge funds operated by grayson that may have broken several rules for second source income  use of congressional staffers for private enterprise and misuse of government travel expenses  two of the hedge funds  that have since been closed  were located in the cayman islands  and one in the us as a united states congressman  grayson is forbidden from earning more than    from a second source  while he states he had no taxable income from the funds during his time as a congressman  which include terms from   and  to present  grayson started the funds in  while not serving  but kept them open when he won reelection for   the question of his income comes because he was still listed as a manager of the fund  which typically comes with a price tag emails from grayson s staff  as well as income disclosures  show that at least one of his staffers appeared to be employed by the fund and the congressman at the same time  though the earnings were as light as   per month  there are still clear ethics violations that have to be investigated evidence also shows that grayson has used taxpayer funds to manage the fund from abroad and possibly to solicit new investors to the fund  a charge he vehemently denies  while on a trip to tampa to present a proposal for increases to social security in august   grayson reportedly scuttled his agenda to manage the hedge fund as markets bottomed out across the globe because of turmoil in china what this all spells is big trouble for alan grayson  he s convinced that the dnc is working against him in a bid to see another democrat elected to the senate seat being vacated by marco rubio  unfortunately  the most disturbing news about grayson and his hedge fund comes from his own brochures and admissions  where he asserts that the philosophy of the fund is to invest in low cost markets where political turmoil  civil unrest  war  famine and  blood in the streets  offers unique opportunities when the area rebuilds his funds have all but failed  and his investors have all been paid back what they have lost  making him quite possibly the most decent of congressional rule breakers  but a rule breaker nonetheless
