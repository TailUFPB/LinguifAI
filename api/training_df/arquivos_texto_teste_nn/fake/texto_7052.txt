the new  ridiculous anti lgbt law that mississippi just passed and signed into law is not only discriminatory  but the opposite of freedom despite being labeled a  religious freedom  law  the only  freedom  it grants is for religious zealots to legally discriminate and fire people for being gay  as well as turn them away from their businesses  very reminiscent of jim crow era laws knowing how horrific these sort of laws are  and being on the receiving end of being fired for being gay  ellen degeneres took a moment on her show to talk about the new mississippi law  she said she s  not a political person   but stated  when i see something wrong  i have to talk about it   so she did ellen said of the law  it s the very definition of discrimination  it s also something that the supreme court already ruled on when they made marriage a right for everyone  everyone  then jokingly added  they re supreme  i mean  that s the best you can get  like the nacho supreme from taco bell  however  she took a very serious tone talking about her own experiences being discriminated against  but coming out on top in the end  if you re in mississippi or north carolina or anywhere and you re saddened by the fact that people are judging you based on who you love  don t lose hope  i was fired for being gay  and i know what it feels like  i lost everything  but look at me now  the crowd then erupts into cheers  with ellen perfectly adding  i could buy that governor s mansion  flip it  and make a   million dollar profit  but really driving home the point that what we really  truly need in this world is  less hate and more love  and she couldn t be more right thank you  ellen  you re spot on as usual  and hopefully mississippi takes notice watch the segment here  featured image via video screen capture
