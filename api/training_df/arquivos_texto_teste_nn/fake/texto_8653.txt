there are many  many things i would call senator ted cruz  but  a thinking man  would never come to mind   but apparently  that s exactly how meghan mccain during a conversation on tuesday s episode of  outnumbered on faux news  weekly standard columnist stephen hayes commented that he believes cruz is winning his battle with donald trump because the frontrunner is not a true conservative  and ted cruz looks like he just waking up to that fact after having tightly embraced donald trump   hayes said   i think that s the risk for cruz even if i agree with him on his substantive critique of trump  host andrea tantaros wondered out loud if cruz has made a mistake by not fighting harder against senator john mccain and seven other lawmakers  comprehensive immigration bill  because  you know  the party of  family values  must never  ever support a bill that would keep families together   after tantaros  musings  meghan mccain made her silly  thinking man  statement  that s red meat for conservatives in iowa   meghan mccain agreed   what i think is fascinating is donald trump was at liberty university yesterday  jerry falwell s school  very religious school obviously  he quoted corinthians wrong and now it s become this meme all over the internet  ted cruz  in many ways  is the thinking man s donald trump   she asserted   he s a religious man that i think a lot of people especially in the hardcore evangelical parts of iowa can digest as being much more religious  and i think that s going to play really well for ted cruz  what first of all  being able to quote the bible does not make him a  thinking man   it makes him a parrot  secondly  if ted cruz were a  religious man  his policies would be ones that help the poor  accept immigrants  promote peace   instead he believes in the exact opposite of all of those things meghan mccain used to make some sense when she spoke  but now it seems that the fox stupidity has seeped into her brain and made her as ignorant as everyone else on that network watch the video below featured image via video screenshot
