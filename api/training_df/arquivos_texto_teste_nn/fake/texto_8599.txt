sarah palin is an idiot  while this has been commonly accepted ever since she slinked out of her slime pit and emerged on the political scene  palin recently managed to be so utterly stupid that it prompted an official white house response  after palin s son track drunkenly beat his girlfriend and made threats with a semiautomatic weapon  caribou barbie did the only thing she knows how to do  she blamed that socialist communist muslim atheist fascist dictator barack obama sure  the half term  half wit former governor of alaska could have had a moment of self reflection  questioning her role as a parent and what she did wrong in failing to instill proper values in her precious little snowflake  she could have spoken out against domestic violence in general  and pointed out that it is an issue that faces many families  including hers  she could have said nothing at all  instead  she told a crowd at a donald trump rally that obama gave her son ptsd when he served in iraq for a single year under bush  and blamed track s violent tendencies the president s blatant attempt to deprive veterans of medical and psychological treatment  failing to mention that  it was actually republicans who slashed the budget for veterans  care   i can talk personally about this  i guess it s kind of the elephant in the room  my son like so many others  they come back a bit different  they come back hardened  they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country  and that starts from the top  it s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder  if they have to question  if they re respected anymore  it starts from the top  the question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder  do you know what we go through  do you know what we re trying to do to secure america and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us  i can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some ptsd and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with   palin said   and it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them  earnest said that while it s easy to mock palin   really easy   the topics she discussed are not a joke  the reaction of some people i think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail  particularly from gov  palin  but the fact is domestic violence is not a joke  gun violence is not a joke  problems with addiction are not a joke  the consequences  or i should say  the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke  we take  very seriously and there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that is sometimes difficult to talk about publicly   he said classy   something one would never expect from someone who would fling herself on top of a dogpile in a drunken brawl her family started at someone s birthday party watch earnest eloquently destroy her below featured image via screengrab
