senator elizabeth warren  d ma  lit into republican presidential frontrunner donald trump with a series of tweets  warren hammered away at trump  calling him a  loser  and accused him of engaging in  petty bullying  attacks on women  cheap racism  flagrant narcissism  warren is hugely popular and influential with democrats and liberals  and her series of tweets targeting trump is seen by some as a sign that the primary season is effectively over and that the general election has begun here are warren s tweets let s be honest    realdonaldtrump is a loser  count all his failed businesses  see how he cheated people w  scams like trump u   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march    how  realdonaldtrump kept his father s empire afloat using strategic corporate bankruptcies to skip out on debt   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march    to experts who say  realdonaldtrump might have more money today if he d put his inheritance in an index fund   left it alone   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march     realdonaldtrump knows he s a loser  his insecurities are on parade  petty bullying  attacks on women  cheap racism  flagrant narcissism   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march    just because  realdonaldtrump is a loser everywhere else doesn t mean he ll lose this election   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march     realdonaldtrump stands ready to tear apart an america that was built on values like decency  community  and concern for our neighbors   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march    way i see it  it s our job to make sure  realdonaldtrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it   elizabeth warren   elizabethforma  march    s tweets all hit at what are considered soft spots for trump  he has boasted about his huge wealth  but numerous reports indicate that his net worth is considerably exaggerated  from trump biographer timothy o brien on a single day in august   he told me his net worth was   billion to   billion  then revised that later the same day to    billion  forbes said at the time he was worth    billion  a year later donald told me he was worth   billion to   billion  but a brochure left on my nightstand at his palm beach resort said he was worth    billion the tweets also discuss trump s sexism  which appears to be one of his major achilles  heels  when fox news anchor megyn kelly pointed out his history of demeaning women  he complained she was bleeding out of her  whatever   and still months later has referred to her as  crazy   which drew an uncharacteristic rebuke of a republican from the right wing propaganda network perhaps most importantly  warren is indicating to the mainstream media and other democrats that trump s racially motivated campaign won t be off limits to criticism  so far  republicans have largely avoided hitting trump on his offensive language towards latinos and muslims  as well as towards black activists  he called for protesters to be punched   the democrats largely have no interest in courting the racists that dwell in the base of the gop  and have no such restrictions on what they can say in the general election it looks like the fight is truly on featured image via flickr
