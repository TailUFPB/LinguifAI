on thursday republicans in congress voted to overturn a rule  proposed by the obama administration  which requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of the person they are advising the rule was first proposed last year  after a detailed report from senator elizabeth warren revealed that financial advisers are receiving a treasure trove of incentives  kickbacks and non cash awards for giving out bad financial advice to seniors and people on the brink of retirement as addicting info reported here  warren s report showed that financial advisers are rewarded with all expenses paid  luxury vacations to places like south africa  the bahamas and aruba  as well as golf outings  theater tickets  gift cards and cash prizes  all for steering retirees toward risky  company owned investment options while financial advisors personally profit from doling out bad advice  retirees lose more than   billion a year because of a loophole that leaves them unprotected under traditional conflict of interest laws the obama administration has been working to fix the loophole by including people who seek advice about pension and retirement accounts as people toward whom advisers have a  fiduciary obligation   under the conflict of interest law in the meantime  the industry has been fighting hard to keep the rule from taking effect during a hearing on the proposed rule last year  senator elizabeth warren went head to head with the president of primerica  peter schneider  who was brought in to testify against the rule watch senator warren hammer away at schneider in the video below  courtesy of sweet videos on youtube while it s clear from senator warren s report and the testimony in the video above that the rule is needed to protect consumers  republicans proved yet again that they have no desire to serve the interests of the public congress introduced and passed h j res   which reads as follows this joint resolution disapproves and nullifies a department of labor rule published on april     relating to the definition of the term  fiduciary  and the conflict of interest rule with respect to retirement investment advice  the rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans  under current law  a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries  the rule changes the definition of  investment advice  to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships  as much as republicans would like him to  there s almost no chance that the president obama would sign any bill which attacks the proposed fiduciary rule still  the republican sponsored resolution confirms what we already know about their priorities while democrats like president obama and elizabeth warren are fighting to protect the public from wall street predators  republicans are working hard to pass legislation that prevents them from doing just that there s only one solution  vote them out in  photo credit kazuhiro nogi afp getty images
