a bloomberg analysis of amazon s same day delivery service locations shows that black neighborhoods are routinely excluded from access to the service although all customers pay the same   fee for the amazon prime membership  which includes same day delivery service in covered areas  black customers are significantly less likely to have access to that service according to the bloomberg study  black customers who live in atlanta  chicago  dallas and washington dc are  percent less likely to have access to same day delivery bloomberg further reports in new york city  same day delivery is available throughout manhattan  staten island  and brooklyn  but not in the bronx and some majority black neighborhoods in queens  in some cities  amazon same day delivery extends many miles into the surrounding suburbs but isn t available in some zip codes within the city limits out of all the places where amazon same day delivery services are available to amazon prime members  the analysis shows the greatest disparity in the city of boston according to the bloomberg analysis  three zip codes encompassing the primarily black neighborhood of roxbury are excluded from same day service  while the neighborhoods that surround it on all sides are eligible  in many cases this means that black customers have no access to same day delivery  while white customers  living just a few blocks away  do have access here s what the delivery zones look like in some of the most populated urban areas image credit  screen capture bloomberg comaccording to amazon vice president for global communications  craig berman  the company did not intentionally create a service area which excludes black neighborhood berman says that service areas were determined by data and algorithms as tech insider reports here  amazon pr director scott stanzel described the criteria the company used to generate the algorithm according to stanzel  that included  distance to the nearest fulfillment center  local demand in an area  numbers of prime members in an area  as well as the ability of our various carrier partners to deliver up to   pm every single day  even sunday  so how does a computer program which doesn t include race as a factor  generate a service area that excludes black neighborhoods tech insider sums it up best  by explaining racism  as researchers have documented in countless studies and reports  is the systemic marginalization of minority communities  it s the aggregate of small and large effects that make it harder for people to find housing  accumulate wealth  avoid the criminal justice system  and succeed in school if they aren t white  data and algorithms selected in deliberate ignorance of racism can pick up and reinforce that systemic problem so basically the algorithm reflects the racism that is already present in a service area  as described by tech insider  it  reflects ongoing economic disparities and segregation between white and black communities created by decades of redlining  that appears to be exactly what happened in the case of amazon s same day delivery service area coverage amazon says the company has plans to  fill in the gaps  in service coverage  over time  that doesn t seem like a good enough answer when the data shows that many black customers are being denied equal service under the company s current model mistakes can happen  yes  but now that the problems have clearly been exposed  amazon should take immediate steps to correct them it s one thing to unknowingly generate an algorithm that excludes black neighborhoods  it s another thing altogether to look the other way once you re aware of the issue  image credit  michael nagle bloomberg via getty images
