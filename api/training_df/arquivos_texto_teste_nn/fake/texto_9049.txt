it s not looking like much of a happy new for republican presidential candidate ben carson carson  who has been nosediving in the polls since november  woke up on new year s eve to a resignation phone call from his campaign s top adviser  barry bennett  but that was just the beginning of the candidate s troubles shortly after bennett resigned  carson s communications director  doug watts  also handed in his resignation that was followed by the resignation of his deputy campaign manager  lisa coen just when it looked as if things couldn t get much worse   additional staffers followed carson s former top advisers out the door the walk out follows accusations that carson s campaign is little more than a  money making scheme  spearheaded by an unethical conservative commentator named armstrong williams  williams biggest claim to fame is that he was secretly paid more than    by the george bush administration to unethically promote the president s signature no child left behind policy  interestingly  williams is not only carson s campaign manager  but also his business manager as raw story reported back in november  carson began facing allegations about the sincerity of his campaign after he bypassed opportunities to engage voters in early primary states  in favor of a tour to promote his most recent book in an article published in new york magazine  staff writer jonathan chait asked whether ben carson is really running for president  or simply running a money making con scheme chait pointed out that  conservative politics are so closely intermingled with a lucrative entertainment complex that it is frequently impossible to distinguish between a political project  that is  something designed to result in policy change  and a money making venture  he then went on to discuss the potential benefits of announcing that you re running for president  even if you don t actually want to be president  declaring yourself a presidential candidate gives you access to millions of dollars  worth of free media attention that can build a valuable brand  so the mere fact that carson calls himself a presidential candidate does not prove he is actually running for president rather than taking advantage of the opportunity to build his brand  indeed  it is possible to be actually leading the polls without seriously trying to win the presidency  what chait discovered about carson s campaign was that it has all the tell tale signs of a scam  carson is doing a lot of things that seem puzzling for a presidential campaign  but quite logical for a brand building exercise  he is taking weeks off the campaign trail to go on a book tour  his campaign itself is structured much more like a scamming venture than a political one  an astronomical  percent of his fund raising totals are spent on more fund raising   bernie sanders  by contrast  spends just  percent of his intake on fund raising   in addition to direct mail  carson seems to have undertaken a massive phone spamming operation  spending most of your money to raise more money is not a good way to get elected president  but it is a good way to build a massive list of supporters that can later be monetized  perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for armstrong williams  the figure running the carson  campaign   is  business manager   as opposed to  campaign manager   it does suggests that carson is engaged in a for profit venture  today as carson s staffers began abandoning ship in droves  they left no doubt about their reasons bennett placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of armstrong  he noted that the carson campaign has raised more money this quarter than any other republican candidate and yet according to the most recent polling data  carson lags some  points behind republican front runner donald trump it doesn t add up  and it seems that a lot of his staffers know it in a final stab  seemingly aimed at the lack of sincerity and professionalism within the carson campaign  bennett said during an interview with reuters  i can play amateur politics at home with my  year old  i don t need to do it at the professional level  featured image credit  gage skidmore via flckr
