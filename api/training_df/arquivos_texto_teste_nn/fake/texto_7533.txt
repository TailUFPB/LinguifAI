donald trump has brought every racist out of the closet and given them a megaphone   as well as the courage to openly be as awful as humanly possible  his campaign events might as well be called white pride rallies  they are disgusting  deplorable  and outright un american in yet another example of the utter racism coming out of the trump campaign and those who follow him  a trump supporter started shouting at those protesting that if they consider themselves african america then they should  go back to africa  go back to africa   suggests camo clad trump supporter  video  pic twitter com   tonydokoupil   tonydokoupil  march    trump doesn t start condemning this sort of speech  he himself should be condemned by every american who stands up for justice and equality  however  it s doubtful that trump will condemn this sort of speech considering he is asking for protesters to be  thrown the hell out  or says that if he had the chance he d punch them himself and that he misses the  good old days  where people were taken out on stretchers if trump is allowed to openly continue his hate filled rhetoric  we will undoubtedly see more and more of this behavior from the grotesque people who support him  he needs to be held accountable for his encouragement of hate and violence featured image via video screen capture
