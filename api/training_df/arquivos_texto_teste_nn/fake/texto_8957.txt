working in the service industry can really be a test  as you will eventually and inevitably come in contact with an impossibly difficult  insensitive customer that makes you question your faith in humanity  and if you haven t worked in the service industry  this story about a customer named holly jones will give you a pretty good idea of what a complete nightmare of a customer looks like for new year s eve  jones visited kilroy s bar n grill in indianapolis  indiana   an experience that left her less than satisfied  jones said that she and her party s experience was  ruined  due to the fact that she had to witness a dead person be wheeled out from an overdose   and of course  because of this  dead person   her table didn t get the attention she felt entitled to  jones was so upset  that she took to kilroy s facebook page to blast the restaurant for making her holiday celebration so awful  she wrote  i will never go back to this location for new year s eve    after the way we were treated when we spent   and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined    every year we have come to kilroys to enjoy new years eve and tonight we were screamed at and had the manager walk away from use while  we  were trying to figure out our bill being messed up the manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn t matter  but i guess allowing a junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money   our waitress when we were trying to ask about our bill being messed up also said  what do you want me to do  expletive  pay your bill for you   what a great way to talk to a paying customer  i get that working on new years eve  is  stressful but being a complete  expletive  to us all night knowing you get an automatic gratuity is not right    kilroy sjones  bad review is awful enough  but it was kilroy s response that made this incident gain widespread media attention  kilroy manager chris burton replied to jones and kindly informed her that the  dead person  who was  wheeled out from an overdose  was actually a  year old woman who had suffered a heart attack while she was also celebrating nye with her family  for jones  insensitive remarks  chris offered some harsh words of his own in return  first of all  the  overdosing junkie  that you speak of was a  year old woman who had a heart attack  thankfully she was revived at the hospital and survived  it sounds like you were very concerned about her so i thought you should know  this poor lady  who was celebrating new year s eve with her husband and son  had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her  you can read burton s full post in the screenshots below  as he closed his post with i m glad to hear you won t be coming back to kilroy s because we wouldn t want anyone as cold hearted and nasty as you returning  kilroy skilroy safter burton masterfully put jones in her place  the incident went viral  in another post  kilroy s reported that the victim who suffered a heart attack was stable  but still had a long way to recover  the bar set up a gofundme page  allowing supporters to donate in support of her recovery  the goal of the page was     but the donations have exceeded twice that amount  if there was one good thing that came out of jones  nasty attitude and review  it was this   as one donor pointed out  i wonder if the lady who was upset realizes that her negativity has been a major blessing to this family  her anger and the subsequent comment from kilroy s has lead to people learning about this gofundme and supporting this family  you are almost at the amount you requested in  hours  without that woman  this incident could have happened all too quietly  featured image via google and screenshots
