donald trump and his supporters are absolutely crazy  there is video that has surfaced from a rally from this weekend with his supporters doing a hitler esque salute and telling reporters to go to auschwitz  and of course we all know about the outbreaks of racist violence  well  the one that really takes the case is how trump and his supporters have managed to make a great part of his ignorant base believe that a protester who rushed the stage is somehow connected the terrorist group isis the protester  identified as  year old college student and activist thomas dimassimo  is in no way tied to isis  however  trump and his supporters have plowed on with this ridiculous and untrue theory  trump was questioned about the spreading of this lie on a recent edition of meet the press  when the shutting down of his chicago rally due to violence was addressed  he gave his usual crazy and uninformed answer  and said   all i know is what s on the internet  so  we have a guy who literally is winning the race to be a presidential nominee who lies all the time and admits to believing everything he reads online  that s scary as hell  to say the least  he even tweeted out the fake video created by his lying fans usss did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage  he has ties to isis  should be in jail  https   t co  ssr true  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    john harwood tweeted this ridiculous travesty trump response to being told video connecting rally protestor to isis is a hoax   all i know is what s on the internet   john harwood   johnjharwood  march    course  we also know that trump is now threatening protesters with arrests that will  ruin their lives  if they exercise their first amendment rights against the hateful environment of his rallies as well  his supporters are also still steadily spreading the lie that dimassimo is an isis supporter  though the fbi has thoroughly debunked that claim  the edited video that they used to promote that dangerous nonsense was actually of the young man at a protest that had nothing to do with isis  dimassimo says of his reasons for rushing trump on stage and taking the disorderly conduct charge  we must nonviolently shut down every trump rally  we must stop this violent  foolish man from taking this country and destroying it  thomas dimassimo is absolutely correct  trump is america s adolf hiter  and the really scary part is that a lot of people are too blinded by bigotry  hate  and fear to see it featured image via video screen capture from addicting info archives
