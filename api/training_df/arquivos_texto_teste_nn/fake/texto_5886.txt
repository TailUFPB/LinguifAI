microsoft is buying linkedin and they have so much cash on hand that they could pay for the professional social network four times over without ever needing to even pick up the phone to start dialing the number of a single bank  yet  they want a loan for the purchase anyway  why would a company that s as flush as microsoft want to take on debt like that when it doesn t have to the answer s simple   the loan equals a tax deduction for them  and the interest on the loan will lower their tax bill for years to come  robert mcintyre  of citizens for tax justice  says  it s an odd world where a company is awash in cash and chooses to make the acquisition with debts because they don t want to pay tax  that  combined with all the other ways they can game our tax system  will bring their total annual liability to rates that are far lower than the one corporate america  and republicans  scream is too high this particular loophole will allow microsoft to avoid the  percent tax rate they d pay for repatriating cash they re holding overseas that s needed to buy linkedin without a loan  exactly how much tax will they avoid paying just this year   billion  and it s perfectly legal  in fact  most types of corporate tax evasion are perfectly legal and that s just for one year  they ll avoid millions more on just this particular purchase in the years to come  in addition to all the other ways they ll avoid paying their fair share of taxes  they aren t the only ones doing this  back in may  a study revealed that multinational corporations are avoiding paying at least   billion per year in taxes  that makes the tax evasion problem much worse than previously thought much has been made of things like corporate inversions  where corporations buy a smaller  overseas company for the purpose of shifting their headquarters out of the u s  and thus  avoid our taxes  we also make a big deal about tax havens  such as the cayman islands and switzerland  although we re starting to make headway with banks in countries that serve as tax shelters to put a stop to this type of evasion but using loans when they re flush with cash is yet another tax evasion method  one might say that people with student loans and home mortgages are doing the same thing  however  people with those two particular types of debt are a  individuals  and b  aren t awash in the kind of cash a company like microsoft is  so there s a huge difference there our official corporate tax rate might be   percent  and republicans and our poor  downtrodden multinationals can whine about how high it is all they want  their crying doesn t change the fact that  each year from  to   more than  percent of our corporations paid zero in federal income taxes  you can bet all the benefits they get from loans  like microsoft is doing  contribute heavily to that  there is nothing that justifies their whining think this is just good business  sure  from a purely profit oriented perspective  anything that lowers costs is good because it raises the bottom line  there are real world consequences though  and one of them is a country  like ours  that shifts its tax burden onto individuals who work  and work  and work for these very corporations  and can t bring in enough revenue to actually function properly microsoft will buy linkedin however it wants  but this  right here  is a perfect example of why our tax code needs to be overhauled  there s no reason at all microsoft should be able to get a loan and deduct it from its taxes when it has four times the cash it needs to buy linkedin  there just isn t featured image by david ramos getty images
