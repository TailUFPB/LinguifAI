john podesta is hillary clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird  that s why this is such a fun video to watch  podesta had a brutal exchange on cbs s  face the nation  on sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on so called  purple states  in  host nancy cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel robert mueller on friday showed that russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests  then she goes in for the kill with this question  but it does beg the question  how is it that these russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like michigan and wisconsin and your campaign didn t   lol  that s such a great snark filled question transcript of full interview nancy cordes  welcome back to  face the nation   i m nancy cordes  our next guest  john podesta  was the chairman of hillary clinton s  campaign  his private emails were hacked and released publicly by russian backed entities during the campaign  mr  podesta  thank you so much for being with us john podesta  nice to be back  nancy nancy cordes  for anyone who voted for hillary clinton  these new indictments mean what john podesta  well  look  it s a tragedy for the american people  really  as mr  mueller said in his indictment  this was an act of information warfare against the united states  against our democracy  so i think it s  obviously  disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these russian active measures  but i think the real victims here are the american people because there  there was direct interference with our democratic institutions nancy cordes  the deputy attorney general was very careful on friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election  you ve had a lot time think about this  where do you come down on that issue john podesta  well  look  this was one part of a  of a complex  active interference in the measures  this didn t even deal with the hacking  this was only about what was going on in the social media and the  and the information campaign that was being done there  but there were  people  millions of dollars spent  and as one of your previous guests  senator coons noted  we won the popular vote by three million votes  they were pushing votes  just to give one example  to jill stein  her vote in michigan  in pennsylvania  and wisconsin was greater than the gap between donald trump and hillary clinton in those states  so you can t prove that it did affect the outcome  but it certainly seems likely that it had some impact nancy cordes  but it does beg the question  how is it that these russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like michigan and wisconsin  and your campaign didn t john podesta  well  of course  we spent a lot of time  energy  and effort in all those states nancy cordes  hillary clinton  herself  did not spend much time in those states john podesta  we  you know  we had   tim kaine was there  barack obama was in   and she spent enormous time in pennsylvania and michigan nancy cordes  sure john podesta  and we spent a lot of effort  we had more staff in wisconsin than even president obama had in   but  but i think that begs the question  i think we  we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest  and at the end of the day  we fell short in those states  and i think that this active measures effort by the russians could have tilted the election in  in donald trump s favor  but i think what the real issue is  is how he s reacted to that  and in that context  if we re   if this is information warfare  then i think he s the first draft dodger in the war  i mean  he has done nothing but tried to undermine the mueller investigation  he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he   was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the  to the activities in the  election  we learned this week  he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the  election nancy cordes  why do you think that is  do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the russians might have influenced this election john podesta  well  you know  i think that mr  trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot  a lot about it  but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him  and i think he just constantly tries to move the ball away  including what was  i think  really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the fbi for investigating the russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in florida  but you know who knows with mr  trump  but he clearly  i think  has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the united states  which is to protect our democracy nancy cordes  midterm elections are coming up  and it s been reported that democrats are telling your former boss  bill clinton  that in light of the me too movement  they  they think he should sit it out  he should be benched  and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them  is that true  and do you think that that s the right call john podesta  look  i think he remains  i think  a figure who is popular with a lot of democrats across the country  and i think that people are calling him  candidates are calling him and asking for advice  but whether he s going to be an active participant  i think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now  i think he s doing other things  and  and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaign nancy cordes  do you think it s a good idea  very quickly  for him to sit it out john podesta  well  you know  look  i think that  that if i was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do  i would  i would sort of judge whether he can be helpful  and i think some places he can be  and probably some places he s more of a lightning rod nancy cordes  all right  john podesta  thank you so much  campaign chairman for hillary clinton  and we ll be right back with our panel of republicans who are leaving the house and senate
