donald trump thinks he s qualified to be president of the united states primarily based on what he always touts as his business acumen  continuously propagating the idea that he s a good deal maker and a great negotiator  traits that he and his blind followers believe make him qualified to be the most powerful person on the planet  not so says democratic senator elizabeth warren  who appeared on the late show with stephen colbert to point out that trump is not only a bad business man but a  loser  business man  the always passionate warren said  you inherit that kind of fortune from your father    do you know what some of the analysts say  if all the money he d inherited from his dad  he d just put it into index funds  he d be just about as rich as he is today  in other words  he wasn t out there doing these fabulous deals  he started out rich  he cheated his way to getting richer  that is not going to build an america for hard working people  warren makes excellent points  according to analysts  if trump  who is the ideal trust fund baby just left his inherited wealth alone in index funds  he would be worth the same today  thus  his supposed dealings and negotiating skills are all a bunch of bulls  t in an attempt to present himself as qualified to be president the hope is that people can see  through the buls  t come november to ensure that this nutjob  who is the likely nominee for the nuttier republican party never gets to the oval office watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
