activist groups across the u s  have been raising the alarm about the disastrous impact of money in politics for a long time while the majority of americans take issue with the massive amount of money that flows into the political system  most have no idea just how absurd the situation has really become leave it to john oliver to shine a light on the problem in this segment of last week tonight the comedian talk show host goes behind the scenes of congress to examine how fundraising activities have all but replaced activities related to policy making and governing in washington dc one the most startling revelations from the segment is the fact that most washington officials now spend at least two thirds of their time in office raising money for reelection oliver reports that elected officials spend at least four hours out of every work day inside washington call centers  this time is entirely devoted to calling wealthy donors to solicit funds toward the end of the segment oliver sits down with new york congressman steve israel who recently announced his retirement from office  saying  i don t think i can spend another day in another call room making another call begging for money as john oliver points out in the segment  every elected official in washington is expected to raise a certain amount of funds for their respective political party the amount of money a member of congress is expected to bring in varies according to their position in washington  an ordinary member of congress might be expected to raise     for example  on the other hand  a representative with a greater amount of power and influence  such as nancy pelosi  is expected to raise as much as    for the dnc during the interview rep  israel described how the current system skews the political system toward the rich describing what goes on inside a congressional call center  the congressman said  you have a bunch of cubicles set up  and those cheap fabric dividers  and you sit at a little desk  and you have a phone  and you have an assistant next to you  and you have a call book  and the call book has sheets of every donor  uh  past donors and their records  and your assistant gets a supporter on the phone and gives the phone to you and you engage in polite conversation and then you get to the point and then you hang up and then you flip the page to the next donor and then you make another call after john oliver points out that it sounds like he s describing a  shitty telemarketing operation   rep  israel responds by saying that he views it as  a form of torture   he then points out that the real victims in all of this are the american people he notes that the average american citizen believes that  they don t have a voice in this system  because of the absurd amount of money that federal legislatures are forced to raise  elected officials can t afford to waste time on people unable to donate at least    to their campaigns what this means is that if you have large amounts of money to donate to your senator or congressman  that money buys you access to an elected official  if you don t have that kind of money to contribute  you re basically out of luck watch the segment below  via last week tonight on youtube image credit  video screen capture via last week tonight on youtube
