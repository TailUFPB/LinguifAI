as soon as the news spread that there was some kind of a  takeover  of federal land combined with the name  bundy   ears across america perked up  however  this isn t cliven bundy himself but rather his son ammon  who is just as stubborn   and since everyone seems to have missed it   extremely greedy greedy like his daddy  in   cliven decided his cattle should get to graze for free and that the more than million dollars in fees he owed the us taxpayer was  tyranny   armed freaks from across the country showed up when blm agents seized bundy s cattle and pointed assault rifles at them until the cattle were returned and bundy was left alone the federal government allowed the cattle to be returned  but bundy is far from out of the woods now son ammon has started his very own revolution  breaking into a federal building located on a wildlife refuge in oregon  a federally protected plot of land with the strictest of rules as far as fires  hunting  alcohol and stupidity go  four things the  patriots  who have moved in will certainly partake in the episode started when a local rancher and his son were sentenced to federal prison for setting over  acres of public land on fire to cover up their poaching  after a protest of their incarceration  bundy and company took the piece of forest and released a video recruiting more  murikans  promising them food and a place to stay  just bring your guns at the beginning of that video  bundy lays out three goals for the area  highlighting the kind of person he actually is  bundy clearly says he s going to  protect  the people and bring back the ranchers  miners and loggers when you cast aside all of the  i love my country  bs and the  we re here for the people  garbage  you ll see that bundy and pals targeted a wildlife management area because the things they think they re going to start doing there are strictly forbidden ranchers aren t welcome to graze their thousands of head of cattle  because the land has been designated as a natural resource  it s a place where a natural ecosystem can actually survive without being decimated by cattle  bundy would  of course  change that and with his intention to be there  for years  if necessary  you know he s thinking setting up a cattle operation might be a good idea miners aren t allowed to strip or tunnel  because it s been determined that the risk to the environment of that area is too great from the pollution mining inherently brings to streams and groundwater  you d think the ranchers would care about the heavy metal poisoning of their cattle  but for some reason they don t loggers aren t allowed to chop down the forest in an area like this for obvious reasons  things live in trees  and in this area  this tiny protected little world of plants  animals  streams and ponds  living things are essential the bundy stance is about greed  it s about the mentality that just because you ve lived in a place a long time you have the right to destroy it  for private property that may be true  you may destroy your own property at will  but that land next door owned by the taxpayer  we have laws and such about that land  it isn t yours  these people have been mooching for free for so long off of the u s  government   and therefore the taxpayer   that they would have no idea how to live on their own yes  these are the same people who call people getting food benefits  lazy  featured image via screen capture
