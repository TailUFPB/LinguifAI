it s time the american people wake up to the dangers and the treasonous nature that is donald j  trump  two days ago  at a press conference that made national news for being absolutely ridiculous  trump had asked the russians  either government or non government  to hack into the united states cyberspace to gather clinton emails  the reason  he wants wikileaks  at the behest of russia  to undermine clinton and help him get elected well today  it s been confirmed that the clinton campaign s computer system have been hacked   and the russians were probably the ones who did it u s  intelligence officials have found evidence clearly linking state sponsored russian hackers to breaches in multiple democratic affiliated organizations  including the fundraising democratic congressional campaign committee  and the democratic national committee  the clinton campaign has now been added to the triangle of breaches reuters broke the story friday afternoon  receiving no comment from the department of justice nor any russian officials  when reaching out for comment  reuters wrote the clinton campaign  based in brooklyn  had no immediate comment and referred reuters to a comment from earlier this week by campaign senior policy adviser jake sullivan criticizing republican presidential candidate donald trump and calling the hacking  a national security issue  reuters has also no knowledge of what specifically had been breached in the clinton computer system maybe it s the emails trump and his buddies at the kremlin have been hoping for  given trump s public ignorance of knowing putin   even though he has acknowledged in the past he does in fact know him very well   it seems the timing of this new hack against clinton is very coincidental also given trump s strange admiration for putin and apparently for individuals that hack  a lopsided influence in the united states presidential election in favor of him also seems very coincidental given the circumstances just now coming to light by saying he hoped russians hacked hillary clinton   which he tweeted and said on camera so it really isn t a  joke  to him   trump has made clear that he is perfectly a ok with victory based on cheating an treasonous associations it s one thing to joke   it s another to have your motherland thugs  who clearly support you  spring into action on your behalf whether or not trump and his campaign clowns are involved  directly  in this remains to be seen  whether or not trump and his campaign clowns are involved indirectly remains to be seen  but thing is for certain  state sponsored russian hackers are unfairly influencing this election  and like the kkk and david duke  trump and his campaign  save mike pence  have disavowed that should scare everybody featured image via joshua lott getty images
