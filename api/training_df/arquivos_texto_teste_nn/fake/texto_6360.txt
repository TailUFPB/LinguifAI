despite the fact that donald trump has admitted in the past that he has acted as his own publicist  he and his campaign continue to deny that it was his voice on the recordings  jake tapper confronted trump s campaign manager on the issue and his defense of trump was sloppy and full of nonsense on sunday morning s state of the union  tapper played the now infamous tape of trump impersonating his own pr guy  and then asked campaign manager paul manafort if the campaign is  seriously claiming that wasn t mr  trump   manafort stuck to his story but tapper pressed on and put manafort on the spot  tapper said  in  under oath he testified he did use the name john barron  and in  he told people magazine he did use the name john miller so this has already been admitted previously  i don t understand why now  manafort then said   i don t know those facts to be true or not  i just know that he said it s not him  i believe him   he then went on in an attempt to change the subject  citing what he said was the lack of importance of the issue  i don t even know the relevance of this frankly  it s  years old and they re not dealing with the issues that trump is trying to focus on today  jobs  terrorism  immigration problems  these are the issues we should be talking about  why the media is spending so much time going by  years  talking about people magazine on a tape that may or may not be trump  but tapper wasn t having it  and he explained the relevance of the story to manafort  here s what he said  this issue is here you have a man who in his  s allegedly is his own public relations agent  bragging about his exploits with women while married to ivana trump  the mother of his three children and speaks to a certain kind of character issue don t you think  indeed  the character flaws here are tremendous  the lies along with the alleged betrayal of his wife and his disgusting talk about women should all be taken as important issues  especially since trump is trying to become president  let s hope it never comes to that scenario watch video here on mediaite comfeatured image via video screen capture
