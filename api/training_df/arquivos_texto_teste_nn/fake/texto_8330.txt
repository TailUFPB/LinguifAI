the people supporting jeb bush s quest for the presidency have invested millions in a candidate who has so far failed to inspire support from republican voters  and has in fact continued to collapse in poll after poll resulting in a  place finish in the iowa caucus with a measly    of the vote   behind ben carson and rand paul  who has now dropped out of the race but when you ve wasted that much money  there s probably a temptation to salvage something  anything  so the geniuses at right to rise  the super pac that bush himself raised funds for and directed right wing millionaires to pour their funds into  has released a new ad featuring the most infamous bush ever  george w  bush in the ad  bush touts his younger brother  and that s where the ad gets extremely bizarre  george  who lost more americans to terrorism than any other president in american history  describes jeb as the right person to  protect america  after touting jeb s  heart  and  strong backbone   he says jeb will  unite our country   of course  during his presidency george w  bush pioneered new techniques in dividing the country  particularly on the topic of a war of choice in iraq he used as a political weapon   describing those opposed to the war as allies of terrorists  and directing his underlings like karl rove to insinuate that democrats were soft on terrorism   despite his administration s failure to kill or capture osama bin laden the elder bush also claims that his brother  knows how to bring the world together  against terrorism   but what sort of standing does bush have on that type of diplomacy  he failed to unite the world in support of invading iraq  and in the wake of that failure chose to commit americans to a war that would eventually kill   members of the u s  armed services and thousands more iraqis george w  bush even reminds people about how his administration crossed the moral threshold and utilized torture  claiming that jeb bush knows when  tough measures  must be taken  that kind of talk might help among republicans  but it also reminds people of the abdication of moral leadership that happened on bush s watch it is highly unlikely that jeb bush will become the republican party s nominee  he has been exposed as a poor campaigner who let a playground bully like donald trump pull his pants down in front of the entire world without ever really fighting back and now his big brother has come barreling into the election after sitting on the sidelines since his failed presidency  reminding everyone   left and right   just why it is the country moved on from the bush clan featured image via youtube
