as president obama delivered his final state of the union address  america once again was given a textbook case of the contrast between the right s erratic  dangerous leadership and obama s calm and effective posture when news broke that members of the u s  navy had been detained by iran  the right went into meltdown mode marco rubio said it was part of a pattern of iran testing a  weak  obama administration  ted cruz said it was  striking  that obama didn t throw out his address and instead speak about the situation  ben carson whined   while president obama is complaining about global warming  of our american sailors are held in iranian custody   john mccain thundered that  iran has already achieved a propaganda victory by announcing that they had  arrested  americans on board american warships  minutes before the state of the union address was set to be delivered  senator cory gardner  r co  told cnn that the president should consider delaying it until the seamen had been returned while senator tom cotton  r ar  described the situation as  humiliating  for obama the pundits were in action too  with msnbc s joe scarborough tweeting   hey iran  you have exactly  days left to push a us president around  enjoy it while you can  after that  there will be hell to pay  but as we ve seen so many times over this presidency  while the right was throwing feces and freaking out  president obama was getting something done  the seamen were freed on wednesday morning without shots being fired  without a lot of noise and fury and drama  without a lot of unnecessary saber rattling iran has released two united states navy patrol boats and  crew members who were described as  trespassing  in iranian waters near a major naval base  state news media reported on wednesday the pentagon and the state department said that one of the boats had experienced mechanical problems en route to bahrain from kuwait on a routine mission on tuesday  and the iranians appeared to have accepted that explanation secretary of defense ash carter praised the successful resolution  i am pleased that ten u s  navy sailors have departed iran and are now back in u s  hands  i want to personally thank secretary of state john kerry for his diplomatic engagement with iran to secure our sailors  swift return  around the world  the u s  navy routinely provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress  and we appreciate the timely way in which this situation was resolved  america was able to quickly and safely resolve the situation because unlike during the bush administration  a diplomatic line of communication is now open between america and iran  instead of a wall of silence between the two countries  there is now a process in place to deescalate tension and an agreement now in operation to steer iran away from becoming a nuclear state instead of freaking out and pounding his fist leading to iran making the world more dangerous  president obama has chosen the other path and it is a brand of leadership that has and will make the world safer featured image via vox
