director michael bay is perhaps best known for his over the top  cgi crazy  transformers  movies  he regularly deals in the kind of popcorn action flicks that allows an audience to turn their brains off and just go along for a ride  or  if your eric trump  son of donald  michael bay can change your life over memorial day weekend  eric came across michael bay s republican friendly take on the benghazi  scandal  called   hours  the secret soldiers of benghazi   it blew his mind eric trump and his wife  lara  apparently spent part of the memorial day weekend watching the benghazi flick  which trump s son said made him  literally livid  i think in order to vote in this next election  you should have to watch that movie  i was livid   trump said   she left these guys on a rooftop in the middle of benghazi getting shot at  having mortars drop on their head because she wouldn t pick up a phone call in the middle of the night  like father  like son  donald trump has routinely slammed hillary clinton s response to benghazi by pushing the conspiracy theory that claimed she ignored her phone when the frantic embassy staff tried to get help  this is an idea that michael bay   whose own political views oscillate between ultra conservative and slow motion shots of american flags waving in the wind   reinforced in his movie by adding a feckless bureaucrat character whose sole purpose in the story was to get in the way of the light beer drinking patriots driving to save the embassy  in a scathing review of the film  critic jason bailey at flavorwire aptly summed up the  cartoon bullshit  bay tried to pass for political messaging  it s like catnip for conservatives in fact  the film s real villains aren t the faceless  nameless libyans attacking these outposts  it s the pencil pushing  weaselly base chief  david constabile   who insults and obstructs our heroes at every turn   we have the best and brightest minds from harvard and yale   he tells newbie jack  john krasinski   of the agents on their base  so  the best thing for you is to stay out of their way   fuckin  smart people  am i right  he also  of course  insists there s no danger to be found  and orders the team to stand down and wait after they get word of the attack on ambassador stevens   a detail refuted by a gop controlled congressional committee  as reported by fox news  but there i go getting political of course  basing your political views on michael bay s portrayal of a contentious event means you are inevitably going to miss some stuff  like many of the facts  here s how factcheck org ruled on the accusation that clinton was awol in the immediate aftermath of the attacks trump is entitled to his opinion about clinton s response to the benghazi attack  but the evidence shows clinton was fully engaged in the immediate response  and subsequent congressional investigations concluded the government response to the attack   including clinton s   was appropriate  clinton testified that even after she went home that night  she remained awake all night  engaged and focused on the situation  since there is no way to independently verify that  we ll let readers decide for themselves  but we would note trump has not provided any evidence to contradict clinton s account both donald and eric are wrong  and wrong in ways that only people who routinely get their news from tabloids and right wing chain emails can be  even a cursory look into the actual details of what went on during the benghazi attacks would show a situation that was far more nuanced and tragic than the black and white nonsense they are describing  ironically  it s this very ham fisted attempt to lash out at hillary clinton that truly does a disservice to the three americans that died at the embassy  their deaths are being used by the trump family to service donald s agenda  there is nothing more despicable than that featured image via joe raedle getty images
