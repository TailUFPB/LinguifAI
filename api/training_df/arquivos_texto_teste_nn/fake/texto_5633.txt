donald trump has claimed since he launched his presidential campaign to be worth at least   billion  he has not offered any proof of this  and has not given any evidence that the   billion figure is anything but a completely made up figment of his imagination now  a smoking gun document has been found that shows trump to be far less wealthy than   billion  and it comes from trump himself in the document  which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including trump tower in new york city  trump was described as being worth more than     with liquid assets of more than   a passage in the  page filing says   the sponsor is donald j trump  mr trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office  retail  residential  golf clubs and hospitality properties in markets including new york  san francisco  florida  washington dc  and scotland  as of  june   mr trump reports a net worth in excess of    and liquidity in excess of    the document was filed with the securities and exchange commission in  by wells fargo securities on trump s behalf the claim of   million in liquid assets is far less than the   million trump told sean hannity of fox news he had in a  interview the guardian newspaper points out that that is not enough to finance a modern presidential campaign  which runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars  trump has already loaned his campaign between   to   million dollars  which means he may already be completely tapped out despite his extravagant claim that he can self finance a battle against hillary clinton to win the presidency trump has so far refused to disclose his tax returns to prove his net worth  the first candidate in nearly  years to hide his returns in this fashion  clinton has exposed  years of her own returns  making her financial situation transparent meanwhile  trump has been completely outgunned on fundraising  his recent filing with the federal elections commission showed his campaign with less than   million on hand  while clinton had over   million even worse  clinton recently revealed that in june she had raised an additional   million for a war chest of over   million  which does not include perhaps even   million or more that has been raised by super pacs supporting her campaign trump has not revealed his june fundraising but an email appeal from his campaign to email addresses they appear to have purchased in bulk to send spam to  several foreign government officials say they have been getting trump emails  boasted a relatively puny   million figure raised in the last few weeks the disparity is showing up in early advertising  as clinton is spending about    a day in critical swing states   florida  pennsylvania  colorado  new mexico  and others   while trump hasn t spent anything at all  by comparison  mitt romney s  campaign was spending about   of what president obama s re election campaign was  keeping that candidate viable featured image via flickr
