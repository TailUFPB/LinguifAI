by nearly all accounts  donald trump s response to the worst mass shooting in american history has been very  very bad  never one to let a tragedy get in the way of self glorification  trump has come across as cold hearted  moronic  and narcissistic   often all at the same time  now he can add  fake  to the list as well in the early moments after the attack  trump began by sending out a vague reaction to the attack claiming he was thinking of the victims  only to follow it up with a random  unrelated smear directed at hillary clinton  since then  he s released a torrent of anti muslim bigotry  he s congratulated himself for being  right  about muslims  he never once mentioned the heartbreaking fact that the attack was in an iconic gay night club and most of the victims were lgbtq  nor has he mentioned that this appears to be as much an anti gay hate crime as an islamic terror attack oh and he also stole a reporter s tweet and passed it off as his own so as to not have to share the spotlight with someone else even for one second cnn s brian stelter caught him red handed it looks like trump flagrantly copy   pasted  sebgorka s unsourced   tweet  tweaked it  and posted at   pic twitter com aahwuhvvnh  brian stelter   brianstelter  june    is immediately clear  trump  flagrantly copy and pasted  reporter sebastian gorka s tweet and made it his own  why didn t he just retweet gorka if he wanted to pass along the information  because then he wouldn t get the retweets and likes that he so desperately craves throughout the day  trump has put on a master class in how not to handle a national tragedy  he s made the event exclusively about himself  to contrast trump s ego  both president obama and democratic nominee hillary clinton have released statements that honor the victims  condemn the attacks  and demonstrate a sensitivity to the startling acts of terror  in particular  obama took pains to not lose sight of the victims and their identity   something trump has yet to even mention this is an especially heartbreaking day for all of our friends  our fellow americans  who are lesbian  gay  bisexual  or transgender  the shooter targeted a night club where people came together to be with friends  to dance and to sing  and to live  the place where they were attacked is more than a night club  it is a place of solidarity and empowerment  where people have come together to raise awareness  to speak their minds  and to advocate for their civil rights  so this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any american  regardless of race  ethnicity  religion  or sexual orientation  is an attack on all of us  and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as as country compare that to how president trump would react appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism  i don t want congrats  i want toughness   vigilance  we must be smart   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    pathetic  doesn t even begin to describe that featured image via alex wong getty images
