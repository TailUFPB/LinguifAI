donald trump decided he was anti capitalism on friday when he called for his supporters to boycott apple products  would he be joining in the boycott he called for  probably not because he s still using his iphone to tweet dozens of times a day  oops trump has taken the side of the federal government over apple in the fight between combating terrorism and consumer privacy  the justice department has repeatedly demanded that apple break into the iphone of one of the san bernardino terrorists  the tech company has declined  citing the need to protect the privacy of its customers hilariously  trump s call for an apple boycott comes on a day where he has been busy tweeting  and many users noticed that trump s tweets come with a signature  twitter for iphone  description on the bottom lol pic twitter com psnvauedgr  colin jones   colinjones  february    t stop  won t stop pic twitter com   colin jones   colinjones  february    may have been under the impression that no one would notice what kind of device he was using because for twitter users going directly to the website or ones using the twitter app on their phones  this description doesn t always appear  for users of the twitter organizational app called tweetdeck the republican front runner made the comments at a campaign rally in south carolina where he is expected to win the primary by a massive margin trump s attack on apple is an odd choice for the man who frequently cites his shrewd business sense as his main  some might say  only   presidential qualifier  it s certainly not about ethics  trump routinely brags that his companies have declared bankruptcy to exploit the government and make the taxpayers give him more money  instead  it might just be out of professional jealousy  after all  trump may be a billionaire  but none of his assets hold a candle to apple s profitability recently  apple s value surpassed   billion  the largest company in the united states by a massive margin  it s unlikely that trump  or his fans  will have any discernible impact on the company s profits  in the past several years  republicans have threatened to boycott everything from starbucks to cheerios  the half baked protests have worked exactly zero times  trump may have the republican party under his thumb  but most of america still hates his guts feature image via gage skidmore flickr
