wayne lapierre has a way about him that defines  a  hole   maybe it s the condescending look his beady little eyes get from behind those frameless glasses  maybe it s the tone in his voice as he declares that the tens of thousands of u s  gun deaths since his tenure began have nothing to do with guns or maybe we all remember his impassioned call for more guns in our schools after   graders were gunned down on one of the coldest days in american history no matter the reason you may despise wayne lapierre  the fact remains the he is despicable  he s a disgusting human being whose moral code has been lost to the cold hard cash of the gun manufacturers who want as many guns as possible in the hands of whoever has the money to buy one understanding all of that  this video will enrage you  lapierre has decided to challenge president obama to a one on one gun control debate  his terms are that the debate be one hour with a moderator  no pre screened questions and no long answers it s difficult for the ammosexual mind to come up with much other than  criminals won t follow laws   so the last stipulation isn t really that surprising  he may want to consult with taya kyle before he assumes that the president isn t willing to answer tough questions from the opposition rather than simply issue the challenge  lapierre attached it to  minutes of propaganda attacking not only the president s stance on gun control but also the affordable care act and yes  you guessed it benghazi  he calls the president a tyrant who ignores the constitution just before he calls on him to mobilize a national force to  turn chicago upside down  in search of felons and criminals with guns because sending the national guard to black communities to illegally search the residents and their homes without warrants or probable cause is just fine  but asking  law abiding  white folks to fill out a form and wait ten minutes is an egregious act of tyranny the entire video is nothing but a propaganda piece aimed at keeping the far right extremists mobilized and ready to do things like occupy the oregon wilderness in the name of  murica or shoot up a planned parenthoood office in the name of life  in the very least he wants the status quo conservative argument of fear for your guns to weigh on the minds of every idiot who believes their firearm is the most important thing in their lives you can watch the ridiculous challenge and the bloviating blowhard who issued it in the video below  if ever there was a time to have a puke bucket nearby  this is it  https   www facebook com nationalrifleassociation videos   permpage  image via screen capture
