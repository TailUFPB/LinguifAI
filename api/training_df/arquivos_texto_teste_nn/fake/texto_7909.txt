republicans claim to love our military veterans  but their decisions not only contradict that claim  it s killing the men and women they sent to fight in iraq and afghanistan veteran suicide is on the rise as gop lawmakers sit on their hands to make sure nothing is done about it in   veteran suicides actually exceeded the number of troops kill in combat  according to the guardian    service members took their own lives in   while a lesser number    died in combat  yet all republicans focused on was making sure president obama could not sign any bills that could accomplish something  and so it has remained that way even as president obama enters his final year in office  and veterans are still committing suicide at a horrifying rate the national veterans foundation reports that  veterans take their own lives every day and that is  too many but republican lawmakers have only made things worse for veterans over the years  creating a sense of hopelessness that makes it more likely that veteran suicides will continue even as those same republicans use veterans as a political tool while republicans take the stage to blabber about how much they love the military and how much they care about the men and women who return home from combat  their actions in congress tell a completely different story just this past october  senate republicans passed the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill which cut   million from programs that benefit veterans  but had no problem increasing funding for missile programsin april   president obama actually had to threaten the gop with a veto after house republicans attempted to cut benefits for   veterans  which included money for education  prosthetic research  and veteran s cemeteries  overall  the cuts amounted to    billion  the veteran s affairs funding bill of  really should have been called the  screw you  veterans bill of   other pieces of legislation offered by democrats that would have provided much needed aid to veterans across the country have been killed by republicans over the years  including the women veterans and families health services act  which would have helped veterans and their spouses seek counseling and fertility treatments another veterans bill that was killed by republicans was offered up by senator bernie sanders in  that would have expanded healthcare and education funding for veterans  but the gop blocked the bill by attaching sanctions on iran to it  this is perhaps the most egregious block of any veterans bill since reuters reported at the time that it would have created  new veterans hospitals to deal with the increased load of wounded veterans coming back from war  these hospitals could help prevent suicides because it would cut down on the wait times veterans are dealing with and give them hope that congress actually cares about them remember the veterans job corps act of   republicans don t  because they blocked the bill and never gave it a second thought even though it would have provided jobs to more than   veterans to help improve their own communities republicans also killed a bill way back in  that would have helped homeless veterans  including those with children and amazingly  that s not all republicans have done to make the lives of veterans and their families a living hell for years  republicans have been viciously attacking the snap program  which provides food aid to millions of americans  republicans would have you believe that all of these food stamp recipients are freeloaders who don t want to work  but that is hardly the case  not only do most food stamp recipients have jobs  albeit low paying jobs    million veterans and their families rely on the program  so not only are republicans refusing to help veterans  they are slashing a program that veterans rely on because republicans refuse to help them and republicans have even slashed mental health funding by cutting grants that help states keep a mental health programs in place  suicidal veterans need a strong mental health system most of all  yet the gop has severely weakened the system for years with treatment like that from their own government  it s no wonder that veterans are committing suicide  they have no support from congress and what little support system they do have is being ruthlessly chipped away by republicans who gleefully use veterans as pawns to improve their political image only to then stab them in the back when they have no further use for them imagine if we actually passed all of these bills to help our veterans instead of passing funding for more war  with better education opportunities and much needed mental and physical healthcare and jobs  veterans would not only feel cared about  they would be cared for and not made to feel like a burden  we could reduce the number of veteran suicides in this country it s an epidemic that must be brought to end and we can start by firing lawmakers who only pretend to love veterans  after all  veterans fought for us  it s time for us to fight for them featured image via flickr
