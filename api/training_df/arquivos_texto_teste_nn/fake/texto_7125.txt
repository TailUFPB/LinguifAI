it s become increasingly common among republicans to desperately cling to the premise that the democratic party is just as screwed up as the gop  it s a convenient idea  after all  if you re staring down the barrel of a donald trump or ted cruz nomination  the only way you can get out of bed in the morning is if you believe the democrats have it just as bad but while the democratic primary has seen its fair share of infighting and controversy  as any close primary between two strong candidates should    the idea that the rug will magically be pulled out from under democrats  handing a presidential victory to a guy like trump is laughably off base  and while it s fine to cling to a desperate wish to stave off a complete mental breakdown over the death of your political party  the problem really begins when republicans start actually believing that fiction it has led to some seriously delusional thinking  complete with stunning leaps of logic and heaping doses of wishful thinking  even  serious  political operatives  like the rnc s spokesman sean spicer  seem to have taken a big swig of the anti hillary kool aid and are spinning the idea that clinton is just days away from being  arrested  rnc spox spicer  dem convention controversy may supplant gop s if clinton gets indicted and  underground movement  gives biden nomination  john harwood   johnjharwood  april    which  msnbc s chris hayes has a dose of cold  hard reality for him while we re writing fan fic  what if instead of fighting batman and superman got married  https   t co   christopher hayes   chrislhayes  april    if this stings a little  but there is no changing the facts  hillary clinton isn t going to just magically wind up in jail over largely manufactured  controversies  like benghazi and her emails  this is republican fan fiction  if she gets the nomination  she will be in it to win it and facing a republican party that is tearing itself apart  the  benghazi hearing isn t going to suddenly bring her down on the flip side  trump  the republican front runner  is almost universally loathed by most demographics  a recent poll found that even half of all white men  white men   say they despise him  his attacks on women  minorities  and common decency have led to some political reporters to make pretty bold predictions about how a trump vs  clinton general election would go  it ain t pretty here s what the map might look like in an election held today  trump s rust belt strength would help him keep mo  in pic twitter com oyueyvwfpg  nate silver     march    the republican party s dirty little secret  polls suggest ted cruz wouldn t do much better  shhh so to paraphrase the late  less than great marco rubio campaign  let s dispel with this fiction that republicans will overcome their trainwreck primary and win by default when hillary clinton goes to jail  with acceptance comes the ability to change  if republicans want to compete at the national level  they need to cut off the gangrenous rot at the center of their political platform and get with the times  this was the very last wild swing to win an election by pandering exclusively to the worst predilections of old white men and it s becoming obvious that the approach no longer works  adapt or die  but don t live in a fantasy world featured image via frontpage mag screengrab
