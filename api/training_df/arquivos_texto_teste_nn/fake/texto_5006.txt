the man who wrote the speech for patricia smith  a k a   benghazi mom   for the gop convention has found that he no longer recognizes his own party  this is someone who calls richard nixon  of all people  an icon of his  it s a strange twist of irony that he d write a speech that ended with   if hillary clinton can t give us the truth  why should we give her the presidency  because nixon was so honest  but that s beside the point  now  richard cross says that hillary is the only choice  despite writing a speech that called her a liar and held her personally responsible for benghazi  in an op ed for the baltimore sun  cross says he s faced with an inconvenient truth about trump versus hillary  despite what i wrote in that nationally televised speech about hillary clinton  i may yet have to vote for her because of the epic deficiencies of my own party s nominee  i have never voted for a democrat for federal office  but when i hear the president criticize the gop nominee  i can t honestly disagree with him  he feels that the main question of the  election is whether muslim americans are full and equal citizens of the u s   and to him  the answer is  yes   also  like the rest of the sane world  he thinks trump s racist  anti immigrant rhetoric is just plain terrible  now  the question becomes  can we come together and find a positive solution to the issue of illegal immigration  just like president reagan and congressional democrats were able to achieve  the answer to that is   we must   with the addition of the white supremacy  conspiracy theory peddling stephen bannon as campaign ceo  trump s message and behavior are only going to get worse  paul manafort and the gop itself have completely failed to rein him in  and he s surrounded himself with sycophantic clones  the only people who will give him everything he wants  except a win in november  cross is not thrilled about the prospect of voting for hillary  and still doesn t have much to say about her that s good  the idea of voting for her makes him very uncomfortable  but the man who asked if we can trust her with the presidency when we can t trust her to tell the truth dropped this truth bomb at the end of his op ed  but the only prospect more terrifying than voting for hillary clinton is not voting for her the reality of american politics today is  she is the only choice  for someone who was able to compose an entire speech raking her over the coals her for benghazi  that s a hell of a turnaround featured image by mark makela getty images
