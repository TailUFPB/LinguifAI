ever since president barack obama entered the white house  the republican party has done whatever they could to undermine his authority and sabotage his efforts to improve america  this couldn t have been more clear when the gop threatened to block any nominee the president chose to replace the late supreme court justice antonin scalia a few weeks ago according to south carolina senator and senate judiciary committee member lindsey graham  this is just  going to be the new rule   on thursday  graham announced during a committee meeting that the senate would block any nominee that would be appointed if it was within a year before an election  graham said  we are setting a precedent today  that in the last year of a lame duck eight year term that you cannot fill a vacancy in the supreme court  based on what we re doing here today  that s going to be the new rule  we re headed to changing the rules  probably in a permanent fashion  this new strategy from the gop to not even consider a supreme court nominee differs greatly from what republicans had originally described as a  tradition  graham insisted that he just wants to have a nominee that will be chosen by the next president  but it seems to be more personal  to be completely honest  this is the first time the judiciary committee has refused to hold a hearing for a nominee since it began holding hearings for nominations   and it s because the gop takes major issue with obama  with graham s statement above  the goper basically just admitted that this is the first time in history that such a blockade has occurred you can watch graham admit to his party s childish behavior below it is obama s constitutional obligation as potus to choose a nominee  and despite the resistance from the senate  the president has been going forward and fulfilling his job duties  unlike republicans like graham and majority leader of the senate mitch mcconnell  the president is expected to announce a nominee within the next few days  featured image via john premble via flickr
