if you re like me  listening to the sound of sarah palin s voice alone  regardless of what she says  is like being stabbed through the skull with a series of high school geometry class protractors  only then do i begin to actually absorb the nonsensical content of what she s saying  but  of course  leave it to the internet to take the pain away a youtuber called tronovitch assembled the first what will inevitably be many autotune remixes of palin s incoherent trump speech  this one is built around palin s white trash tendencies  illustrated by the mashed up use of the phrase  hee haw  as well as the  television show of the same name while we re here  is there anyone else in politics who s less self aware than palin  she seems to believe that liberals and the  lamestream media  are terrified of her because she goes rogue and challenges the establishment  she appears to be completely unaware of the fact that everyone outside of her retirement aged fanboys are laughing at her   her and her idiot strength  consequently  she doesn t seem to grasp that she s embarrassing herself by going full dumbstupid   you never go full dumbstupid  she seems to believe that her speaking style is a threat rather than a source of accidental self satire  in other words  every time she appears in public  she ratchets up her act  thinking that it ll totally flummox liberals  but in reality it just comes off as full dumbstupid  frankly  it s one of many tell tale signs that she s totally ensconced in white trashery  which is often indicated by poor judgment and horrendously bad taste suffice to say  she clearly doesn t know  and if she s been told how insanely ridiculous she sounds  she s not paying attention   which is yet another sign of being white trash  besides  if she stops  the comedy ends  and that d be a tragedy featured image via video screen grab
