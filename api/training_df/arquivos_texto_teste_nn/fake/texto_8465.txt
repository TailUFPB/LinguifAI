pastor james david manning is one of the most vocally homophobic preachers in america  he is the leader of atlah worldwide church  and has made such disgusting public statements as  jesus would stone homos   and tried to accuse gay people of spreading ebola through starbucks coffee  well  pastor manning is finally getting his comeuppance  because a judge has ordered that his hateful church be put up for public auction the reason for the order is that manning has not been paying his church s bill  dna info reports that manning has nine tax liens against the church s property  the debts include  but are not limited to manning  however  is as delusional as ever  and insists that he didn t know about the auctioning of his church until last week  this seems to be a flat out lie  though  as his lawyers responded to the case as early as october   which is a month after the case was opened  manning also plans to go against the auction order  which was filed by judge joan kenny on december     manning says of the auctioning of his church  i assure you  it s about a water bill and a tax that can t be levied against this church  i think it s a land grab quite frankly  though the church is  like all others  tax exempt  manning seems to be unable to comprehend that being a tax exempt religious institution does not mean that he does not have to pay his bills  to that end  whatever appeals he might make to stop the auction will likely prove fruitless  the auction will be held on february  this is all to the good  as the community can now be effectively free of manning and his followers  constant and unending stream of homophobic hate speech  harlem will definitely be a better place featured image via screen capture from the manning report on youtube
