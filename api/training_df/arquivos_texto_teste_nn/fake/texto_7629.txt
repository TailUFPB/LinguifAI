the gop is known for its misogyny  this is especially true of those currently running for president on that side of the aisle  so  it is only fitting that misogynist insults often used by men are turned on these guys  and full frontal host samantha bee did just that on monday s edition of her show women are often accused of being  too emotional  to be in certain positions  but the mudslinging and childish insults that have peppered the gop debates and campaign trails show that men can be just as emotional   in their cases inappropriately so  bee started her first segment with a eulogy for the death of the republican party in the wake of the absolute national embarrassment that is their presidential primary  then turned on the candidates themselves  she began  i don t mean to sound sexist  but i think men are just too emotional to be president  bee then pointed out what everyone knows  saying that the gop establishment knows that the donald trump candidacy is doing to their brand what his a shole son does to real elephants  this narrative within the establishment has made old time gopers like former presidential nominee mitt romney and arizona senator john mccain try to urge people within the party not to support trump bee says that this won t do any good  though  if past efforts by romney are any indication  because when  tried to stand between a charismatic guy and the white house  you got beat like a muslim girl at a trump rally  samantha been is absolutely correct here  trump will likely be the gop s nominee  and that is absolute nightmare for them  he s an openly racist  misogynist  xenophobic asshole who bears some startling and disturbing resemblances to adolf hitler  and we all know how that ended you re done  gop   and you did it to yourselves  good riddance watch samantha bee s brilliant takedown below featured image via screen capture
