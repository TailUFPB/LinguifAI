claire mccaskill is very clever  instead of outwardly calling trump a  phony bloviated god damned fool  outright  she disguised it as something former democratic president harry truman would have said  and all while saying that  she smacked down  historian  newt gingrich after the former speaker of the house made a tweet equating truman to trump  mccaskill  a clinton supporter  really let him have it for a history guy you don t know much about harry truman he d call out trump as a phony bloviating god damned fool  https   t co   claire mccaskill   clairecmc  august    from mccaskill s accurate description of trump  gingrich really should brush up on his truman history  before being tapped to the vice presidency  truman was a united states senator for  years and the elected presiding judge of jackson county  missouri for  years before that  not only that  he wasn t a millionaire   he was a farmer  a haberdasher  and had deep connections to political mob bosses truman was no outsider  and trump isn t an outsider  as a billionaire real estate mogul who has touted bloomberg  the clintons and putin as his friends  it s hard to consider him an outsider  which is why mccaskill s assessment is spot on sadly  politicians  especially on the republican side  have been pussyfooting around calling trump out for what he really is  but claire mccaskill is not shy when it comes to voicing how she really feels between nancy pelosi basically saying trump is spewing b s   elizabeth warren lambasting him as a  pathetic  two bit dictator and now this  the women are grabbing the reins and honing in the conversation  and it s about time gingrich should stick to what he knows best   staying out of the way and losing  like his dreamboat candidate donald trump thank you  senator mccaskill  for saying what we re all thinking  and thank you for killing two birds with one stone featured image via aaron s  bernstein getty images
