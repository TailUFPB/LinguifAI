speaker paul ryan put on a public temper tantrum after fbi director james comey came out and said he and his team did not believe that hillary clinton broke the law when she set up a personal email server ryan sent a request that instead of how presidential candidates are traditionally treated  that clinton be denied intelligence briefings that are given once she becomes the official nominee of the democratic party his petulant request has just been denied director of national intelligence james clapper told ryan in a letter obtained monday by cnn that he  does not intend to withhold briefings from any officially nominated  eligible candidate  ryan made the request after clinton was severely criticized by the fbi for her email use  but not punished  nominees for president and vice president receive these briefings by virtue of their status as candidates  and do not require separate security clearances before the briefings   clapper wrote to ryan   briefings for the candidates will be provided on an even handed non partisan basis  ryan s request is even more ridiculous when his own party s nominee is donald trump  earlier in the year  intelligence experts expressed concerns that trump would be given these briefings  as he has shown time and time again a complete disregard for how things are to be handled with sensitivity at the presidential level the speaker himself has expressed concerns on multiple occasions about trump s temperament  admitting that his campaign sent an anti semitic tweet and that trump s remarks about a latino judge were racist  yet ryan has not raised any objections about trump receiving intelligence briefings conservatives have repeatedly whipped themselves up into a frenzy  believing that investigations into the benghazi attack would take down president obama  and now secretary clinton  the probe into the email was an outgrowth of that frustration  and has now turned into a big zero  again featured image via flickr
