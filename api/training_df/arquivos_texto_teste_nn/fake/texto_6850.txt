republicans aren t very smart about a lot of things  but one of their most unfortunate mental deficits is in their awareness of what they sound like to the rest of the world  whether they simply are too dumb to know  or they just don t care  the way they portray america to the rest of the world is a damned embarrassment to the nation one of the worst sources of this global shame is easily donald trump  for obvious reasons  his stupidity  empty talk  hate and chest beating are dragging us back to pre obama levels of global ridicule  however  now things are taking a departure from simple mockery and turning into a serious international incident north korea is now using trump s rhetoric regarding nuclear proliferation  and the fact thath e is actually advocating using them  as justification for not backing down on their nuclear program  this is the same north korea that only about a month ago wanted to have their nuclear weapons ready to fire at a moment s notice  and promised to expand their arsenal ri jong ryul  deputy director general of the institute of international studies in pyongyang had this to say  donald trump s remarks are totally absurd and illogical  the u s  tells us to give up our nuclear program  is preparing a nuclear attack against us  and on the other hand would tell its allies to have nuclear weapons  isn t this  a  double standard  source  cnnnorth korea was difficult enough to deal with on their best days  now  they hear a person that could be the presidential nominee of the most war loving political party in modern american history advocating for more nuclear weapons to be developed  as well as the actual use of them against nations like north korea  perhaps one day republicans will understand that people outside of the u s  also do listen to our politics  but sadly that doesn t seem to be today featured image via mother jones
