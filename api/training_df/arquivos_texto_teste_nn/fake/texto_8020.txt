a desperate jeb bush held a campaign rally at a south carolina golf course on wednesday  and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the south carolina primary approaches  but his worried fans had different concerns like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied  one bush supporter named edward scott told bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by trump because his message is being lost the more bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul  your message doesn t resonate with the national community    i was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because i think that s who you are and i think they try to knock you off center  it appears you do get knocked off center  like anyone would  because of the insults to your family  i don t think i feel shaken up by the bully   bush replied   i m the only guy going after the guy who i believe is hijacking the party  david villinger also voiced concern about trump taking over the race while bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message  i think the campaign has been co opted by the p t  barnum of our time  and i think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today  but i think i would encourage you to emphasize those things  indeed  jeb bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind trump  who leads the field with  percent while bush only has under  percent cruz clocks in at second place with  percent and rubio is a close third place with  percent  clearly  nobody is really all that excited about jeb in the end  jeb bush not only received advice  he got bad news because south carolina governor nikki haley endorsed marco rubio even after jeb sent his brother to meet with her  jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm  it s all been decided  apparently  the pundits have already figured it out  we don t have to go vote  i should stop campaigning maybe  and that s probably the best idea jeb bush has had throughout his entire campaign  featured image from flickr
