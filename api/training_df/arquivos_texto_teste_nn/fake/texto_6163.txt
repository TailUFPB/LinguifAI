donald trump has a strategy to defeat hillary clinton  and that s to re litigate decades of anti clinton conspiracy theories   theories that should have been put to bed years and years ago the ugliest of those theories is that hillary clinton had her friend vince foster murdered   this despite the fact that numerous investigators  including clinton attack dog kenneth starr  have said that foster s death was suicide and now his sister is speaking out here s more on trump s accusation in an op ed in the washington post  sheila foster anthony  sister of vince foster  said this to trump it is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy  but such is the character of donald trump displayed in his recent comments to the washington post  in this interview  trump cynically  crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother  vincent w  foster jr   may have been murdered because  he had intimate knowledge of what was going on  and that hillary clinton may have somehow played a role in vince s death how wrong  how irresponsible  how cruel                                                 five investigations  including by independent counsels robert b  fiske jr  and kenneth starr  concluded that vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep  unable to work  unable to think straight  and finally to take his own life anthony goes on to say that she and her brother were very close and that he called her a few days before he died saying that he needed help for depression  she found three psychiatrists  but help wasn t early enough  he killed himself three days later  that was only the beginning of her nightmare  the right took the story of foster s suicide and tried  desperately to pin it  and everything else  on the clintons these outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain because this issue went on for so long and these reports were so painful to read  for years  our family had to wage a court fight to prevent release of photographs of vince s dead body  my heartbroken mother was plagued by harassing phone calls from a reporter anthony has kept mostly quiet throughout the years  but trump bringing this up again  many years after this has been settled  is too painful for her  and for her family  to endure the fact is  that trump will stop at nothing to appease his ego and win the ultimate political prize  this election will be ugly  a lot of people  who have put the past behind them  will have old wounds opened  hillary clinton  like all political candidates  is flawed  but she s not a murderer and to imply so is beyond unethical  trump is only proving that he s not fit for office  any office featured sketch of vince foster via wikipedia  featured image of hillary clinton via mark wilson at getty images
