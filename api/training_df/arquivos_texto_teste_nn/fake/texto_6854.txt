corey lewandowski got some good news last week when the state s attorney for palm beach  florida announced that he was dropping the charges against him and is now saying he is ready to move on  but don t expect trump s abusive campaign manager to admit he did something wrong or apologize for it lewandowski appeared on fox news sunday  and chris wallace asked if he had any intention of apologizing to michelle fields  in the interest of avoiding unnecessary litigation  which i know republicans don t like  are you prepared here and now to apologize to ms  fields for touching her and for saying that she was delusioned  the campaign manager responded exactly the way you d expect trump s right hand man to respond  here and now i d like to say i ve never spoken to ms  fields  i turned over my phone records to the palm beach county district attorney s office  it clearly shows i called her phone number that evening  i read about this on the twitter feed  i d be happy to have a conversation with her  but to apologize to somebody i ve never spoken to and candidly don t remember ever having any interaction with is something that is a little unrealistic right now  he added   this is a person i ve never spoken to and i d be happy to have that conversation if we can put this thing behind us  just like his boss  lewandowski is incapable of admitting that he was wrong  he still refuses to apologize to the woman he assaulted and called names even though there is video evidence proving he did it  he  like trump  thinks that he can just walk through life and do whatever he wants without ever suffering any consequences and unfortunately  palm beach prosecutors reaffirmed this by not pursuing the charges ms  fields has likely had her career ruined  while this jackass gets to proceed as if nothing happened  lovely  isn t it featured image via joe raedle getty images
