the tribeca film festival is one of the most respected artistic events in the film industry  however  it has been embroiled in controversy as robert deniro and other organizers had allowed a film into the festival that pushes anti vaxxer nonsense  deniro had originally insisted that the film should be shown  in order to show alternative viewpoints regarding the vaccination debate  however  after the public was rightfully outraged that deniro was giving credibility to these anti science viewpoints  he released the following statement  saying that the film would not be shown  my intent in screening this film was to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me and my family  but after reviewing it over the past few days with the tribeca film festival team and others from the scientific community  we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion i had hoped for  of course  the people behind this piece of propaganda are screaming that its removal from the film festival is censorship  their statement on the development says  to our dismay  we learned today about the tribeca film festival s decision to reverse the official selection of vaxxed  from cover up to catastrophe  it is our understanding that persons from an organization affiliated with the festival have made unspecified allegations against the film   the statement continued   we have just witnessed yet another example of the power of corporate interests censoring free speech  art  and truth  tribeca s action will not succeed in denying the world access to the truth behind the film vaxxed  the film is directed by none other than andrew wakefield  the doctor who started the whole anti vaxx movement with a bogus study in   his so called research has been completely discredited  but the damage has been done  the anti vaxx movement is stronger than ever  and is a major public health risk  this isn t about censorship  it s about protecting the lives and health of the public i am very glad that robert deniro did the right thing and pulled this ridiculous film from the film festival  this movement does not need anymore juice than it already has featured image via frenchculture org
