last week  president trump stepped in and interceded on behalf of three young ucla basketball players who foolishly were caught shoplifting in china  shoplifting in china is not treated lightly and most likely would have resulted in a prison term for all three young men  president trump was able to convince china s president xi  however  to release the three young men from custody  when asked how the loudmouth father of  liangelo ball felt about president trump helping to secure the release of his son  liangelo  lavar ball suggested the president had little to do with the matter  who   ball told espn when asked about trump s involvement in the situation   what was he over there for  don t tell me nothing  everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out  they try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes   i m from l a  i ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses  president trump took to twitter to reply to lavar ball s ignorant comments now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail  lavar ball  the father of liangelo  is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal  i should have left them in jail   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    who is this crackpot lavar ball  and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the president of the united states just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country   andrew stephens of the armchair all americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self serving  money  and fame obsessed lavar ball really is  in his article  stephens reveals a sick man  who is so controlling of his  sons and their basketball careers  that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital  over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand  on march     andrew stephens of armchair all americans published an article about lavar ball titled lavar ball  the epitome of what is wrong with modern sports  it touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children stephens claimed that in the article  without commenting on upbringing tactics  i attempted to delve into lavar ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit about an hour after the article was run  i received a comment on it from a member of the ball family  who wishes to remain anonymous  the comment  which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter  read as follows   wow  you nailed it  although you don t even know the half of it  lavar took over the high school program  added the coach  his puppet  which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year  and lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court  if you are allowed to shoot at any time from any where and never come out of the game  any decent idiot could score  points also  tina ball  his wife had a stroke on feb   she had life threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife    at the chhs vs  lb poly game with his sons  including lonzo  he still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him  and cause bbb sales to diminish   in   ca   tina is there now and he only visits for  hour a few days a week  while her mother has yet to leave her side  pathetic    i was a bit skeptical when i initially viewed the comment  i figured that it was someone attempting to drive a smear campaign against the ball family  seeing how lavar was such a polarizing figure  but  the information was oddly specific after a bit of deliberation  i contacted the email address listed with the comment  they confirmed through multiple email and social media confirmations that they were  in fact  a close relative of lavar and tina ball  i also spoke with the hospital listed in the email  the hospital confirmed that tina ball was checked in as of   pm est on march  tina  who was very active on twitter  stopped communication on february   which fits in with the timeline provided below by a member of the ball family watch this video as the loud mouth  obnoxious lavar ball is interviewed on the skip and shannon undisputed sports show one of the first questions the female host asked of lavar was about his desire to have a reality show made about him and his family  keep in mind  this interview took place shortly after a very serious stroke   it s hard not to pick up on the sadness expressed on the face of his oldest son lonzo ball  while his overbearing father dominates the conversation and makes a complete ass of himself when confirming the identity of the member of the ball family that commented via email  we received another large piece of harrowing information  notice  she is not at any games  she is not at work  and she is not at home  someone needs to ask the question  where is tina  she is severely disabled and paralyzed on right side  cannot talk and is questionable about her comprehension  left side of her brain impacted with massive stroke  while at home on feb    school holiday   president s day   tina is a pe teacher in  ca  feb    tina ball admitted at  icufeb    surgery to remove a portion of her skull to reduce swelling from the stroke  evening feb   chino hills vs lb poly   cerritos college   evening game  same time as surgery  lavar   lonzo at the game with the other ball boys   missed the surgery and post op  did not come to hospital during or after surgery  the ball boys are not allowed to see their mother  lavar is afraid it will take away from their game s   lonzo had big game at asu and u of a later that week  also  media buzz would take away from all the interviews and media touring for lavar   bbb brand would suffer  it literally is bigger than tina s life  as evidenced by lavar s approach  as a family member  i am embarrassed and feel so sorry for tina  since lavar is on a media tour  he visits her rarely  while her mother has stayed by her side continuously  the crux of the original story was rooted in that fact that lavar ball s priorities were self motivated and not for the betterment of a  family brand   after hearing the explicit details given to us  if these allegations are true   it only confirms one thing for lavar ball  money and fame are king lavar recently attempted to sell his ball s big baller brand for a billion dollars  when major shoe companies laughed at his offer  he raised his price to  billion dollars  how ball ever got his product line this far is really quite amazing   when lavar ball said he wanted   billion for a big baller brand co branding shoe deal for his three sons  the big shoe companies scoffed after that rejection  big baller brand released lonzo ball s first signature shoe  the   and decided to charge a minimum of   for a pair  lavar told colin cowherd on wednesday that companies like nike  adidas and under armour will regret not forking over   billion and that he s decided to raise the price for a deal  now that lonzo s headed to los angeles  what they should have done is give me a billion dollars and let me be on my way   lavar said  referring to the lakers drawing the no   pick in next month s nba draft but now  apparently  the draft lottery results tripled big baller brand s value  now you know if they want to talk to me now  it just went up to   billion  triple b s billion  billion  billion   he told sports illustrated lavar had a chance to fix his embarrassing error of disrespecting the president for the gift he gave their family  but instead chose to double down on stupid  in one of the most painfully ignorant interviews you will ever witness  with cnn s chris cuomo
