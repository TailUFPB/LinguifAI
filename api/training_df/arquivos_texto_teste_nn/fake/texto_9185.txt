chicago mayor rahm emanuel is really working hard to make chicagoans feel a part of the city the only problem is he s focusing his efforts on the illegal aliens who live there  to add insult to injury  chicago s murder rate is sky high with no end in sight but  but  but the illegals have a new  fancy  id to give them the same benefits as everyone else in the city at a cost of millions to taxpayers  the card is free to the freeloaders while the taxpayers foot the bill the name  municipal id  was initially floated for the program  but emanuel revealed that chicago s city ids would actually be called  city keys  he said city keys were designed to give a person who doesn t have an id or a driver s license essentially the same benefits as those who do   when somebody says   can i see your driver s license     what that unlocks and what that smooths out and all the speed bumps that literally get eliminated because you have a driver s license   emanuel said the mayor says the ids will also provide benefits including discounts at cultural centers  on public transit and for veterans and senior citizens at locations across the city  chicagoans will be able to link their public transit and library card to the id and potentially even open bank accounts with it critics of the program say it might be a way for undocumented workers or people illegally in the u s  to obtain a valid id great point read more  fox news
