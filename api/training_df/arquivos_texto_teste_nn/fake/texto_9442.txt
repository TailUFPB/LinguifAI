one of the many targets of the opposition research firm fusion gps is accusing them of assisting the kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed  the strong allegation comes from bill browder  a london based banker who spearheaded the magnitsky act  a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the russian government browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that fusion gps and its founder glenn simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to yuri chaika  russia s prosecutor general  and to donald trump jr  during the infamous june  trump tower meeting  if it is true that glenn simpson was supplying information about me to the russian government  it s far more serious than smear campaigning or foreign agents registration act violations   said browder  the head of hermitage capital  it would mean that simpson was assisting the putin regime in their plot to get me back to russia to have me imprisoned and killed it was previously known that the washington  d c based fusion gps s investigation of browder was beneficial to the russian government and its effort to reverse the magnitsky act  but it was revealed only last week that information fusion collected on browder was shared directly with chaika  whose position is the russian equivalent of the u s  attorney general natalia veselnitskaya  the russian attorney who attended the trump tower meeting  is who provided both chaika and trump jr  with the fusion generated information on browder  she took a four page report into the june    trump tower meeting  which was attended by jared kushner and then campaign chairman paul manafort veselnitskaya worked with simpson  a former wall street journal reporter  on the anti browder project  reuters reported on thursday that simpson compiled the research for the trump tower memo  and nbc news reported on friday that similar research put together by simpson was given by veselnitskaya to chaika in oct   browder  who was born in chicago but is a british citizen  is a target of the kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the magnitsky act  which passed congress in   the russian government recently issued an interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend browder  vladimir putin reportedly approved the move against the  year old money manager  who wrote a book about his travails called  red notice   a reference to the term used for interpol warrants fusion gps  which is based in washington  d c   became involved in the browder matter after being hired by bakerhostetler  a law firm representing denis katsyv  a russian businessman who faced penalties because of the magnitsky act simpson worked closely on the investigation with the moscow based veselnitskaya  who represents katsyv and his firm  prevezon holdings veselnitskaya s affiliation with simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the trump tower meeting and the dossier  which was funded by the clinton campaign and dnc theories have circulated that fusion gps arranged the trump tower meeting in order to compromise the trump campaign or that simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by veselnitskaya to christopher steele  the former british spy who wrote the dossier fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by bakerhostetler to investigate browder adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that simpson and veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the trump tower session busted  meeting between fusion gps and russian lawyer before and after the co founder of fusion gps  the firm behind the unverified trump dossier  met with a russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with trump jr  the contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to russian interests  at a time when it was financing research to discredit then candidate donald trump the opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the dnc and hillary clinton s campaign paid for that research  congressional republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the fbi s investigation of russian collusion with the trump campaign   making fusion s  contacts with russian interests all the more relevant dnc money funneled through law firm to fusion gps the june  trump tower meeting involving donald trump jr  and russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period  bank records show fusion gps was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a kremlin linked oligarch while paying a former british spy christopher steele to dig up dirt on trump through his russian contacts but hours before the trump tower meeting on june     fusion co founder and ex wall street journal reporter glenn simpson was with veselnitskaya in a manhattan federal courtroom  court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together  they also were together after the trump tower meeting read more  fox newsread more  daily caller
