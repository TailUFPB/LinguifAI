a house tea party republican declared that conservatives own christianity during an attack against president obama in his moral defense of granting asylum to thousands of syrian refugees  president obama cited the bible in november to counter anti refugee conservatives  scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger  for we know the heart of a stranger    we were strangers once  too   obama said  my fellow americans  we are and always will be a nation of immigrants  we were strangers once  too  and whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the atlantic  or the pacific  or the rio grande  we are here only because this country welcomed them in  and taught them that to be an american is about something more than what we look like  or what our last names are  or how we worship  indeed  the bible commands christians to love foreigners and treat them with respect and compassion  deuteronomy   states and you are to love those who are foreigners  for you yourselves were foreigners in egypt and leviticus   states the foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native born  love them as yourself  for you were foreigners in egypt the verse president obama referenced is exodus    which states you shall not oppress a sojourner  you know the heart of a sojourner  for you were sojourners in the land of egypt as we all know  republicans are constantly claiming that america is a christian nation and that we must adhere to christian values  so if that is the case  you would think republicans would jump to support president obama and his effort to help refugees who are fleeing war and death in their homeland but they aren t  in fact  they not only oppose president obama  they are attacking him for using the bible against them during an interview with american family radio host sandy rios on monday  virginia rep  david brat argued that president obama can t use the bible to hit back at conservatives because he says the right wing owns christianity  and must indoctrinate people to make sure they are brainwashed to believe that conservatives have a monopoly on christian values  our side  the conservative side  needs to reeducate its people that we own the entire tradition  if you lose the moral argument  you lose the policy argument every time  so we need to reclaim the moral argument  where we re so strong  he also claimed that president obama is using the bible to build federal power  he s using the christian tradition and trying to bring about compassion by bonking republicans over the head with the bible  it s almost a comedy routine on what compassion and love is  he s mocking his enemies in order to compel a larger federal state using the tradition of love  here s the audio via right wing watch so david brat believes that republicans alone own christianity and have the only right to use the bible to push their political agenda  of course  he is assuming that only republicans are christians  which is complete bullshit brat and his fellow conservatives are just pissed that president obama used the bible to reveal them as complete hypocrites  if republicans really gave a damn about what the bible said  they d be pushing for universal healthcare  a stronger food stamp program and would welcome refugees with open arms  but they don t  thereby proving that they are nothing more than opportunistic cherry pickers who abuse religion for their own gain featured image  wikimedia
