pope francis is no fan of walmart or of mcdonalds  or really of many american companies  in a powerful mass at the vatican  he called companies that exploit workers  bloodsuckers  and the people who work there   slaves   he also said the employers were committing a mortal sin during mass at the vatican  he told a story about a girl who found a job working  hours a day for  euros     a month  paid  under the table   this is starving the people with their work for my own profit  living on the blood of the people  and this is a mortal sin   he said at the service in his santa marta residence  without a pension  without health care   then they suspend  the contract   and in july and august  the workers  have to eat air  and in september  they laugh at you about it  those who do that are true bloodsuckers          euros source  reutersit s hard to read those words without imagining that the pope is speaking directly to americans  the united states is the only country in the developed world that doesn t offer universal healthcare  fewer than half of americans have a pension or even a  k   only about half of employers offer any sort of retirement plan before ronald reagan  it was standard for companies to offer pensions and even health insurance  then   k  s which are a gift to wall street  came along  and pensions went away as some employers chose to offer nothing at all not only does this make the companies  bloodsuckers   it s a bad business move  at least for companies that value their employees  because people aren t tied to their jobs with pensions  they are leaving them  the average turnover rate is about  percent a year now  we know how hard republicans fight against basic health care for all  we also know how hard they fight against a living wage  but we hear little about pensions  unless it s about companies stealing pensions from their employees  the pope didn t mention that  bloodsucking  tactic  the fact is  though  that republicans don t like pensions any more than they like healthcare or paid time off  they are doing their best to end them  whether it be public pensions or through destroying unions  remind me  who are the christians here featured image via milos bicanski at getty images
