the warning signs were everywhere forty one year old sara atkinson had stopped taking her medication  according to family members  she was growing increasingly paranoid  she claimed there were bombs planted in her home and thought there cameras hidden inside her five year old son s shoes at one point atkinson had threatened to kill herself and take her son with her shortly before kenny kreuscher s mother put a   rifle to his head as he lay sleeping  the little boy told his father that his mommy had punched him ken kreuscher sr  recorded the conversation with his son  documenting marks left on the child by his mentally ill mother  hoping that someone would intervene over the course of the past year  ken kreuscher had filed numerous police reports and contacted child protective services multiple times  he d gone to court to try to get an order of protection  i ve been telling everyone in court this was a possibility that this would happen   kreuscher said during an interview with denver s kdvr  on march  but while kreuscher raised the alarm over and over  no one intervened on his son s behalf at the beginning of march  the colorado mother left the state with kenny  traveling to roundup  montana on march   while still in montana  she shot the little boy in his sleep  she then turned the gun on herself the five year old died  hours later here s more on the story from kusa there s a fine line between violating the rights of person who has been diagnosed with mental illness and protecting the lives of innocent people under federal law  a person who has been deemed to be a threat to themselves or others is not supposed to be able to possess a gun  the problem with the law  however  is that there are very strict rules about when and how a person with serious mental illness is determined to be a  threat to themselves or others  in the case of sara atkinson  although the people closest to her  including her own son  were sounding the alarm about her mental health  the law offers little help while it s unknown where sara atkinson got the gun that she used to kill herself and her child  there was likely no law preventing her from purchasing or owning a gun  in spite of the warning signs in her behavior restrictions on gun ownership are limited to people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution  people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity in a court of law and people who have been found incompetent to stand trial at one time  local law enforcement officials were far more likely to err on the side of caution  requesting gun permits and licenses be revoked in cases where a person s behavior suggested a potential threat for example  until   local law enforcement officials in tennessee could ask the state to revoke a gun permit in cases where a person  poses a material likelihood of risk to the public  but second amendment nuts challenged the state s law  calling it a violation of gun owner s rights thanks to the nra  all across the country  it has become increasingly difficult to limit anyone s access to a gun today  even when all of the warning signs are there  it s nearly impossible to revoke a person s  right  to own a gun image credit  video screen capture via kusa
