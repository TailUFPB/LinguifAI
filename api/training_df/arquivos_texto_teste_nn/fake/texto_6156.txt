when donald trump recently said he would love to have a debate with democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders during his appearance on  jimmy kimmel live  he probably didn t think it would actually happen   despite the fact that he bragged about how much the debate  would have such high ratings  but it turned out that sanders was more than happy to fulfill the donald s request  knowing full well that he could wipe the debate floor with the presumptive republican nominee on any day of the week and not even break a sweat doing it  in teasing about the debate  trump challenged bernie to raise   million for charity   a mission that sanders immediately accepted by responding on twitter  game on  i look forward to debating donald trump in california before the june  primary  so although trump might have never actually intended on having a face off with the vermont senator and is likely regretting opening his big mouth  for once   it looks like it might actually happen we can t wait to see sanders put trump in his place  and fortunately we have something to hold us over  we can easily get a preview of what the debate is going to look like thanks to the trump vs  bernie web tv series and live tour  which is the genius comedy project of james adomian  bernie  and anthony atamanuik  trump  these two comedians have brought sanders and trump to life with their spot on impersonations  perfectly capturing trump s ability to be offensive and effectively avoid answering direct questions  as well as sanders  unwavering dedication to human rights movements and the middle class  this skit is absolutely brilliant  and really gives us a taste of what we might actually see before trump gets his ass handed to him in real life you can watch the hilarious special below let s just hope trump doesn t  chicken out  of the real debate  sanders  campaign manager  jeff weaver  said bernie is ready to go  we are ready to debate donald trump  we hope he will not chicken out  i think it will be great for america to see these two candidates and the different visions they have for america going forward  what we ll have to see  is does donald trump have the courage to get on the stage with bernie sanders  that remains to be seen  featured image is a screenshot
