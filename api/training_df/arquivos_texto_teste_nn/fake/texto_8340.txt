well  they say all good things must come to an end and for republicans  it s beginning to look like their favorite anti hillary clinton talking point is unraveling right before their eyes  it seems they may have to actually focus on the issues instead of obsessing over a manufactured scandal   i m kidding  of course  at first blush a new nbc news report seems like bad news for clinton and her campaign  journalists seemed to confirm that her emails contained  references  to cia operatives who were conducting espionage overseas  sounds bad  right right wing media outlets certainly wanted to pretend like it was  conservatives gleefully began spreading the narrative that this meant clinton s servers could have led to american cia agents getting killed  newsmax  a cheap fox news knockoff  blared u s  intelligence officials say  top secret  emails hillary clinton kept on her private email server when she headed the state department include the real names of cia spies serving undercover overseas   a violation of federal law that has put the agents in harm s way the readers of newsmax   and other right wing sites   were led to believe hillary s arrest was only moments away nope  not even close the nbc news investigation found that this was a case of more smoke than fire and quite a bit of wishful thinking on the part of conservatives  here s what they found instead  emphasis added  but contrary to some published reports  three officials said there was no email on clinton s server that directly revealed the identity of an undercover intelligence operative  rather  they said  state department and other officials attempted to make veiled references to intelligence officers in the emails   references that were deemed classified when the messages were being reviewed years later for public release catch the differences there were absolutely no direct references to the identities of undercover operatives  no  names  or distinguishing characteristics  no way to know who the emails were referring to  if a terrorist were to find these emails  they would be spectacularly unhelpful making matters even stronger for clinton s case  the emails were only deemed classified years later  at the time she had them  they were considered mundane this falls in line with what clinton has been saying all along  she admits that having the server at her house was a mistake  but it was never a criminal act  and it ultimately put zero cia agents at risk of any danger  the republican charges to the contrary are evaporating under scrutiny if this is all they have against her should she receive the democratic nomination  they are   without doubt   utterly screwed feature image from flickr
