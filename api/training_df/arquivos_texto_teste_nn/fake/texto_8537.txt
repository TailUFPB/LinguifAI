sometimes in life you just need to state the obvious  especially if you re fox news and your viewers still need to be reminded not to eat paste it s pretty common knowledge that a president is only allowed to serve two terms in office  so either the folks over on fox   friends think that their viewers are stupid  they are reminding themselves  or this is brand new information to them and they think they are reporting breaking news for the first time during the segment they showed president obama explaining some of his biggest regrets as president  and how he wouldn t want to run for a third term even if he could  because it would be too big of a toll on his family  it was then that the hosts maneuvered their right wing spin into saying that hillary clinton would be a third term of obama however  the most baffling part of the segment  alongside their love for george w  bush  was when they were literally talking about a third term for obama and what that would mean  brian kilmeade  while reading a tweet that read   i believe he would beat anybody in the current gop crop  decided to follow it up by saying  that could be the case  we ll see  which is when steve doocy had to chime in and remind his cohost alongside viewers at home  but then again  he can t run  so  he wouldn t be running  oh  brian kilmeade  there s a reason bobby moynihan portrays you as so scatterbrained and unintelligent on snl  because you are this really shouldn t be something that has to be explained to anyone in this day and age  but when dealing with fox news and fox news viewers  well  they seem to need a little bit more time to grasp facts and reality  honestly  the look on doocy s face as he explains to kilmeade that obama can t run again is priceless watch for yourself   video featured image  c l
