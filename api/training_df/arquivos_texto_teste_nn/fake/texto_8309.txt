it has been well documented that donald trump s presidential campaign has been endorsed by multiple white supremacist groups  one of the groups supporting trump is the american national super pac  a branch of the organization  the american freedom party  is directing a new robocalling effort to try and connect their message with voters  they called iowans before their caucus  and they are now calling voters in new hampshire here is the message people are hearing when they answer their phones  we don t need muslims  we need smart  educated  white people  i am a farmer and white nationalist  support donald trump  here is a video that lets you hear the three different voices that have contributed to the message https   www facebook com cnnpolitics videos   fref nfone of those voices is that of jarod taylor  tayler is well known white supremacist leader  he is the editor of the white nationalist media outlet  amren  taylor has ties to various white supremacist organizations and has been very vocal in his support for trump  during a segment on cnn  taylor attempted to justify his views  saying  why would we want more muslims  muslims have been a terrible problem for europe  and here they want to pray five times a day  stop the assembly line  they want foot baths before they go to prayer  they want women only swimming pool hours  and some of them want to kill us  why should anyone want more muslims  trump has denounced the endorsement by the group  that being said  it isn t surprising that hate groups have latched on to trump s campaign  so far his campaign has been largely built by exploiting the anti brown hatred held by many conservatives the trend has been that as more gop candidates drop out of the race  their followers flock to ted cruz and marco rubio  so  it seems like taylor and this group of racist friends may have backed the wrong horse to drive home their  white advocacy  agenda  despite getting the media attention  trump s stance on immigration is only nominally different that iowa gop caucus winner  ted cruz  since the group s efforts appear to only be hurting trump  let s hope the group decides to keep up their efforts  backing whoever eventually gets the nomination  in the general election featured image from video screenshot via facebook
