florida senator marco rubio has been going after presidential rival donald trump with a vengeance over the past few weeks  continuously calling out the republican front runner in every way possible   from his lies to his spelling to his offensive and hateful rhetoric on friday  rubio targeted trump s anti muslim comments during an appearance on cnn s  new day   stating that trump needs to tone down the islamophobia because the rhetoric a president puts forth has  life and death consequences   rubio  who pretty much has no hope for becoming the gop nominee  spoke some truth when he said  i know people like it that donald trump says whatever he wants and whatever they feel like saying  presidents cannot say anything they want  presidents have to understand that their words have consequences  often life and death consequences  for real people in the real world  because of trump s inflammatory  foul remarks  rubio said what any level headed american instinctively knows  that trump wouldn t be a  good commander in chief  if he can t work with america s armed service in its entirety   because many of those members are muslims  rubio posed this question  how are you going to face them as commander in chief  knowing you re going around saying all muslims hate the united states  i don t think you re going to be able to be a good commander in chief  you can watch rubio s criticism of the business mogul below these statements from rubio come just one day after rubio slammed trump during thursday s republican debate  stating that defending muslims isn t about being politically correct  after trump insisted that  islam hates us  during the debate  rubio made similar comments to his interview on cnn  i know that a lot of people find appeal in the things donald says  because he says what people wish they could say  the problem is presidents can t just say anything they want  it has consequences  here and around the world  stating that although there are dangers in the world in regards to radical islam  it s wrong to generalize an entire religion  rubio said  there is no doubt that radical islam is a danger to the world  i can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery  especially arlington  you re going to see crescent moons there  if you go anywhere in the world  you re going to see american men and women serving us in uniform that are muslims  rubio s right  whether you agree with him as a presidential candidate or not   and this goes way beyond trump s feelings about the islamic faith  he s demonstrated the same anger and insensitivity toward hispanics  women and many other minority groups  trump s inflammatory  hateful rhetoric has the power and influence to divide this nation instead of unify it  he s taken the most awful aspects of the republican party and amplified them  just by the way his rallies have transformed into fighting arenas  trump has already demonstrated that he approves of violence and cares very little about peace and the well being of americans his bigotry doesn t support  he s dangerous behind comprehension  and his brand of ignorance threatens to destroy america featured image via gage skidmore
