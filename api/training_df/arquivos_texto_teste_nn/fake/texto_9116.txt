the nfl announced tuesday that the final  sunday night football  game of the season has been canceled was it due to low attendance in previous weeks  well  it s part of the reason  low attendance has been plaguing the league since the kneeling controversy took hold recently  a liberal news source tried to downplay the boycott from nfl fans by citing injuries from key star athletes in the nfl as the reason for low interest in games   we think the kneeling controversy has more to do with the lack of interest in games  it s being reported that the attendance is down   from last year we ve seen stadiums with hundreds of empty seats along with low viewership there are a few other reasons why the game was canceled but low attendance was certainly part of it daily caller reports the league had yet to announce who would play during the primetime game next sunday  but with the chance that none of the matchups would have playoff implications for one or both of the teams  they opted not to schedule the game new year s eve the other problem the league faced was broadcasting a game on new year s eve  which would invite lower number of viewers traditionally on that night  we felt that both from a competitive standpoint and from a fan perspective  the most fair thing to do is to schedule all week  games in either the  p m  or   p m  windows   nfl broadcast chief howard katz said in a statement the last time a  sunday night football  game took place on the final night of the year was in  when the chicago bears hosted the green bay packers  that game was hall of fame member brett favre s final game with the packers  despite that fact  the game only drew   million viewers  which for that season was a quarter of the typical audience for  snf  in a season plagued with lower ratings due to the national anthem protests  the league s decision was not surprising
