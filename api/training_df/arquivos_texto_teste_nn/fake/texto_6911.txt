a florida man recently had a tattoo of donald trump inked onto his leg  and the current gop frontrunner really isn t going to like it  it s a naked portrait featuring the trust fund tycoon s reportedly tiny manhood tattoo artist spooks joya  who created the tattoo  spoke to vice about how the artwork came about  saying in an email  i actually saw the original picture by illma gore and thought it was awesome i researched what the piece stood for and couldn t resist not doing it  so i offered to do it for free on anyone who wanted  it started out as a joke but i was surprised people seriously wanted to get it done  men and women  it was nuts   it seems men and women were literally queueing up to pay the ultimate insult to donald trump   and it really is a monstrosity  the tattoo is up on the thigh of a man who remains anonymous  but we do have pictures of the tattoo being completed this might be the appropriate moment to ask  who on earth would do this to themselves  and why  for those unaware of the background  trump has been smarting for a quarter of a century over a slight made against him by journalist graydon carter  the vanity fair writer wrote a negative piece on trump  in which he called him a  short fingered vulgarian   last october  carter published a piece in vanity fair entitled  why donald trump will always be a  short fingered vulgarian   in which he detailed trump s thin skinned response to the criticism  and his refusal to let the matter go  he writes like so many bullies  trump has skin of gossamer  he thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else  but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self image  he coils like a caged ferret  just to drive him a little bit crazy  i took to referring to him as a  short fingered vulgarian  in the pages of spy magazine  that was more than a quarter of a century ago  to this day  i receive the occasional envelope from trump  there is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine  on all of them he has circled his hand in gold sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers and so it was  that trump decided that a primary debate to decide the republican nominee for president of the united states  was the appropriate place to brag about the size of his penis  after marco rubio referenced the sight in a march debate  trump told the crowd  look at those hands  are they small hands   holding his  admittedly stubby  fingers out towards the audience and the cameras  he referred to my hands   if they re small  something else must be small   i guarantee you there s no problem  i guarantee  it seems for one person in particular  the comedy pay off was worth it featured image via flickr creative commons
