muslims care more about the people of flint  michigan than republicans do the republican caused disaster unfolding in michigan is incredibly infuriating  in a penny pinching scheme  governor rick snyder and his emergency management henchmen decided to switch flint s water supply from lake huron to the nearby river  which has been undrinkable for decades due to high levels of lead and other industrial chemicals for well over a year  the residents have been forced to drink and bathe in this water all while republicans insist that the water is perfectly safe so far  republicans have done very little to fix their mess  instead  they been busy trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility  which is why president obama stepped in to do their job for them  and now  muslims are coming to the rescue as well  who is hussain   is an organization honoring the memory of imam hussain ibn ali  a grandson of the prophet muhammad who was killed by extremists by speaking out against violence  he died by being denied water over the course of several days  the organization believes that denying water to any human being is unacceptable and bringing water to those who need it is part of their campaign and the organization has already collected   bottles of fresh drinking water for the red cross to distribute to the residents of flint  even though republicans and conservatives across the state and the nation have demonized muslims repeatedly  despite the hatred and racism hurled against them  they have chosen to help anyway  prophet mohammad taught us  your neighbor comes before your own household   as a resident of detroit this is not only a flint problem this is a michigan problem and i feel obligated to help to the best of my ability   said mohammed almawla  who helped collect water for flint  we saw what needed to be done and we decided to do it   said event organizer dr  aziza asakari   we reached out to schools  neighbors  friends  mosques  anyone and everyone to help us by donating a case of water  or money towards a case  this inspiring story is the very definition of american values  a group of people coming together for the purposes of helping a community in need  no one would blame these muslims for turning their backs on their fellow citizens for the way they have been treated recently  but they chose to come to their aid despite the discrimination they have faced by the right wing in recent months republicans should be ashamed of themselves  they poisoned the citizens of flint  michigan and have failed to take responsibility  governor rick snyder should have resigned by now but he refuses to do so  now muslims are working to provide clean water to the residents in an act of humanity that proves once and for all that conservatives are full of shit whenever they talk about muslims  muslims are helping the american citizens that republicans willingly chose to harm  it s pretty easy to recognize that it is republicans  and not muslims  who are the real threat to our safety and security featured image  washington times
