trey gowdy railed against the erosion of trust between the american people and the doj during a hearing before congress today   i want to start with something that s very important to me   gowdy began   and i think it s important to all people in this country of good conscience  irrespective of their political ideation  and that s the independence of the department of justice  in my judgment   and  have been challenging years for the department of justice  gowdy then went into the various legal procedures for charging citizens  including political players like hillary clinton and former fbi director james comey  mr  conyers asked you whether or not it was appropriate for the president to weigh in on an ongoing investigation   gowdy said   and of course  the answer to that is  no   it is not appropriate  it s not appropriate in   it wasn t appropriate when president obama did it in the irs targeting scandal  it wasn t appropriate when president obama did it in the ongoing investigation into hillary clinton s server  it is never appropriate for a president to tell a department of justice what outcome it would reach  i just wish my friends on the other side of the aisle would have the same kind of outrage when president obama did it as they do now   then gowdy asked a  last question  how do you restore people s trust   republicans and democrats   confidence in a department of justice when it seems like different rules apply depending on who s in power   he asked attorney general sessions gave a direct answer  well  it s a good question and important question   sessions responded   we intend to do our work  according to the established principles of the department of justice  we will not be infected by politics or bias  we will only make decisions we believe are right and just  we re not going to unlawfully use the department to advance a political agenda  i am determined that when the years go by  that people will say this department of justice did not crumble  read more  bpr
