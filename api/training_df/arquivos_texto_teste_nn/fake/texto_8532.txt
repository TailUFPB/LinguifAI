bristol palin had something to say and pondered some questions after tina fey roasted her mommy on saturday night live over the weekend last week  america s village idiot returned to the political stage to endorse donald trump in a rambling incoherent speech that has been lampooned repeatedly by comedians across the country frankly  chris hardwick s mockery of palin s speech on comedy central s  midnight has been my favorite thus far but on saturday  tina fey received yet another opportunity to mock palin in what became an instant classic opening segment on the long running nbc sketch comedy program and of course  sarah palin s demon spawn couldn t resist taking shots at tina fey making fun of her looks and the way she sounds bristol palin commented on the saturday night live sketch on monday by asking  who wore it better  sarah palin or tina fey   in reference to the jacket worn by both ladies  anyway  i think it s funny that the producers of snl couldn t get their hands on the same top my mom wore  because it was sold out   the failed abstinence advocate wrote   i have to admit  the shirt looked great  but i still think my mom wore it better  she then included a poll  which everyone should totally add their vote to  asking who wore it better but that s not all as mentioned earlier  bristol also trashed fey s impersonation of her mom and her looks  i m sure many of you saw tina fey  who sounds nothing like my mom  do a skit based on my mom s endorsement of donald trump i don t know about you  but hearing her fake accent is like nails on a chalkboard for me i may be biased  but i think my mom trumps her in the looks department   especially for having three more kids and seven more years on tina  saturday night live and fey have been clinging to this impersonation a little too long  it s getting pathetic  its been  years  are they desperate for content  or just desperate for viewers  in the interest of fairness  after all  bristol did say she  may be biased   here s a poll asking who s voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard  sarah palin or tina fey  be sure to vote and don t forget to vote on bristol palin s poll  too sarah palintina feyfeatured image  distractify
