apparently  kimmel s okay with throwing half of his audience away over his uncontrollable hate for donald trump and his supporters  the big question is  will parent company abc be okay with kimmel insulting  and driving   of his audience away late night comedian jimmy kimmel said he would perform the same emotionally charged monologues about healthcare and gun violence  again in a heartbeat   despite a drastic reduction in republican viewership of his show  three years ago  i was equally liked by republicans and democrats   kimmel told cbs   sunday morning  of  jimmy kimmel live   which has aired on abc since    and then republican numbers went way down  like  percent  or whatever  and you know  as a talk show host  that s not ideal but i would do it again in a heartbeat  kimmel earned high praise and sharp rebukes for his foray into the healthcare debate in september  an issue that became particularly important to the comic after his six month old son billy was born with a rare congenital heart defect he also garnered similar reactions when he choked up during a monologue imploring congress to act on gun control in the wake of the las vegas massacre earlier in october critics like conservative commentator ben shapiro have slammed kimmel for parading as a  moral arbiter  i m not  i mean  i agree with him  i m nobody s moral arbiter   kimmel told cbs   you don t have to watch the show  you don t have to listen to what i say  a defiant kimmel added that he doesn t say  i don t mind  because he preferred  everyone with a television to watch the show  but if they re so turned off by my opinion on healthcare and gun violence then  i don t know  i probably wouldn t want to have a conversation with them anyway   he continued   not good riddance  but riddance    washington examinerkimmel has been known to mock trump over comments he made to billy bush several years ago about a woman in the privacy of the bus they were traveling on together  jimmy kimmel never counted  however  on this video resurfacing where he asks random women to  feel  what s in his pants and then tell the tv audience what it is  pretty funny  huh  yeah  if you re a misogynist pig
