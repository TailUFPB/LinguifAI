the republican party s  unity  of obstructionism may be crumbling down fast as gop senators line up to meet with president obama s scotus nominee merrick garland  although fourteen republicans have agreed to meet with the overly qualified nominee  they have all pledged they will do so only out of courtesy   and not to consider him however  as usual  there appears to be only one grown up in the room  and that would be senator susan collins  the moderate from maine collins  who has served maine for nearly  years and has often crossed party lines  sat down with garland earlier this week to go over constitutional  issue based questions and what happened after she met with garland  well  for starters  she really seems to like him  telling reporters at the captiol  he has a humility about him  he has clearly thought very deeply about the issues confronting the courts  there was not any question he could not handle and he has a long record of accomplishment  she also referred tom garland as  thorough  and  impressive   saying his answers to her questions raised no red flags and were pretty down the middle as expected but the most telling of all is how the meeting left the senator  breaking from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and judiciary chairman chuck grassley  collins states   the meeting left me more convinced than ever that the process should proceed   meaning hearings should be scheduled and the nominee should have his up or down vote  the next step  in my view  should be public hearings before the judiciary committee so that the issues that we explored in my office can be publicly aired  although collins is convinced  she expressed doubts that her actions would influence other senators who have remained shockingly loyal to grassley and mcconnell  just last week collins said she was utterly  perplexed  at the amount of pettiness exhibited by the senate gop surprisingly  collins has received very little blow back from her own base  that s what happens when politicians actually do what the people want  currently   percent of americans support holding a hearing for garland  including  percent of republicans  featured image via win mcnamee getty
