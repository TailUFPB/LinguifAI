ted cruz has officially quit the  republican presidential race  according to a statement released by his campaign manager jeff roe  this brings an end to the last desperate hope that republicans had to stop donald trump from leading their party directly into the  layer of hell in the  presidential election trump completely smashed cruz  by approximately a  percent margin in the indiana primary  john kasich also technically still existed  coming in with less than  percent of the vote kasich has pledged to stay in the race until either he or trump reach the required threshold of   delegates  aside from most people saying  john who   a reason this is a futile effort is that it s mathematically impossible for him to win enough delegates to beat trump  to put it into context  cruz needed fewer delegates and even he dropped out after trump walked away with a gift wrapped indiana primary win cruz threw in everything including the kitchen sink to secure a win in indiana  he colluded with john kasich in a so called  alliance  to try to swing a heavier vote count towards himself in order to take away from trump s chances  he picked a vp candidate  even though she is universally reviled  what was he thinking    and there was massive super pac money doing ad buys  he even netted the governor s endorsement in the end  it was an embarrassing blowout that told him what everyone has been saying for months  the rnc is speeding towards the edge of a cliff  and trump is in the drivers seat cruz issued some short remarks following his blistering defeat  we left it all on the field in indiana  we gave it everything we ve got but the voters chose another path  so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long term future of our nation  we are suspending our campaign  sourece  cnntechnically speaking  trump still needs to gather more delegates in the remaining primaries before he will win the nomination hands down  but with cruz out and kasich being relegated to obscurity as a gop protest vote  there s really nothing stopping trump from usurping control of the republican party  will you be watching as the republican party has to smile and hand trump his nomination in cleveland featured image via tombstone generator
