in september   stephen henderson  the editorial editor of the detroit free press  used the power of his pen to unjustly attack kid rock  after liberals feared rock might actually be serious about running as a republican contender against the do nothing democrat senator debbie stabenow  as a michigan resident  i can say with a great level of confidence  that besides mike illitch  the now deceased owner of the red wings and detroit tigers  kid rock has done more for the city of detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state  when the illitch s asked detroit legend and philanthropist  kid rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated little caesar s arena  no one could have dreamed that the detroit free press  stephen henderson would have used his position to push a lie  that kid rock  the single father of a black son  and naacp award recipient is a  racist  here s what henderson had to say about kid rock  the man who has done so much for the city of detroit this is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music  who used to wrap his brand in the confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism  no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of african americans pushing back against american inequality  just last week  he trashed colin kaepernick  the former san francisco  quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent  kneeling protest during the pre football game singing of the national anthem  having kid rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to detroiters   nothing less  and the ilitches  who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it  should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling here is how kid rock responded on his facebook page people  pay no attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create   and by the way  fuck the extreme left and the extreme right  they are trying to use the old confederate flag bs  etc  to stir the pot  when we all know none of this would be going on if i were not thinking of running for office  pretty funny how scared i have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people   me racist who do not agree or cower to them   no one had a word to say when we sold out the  shows at lca back in january  my track record in detroit and michigan speaks for itself  and i would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine  i am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of detroit  so suck on that too i am the bona fide king of detroit love and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that  your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our city i am however very disappointed that none of the people  businesses or charities i have so diligently supported in detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and the detroit free press  so for the unforeseen future i will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones i have supported in the past  i would however employ that nan go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people i love  idiots       has al sharpton even paid his back taxes yet  today  the race obsessed stephen henderson  got some very bad news ap   the detroit free press fired stephen henderson  its managing director of opinion and commentary  after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues  the newspaper announced friday free press editor and vice president peter bhatia announced henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years  gannett co  inc   the newspaper s parent company  says henderson s behavior  has been inconsistent with company values and standards  henderson said in a statement to the detroit news and crain s detroit business that he is  stunned  i dedicated  years to this newspaper over three decades  all of it performing at the highest level   henderson said   i may have more to say on this later  but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of detroit  stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for detroit   bhatia said  he added there were no accusations of sexual assault  but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at free press employees ran counter to company policies less than  months ago  henderson appeared on meet the press and called america a racist nation with a racist history rich lowry of the national review appeared with stephen henderson on meet the press to discuss colin kaepernick and other nfl players who disrespect the flag as a way to support black lives matter  henderson argued   some of the words in the national anthem are racist   henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the american flag because he thinks america is a country whose history is racist  henderson told the panel   i think this is a country whose history is racist  whose history is steeped in white supremacy  and the anthem reflects that in its very words    inaudible    lowry responded to henderson by saying   it s also a nation with very important ideals that have worn down those injustices over time and created a more just society  and people have died under that flag for those ideals  watch
