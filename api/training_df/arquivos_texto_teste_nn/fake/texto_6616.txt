if you re a woman you re going to want to deck this asshole for what he just said during an interview with the christian post this week  evangelist nut job kirk cameron said that no matter how wives are treated by their husbands they should be submissive and stay in the marriage because god commands it  wives are to honor and respect and follow their husband s lead  not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband   cameron said before claiming that women should know their role so that the marriage can succeed   when each person gets their part right  regardless of how their spouse is treating them  there is hope for real change in their marriage  in other words  even if she is being beaten daily by her husband and treated like a slave  a wife should always remain submissive and basically let her husband do whatever they want without consequence  and it s all because the bible says so according to cameron  a lot of people don t know that marriage comes with instructions   he said   and  we find them right there in god s word  seriously  this is the  advice  cameron has for women someone should call cameron s wife and make sure she is okay because the former child actor clearly thinks domestic violence is something wives should just ignore instead of saving themselves and getting out of the marriage cameron is  of course  part of the conservative  christian  fundamentalist movement which repeatedly preaches that women are nothing more than common house slaves meant to cook  clean  raise children  and talk only when their husbands give them permission to do so just take pastor steven anderson for instance in february  anderson posted a sermon in which he preached that women should be banned from voting  barred from seeking divorce  prevented from entering the workforce  and ought to be confined to the home where they are submissive to their husbands  the right to divorce your husband is what they mean  you know what they mean  the right to rebel and disobey your husband  the right to divorce him  the right to go out and get a job and make your own money  the right to tell him what to do  the right to go vote for our leaders as if women should have any say in how our country is run when the bible says that  i suffer not a woman to teach  not to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence  here s the video via youtube two years earlier  anderson demanded that women shut their mouths in church so that the men could teach them  you have to wonder if cameron believes that  too anderson has also preached that women shouldn t be allowed to talk  read  or leave the house basically  if conservative  christians  like steven anderson or kirk cameron had their way women would be forbidden to have lives outside of the home and would be under the boot heel of their husbands day in and day out without a say in the matter  and just think  many republican lawmakers agree with them it s a scary thought that should spur women across the country to use their right to vote to put men like cameron and anderson in their place featured image  facebook
