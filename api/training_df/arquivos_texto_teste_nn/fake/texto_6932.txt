congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz s career is in jeopardy as a wave of resentful backlash in the democratic party over corrupt politics has affiliated her with everything that is wrong with establishment politics  her poor leadership and lack of impartiality as chair of the democratic national committee has disenfranchised millions of democrats around the country  and has inspired thousands of progressive independents to not only support senator bernie sanders for president  but her democratic primary challenger  tim canova  as well refusing to take money from corporations or super pacs  mr  canova has raised over    in the first quarter of  from small donations averaging   each  ms  wasserman schultz s flailing public image began its downward spiral after allegations surfaced she rigged the debate schedule of the democratic primaries to shield hillary clinton  on whose campaign she served as co chair in   from exposure now debbie wasserman schultz is shielding herself from exposure by refusing to debate her democratic primary challenger  on april   tim canova tweeted a video clip of a debbie wasserman schultz s district director  jodi bock davidson  swatting a cell phone out of one of mr  canova s campaign staffers hand after asking debbie wasserman schultz if she would agree to a debate  most staffers of politicians would have lost their job after such an incident  but debbie wasserman schultz  who is no stranger to dirty politics  most likely applauded the response  mr  canova told a local south florida newspaper he has sent three letters to the debbie wasserman schultz campaign requesting to schedule a debate and has yet to receive any response  he has also started a petition on his campaign website for debbie wasserman schultz to debate him  debbie wasserman schultz continues to remain silent regarding his inquiries  she has often dodged questions about her primary opponent  hoping his surge will go away on its own if she ignores it  she told the miami herald tim canova won t change her campaign strategy  which makes little sense as she has never been challenged in her democratic primary since she entered congress in  until now  and her congressional district consists overwhelmingly of democrats  it s no different than any other election i have  i have been on the ballot virtually every time  i do the same thing no matter whether i have primary opposition   she said in the interview ms  wasserman schultz also dodged a question regarding why she thinks tim canova has gained the popularity he has  i really don t know   answered ms  wasserman schultz   i am focused as i usually do on my own campaign  doing the best job i can to represent my constituents and that s my first responsibility is to do my job in congress  to help elect a democratic president and to make sure that in running for re election people know the work i have done on their behalf  i m not remotely paying attention to what my opponent does  apparently  not remotely paying attention to her opponent is synonymous with ignoring their requests to debate so voters can grasp a sense of where the two candidates differ on important issues to the constituency base  ms  wasserman schultz s failure to engage with tim canova in a debate setting is undemocratic and sets a terrible example for the rest of the democratic party from its own chair featured image via flickr
