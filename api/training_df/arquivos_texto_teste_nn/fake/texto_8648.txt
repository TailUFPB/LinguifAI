maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio is a vile creature  the  year old has reigned over the arizona county for more than twenty years  much to the dismay of the hispanic community  and he s running for office again  but  the way he is soliciting donations from his scared  xenophobic supporters this time around is absolutely infuriating in an email sent out to supporters recently  america s most racist sheriff extorts money from his ignorant voters by threatening to retire  the email s subject line is  announcement  i ve made a difficult decision  and begins by calling on his  patriots  to support him or else  after hours of prayer  and countless frank discussions with my wife ava and other trusted advisors  i have decided my time as sheriff is over  unless i can count on you to stand with me this election  arpaio then goes on to blame  left wing elites   his immigration stance   obama s political machine   and  hollywood leftists  for the tough road he has ahead of him should he decide to run for re election  he tells his supporters that they need to empty their wallets and help him defeat the scary liberals who want to see him out of office  for some of you   is all you can spare today  but for others   or even    is a sacrificial gift you are willing to make  my team has told me that because our reserves are almost completely drained i will need to raise at least  million dollars to have a fighting chance  so every single dollar helps  to be clear  this is absolutely   percent extortion  the definition of which is  the practice of obtaining something  especially money  through force or threats  he is threatening that he will retire and not bother to run again unless his faithful  immigrant hating supporters shell out money for him  he doesn t just tell them he d like to be their sheriff again  he threatens them  and this isn t the first time he has duped voters in   he sent an email out with a similarly deceiving subject line  they re trying to recall me   nobody was trying to recall him at the time  i mean  we always want to recall him but there wasn t a concerted effort to remove him from office it s not surprising that he would stoop to such levels  this is  after all  the man who can be blamed for countless deaths in his jail and has made the lives of latinos in his community a living hell  he was donald trump before donald trump was donald trump  his bombastic  hate filled rhetoric garnered him the support of many top republicans   including former governor jan brewer since   he has unleashed hell on brown skinned people in his phoenix  and sadly  every time he is up for re election he wins because people just don t vote or they have become complacent  for whatever reason  he continues to sail to victory each time he runs hopefully  maricopa county voters will be so turned off this newest extoruion plot and they ll vote for someone else   but  i won t hold my breath see the full email below    and here s a video to remember why we hate this guy so much  featured image via facebook
