sometimes all you can do is laugh at the stupidity of fox news  which is exactly what vermont senator bernie sanders just did when discussing taxes for the wealthy and ridiculous wealth inequality the democratic presidential candidate appeared on fox news with chris wallace this past sunday  and one of the things that the fox host tried to grill sanders on was to question the claim that the economy is  rigged  for the one percent wallace tried to make his point by pointing out that in  the top one percent paid   of all federal income taxes  as compared to now where they pay    however  he clearly doesn t understand math  which actually falls right into sanders  argument that the system is  in fact  rigged for the very wealthy to keep getting wealthier without paying their fair share of taxes wallace asks sanders  if the wealthy have rigged the system  why have they done such a lousy job of it  this is when bernie literally laughs out loud and responds to the condescending wallace  ohhh  chris  i think you re missing the major point here  and that is  what we have seen in recent years is a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent whose percentage of wealth in america has doubled  we re talking about trillions of dollars going from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent  wallace then tries to blame president obama  because of course  but sanders responds  these are policies that have gone on for a long long time under republican administrations and democratic administrations  now  are we better off today than we were when president bush left office and we were losing   jobs a month  of course we are  but for the last  years what we have been seeing is a middle class disappearing  people working longer hours for low wages  and today  as it happens    of all new income is going to the top one percent  that s a rigged economy to my mind  chris  and if they are earning   of all new income  they should be paying   of all tax revenue  but they re not  the system is rigged for them to get away with paying less and less with a lower tax burden due to loopholes and deductions those who make far less don t get the opportunity to take advantage of sanders is exactly right  and good for him for laughing in the face of fox news  it s about time someone did featured image from youtube
