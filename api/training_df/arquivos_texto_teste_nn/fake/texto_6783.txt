like clockwork  the dregs of the conservative movement crawled out of their holes  and twitchy comment sections  to stand with disgraced  now former espn analyst curt schilling  his principal defender  sarah palin  a woman with enough hate in her heart to spread it around generously and with absolutely no job she could risk losing by doing so the one time baseball great had finally struck out with espn after posting  yet another  ugly hate filled facebook rant to his followers  having been repeatedly warned by the network that his unabashed bigotry was out of line and needed to be curtailed if he wanted to continue to be a public figure  schilling decided it would be a great time to begin bullying transgender people  on his page  he shared a conservative meme that depicts a man dressed as a woman with a caption reading  let him in  to the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow minded  judgmental  unloving  racist bigot who needs to die    after the initial blowback  schilling created a blog post defending his belief that trans people are using public restrooms to prey on little girls  a  pants on fire  level lie  in a rant that had people seriously concerned for his mental well being you frauds out there ranting and screaming about my  opinions   even if it isn t  and comments are screaming for  tolerance  and  acceptance  while you refuse to do and be either you re the ones making it the issue  i don t care  if you ask me about any of the topics it s likely  much to the chagrin of many  i ll answer with my opinion sarah palin was appalled that schilling had been canned from espn for his bigotry  so she decided to do something  post an equally offensive meme bullying the trans community in  solidarity  with his   bonus points if you noticed the meme somehow managed to blame president obama  https   www facebook com sarahpalin posts   thus we get a glimpse into the mindset of sarah palin  the  real  victim  in her view  is the hapless conservative who isn t allowed to spread vicious lies about a vulnerable group and still be allowed to have a job as the face of a major television network  to  support  her fellow conservative  palin lashes out at the lgbt community   who  it should be noted  were not responsible for schilling s pink slip what s the word for this  dangerous  pathetic  idiotic  how about  cowardly  featured image via alex wong getty images
