mccabe finally did recuse himself from the clinton investigation only a week before last year s presidential election  internally  the wall street journal article started a flurry of emails among mrs  mccabe s campaign  kortan  director mccabe  and the fbi s general counsel  part of that exchange is an email from mccabe to someone in the general counsel s office   sucks pretty much  buckle in  it s going to get rough   the colleague responds   i know  it s awful  i shouldn t be shocked by now  but i really am appalled   mccabe also forwarded the article to comey who responded   copy  on october

possible conflict of interest by noting that clinton headlined a virginia fundraiser on june     for mrs  mccabe   a significant amount was donated after the fbi had initiated its investigation and begun meeting with secretary clinton s attorneys in august   the documents also show that fbi leadership was sensitive to reports of fbi internal dissent with then director comey s handling of the clinton investigation  on october     mrs  mccabe forwarded to director mccabe a true pundit article titled   fbi director lobbied against criminal charges for hillary after clinton insider paid his wife      the story reported that former fbi executive assistant director john giacalone resigned in the middle of the clinton email investigation because he saw it going  sideways  and that jill mccabe received money from a pac headed by mcauliffe  who was under investigation by the fbi for campaign finance law violations  mccabe forwarded the article to comey  noting  fyi  heavyweight source   comey replied to mccabe  copying chief of staff james rybicki  saying   this still reads to me like someone not involved in the investigation at all  maybe somebody who heard rumors  these new
