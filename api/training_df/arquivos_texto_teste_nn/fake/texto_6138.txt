donald trump has repeatedly sworn he loves hispanics and hispanics love him  but not   apparently   when it comes to the judge presiding over his trump university fraud trial trump  whose guilt in this case is almost beyond doubt  swears that if he loses the case  which is looking likely   it s not because he is a shameless con man  no  it s because the judge is a  hater  and a mexican  we re in front of a very hostile judge   mr  trump said   the judge was appointed by barack obama  federal judge  frankly  he should recuse himself because he s given us ruling after ruling after ruling  negative  negative  negative  what happens is the judge  who happens to be  we believe  mexican  which is great  i think that s fine   mr  trump said the only problem  judge gonzalo curiel is from indiana not mexico  which is great  i think indiana s fine it s not the first time trump has gone birther  of course  he famously set fire to piles of his own money in a quixotic quest to prove president obama wasn t born in the united states  at several points  trump even claimed to have proof  but never produced a single shred of evidence  his new accusations do  however  represent the first time trump has claimed mexicans   aside from being rapists and drug dealers   are infiltrating the federal justice system to screw over trump personally why would they do that  trump supporters seem to believe it s because of trump s immigration plans  facing a crowd of supporters who had killed time before trump got up to the podium by mindlessly chanting  build that wall   trump knew exactly what he was doing when he suddenly floated the idea that the judge who is about to rule against him is a secret mexican  he was quite literally preaching to the choir all of this undermines trump s assurances that hispanic voters will flock to him in november  if he sincerely believes a federal judge would be prejudiced against him in his court case because of his hispanic heritage  then it s not hard to imagine the rest of the hispanic and latino population would be repulsed by his message of anti immigrant hate  he can t have it both ways trump closed his remarks by promising to file a lawsuit against judge curiel when he becomes president  i m telling you  this court system  judges in this court system  federal court  they ought to look into judge curiel  because what judge curiel is doing is a total disgrace  ok  but we ll come back in november  wouldn t that be wild if i m president and i come back to do a civil case  the audience roared   the same audience that at one time probably raged at president obama for taking a day to go golfing  suddenly  a president who spends his time in office wrapped up in a personal civil case to settle a grudge is a ok featured image via spencer platt getty images
