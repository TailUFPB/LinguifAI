there were several powerful  captivating speeches that marked hillary clinton s democratic national convention in philadelphia earlier this week  but the most memorable one came from the father of a muslim soldier who sacrificed his own life to save his comrades khizr khan  in a brilliant speech that he delivered without any notes  stood on the dnc stage with his wife ghazala and ripped republican nominee donald trump to shreds for his anti muslim rhetoric  pulling out a copy of the united states constitution that he carries with him everywhere  khan challenged trump  have you even read the united states constitution   i will gladly lend you my copy   it was an iconic moment that was by far the most powerful of the entire convention  and even conservatives could not deny that khan had made them feel ashamed to be represented by trump of course  many were waiting for trump to react to this epic moment  because trump never lets any criticism get past him without retaliating in one of his childish ways  well  trump has finally responded  days later after new york times reporter maureen dowd asked trump about it  and it s just as disappointing as you would expect dowd asked  on the poignant appearance of muslim lawyer khizr khan and his wife  whose son  humayun  an army captain  posthumously received a bronze star and a purple heart and was buried at arlington national cemetery after he was killed by a suicide bomber in iraq in   as his wife  ghazala  stood silently by his side  khan held up a copy of the constitution and asked trump if he had ever read it and said   you have sacrificed nothing  trump had just one thing to say in response  one sentence  eight words  it was this  i d like to hear his wife say something  yes  trump s reaction to the most powerful criticism he got at the dnc is to insult a gold star mother  what a moron twitterlast night  ghazala khan explained on msnbc that she hadn t said anything at the dnc because speaking about her son humayun causes her to be too overcome with emotion  you can watch humayun s parents remember their son in the powerful interview below featured image via john moore   getty images and screenshot
