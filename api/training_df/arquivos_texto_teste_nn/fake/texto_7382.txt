politifact just humiliated senate republicans big time during an appearance on meet the press on sunday  senate minority leader harry reid pointed out that democrats have never held up a supreme court nominee the way republicans are doing now  you have to look at what has happened   reid said   we have never held up a supreme court nomination  since  in a lame duck session  there have been six that have all been approved  here s the video via nbc republicans are probably crying foul at this point  but politifact took up the case and investigated reid s claims  and conservatives are definitely not going to like the results as it turns out  politifact rated reid s claim as  mostly true   despite republican claims that democrats started some kind of precedent for their own actions in the present day  the fact checking organization found that only republicans have ever not held hearings for a supreme court nominee politifact pointed out that when president bush nominated harriet miers to a fill a vacancy on the high court both democrats and republicans objected  therefore  democrats are not solely responsible for denying a nominee a full hearing  miers also at least was allowed to meet with the senate judiciary committee  which under republican control is flatly denying current nominee merrick garland a meeting of any kind then politifact moved on to the  nomination of extreme conservative robert bork  which was highly contentious  democrats did  indeed  launch much public opposition against him  but in the end  even bork received a full hearing and lost the nomination of samuel alito in  drew filibuster attempts by democrats  including reid and then senator obama  but as reid pointed out to chuck todd  alito is sitting on the supreme court bench now because democrats dropped their filibuster effort and he was confirmed despite the latter two contentious nomination battles  politifact ruled that they  can t find a time when a democratic senate refused to hear a republican president s nominee  even if they were opposed  they allowed the nominee to come to a confirmation vote  in short  only republicans have refused to even hold hearings for a supreme court nominee and it s not because of some non existent tradition started by democrats or some non existent precedent that goes back  years regarding election year nominations  it s because republicans are throwing a temper tantrum because they don t want the black president to extend his legacy through the supreme court  that and they think only a conservative is entitled to replace scalia the bottom line  however  is that senate republicans need to suck it up and do their jobs because the american people and the constitution demand it featured image  cagle
