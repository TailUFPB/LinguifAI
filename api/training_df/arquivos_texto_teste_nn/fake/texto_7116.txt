former speaker of the house john boehner took to facebook recently to convince people he s just an average joe who takes pride in his lawn  after cutting his losses and running away with his tail between his legs when the going got tough with the right wing extremists he helped cultivate  boehner has settled into a modest life of being the guy next door https   www facebook com johnboehner photos a      type  you take the post at face value  you have a guy from ohio with perfectly green grass and your standard lawn mower  the problem is  john boehner isn t a regular guy from ohio with perfect grass he s worked hard to cultivate  he s a rich elitist standing in front of a mansion with acres of lawn  the mower is probably borrowed from his landscaper  it s more than likely the little one he uses around flower beds and other areas that the industrial zero turn mower won t fit in in other words  the post is  more than likely  a complete farce  is it possible that john boehner mows his own lawn with a  inch toro  sure  is it possible that he s responsible for having a perfectly cut  lush green lawn in march when everyone else is still waiting for the frost to heave  absolutely  is it realistic  not by a long shot  it really makes no difference  the guy is a has been who will be remembered for caving to the tea party or freedom caucus or whatever the religious zealots demanding government be reduced to four guys and a calculator is calling themselves these days what is remarkable about the post are the comments  it s almost sad  you almost want to feel bad for the guy  the comments aren t from democrats looking to disparage him for his obvious privilege  they re from the imbeciles who vote for tea party douchebags  setting poor speaker boehner s social media world ablaze with accusations that he s a rino  republican in name only  who is responsible for obamacare and anything else the democrats managed to accomplish while he was in office  they truly just tore him to pieces  those are just a few of the scathing comments  you can visit the post yourself to see just how useless the right finds john boehner to be  they hate him more than we do featured image from facebook
