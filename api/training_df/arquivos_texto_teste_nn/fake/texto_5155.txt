conservatives have something to say about absolutely everything  this time  they re throwing a temper tantrum over one of the major messages of the rio olympics   climate change  the opening ceremonies featured climate change as one of the central themes  so of course conservatives came out in droves to whine and cry about politicizing the games on social media the display started with a boy and an endangered pau brasil tree in the center of the stadium  then a video of the world played  showing how several major cities would be affected from rising sea levels as the antarctic ice sheets melt  it was an important message to highlight  and some were pleased that rio did it those people weren t likely anti science conservatives  though  brazil has its own environmental problems  so of course that crowd thinks rio is being massively hypocritical in saying anything about climate change  here s a hint as to why it s not  one of the purposes of the opening ceremonies is to showcase the host nation  it s entirely possible that the rio organizing committee wanted to send a message about climate change to their own government  as well as to the rest of the world the anti science   climate change is a hoax  crowd wasn t going to let that go unnoticed  though  everything is evil  liberal propaganda to them if it doesn t fit their narrative  and this part of the opening ceremonies definitely didn t fit with what they like to hear  what did they want  something flashy and superficial  no doubt   so they took to twitter to lash out as only conservatives can when they re faced with facts rio olympics so far  quite boring   pushing global warming propaganda they mention n pole losing ice but never mention growing ice at s pole  politixgal   politixgal  august     openingceremony at  rioolympics just went full sjw retard on global warming  highlighted slavery but no mention of emperor who ended it     the mad monarchist     august    and now we interrupt the rio olympics opening ceremony with a global warming awareness segment   oliver darcy   oliverdarcy  august    oh god  we re getting a tedious bilingual lecture on global warming at the  openingceremony of the  rioolympics  please  stop it   tunku varadarajan   tunkuv  august    sense brazil would focus on global warming  probably distracts from zika  corrupt government  and ocean of poop   ben shapiro   benshapiro  august    when does obama storm onstage  grab a mic  and shout  imma let you finish but i was the greatest of all time on global warming  ben shapiro   benshapiro  august    much propaganda at  openingceremony  from  climate change  to  refugees   it s like watching democrat convention  https   t co   nick short   politicalshort  august    rio olympics ratings fail  down    spread global warming all u want  nobody is watching you morons https   t co   kathleen dang     august    sarahnemerson rio olympics opening ceremonies sanctimonious call to arms over global warming from country slashing   burning rainforests  righteous axe   righteousaxe  august    are so fun to watch when they re in hissy fit mode  are they not  they d scream about someone declaring the sky blue if they could  at least when liberals decry anti climate science speeches and displays  we have the science on our side with which to do so  they just want to whine featured image by clive mason getty images
