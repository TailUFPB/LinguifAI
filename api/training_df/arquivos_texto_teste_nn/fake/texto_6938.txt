wisconsin governor scott walker has blown so much money on his vanity presidential campaign that he put himself    million dollars in debt  an odd accomplishment for a  fiscally conservative  republican who says that our government s debt is the most evil thing ever walker is trying to sell off the surplus garbage campaign merchandise that nobody wanted to buy the first time around  in order to cover his debts  he sent out an e mail begging people to buy t shirts from him for    if you really want to wear a t shirt which will announce to everyone how stupid you are  you can find similar walker merch online for about half the price walker isn t even able to fulfill color or size requests due to a  lack of resources   he wants you to pay  bucks for something you may not even want to  or be physically able to  wear properly  don t worry  though  if you get a shirt that is  sizes too small or a hideous color  he also said in the e mail that the shirts can be framed or used for  crafty things  like a pillow cover or bag that  exactly what i d do  lay my head on a scott walker pillow as i stare at a scott walker framed t shirt on my wall walker dropped    a day on his  day presidential run  which is a fact he isn t divulging to the people he s asking for cash   days is pretty impressive to go from the great white right wing hope to  scott who  in the e mail that he sent out to the people who are now upset that they forgot to unsubscribe from his mailing list months ago  walker made some strange statements about how careful he is with money  if there is one thing the american people learned about me during our presidential campaign  it is that i am thrifty  source  apwalker then went on to cite how he uses coupons and loves hitting up the discount racks when shopping  do they give coupons for failed presidential vanity campaigns intended for boosting speaking fees and book deals there s     worth of irony to be found in a  thrifty  guy  who is against big spending  asking people to waste  bucks on what is essentially an  i m with stupid  t shirt  he would need a little over   people who are bad enough with their money to think this is a good deal  in order to cover his debt featured image via scott olson   getty
