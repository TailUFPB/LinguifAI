if you re a guy who thinks sending unwelcome d ck pics to women is cool  you better hope you ve never sent one to this model emily sears is a model from australia who often shares pictures of herself on social media  and because of her job  men often send her pictures of their junk even though she really would rather they didn t  i usually receive at least one or two d ck pics per day  at minimum   sears told buzzfeed   it s just been consistently happening for so long  i became absolutely fed up with these kinds of disturbing and disgusting messages and comments online  rather than allow gross men to continue sending her unsolicited pictures of their penises  emily decided to fight back in the best way possible emily noticed that whenever these men sent d ck pics to her  they did so using their social media profiles  so she looked at the profiles to see if these men had girlfriends  wives  or mothers who she could inform about the pictures she then sends a message to the guys complete with images of the women in their lives and asks what they would think if she alerted them to the unsolicited photos  we send the photos as a reminder for them to have respect for women  i think it provides an accountability that people seem to lose online  being behind a screen gives people a false sense of anonymity  i have noticed since posting my responses as a warning that the number has been significantly lower  i think my followers are slowly getting the message  after realizing that emily figuratively had them by the balls  the men would claim that they were sorry and said they wouldn t do it again here s a couple of samples of messages between emily and the men who harassed her and sometimes  she went ahead and informed the women in their lives anyway  since most of the creepy guys are just sorry they got busted  their apologies always seem fake   emily said   sometimes they try and say their friend stole their phone  and that it wasn t them  i don t believe they re sorry so much as they re sorry you re putting them on blast  and because they are fighting back and holding men accountable for their actions  more harassment usually follows  but emily has no plans to stop outing men who send her unwelcome pictures of their d cks  i get messages from men who say we re  sluts who are asking for it   which can get pretty overwhelming  but i truly believe its a huge social problem reflecting the attitude many men have towards women and i want to keep trying to fight against it  frankly  these men deserve what they get  men need to understand that there are consequences and just because you re using the internet  it doesn t mean you are anonymous  apparently  men need to be taught these facts  and they definitely need to learn that sending dick pics to women is not okay as long as there are women like emily sears around  that lesson will continue to be taught in other words  keep it your pants  gentlemen featured image  instagram
