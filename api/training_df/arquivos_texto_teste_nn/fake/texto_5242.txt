early saturday morning  a customer at a kansas international house of pancakes called  to report that one of the nra s  responsible gun owners  had opened fire on him for the most ridiculous reason one can think of according to wichita police sgt  steve yarberry  the  year old victim had asked another man to stop spewing racial slurs at the restaurant  instead of offering a polite acquiescence or even engaging in a spirited debate  the hate spewing gentleman opted to communicate using the second amendment   not the words  but the action  at least one shot was fired in the parking lot of the ihop  upon leaving the restaurant  the unnamed victim noticed a black sedan following him  then   at least three more gunshots rang out  police believe that the shooter stalked his victim  one of the rounds struck the tailgate of his vehicle   yarberry explained  fortunately the target  who only asked that the man stop acting like a racist douchebag  was not hurt in the attack  he did not know the shooter  the sergeant says according to the national rifle association  nothing should have impeded the shooter s ability to own and possess a firearm until the very moment he pulled the trigger or committed another crime with the gun  until that moment  he was a  good guy with a gun   the last line of defense against a tyrannical government and criminals like himself  but that s the problem    good guys  and  bad guys  look exactly the same  until it is too late  that is the suspect has still not been identified or apprehended featured image via the wichita eagle
