thanks to the quest for natural gas power through fracking  an australian river has become polluted enough that it can be set on fire  dramatic video of what happened was captured by activists and published online https   www facebook com rtvids videos  a queensland river near a fracking site exploded into flames after a coal seam gas  csg  protester sparked a kitchen lighter above the water surface greens mp jeremy buckingham uploaded dramatic footage of the river ablaze to his website and social media accounts to highlight his party s concerns about fracking and the extraction of coal seam gas the video shows the new south wales greens mp ignite the fire on the condamine river and then jump up in shock  exclaiming   holy f     unbelievable   a river on fire  the video echoes other viral videos in the past that have shown that the gases released by fracking have sometimes leaked into the traditional water supply  and allowed similar experiments where water coming into homes has been set on fire as well fracking has also been linked to increased earthquake activity  and as a result it has been banned in several u s  states  sometimes completely or pending further study of the technology some have called for a complete ban on the practice  while others have called for a slowdown in its use  fracking has been credited with contributing to the lower price of oil and gas in the last few years  but like every other energy extraction technology used on a mass scale  it has an environmental downside the only energy technologies without the serious problems of fracking or traditional oil drilling are green technologies like solar or wind power  but to date they are incapable of generating the kind of power output needed to fully displace the traditional sources of energy  the obama administration has tried to incentivize the creation of  green tech   but has been opposed by republicans who take in the bulk of donations from the fossil fuel industry  who also fund an enormous amount of anti green propaganda  featured image via facebook
