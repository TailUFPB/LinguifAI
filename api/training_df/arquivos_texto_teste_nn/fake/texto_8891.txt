the domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day  perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort  of course  despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation  the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics  and comedian seth meyers has taken full advantage of that on wednesday night s edition of his show  meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  tarpman   and proceed to mock him relentlessly  luckily  msnbc s lawrence o donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us first  the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave  then  it panned to  tarpman  hiding with his gun  after that  we see seth meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity  he even called  tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia clue  watch the clip below  via msnbc well  it seems that this particular terrorist  levoy finicum  has gotten his fifteen minutes of fame  and they re not about to be over congratulations  mr  finicum  you are currently on short list of extremely stupid people  even by the standards of anti government terrorists featured image via video screen capture from msnbc
