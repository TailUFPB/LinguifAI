a routine church service at the st  peter s missionary baptist church in dayton  ohio turned violent when a gunman walked in and shot the pastor  rev  william schooler was in the pulpit when he was murdered in cold blood as his choir sang behind him  according to local station wdtn  the pastor s brother   year old daniel schooler  is in custody due to suspected involvement in the killing of his brother  no motive is known at this time there were roughly  attendees at the service  and they all ran to flee the gun violence  the event happened at about   eastern time  the victim was a retired and celebrated member of the city s school system as both a teacher and a principal in addition to being a figure of the religious community now  to hear the gun lobbyists and gun nuts tell it  this would have been prevented if there had just been one good guy with a gun to make sure that the shooter was taken down prior to killing anyone  but  honestly  who is expecting to be shot down in a church  of all places  no matter what one might think of organized religion  churches are places that most people go for peace  worship  community  and ultimately salvation  it s likely the last place most reasonable people feel the need to go packing heat  however  the nra would have us believe otherwise no  the solution is not moar guns  this man died because a deranged lunatic came into his church and gunned him down in cold blood  the solution is not more guns  and more armed people in more places  or the extinguishing of gun free zones  the solution is putting policies in place that make sure such people don t get their hands on weapons in the first place it really has gotten so bad that we cannot go about our normal activities   like  say  going to church   without fearing for our lives  and that s a damn shame rest in peace  rev  schooler  you didn t deserve this featured image via screen capture from wdtn
