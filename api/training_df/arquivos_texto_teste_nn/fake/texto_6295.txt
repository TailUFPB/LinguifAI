oops  while the media is still talking about the fact that donald trump refuses to release his tax returns  his campaign has revealed that his vice presidential pick will be much better vetted than the man wanting the top of the ticket  his vp candidates will have to show their tax returns here s the video trump defenders will make the point that showing tax returns is not a legal requirement to run for president  but most do and there are good reasons for it  especially with a candidate like trump trump s entire campaign  and his following  has been built upon the idea that he s a magician with money  he s such a money maven he can force unwilling governments to build a wall against their own people  trump talks a lot  but without seeing his tax returns  we have no idea how much money he has and how he is spending that money  this  while he s demanding complete transparency from hillary clinton  and now  from his vp candidates the msnbc report went on to say that trump doesn t particularly care about his vp pick s views on any given issue   that there won t be a litmus test on abortion  lgbt rights or any of the other hot button issues  but based on all around views it is pretty normal that trump would require the tax returns of any candidate  but face it  the odds of his vice president having the nuclear codes or the keys to the treasury are pretty slim  it s trump that people are being asked to support  not some  as of now  vague idea of a vp candidate  this is a bit like the twice divorced candidate demanding that his vp pick be married to his or her  probably his  first spouse  it s like trump demanding that they have a great haircut or like him demanding decorum from his picks  trump is asking his vp picks to jump through more hoops than he will  this is just more proof that trump is running for dictator  not president featured image via andrew burton at getty images
