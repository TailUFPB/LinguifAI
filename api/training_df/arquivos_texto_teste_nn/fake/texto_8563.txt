it s hard to believe that it s been nearly  years since natalie maines of the dixie chicks perfectly spoke her mind in reference to the impending iraq war  if you don t remember what she said  let me remind you  just so you know  we re on the good side with y all  we do not want this war  this violence  and we re ashamed that the president of the united states is from texas  this  of course  sparked a huge backlash against not only maines  but the dixie chicks  people everywhere couldn t believe that she d have the perfect audacity to speak up against an unjust war and against the president who was leading the charge into iraq  dissent is usually considered patriotic  but apparently not if the dissenting voice is against a warmongering conservative president well  dusting off her infamous quote on twitter  maines just completely roasted republican presidential candidate senator ted cruz  another republican from texas who loves war and wouldn t think twice about send our troops anywhere he thought there was a need  necessary or not  diplomacy be damned maines tweeted just so you know  i m ashamed ted cruz is from america   pic twitter com   natalie maines     january    mind you  the quotes are absolutely perfect that she chose  the first being from former president eisenhower  a man who knew the dangers of war  because he lived through the worst we ve ever had  then paired with sen  cruz  a canadian born chickenhawk  and far from the republican that eisenhower was  who claims he ll  carpet bomb  the enemy to make them  glow in the dark  maines reminds america of the stupidity of electing yet another senseless fool to the white house and the inevitable war it would cause  a war that would send thousands more of our troops to unnecessarily die  however  maines does it with a perfectly sarcastic spin when she says  just so you know  i m ashamed ted cruz is from america   the wink is seemingly insinuating two things  that he s a repeat of george w  bush  so the same quote was necessary  and also that he was born in canada  which was confirmed with this tweet i stand corrected just so you know  i m ashamed ted cruz claims to be american  pic twitter com jultnimoxh  natalie maines     january    is definitely a person to be ashamed of  because not only is he dangerous  he s smarmy as hell and as greasy as a used car salesman to get what he wants done  even if that means reading green eggs and ham on the floor of the senate to shut down the united states government good on you  maines   well frickin  done  never ever stop speaking the truth featured image  youtube twitter
