a group of thugs marched through the main train station in stockholm  sweden and beat up refugee children and anyone who didn t appear to be ethnically swedish  it is a shocking moment of anti migrant violence as europe deals with the fallout from the syrian civil war wearing all black balaclavas and armbands  the men  gathered with the purpose of attacking refugee children   stockholm police spokesperson towe hagg said  i saw maybe three people who were beaten  that was no football brawl or something similar  they targeted migrants  i was quite scared and ran away   an eyewitness told the aftonbladet newspaper before the attacks  the mob handed out leaflets with the slogan  it is enough now   which threatened to give  the north african street children who are roaming around  the  punishment they deserve  the rhetoric of the attackers sounds unsettling like what we have been hearing every night at donald trump s presidential rallies  he launched his campaign with an explicitly white power message  blaming mexicans for being  rapists   then arguing in favor of a national registry of muslims and banning them from traveling to the united states trump s rhetoric has already led to violence here  one group of massachusetts men beat up a latino man while citing trump  while at his rallies trump has egged on his supporters who have attacked and mistreated black protesters the rise of the nationalist right in europe has used mass migration as its excuse of the moment  blaming economic hardships and slowdowns on migrants with different colored skin and ethnic and religious backgrounds has been a trope of the extremist right for ages the republican party and the mainstream press have both been afraid to call out trump and his backers for their blatant hate  and while it seems unspeakable  we re not that different from the people in europe  maybe it could happen here featured image via youtube
