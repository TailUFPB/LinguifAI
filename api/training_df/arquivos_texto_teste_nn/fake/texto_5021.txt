there s a lot of uncertainties in this election  but one thing is crystal clear  donald trump is liar  now  whether or not he believes in anything he says remains to be seen  no one has been able to  crack  the republican presidential nominee  he even bragged that people can t  so who knows but there is some telling evidence that trump is a pathological lying  walking contradiction  look at his politifact file  over  percent of the things that come out of his mouth have been lies then there s the obvious stuff  he use to support gay marriage and abortion  now he doesn t  he use o think hillary clinton was  terrific  and now she s  crooked   he opposed the iraq war from the beginning but actually he didn t  the list goes on and on but instead of reading a list  the democratic coalition against trump has made a video documenting  chronicling and highlighting dozens of trump s biggest lies and contradictions republicans thought they were clever with their  hillary clinton lying for  straight minutes  video   until it was picked apart and debunked by politifact  reddit  daily kos and so forth  but when it comes to political hogwash and making mountains out of mole hills  republicans are professionals but with trump as their nominee  they have no room to speak posted on their facebook  the organization  which runs a website dedicated to exposing trump s lies  wrote this is incredible   watch trump contradict himself on iraq  abortion  hillary clinton  profanity  universal health care  the libyan intervention  illegal immigration  nuclear weapons  neo nazism  minimum wage  bill clinton  integrity  his tax returns  and his own political leanings it is truly incredible to watch a man who has duped millions of republicans into believing he is an authentic  conservative  pro american counter to hillary clinton here s the video in all its glory  watched by over  million people trump supporters claim they back to bloated narcissist because he  says what he means  and he  tells it like it is  only he doesn t say what he means   just what s expedient   and he doesn t tell it like it is  he tells it based on what his supporters want  and that certainly isn t the truth featured image via jeff swensen getty images
