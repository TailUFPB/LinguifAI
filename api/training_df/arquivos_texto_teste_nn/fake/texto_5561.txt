like father  like son  eric trump didn t miss a beat when he was asked whether or not his sister ivanka could make a good vice president  of course  he mused  she s got the looks eric was on fox and friends doing a fluff piece about his father when the discussion of vice presidential picks came up  contrary to much of the information leaking out of the trump campaign  the younger trump was adament that people were begging his dad for the chance to be his vice president  eric didn t mention a single actual name  which makes sense because it was a lie according to many people the new york times spoke to  the answer would be an emphatic no  never   said chris schrimpf  a spokesman for gov  john kasich of ohio   no chance  hahahahahahahahaha   wrote sally bradshaw  a senior adviser to jeb bush  when asked if he would consider it  scott walker has a visceral negative reaction to trump s character   said ed goeas  a longtime adviser to the wisconsin governor or  as senator lindsey graham put it   that s like buying a ticket on the titanic  likewise  many of trump s own top choices have since publicly rejected the offer including iowa senator joni ernst and tennessee senator bob corker so fox and friends were left floating hypotheticals with eric  they brought up ivanka  whose only qualification appears to be that she briefly made a business out of selling scarves that were dangerously flammable  eric was smitten with the idea   in his own creepy way  i agree  she s got the beautiful looks  she s got she s smart  she s smart  smart  smart  she s certainly got my vote  she s got the beautiful looks it appears eric has taken after his dad in routinely objectifying and sexualizing the women in the trump family  donald trump has spoken at length about the attractiveness of both of his daughters  including musing about the eventual size of daughter tiffany s breasts while she was still an infant  for ivanka he s said  joked   several times that she is so attractive that he would be dating her if she weren t his own offspring  yeah  she s really something  and what a beauty  that one  if i weren t happily married and  ya know  her father it s unclear whether trump actually fantasizes about sleeping with his own daughter or if his own worldview is merely so warped by misogyny and sexist gender ideals that his only pride for a woman like ivanka is that she grew up to be attractive  neither option should instill confidence in this man  the fact that his son is showing the same tendency to reduce his sister to a sex object is equally troubling and these are the people who are to represent the  family values  crowd  good grief featured image via fox news
