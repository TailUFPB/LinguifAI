the british parliament conducted what can only be described as a  national celebrity roast  when they took up the petition signed by more than  britons  requesting that their government ban donald trump from entering the country based on the fact he  foments racial  religious  and nationalistic intolerance  which should not be welcome in the uk  the  hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions  and due to the huge number of signatures  rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him  however  it did give parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant trump bashing  which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate watch one of the compilations of what the uk really thinks of trump below if only the republican party felt that way even some tory party members  which are like the british version of republicans  except that they are not insane  have come out against his comments  although not as strongly as labour and scottish national party members had done some took a more serious stance on the idea of trump not being permitted in the uk  by implying that allowing his presence would embolden the nationalistic and islamophobic groups that already exist in the nation watch more footage of further discussion below ultimately  trump will not end up being denied entry to the uk because there will not be a vote held at the end of the debate which would be required to enact a legitimate ban  however  members of parliament felt that the   british citizens who signed the petition  deserved both an answer to it  plus a strong statement by their government against the sort of hate that trump peddles daily featured image via fox news screen capture
