it s probably not very controversial to say that donald trump has an image problem  sure  the republican base turn up to his rallies to be turned on by his xenophobia  but his electability in a general election is an entirely different matter  in some of the latest polls done on trump s favorability  the republican front runner is the most hated politician since post watergate richard nixon  when it comes to trump  most of the country falls somewhere between  actively loathe  and  hate with a passion  this is due  in large part  to the fact that the very stuff that helps him in the primaries   anti immigrant bashing  open bigotry  violence against minorities at his rallies   repulse everyone else  in short  if you aren t the guy literally dressed as a wall at a trump rally  you probably hate him this guy attended a recent trump rally dressed  as the wall  pic twitter com   pigeon today   pigeontoday  april    address this glaring problem  trump s campaign has been quietly pivoting from  our candidate  the bigot  to a supposedly softer tone that presents trump as more  presidential   in a recording made to a group of republican insiders  trump s campaign manager paul manafort said trump s  part  would be evolving the part he s been playing is evolving into the part of that you ve been expecting but he wasn t ready for it because he had the first phase  you ll start to see more depth to the person  the real person  you ll see him in a different way are you buying that  singer and firebrand cher sure wasn t  on twitter  she gave trump and his  changing tone  the brutal beatdown it deserved trump just said all these months hes been acting playing a part   base that hes been tricking is he going  pretend  human now   cher   cher  april    says he s been  acting in front of his followers he couldn t have gotten so many ppl at rallies if his ppl knew who he really was  cher   cher  april    if trumpsupporters know yet  that he was only  acting at his rallies he knew just how  suck em in  the art of the double deal   cher   cher  april      emojis and all   brings up an inconvenient truth for trump s followers  the man they adore is either pandering to their racism because he knows it will get them going  or he is lying now about ever changing  neither option is a  good  one  both suggest trump is a manipulator and untrustworthy the singer also seems to think trump s  real  image isn t the presidential  mature one his campaign is now suggesting  she has a little reminder trump says past monthswe re just part he was playing projecting fake image he really loves women  blacks  he was  birther muslim obama  cher   cher  april    trump who once said he would spend almost any amount of money to  prove  president obama was a kenyan muslim  now wants us to believe he is really a mature  intelligent guy  it may just work on his supporters  but the rest of the country  they re with cher featured image via win mcnamee getty images
