the florida department of juvenile justice has finally decided to terminate its relationship with the for profit prison company  youth services international  whose name couldn t be more misleading  for years the company has been embroiled in controversies involving covering up youth sex abuses by staff  falsifying records  and starving inmates  among a litany of other allegations occurring over the past few years the company settled on paying the state of florida   million to get a lawsuit thrown out  which they continue to deny has any merit florida s entire juvenile prison system is privatized  exposing it to abuse and corruption so the companies who hold the government contracts can squeeze out as much profits as possible  despite the rampant problems with youth services international  the state of florida is merely accepting new applications from other for profit prison companies  these private prisons interfere with the administration of justice  and they re driving inmate populations skyward by corrupting the political process   wrote senator bernie sanders in a huffington post article last year   no one  in my view  should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars   whether they re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers  in fact  i believe that private prisons shouldn t be allowed to exist at all  which is why i ve introduced legislation to eliminate them  senator sanders went on to explain how the for profit prison system facilitates prisoner abuses  harms minorities  victimizes immigrants  influences prison policy and immigration policy while corrupting politicians to favor the interests of the for profit prison industrial complex  the state of florida has clearly seen the problems posed by placing the management and control of their prison system in the hands of a private company  yet they are continuing to place the livelihood of thousands of teenagers who need help in the hands of companies who just see them as profit  the justice is not for sale act proposed by senator bernie sanders would ban private prisons in america  but in the meantime  states  such as florida need to start taking action on prison reform by not using the criminal justice system as a means for profit featured image via flickr
