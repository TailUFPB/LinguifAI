donald trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him  and instead he just handed the rest of america a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected at a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether trump gets the nomination before the convention or not  he told his followers that if he loses  he ll go into hiding  never to be seen again signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another republican should he lose the nomination  trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor  which  to be fair  is true if the victor is donald trump clearly not a fan of ted cruz  trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him  they fight like hell for six months  and they re saying horrible things  the worst things you can imagine  and then one of them loses  one of them wins  and the one who loses says   i just want to congratulate my opponent  he is a brilliant man  he ll be a great governor or president or whatever  so trump made his supporters a promise  i m not sure you re ever going to see me there  i don t think i m going to lose  but if i do  i don t think you re ever going to see me again  folks  i think i ll go to turnberry and play golf or something  it s bad enough that trump is already playing the sore loser  but his gambit is almost sure to backfire  it s been well documented that trump is despised at almost surreal levels  his unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far  the sheer level of loathing people have for donald trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country  he s hated by hispanics  he s hated by women  he s hated by african americans  he s hated by young people  he s hated by the one group the gop could always count on  white men  yes  really  he s the most hated politician in three decades  the last person who came close  richard nixon post watergate  even dick cheney   at the lowest moments of the bush years   was hated by  slightly  fewer people that s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant donald trump never shows his face in front of a camera again  it s hard to imagine a better way donald trump could make america great again than that  and trump just promised to do it the stakes in this election  already very high  just became  president trump vs  trump never being seen again  pray america makes the right choice featured image via john moore getty images
