with donald trump s clear and obvious racism over not wanting a judge of mexican descent   albeit born in indiana   presiding over the trump university case  the ladies of the view had more than just a little to say about his remarks whoopie goldberg being so blunt as to say  when you pick any group of people  and you say they are this  and they are that   it s not that he doesn t know any better  it s not that this is new to him  he has been crappy about muslims  and it s just about their difference  and the reason people call it racism is because it now falls under this umbrella   it s everybody except non white people  with joy behar adding  he s running scared from this trump university bit  because this is the exact thing that his supporters should be worried about  that he s a scam artist  that he takes money from old people  makes them go into their retirement funds to pay for his stupid university  that he forces people to max out their credit cards  so they can go to his stupid university  you can get the same thing at the learning annex for thirty bucks in new york city  and behar s correct  trump seems to be purposefully using the judge s race to try to make it about that instead of the fact that he is  in fact  scamming people  it shifts the focus  but at the same time we still can t ignore the blatant racism at one point  whoopie turns to the camera to directly call out trump  and says  so  this is what you have to do  trump  you have to accept the fact that this is how our system works  and if you re uncomfortable that this man is of mexican descent  then you re gonna be uncomfortable with a lot of stuff  because it sounds to like you want to bring back the one drop rule  that says if you have one drop of this  then that s what you are  trump is clearly racist  not only with this judge  but with his remarks about latinos in general  he s a bigot who clearly wants a white america  and it s horrifying to think he d be in charge of choosing supreme court judges when he can t even handle a judge with mexican ancestry hearing his case  we need to now  more than ever  make sure trump doesn t win in november watch the brutal take down here  he s running scared    joyvbehar says of trump after his remarks on the judge presiding over the trump u lawsuits  https   t co   the view   theview  june    image via video screen capture
