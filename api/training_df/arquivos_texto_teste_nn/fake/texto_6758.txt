alzheimer s disease is a devastating type of dementia  accounting for  to  percent of dementia cases  and currently affecting over  million americans  according to the alzheimer s association  it is the  leading cause of death in the united states  and someone in the u s  develops the disease every  seconds  by   the number of cases is projected to reach   million scientists and researchers have grappled with understanding the disease in a search for a cure since   when german neurologist dr  alois alzheimer discovered the plaques and tangles in the brain of a woman who had died of an unknown mental illness with symptoms of memory loss  difficulty with language  and erratic behavior  over the progression of the disease  amyloid plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles build up in the brain  disrupting connections between nerve cells and ultimately death of nerve cells and brain tissue a recent study led by scientists from the university of glasgow in scotland and hong kong university of science and technology has produced a potential breakthrough in alzheimer s disease treatment in mice with a progressive disease similar to alzheimer s  the researchers injected a protein called il   within a week  the memory and cognitive functions of the affected mice improved to normal levels   the daily protein injections cleared out existing amyloid plaque in the brain of mice and stopped its development  the results have yet to be tested in humans  with no guarantee the protein will have similar results in human trials  a  study estimated positive results from experiments on mice translate to success in humans at a rate of  percent nonetheless  the study is promising as no cure or treatment is currently available for alzheimer s disease  alzheimer s care and other forms of dementia are estimated to cost the united states   billion in  working with the mice  the scottish and chinese researchers found the protein  il   promotes the development of microglia  immune cells in the brain  and direct them towards the plaque formed by alzheimer s disease  the relevance of this finding to human alzheimer s is at present unclear  but there are encouraging hints   said professor eddy liew  a leading researcher of the study from the university of glasgow  in a press release   for example  previous genetic studies have shown an association between il  mutations and alzheimer s disease in european and chinese populations  furthermore  the brain of patients with alzheimer s disease contains less il  than the brain from non alzheimer s patients  there have been enough false  breakthroughs  in the medical field to caution us not to hold our breath until rigorous clinical trials have been done  the researchers will soon begin the first phase of clinical trials on humans to test the toxicity of the protein il  at the doses used on mice  with the global medical community anticipating with hope for favorable results featured image courtesy of flickr
