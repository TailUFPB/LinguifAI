in february   the city of birmingham  alabama voted to increase its minimum wage by     it would have increased on march  to    and then again to    a year later  but republican governor of alabama robert bentley recently signed a bill banning cities from implementing any sort of minimum wage increases  while the state s minimum wage remains at the federal minimum of     alabama remains one of the few states in the country without a state minimum wage law  republicans used the same old argument in opposition of increasing the minimum wage  alleging it hurts businesses and the economy  when  in reality increasing minimum wage stimulates the economy by putting more money into the hands of the working class  especially in alabama which has one of the highest poverty rates in the country while governor bentley seems fixated on striking down any progressive reforms in his state  especially ones related to the national progressive movement to fight for a living wage of   an hour  it has been recently reported that the governor gave his staff exorbitant raises in the past year four of his cabinet members received a raise of     from their previous    salaries  many of his other staff members received raises as well  even many of his republican colleagues felt obligated to vocalize their opposition to the raises  the bentley administration says the state is broke   republican candidate for the alabama state board of education  jackie zeigler  told the alabama political reporter   they have denied pay increases for teachers  state employees and retirees  they closed five state parks and cut back others  they closed  drivers license offices  they gutted the state auditor s budget  they took  state troopers off the road  meanwhile  behind the scenes  they were giving themselves huge pay raises  cutting the normal people but adding to their own pay  this needs to stop  just a few months ago  governor bentley took flack for using grant money from the bp oil spill meant to revamp affected beach communities on the alabama coast to repair and renovate a second governor s mansion  estimated to cost the state    million  with a governor like this  alabama  like most of the republican strongholds in the south  are likely to remain hubs of poverty and growing wealth inequality featured image via flickr
