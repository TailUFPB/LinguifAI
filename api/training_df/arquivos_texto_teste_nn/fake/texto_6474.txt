apparently tired of people slamming doors in their faces  jehovah s witnesses have found a new way to indoctrinate children rather than accept that most parents do not want their children to be brainwashed into hating people  the religious sect is creating cartoons meant to teach them to be anti gay  christians  who can act as advocates for their cause the cartoon begins with a child at school looking at the drawings her classmates made of their families  gazing at one image of a child holding hands with her two moms  the child goes home and presents her mother with a picture she drew of her family  which features what conservatives call a  traditional  family featuring a mother and father she mentions that one of her classmates drew two mommies  who are married to each other  and that her teacher says that it doesn t matter as long as they love each other and are happy the girl s mother  however  has an anti gay viewpoint and promptly goes about trying to teach her child how to hate and that gay people aren t  normal  the mother picks up her bible and tells the girl that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and uses the example of an airport security scanner to demonstrate that gay people are not going to be able to go to paradise if they keep being gay  in other words  gay people are going to hell the girl s mom goes on to claim that  people can change   which is code that means gay people can just stop being gay and become straight  she then encourages the girl to tell her classmate all about jehovah and that her parents are going to hell if they don t stop being gay here s the video via youtube jehovah s witnesses even proudly gave their stamp of approval after the video ends this is part of the reason why i started telling jehovah s witnesses that i m not a christian instead of just waiting for them to give up and go away  their persistence at trying to preach to people at their homes is one of the most annoying things about them but now they are literally trying to indoctrinate children via social media with a cartoon that teaches them to be bigots homophobes who spew hate and condemnation instead of decent human beings who practice love  acceptance and tolerance children should not be subjected to this kind of backward thinking and creating a cartoon to do it is about as low as it gets featured image via video screen capture
