right ing paranoid whackjob pat boone has declared snl is now venerating satan  because of a parody skit they ran called  god is a boob man   the skit was making some light hearted humor at recent attempts to pass anti lgbt laws in many states  the skit is absolutely hilarious and is a parody of other recent christian movie trailers for such films as  god s not dead  it isn t clear how boone saw the skit since he clearly hates snl and shouldn t be watching it as a result  perhaps he watches it just to get outraged  he certainly did get upset  though  when he took it upon himself to godsplain god to the rest of us god is not thin skinned  but he does demand reverence  if you have any brains at all you don t pitch yourself against someone who created all things  the god of the bible  they don t have to apologize to christians  when you come against god and the holy spirit who are one and the same  you are bringing upon yourself eternal condemnation  source  right wing watchboone went on to not only accuse snl of being supporters of satan  but he also outed snl as a secret jew hating enterprise as well  something can be devilishly funny  but this skit is diabolical  god has only one real enemy   satan  satan ridicules faith  and they re taking satan s side  they re also ridiculing me and the film  telling impressionable young people not to see it because it s ridiculous  then they throw in that the lawyer is jewish to make the christian look even worse  but it s just anti semitic  source  fox newsyeah  he sure nailed it  saturday night live is secretly anti jew  just think about how stupid that sounds for a few moments then  to prove that he s a couple cans short of a six pack  boone said he didn t feel that snl needed to apologize to christians  followed a few moments later by him demanding that snl apologizes to christians  he literally real time flip flopped boone even went so far as to suggest that gay people should be offended at snl for being  portrayed as more bigoted than christians   notice he said  more  bigoted  he literally admitted that christians like him are bigoted  by using the word  more  as if this wasn t embarrassing enough  the producer of  god s not dead     they actually made  of these   michael scott  also complained that snl is not portraying his movie  accurately  proving that he has absolutely no clue how parody or satire works scott also chimed in with another incredibly funny comment  saying that parody like the snl skit  goes too far  and  can cause divisions  among us really  anti lgbt pro discrimination law doesn t go too far  and bigoted irrational hate doesn t cause divisions  but  a parody skit on snl is the great doom of humanity  you really couldn t intentionally make up something that sounds as stupid as the things fundie christians say naturally  these days featured image via fox news screen capture
