every time donald trump tries to walk back his  punishment  comments on abortion  he only manages to become even more offensive and misogynistic in a recent new york times interview with reporter robert draper  trump made yet another pathetic attempt to clarify the disgusting comments he made during an interview with msnbc s chris matthews in march  where he stated that women should get  some form of punishment  for seeking an abortion  trump originally tried to correct his comments shortly after by saying only doctors who perform illegal abortions should face criminal charges   which was still a very anti woman stance to take  now  trump has made another attempt to defend his comments   and it s just as bad  trump said  i didn t mean punishment for women like prison  i m saying women punish themselves  i didn t want people to think in terms of  prison  punishment  and because of that i walked it back  twitterbut it turns out  every time trump walks his comments back  it s only because he s receiving backlash and he wants to do damage control   he s not really sorry at all  draper investigated trump s claims that he hadn t meant that women should be punished  and discovered that the presumptive republican nominee was lying through his teeth  draper reported that trump initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused to walk it back  before giving a statement  it wasn t until numerous media outlets swarmed him that trump tried to soften the blow with another statement that said the exact opposite  those two contradictory statements were released approximately an hour apart   but that s nothing new for the dishonest  constantly contradicting and flip flopping candidate you can watch trump s original  punishment  comments below and see for yourself that trump s claim that it was a misinterpretation is complete bullsh t  this is a guy who clearly hates women  and will be a major threat to their health  safety and future if he gets the white house to prove just how crazy trump is  in the same times interview  trump insisted he would do better on women s issues than democratic front runner hillary clinton and  everybody else combined   he said  frankly  for the general election i think that s a very good issue for me  trump still remains completely oblivious that almost three quarters of american women hate his guts  and of course  shaming and telling them that they should punish themselves for having an abortion isn t going to help featured image via eduardo munoz alvarez   getty images
