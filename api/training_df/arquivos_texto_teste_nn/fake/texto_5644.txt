the republican national committee seems to be crumbling before his royal censorness  donald trump  even when it comes to barring unfriendly media outlets from the gop convention  open secrets  a non profit outlet that scrutinizes lobbyists  federal agencies  politicians of all stripes and more  can t get into the gop convention this year  despite having gone every year for the past  years they tweeted about it  asking if other non profit outlets had experienced this problem and shining a nice  bright spotlight on the whole thing we ve been denied press creds  by rnc  though we ve had them every convention back to    any other nonprofit news orgs in the same boat   opensecrets org   opensecretsdc  july    to donald trump s world trumplestiltskin has banned at least nine media outlets from covering his rallies  including major ones like the washington post  the huffington post and politico  he s also banned individual reporters from his rallies who work for a much larger range of outlets  they all seem to have a bad habit of making him look bad and  well  king trump just can t have that trump is so sensitive to anyone that doesn t bow and scrape before his dirty little feet that he promised to open up libel laws so it s easier to sue the press and  win lots of money   in other words  censorship  it s a wonder that tea partiers  who allegedly want a return to running the country according to the letter of the constitution  actually support him given how he s openly threatened to tear up the first amendment  and others  too  trump also has a history of filing strategic lawsuits against public participation  which is suing someone for exercising their first amendment rights  it s ridiculously clear that he uses lawsuits as a weapon and a negotiating tool  and he also makes a point of suing anyone he doesn t like  as the gop s standard bearer  it s patently obvious that they re kowtowing to him open secrets was allegedly barred because of space constraints  viveca novak  the editor of open secrets  money in politics blog  said that there was no process for appeal  and they re now stuck trying to cancel travel plans without losing too much money  factcheck org was initially denied credentials as well  but they got an appeal and succeeded  so what the hell rnc communications director kevin spicer said that the credentialing process goes through the house and senate press galleries  however  because open secrets is a non profit  they re considered special press and must go through the rnc s special press director  which is it  space or problems with the credentialing process  they can t get their story straight  and novak poked them for it  doesn t seem like it s for lack of space  https   t co  https   t co   viveca novak   vjn  july    hill has a story listing some of the prominent republicans who aren t going to the convention this year because of drumpf  and because of what he stands for  bush the greater  bush the lesser  and bush the least aren t going  john mccain isn t going  mitt romney likely isn t going either  even though it s traditional for past nominees to attend  both john kasich and ted cruz turned down opportunities to speak  and there s a whole host of delegates who won t be in attendance either of course  there is a very slim chance that the rnc is telling the truth about space and credentialing and trump actually had nothing to do with this pathetically slim so slim that it s virtually nonexistent it s just way too coincidental that they d do this to an outlet that s attended their convention every year since  while preparing to crown the very man that has openly said he wants to censor the press  they also don t have their story straight  open secrets will be allowed at the democratic convention  though  so that s something  just not the republican one  welcome to life under king trump featured image by by wispolitics com  cc by sa    commons
