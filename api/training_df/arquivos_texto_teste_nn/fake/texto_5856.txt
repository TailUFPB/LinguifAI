only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the lgbt community  the gop decided they could go back to being discriminatory one would think they d wait at least a week  but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at pulse nightclub in orlando  florida  because according to vanity fair republican leaders in the house of representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification that s right  you read that correctly  they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay according to the hill rep  sean patrick maloney  d n y    who is gay  filed an amendment to a defense department spending bill that would enforce a  executive order prohibiting discrimination against lgbt people yet  the house rules committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon  nope  not even a vote  not even a chance apparently  the house gop doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage  you know  because adding non discriminatory amendments for lgbt people in a house of representatives full of gop bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual as the hill explains house gop leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month  before now  republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments don t you see  they only want to play by their rules  if you re not doing something they like  well  then they will make sure it never happens  but guaranteed if it was the other way around  the story would be verrrry different this just proves  yet again  that republicans only care about themselves featured photo by allison shelley getty images
