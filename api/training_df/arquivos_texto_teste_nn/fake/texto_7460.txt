the only thing sadder than losing a republican presidential race to a reality tv show host is then having to grovel at the feet of said reality tv show host and beg for scraps  and in  there is no sadder sad sack than ben carson  the one time presidential front runner has spent the past few weeks shamelessly stumping for a guy who once couldn t wait to spread vicious rumors about him  and all for the off chance that trump won t forget about him once he becomes emperor president but wait  what about chris christie  surely  the new jersey governor who has had to grin and bear it while trump mocks him to his face while standing next to him at political rallies has had it worse  sadly  not  because as low as christie s self esteem gets   and it s gotten very low   there is something singularly depressing about the position carson is in  after all  when you find yourself defending donald trump s comparison of you to a child molester  you ve dug a hole for yourself so deep that you re on your way to china alas  here s carson doing just that in an interview with yahoo news  carson was reminded of the time that trump  in an egotistical rage  decided to link carson to that of a child molester  but not before labeling carson a  pathological liar  first  when he says he s pathological   and he says that in the book  i don t say that   and again  i m not saying anything  i m not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease  and he said he s pathological  somebody said he has pathological disease  that s a big problem because you don t cure that  as an example  child molesting  you don t cure these people  you don t cure a child molester  there s no cure for it  pathological  there s no cure for that  was trump calling carson a child molester  of course not  he was merely saying carson s  pathology  was of the same level as that of one  to which carson responded on wednesday  you have to admit to a degree  did work  adding  a lot of people believed him  well said  mr  carson  clearly you are a man of such integrity that you won t even defend yourself when a dumpster fire with a hair piece accuses you of being of the same mental health as a child predator  gifted hands  no spine carson s endorsement of trump has always seemed particularly vile because he had previously spent his entire campaign focused almost entirely on pretending to care about the  angry rhetoric  in the race  repeatedly  he called for candidates to tone down the mudslinging  to no effect   his  i quit  speech explicitly lamented the toxic state of the race  here s how he described his ideal candidate carson stated that in choosing the next person to lead america  you d  need someone who has demonstrated significant accomplishment  whose ideas and policies are clear   and whose character would be revealed by  how they treat others and their family   we d also  need to see what they have done for america  and then he picked the exact opposite  donald j  trump featured image via yahoo news
