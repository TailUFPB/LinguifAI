president trump wants those who settled sexual harassment cases using our tax dollars to be exposed the house is responsible for the sexual assault slush fund that used our taxpayer money to pay off accusers  we should all call for this slush fund to be shut down this is not what our hard earned money should be paying for new  president trump tells me he believe congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled sexual harassment claims  trey yingst   treyyingst  november    transcript and video of rep  jackie speier on  face the nation   nov     is below  she spoke to john dickerson and chuck todd before that about the   million in settlements for sexual harassment by congress members  americans are furious that their tax dollars are being used in such a way without the harasser being held accountable  these gropers should pay for this themselves here s the comment from the interview below that really stands out   we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked  doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified  so the office of compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed     rep jackie speierrep  jackie speier  d california  joined  face the nation  sunday to discuss the fallout from the flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations across the u s   and sexual harassment in congress john dickerson  the debate over sexual harassment moved into the halls of congress after california democratic congresswoman jackie speier went public with her own experience of unwanted sexual advances as a young capitol hill staffer  speier s revelation actually inspired leeann tweeden to come forward with her allegations against senator franken this week  congresswoman speier introduced legislation in the house aimed at fighting sexual harassment in congress  and she joins us this morning from palm springs  california  congresswoman  i want to start with something you wrote  you said that   it s clear the good old boys club mentality of capitol hill still persists after all these years  it is perhaps the worst i ve seen in  years of working on these issues   the old boys club was pretty bad  you re saying it s worse now jackie speier  well  i think it s worse in part because we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked  doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified  so the office of compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed john dickerson  as congress and the larger culture tries to figure out what the standard is for treating accusers who come forward  something better than what has been where they ve been blocked  but also something that doesn t allow false accusations  how does that standard get determined  in your mind jackie speier  well  first of all  we have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously  and the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or intimidated into not filing the complaint  that s what it is right now in congress  there s a one month period where you re counseled  there s another month where you go through mandatory mediation and you have to sign a non disclosure agreement at the front end and then you have a month of cooling off period  i mean  that is truly ridiculous  it s important for us to remember too  john  that over   of those who have been sexually harassed or sexually assaulted are telling the truth  so all these victims who have come forward with roy moore or with the president or with al franken  all of them have to be  we expect to believe them because  for the most part  they are telling the truth  there is no gain for them to come forward  there re lots of down sides  frankly john dickerson  what s your view about reevaluating the situation  you mentioned the president  the white house seems to suggest  and senator cotton also seemed to suggest that the voters knew about this  they voted for him  and so it s an issue that s in the past  how do you see it jackie speier  well  i think there is some truth to that  if the president was running today  i bet he would not be elected because i think we have had a huge cultural shift that was  years in the making  but i think all of us are grateful now that there is a new day for women in the workplace  where they do not have to put up with sexual advances that are unwanted  that they do not have to live and work in a hostile work environment  and that s going to be good for all of us in the workplace john dickerson  as that cultural shift takes place  some people have argued  some democrats and liberals have argued  that a reevaluation of bill clinton s presidency is required  what do you think about that in order to be clear about what the new standard is and use  you know  elements from the past that are well known jackie speier  well  first of all  let s remember that he did face impeachment  it wasn t as if it was just tossed to the side  he faced impeachment  i think that the victims who came forward were not treated as they should have been  they should have been believed because  as i have pointed out  most people who come forward are telling the truth john dickerson  in the case of al franken  what s your feeling about that  there have been some columnists who ve written that basically again  liberals have said he must leave the senate in order for democrats to retain their credibility on this issue  or else they re open to the charge that democrats apply it when it comes to republicans  but are more generous when it comes to their own team jackie speier  i think it s appropriate for the ethics committee to do an investigation  senator franken has actually agreed to that as well  i also think that it has to be determined if there s a pattern of sexual harassment  incidents have to be severe or they have to be ones that happen over a period of time  so i think we ll wait and see what the investigation determines john dickerson  is that an instructive distinction then  pattern versus specific mistake in terms of what might penalize somebody but be the difference between penalizing and expulsion jackie speier  and that s what the courts have held with sexual harassment cases  if there s a pattern  then sexual harassment is found to be in existence  if it s a one event and it s maybe a conversation versus  you know  sexual assault or an unwanted sexual advance  so it really depends on the circumstances in all of these cases john dickerson  final question on a different topic  on taxes  eleven of your republican colleagues in california voted for the house tax cut bill in which deductibility of state and local taxes is no longer allowed  they were told  at least one of them was told   well  that ll get fixed later  and californians who have high taxes will be able to deduct them   what s your do you believe that jackie speier  no  i don t believe it  and i think for all of those members who basically have handed their constituents a    tax increase  that s what we re talking about  when you take the state and local taxes and the property taxes and the mortgage deduction that is reduced to     it is a huge hit for every single california family john dickerson  all right  congresswoman  thanks so much for being with us  and we ll back in one jackie speier  thank you  john john dickerson  minute with white house budget director mick mulvaney
