it s no secret that republicans have used their obstructionist tactics to block anything and everything president obama has tried to do   including nominees  from judicial to state department in a blatant attempt to hurt his ability to have a legacy  republicans have targeted nominees  holding them hostage politically unless their demands are met  some nominees waited hundreds of days for just a hearing  and others have waited even longer for a confirmation and with that  one nominee  who has waited over  days for a confirmation  has died the new york times reports that cassandra butts  a worker in government and non profit entities  died suddenly at the age of  on may  of acute leukemia  which she did not know she had until shortly before her death  president obama and the white house  recognizing her passion for helping others through public service  tapped her to serve as the united states ambassador to the bahamas butts had worked for multiple branches of the government  including lawmakers on capitol hill and the white house counsel butts sailed through hearings in may   and all seemed on track for a swift confirmation to a seemingly unimportant position  which urgently needed filling  so far  the bahamas hasn t had a proper ambassador for   days but  in typical washington form  republicans held up her nomination  not because she wasn t qualified  but because they literally hate president obama and it isn t fair to link all senate republicans to this hold up  only two republicans can be single handedly blamed for this  tom cotton and ted cruz is anyone surprised  cruz  up in arms over the iran nuclear deal  placed a hold on the confirmation on all state department nominations  which of course included butts cruz couldn t get his way  so naturally he unleashed a scorched earth policy on all those even remotely associated with the president but it was senator tom cotton   better known as  tehran tom  by progressive advocates   who proved to be a nefarious monstrosity in the whole matter  in seeking to punish the obama administration over a secret service leak of private information about a member of congress  specifically targeted butts and the norwegian and swedish ambassador nominees  after making a fool of himself  cotton lifted the hold on the scandinavian ambassadors  but he kept the hold on butts as the new york times reports cotton eventually released the two other holds  but not the one on butts  she told me that she once went to see him about it  and he explained that he knew that she was a close friend of obama s   the two first encountered each other on a line for financial aid forms at harvard law school  where they were classmates   and that blocking her was a way to inflict special pain on the presidentand there you have it  because republicans hate the president so much  they upheld a qualified  dignified  and devoted public servant from serving in a position that yields almost no political power and now she has died  never getting the grace of a confirmation vote that s how the republicans have chosen to govern  they should be so proud of all their  accomplishments  featured image via mark wilson getty images
