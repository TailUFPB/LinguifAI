by now  we re all fairly certain that we ve seen enough evidence to in the very least convict the major players of the dubya administration of lying to the american people about saddam hussein s iraq  there were no weapons of mass destruction  of that we are sure we re sure  the people who went looking are sure  even the cia is sure  the only people who aren t sure are the top ranking members of the bush administration  george bush  dick cheney and donald rumsfeld  while they seem to admit that they were wrong about wmds in iraq  they refuse to admit they made a mistake invading iraq over the issue because it was the  best information  they had at the time a newly declassified document is shedding some light on those claims  in a memo written by donald rumsfeld himself to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  the former secretary of defense wrote   please take a look at this material as to what we don t know about wmd  it is big  the memo wasn t about what we knew about the alleged iraqi weapons programs  but rather what we didn t know  as it turns out  we didn t know diddly squat  the report stated basically  just before the bush administration made their case for war  they knew very little about what was actually going on  that translated to the doom and gloom reporting to the american people by their leaders that a maniac had most definitely acquired nuclear  chemical and or biological weapons that could be used against the us or its interests while an article in politico points out that rumsfeld was under no legal obligation to disclose the classified memo or its contents  it is only fair to note that he and his bosses opted instead to send colin powell to the un for the infamous speech full of lies that gained the support of the united kingdom and a coalition of nations the memo proves that we were going to war no matter what  they weren t fed bad information  they didn t push america off that cliff and into another ground war because they thought they knew what iraq was hiding  they jumped off because they knew exactly what they didn t know  and even that pointed to a country far less dangerous than the one they sold the american people featured image via wikipedia
