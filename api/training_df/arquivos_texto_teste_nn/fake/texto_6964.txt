when you re given a free pass by the government to pretty much make whatever you want with no responsibility if something devastating were to happen because of your product  you d probably make whatever the hell you wanted with no remorse  after all  profit is more important that human life  right  at least  that s what the government is telling gun manufacturers with the  protection of lawful commerce in arms act  the law   prohibit s  civil liability actions from being brought or continued against manufacturers  distributors  dealers  or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages  injunctive or other relief resulting from the misuse of their products by others   with one of the reasons for the law literally being   to prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce   in other words  they don t want any silly lawsuit to get in the way of profit on paper  it may look like it makes sense to not hold gun manufacturers liable for how their product is used  after all  it s not their fault if a gun is not handled properly or used to harm someone else  however  what so many fail to see is the fact that with no responsibility it gives gun manufacturers a free pass to basically make whatever they want  regardless of public safety  if they can make it  people will buy it  and after that  well  they re off the hook so  with all that being said  gun manufacturer precision syndicate  llc made a gun for a client to look like the gun from nintendo for the game  duck hunt   calling it the  nintendo glock   the gun literally looks like a toy via facebook here s the toy for comparison  it was always fun duck hunting and then switching to super mario bros  for some reason i would panic when i thought i shot the poor pup      who else had fun with this   retro  retrogaminglife  nintendo  nintendocontroller  nintendozapper  zapper  supermariobros  duckhunt  nintendocartridge   photo posted by conspiracy xtreme gaming   conspiracyxtremegaming  on mar    at   psthowever  after posting the picture to their facebook page about the gun  they apparently got two reactions  request for purchase  and or outrage  all in all  the image got over   comments  and nearly  thousand shares  they then had to make a follow up post stating in light of the  nintendo glock  drama  we feel that the media and our fans need to know that this firearm will not be mass produced nor will it ever be  this is a one off custom build for a friend of ours  do to the thousands of emails and messages we have received in the past  days we have been unable to contact everyone in a timely manner  please be patient we will get to you as soon as possible  thank you all for your support  oh  and please   keep your guns locked up and away from children  it s common sense via facebookhow nice of them to be condescending enough to remind people to lock up their guns to keep them away from children  if only they could use that  common sense  know how to think twice before making a gun that looks exactly like a popular toy that children would want to play with now  say this gun were to get into the hands of a child for any number of reasons  this gun manufacturer is essentially off the hook  because assuming it functions properly and has no mechanical faults that cause injury  if someone were to just use the gun  the maker has no liability according to the law there will certainly be people who disagree that gun manufacturers should have liability over how their product is used  but when something is made that so obviously could be mistaken for a toy  a toy that a child could point and shoot  there needs to be better  well regulated  standards to guns  after all  the second amendment was written for the intent to arm the state militias  not so gun enthusiasts can have firearms that look like toys or so that gun manufacturers can make as much profit as possible featured photo by scott olson getty images
