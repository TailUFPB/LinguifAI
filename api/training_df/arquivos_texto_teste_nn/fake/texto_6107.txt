shell admits to spilling   gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico on may     footage of the spill  captured by ecogig scientist dr  ian macdonald during a fly over of the site  shows that the company has vastly misrepresented the size and magnitude of the spill according to macdonald  the spill covers more than five square nautical miles  the equivalent of  square kilometers  or about   acres maps  flight logs and other documentation regarding the aerial survey of the may  gulf oil spill can be found here macdonald s survey of the deepwater spill found that the extent of the damage is not consistent with the company s stated figures as macdonald reports here even if the average thickness of the visible oil were a mere  micron    millimeter  vastly smaller than the areas of emulsified oil that stretch across the area   the visible surface oil would represent about   gallons of oil macdonald is with the nonprofit organization on wings of care  the group has conducted hundreds of aerial surveys and logged thousands of flight tracking hours since   working in the gulf of mexico  pacific ocean coast and many other areas referring to the recent shell oil spill  which is located about  miles off the coast of louisiana  macdonald stressed the severity of what he observed  saying  we haven t seen images like this since the bp disaster of  according to his report  which can be read here  the smell of oil was so strong that it was physically  uncomfortable  for the crew to fly closer than   feet above the spill during the fly over macdonald observed two small  clean up  vessels according to the report there were two skimming vessels in the vicinity  but they appeared to be on the distant periphery of the slick  and the amount of oil that appeared to be within their booms was pitifully small compared to the size of the slick  which covered over  square nautical miles on may   skytruth  a nonprofit environmental organization based in west virginia  blasted shell s response to the spill calling it  a joke  but not a very funny joke   writing thank you  shell  for demonstrating quite convincingly over the past  days that oil spill cleanup is nothing more than a convenient fantasy the organization also raised alarms about the shoddy monitoring of offshore drilling operations  noting that the recent spill was discovered entirely by accident this spill was discovered accidentally by a helicopter pilot flying over the area who happened to spot the slick   that s right  a modern pipeline at a high tech deepwater development project leaked thousands of gallons of oil  and that leak was accidentally discovered   not because high tech telemetry on the pipeline signaled an alarm due to a drop in pressure  not because flow metering detected a difference between what was going in one end of the pipe vs  what was coming out the other   how long would this leak have continued  if not for the sheer luck of having a vigilant pilot happening by here s the disturbing footage from macdonald s fly over of the spill  image credit  video screen capture via ian macdonald  youtube
