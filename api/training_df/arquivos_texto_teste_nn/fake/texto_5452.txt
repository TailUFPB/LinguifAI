almost every well known celebrity will likely get a moment where a gossip magazine does a feature on them telling the public what we may not know about them  so  keeping with the tradition of doing the same for politicians that may not have been featured  bill maher on hbo s real time just did   things you don t know about donald trump  many of them were funny  i don t drink alcohol  i cause others to drink alcohol  not only do i read the bible  the book of revelations mentions me by name  mar a lago  is spanish for  house of douche   i saved the box melania arrived in so i can return her when she turns   i never actually believed obama was born in kenya  because i thought the name of the country was kanye  yet  some were all too real  sometimes  late at night  i worry that my obsessive self aggrandizement and self promotion are symptoms of a inner weakness and a transparent  childish impulse that everyone can see  i worry they re laughing at how obvious it is that i m an abandoned  frightened child swirling in a black emptiness  or hitting trump on his obvious racism  i cry at movies because they re integrated  and  of course  going back to the oldie  but a goodie where maher calls trump an orangutan  i can peel a banana with my feet  maher hits the nail on the head  and i don t care who you are  this segment is beyond hilarious  because most of them are probably true watch the full segment here featured image via video screen capture
