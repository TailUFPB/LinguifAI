over the last few months  donald trump has been able to garner enough votes to make him the presumptive republican nominee for the presidency  unfortunately  his message has been based on divisiveness  consistently attacking minorities as the cause of the country s woes  not since the america when it was perfectly fine to discriminate against women has there been a candidate whose views on women have been so repulsive  not since jim crow america  when it was perfectly fine to use the language of racism  has there been a candidate who has openly called for the oppression of minorities  specifically muslims and mexicans  it s taken a long time and america continues to be a work in progress  but there has been improvement and americans continue to work hard to move the country in the right direction trump s america is not the america that we ve all worked so hard to better  his election would lead us to a regression rather than a progression for a better society  thus  our values are inconsistent with that of this demagogue bernie sanders reminds us of this fact in this touching video that lets trump as well as the world know that the american people are a great people and it s our diversity that makes us so great  when we are inclusive as a nation  when we help each other rather than divide each other  we are great  bernie s message is the message of hope and love and in the end  it will overpower the demagoguery and racism of donald trump watch video here featured image via video screenshot
