mike huckabee is fed up with evangelical  christians  and threw a temper tantrum because they won t support his run for president the republican presidential wannabe aired his grievances with conservative  christians  during an interview with fox host todd starnes  throwing them under the bus in the process huckabee s poll numbers stand at a meager   percent  which makes him particularly angry at evangelicals as they flock to ted cruz  this  of course  sent the former preacher into a jealous rage as he accused evangelicals of caring more about getting rich off social issues than changing the law  a lot of them  quite frankly  i think they re scared to death that if a guy like me got elected  i would actually do what i said i would do  and that is i would focus on the personhood of every individual  we would abolish abortion based on the fifth and  amendment  we would ignore the supreme court s same sex marriage decision  as we all know  huckabee has repeatedly said he intends to ignore the supreme court and abolish a woman s right to choose and same sex marriage should he become president  but he says evangelicals are not really into doing either of those things because it would bring their money making operation to an end  a lot of these organizations wouldn t have the ability to do urgent fundraising because if we slay the dragon  what dragon do they continue to fight  and so  for many of them  it could be a real detriment to their organization s abilities to gin up their supporters and raise the contributions  and i know that sounds cynical but  todd  it is what it is  huckabee then accused conservative  christians  of running on  secular standards  instead of on biblical principles and told starnes that these organizations should come out and admit to donors that they really don t believe in biblical principles  they just want to dupe christians into making them rich  look  we re a club  we re an organization   huckabee suggested they say   we talk about prayer  but we don t necessarily believe that it will change things  there comes a time in our lives where we either believe in a great god who does great things and uses sometimes the weak to get it done  or else we don t believe in that and we just get human might and we gather all the human resources and we live or die by the human sword  here s the audio via right wing watch this little hissy fit by huckabee is incredibly revealing  not only did huckabee decimate any chance he had of getting their support  he basically blew the whistle on how these conservative  christian  organizations operate and what they actually believe  huckabee just came out and blasted these organizations of fleecing donors for money by pretending to believe in god and prayer and not really caring about enacting a social conservative agenda because they wouldn t be able to make any more money once it goes into effect this might actually be the first time huckabee has been truthful throughout his entire political career  and you can bet that conservatives are going to blow a gasket over it featured image  wikimedia
