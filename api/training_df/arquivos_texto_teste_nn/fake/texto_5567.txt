there have been two black men  one in louisiana  one in minnesota  killed by cops in as many days  this is a pattern  and an extremely disturbing one  a lot of it is racism  but many white people don t want to believe that  they do not want to believe that white privilege is a thing  and being black literally means living under the daily threat of violence   not from criminals  but from cops  from the people who are supposed to serve and protect us  that is the last thing they do  though however  the thing is this  not all cops are like this  there are many black police officers who are disturbed by the videos of the shootings   and one of them is speaking out  nakia jones is a black police officer in a predominantly black neighborhood  and she was so disturbed by the video of alton sterling being murdered by cops in baton rouge  louisiana that she recorded a passionate  emotional video  she watched the video  quote   over and over and over and over again   to make sure she wasn t viewing it through just the lens of a police officer  or that of a black woman  she looked objectively and was horrified by what she saw  nakia jones spoke to both racist cops who murder black men with impunity  and to the black community  in how to change  and of why she took the oath to serve and protect in the first place officer jones shamed racist cops  as they should be shamed  and a system that could just as easily murder her own sons in the same way so many black men have been murdered by police  the video is powerful  beautiful  and heart wrenching all at the same time  there are too many wonderful quotes therein to begin to put them all in one article  the best way to portray her is to simply watch without further ado  here is the most powerful video i ve seen on this subject matter yet featured image via video screen capture
