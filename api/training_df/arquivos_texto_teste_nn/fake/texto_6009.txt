chuck woolery wants america to return to the  when liberals were punished for exercising free speech and the minimum wage was    an hour during an appearance on fox   friends on sunday the former wheel of fortune host whined about matt damon s commencement speech in which the actor addressed the need for a higher minimum wage and blasted republican nominee donald trump woolery responded by accusing damon of being a communist and suggested punishing liberals who express their support of anything deemed a communist idea by the right wing  in the   in hollywood if you spoke for communism  you were blackballed   woolery said   in the   and  in hollywood if you speak for communism  you re rewarded for it  but if you speak against communism  you re blackballed  and that s blatantly not true since conservative actors like gary senise and tom selleck have both starred in movies and great television programs  also  since when is free speech a communist thing woolery then attacked workers who make minimum wage by suggesting that those workers don t work hard and are just starting out and don t have families to support  most people don t realize that it s not a good thing  it s a bad thing   woolery claimed about raising the minimum wage  i think it s the liberals  job to take the simple and make it as complex as possible  i think it s the conservatives  job   and we don t do a very good job of it   to take the complex and make it as simple as possible  the things that sound really good   this knee jerk reaction to  bucks an hour   my son is  years old  he would love to make   an hour  you ve got to earn your way in this world  and if it costs them   a hour and you re a small business and it ruins the business  what good does it do   he continued   these are people who are starting off  they re not people who have families by and large  here s the video via youtube again  woolery doesn t know what the hell he is talking about  not only is raising the minimum wage good for the overall economy  it strengthens businesses and actually does help the families of these workers according to the center of economic and policy research  the average age of a minimum wage worker is  years old  far from someone who is just  starting off  indeed  the department of labor says that women would especially benefit from a much needed minimum wage hike more than half of those who would benefit are women   about a third of them have children  in fact  of the   million working single parents that would benefit  more than  percent are women  and research shows that raising the minimum wage reduces child poverty among female headed households raising the minimum wage would immediately impact these families and the local economies they live in  the cost of living has gone up along with the bloated income of wealthy assholes like chuck woolery  therefore  minimum wage workers should see an increase and that increase would definitely be over   an hour if the minimum wage had been tied to inflation since the   and if you re a woman  you only make  cents for every dollar a man makes  which makes things worse wage hikes also boost worker morale  which makes businesses stronger  a happy workforce that is taken care of by their employer means a healthier business and a healthier community  woolery might understand that if he hadn t spent his career  working  as a game show host  there are people in this country who work far harder than he does and they only make minimum wage  also  minimum wage is lowest in red states so woolery just insulted millions of conservatives featured image  screenshot
