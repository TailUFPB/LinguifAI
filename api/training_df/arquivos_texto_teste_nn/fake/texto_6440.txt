one of the biggest talking points being used by the donald trump campaign against hillary clinton is that she voted for the iraq war  which  technically she did  she approved of the authorization to use force if necessary after an inspection and investigation into the use of weapons of mass destruction  an investigation that was manipulated to get us into war  but then later found no such weapons according to cnn  the center for public integrity and its affiliated group  the fund for independence in journalism  reported  the bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against iraq on march     let s recall exactly what clinton said back in  in regards to the vote  even though the resolution before the senate is not as strong as i would like in requiring the diplomatic route first   i take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a united nations resolution and seek to avoid war  if possible  because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the united nations more likely and war less likely and because a good faith effort by the united states  even if it fails  will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause i have concluded  after careful and serious consideration  that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation  if we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few democrats  i am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go away with delay will oppose any united nations resolution calling for unrestricted inspections  adding  this is a difficult vote  this is probably the hardest decision i have ever had to make  any vote that may lead to war should be hard  but i cast it with conviction    my vote is not  however  a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of american power or purpose arguing  that her vote  is not a vote to rush to war  it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our president  and we say to him  use these powers wisely and as a last resort  her position was clear  and back in   trump knew that hillary s vote to authorize force was  horrendous   but told new york times reporter maureen dowd  don t forget that decision was based on lies given to her  adding  she s very smart and has a major chance to be our next president  when one makes a decision based upon lies  one must still be held accountable  but others must remember that lies were told  back in   trump seemed to understand that while  yes  her vote wasn t ideal  she made the decision based upon information given to her at the time and she made clear war was to be used as a last resort after all diplomatic means were exhausted for trump to now use this against her is either willful ignorance or pure political pandering  he s a man with no policy experience and knows hillary will be able to crush him at any debate and is far more qualified than he could ever dream of being  so he s grasping at popular mudslinging straws that he sees others use  because they work  yet  facts will prevail  and the internet will uncover his opinions from the past  he s got nothing on hillary  and he knows it featured photo by scott olson getty images
