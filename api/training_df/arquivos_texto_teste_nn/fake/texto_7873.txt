it s hard to believe that ben carson is a brain surgeon after the words that have come out of his mouth during his run for the republican nomination for the presidency  yet again  it s hard to believe the guy s running for the presidency at all  in a continuous series of stupid comments  ben carson has once again outdone himself  during an interview  ben carson claimed that president obama was  raised white  and thus can t identify with the  experience of black america   but  trevor noah of the daily show isn t letting him off so easily  during a segment of his show  noah said  like a glitched character on a video game  ben carson is just off facing the wrong direction  yeah  he is not attacking trump or the other republicans  but rather he s chosen to attack president obama  and it s not for his policies and it s not for his record  it s for not being black enough  so ben carson is saying that because obama didn t grow up poor  he didn t grow up black  that is such a bullshit argument  being poor isn t what makes you black  because if it is  then there are a lot of people living in trailers in the middle of america who will be very upset to hear the news   i m what    but they re not black  and we know this  because if they were  their trailers would have nicer rims  although the segment is hilarious  noah makes a brilliant point  why not attack the president for his policies instead of some nonsensical measure of how black the president is or isn t   focusing on the issues will go a long way in lending some credibility to ben carson s campaign  thus  it s no wonder that his campaign is foundering the type of cheap talk carson has brought to the table is similar to that of the rest of the republican clowns running for the nomination  we shouldn t expect better watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
