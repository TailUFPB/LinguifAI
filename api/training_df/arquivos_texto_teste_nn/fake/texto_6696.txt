on monday evening  hillary clinton and bernie sanders both sat down with rachel maddow for a town hall style interview to try to pick up any undecided voters who may be left before tuesday s primaries  during clinton s interview  a protester interrupted to yell out a question  but instead of becoming irritated  hillary and rachel handled the protestor with the dignity they deserved a female protester stood up and yelled something about women in immigration detention  now  if this had happened in a republican town hall meeting  the women would have been immediately escorted out and possibly beaten if trump s supporters were there  none of that happened here  rather than treat the women like an annoyance  maddow repeated the woman s question and clinton answered it the transcript from msnbc documented the incident question   off mike  the lives of the women that are  inaudible  right now maddow  this is outside of our forum  ph   let me just rephrase the question for you  tell me if i get it right  asking about women and families in family   immigration detention facilities clinton  yes  i m against that  absolutely i m against that  i ve been against it for a long time  i ve said we should have family detention  we should end private prisons and private detention centers  they are wrong  we should end raids and roundups  and when i am president we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship  so we will end all of these problems at the time we are successful by taking the protester seriously and not becoming angry  hillary clinton showed the audience  both at the venue and at home  that she cares about the issues that are weighing on the voters in this country  she could have just ignored this woman  but she showed her the respect she deserved by giving her an answer to the question she yelled out  and it wasn t a bullshit answer just to shut her up  it was clearly something she has thought about and wants to fix hillary clinton acted presidential last night and it was great watch featured image via video screenshot
