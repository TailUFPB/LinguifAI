while most people have pretty much forgotten that florida governor jeb bush was actually a republican presidential candidate not too long ago  it seems that he can t let it go  after being overshadowed by candidates like marco rubio  ted cruz and the party s presumptive republican nominee  donald trump  jeb has come to the surface to let everyone know that it wasn t his fault he lost on monday  the younger bush reminded everyone that just like his big brother  he is also capable of spewing moronic garbage  in an interview with former bush press secretary nicolle wallace  sore loser jeb  made sure to remind americans that the real reason he didn t win in south carolina was because of the pope in discussing what went wrong in his presidential campaign that prevented him from surpassing the other candidates  jeb said   the pope intervening in american politics didn t help  wallace was shocked and pointed out you re catholic  blaming the pope  bush reiterated that he wasn t blaming the pope   but clearly pope francis  inconvenient mass had cost jeb everything  no  no  i m not blaming  talking about  basically  open borders at a time with the whole trump phenomenon was to build a wall and make mexico pay for it  he goes to the border for a massive mass  and he had every right to preach the gospel there  i don t think he should be intervening  i don t think he understood he was intervening in our political affairs  that generated a lot of news and stopped the momentum  when wallace asked jeb to specify just how pope francis had helped the media kill his campaign  jeb explained  the news cycle was dominated by that  trump  to his credit  was very smart at exploiting these kind of opportunities  he s a master at understanding how the media works more than anybody i ve ever seen in politics  kudos for him for kind of creating the environment and then manipulating the environment to his effect  jeb s comments are so ridiculous  they might as well have come from ben carson  not only is jeb criticizing the pope  but he s praising trump  who dissed the catholic leader  jeb is also in an insane amount of denial over the  three way tie  for second place  because he seriously thinks that if the pope hadn t ruined everything  he could have won  according to statistics  trump  rubio and cruz all had over  percent of the vote each  jeb lost south carolina with   percent  but i m sure it was because of  the pope  you can watch jeb blame the demise of his disastrous campaign on the world s most famous religious leader below featured image via gage skidmore and martin schulz
