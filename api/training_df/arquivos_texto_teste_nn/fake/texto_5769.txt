as obamacare continues to survive court challenge after court challenge  and the republican s   attempts at repealing   some good news about the landmark healthcare law comes today from the urban institute s robert wood johnson foundation a new study conducted by the foundation shows that healthcare spending in the united states  over a  year period  will be reduced by    trillion  the study was a correction to the centers for medicare and medicaid services  which reported inaccurate spending predictions based on a flawed view of consumer spending and attributes of the landmark healthcare law when cms originally made those projections  they really thought the slowdown in health care spending  was mostly due to the recession  and afterward we d see a return to the higher rates of spending growth   and that didn t really happen although obamacare isn t completely responsible for the slow in healthcare spending  the study does note that that the healthcare law and the  ripple effect  of its policies are having an effect with medicaid and other programs that is causing more financial stability in the markets the hospital readmissions program  which is covered by federal reimbursements  saw a sharp decline in these rates once obamacare came into law  saving the country billions  that s just one example of how the healthcare law has been saving the government tons of money it otherwise would have been throwing away for frivolous expenditures so  in other words  the process may be cyclical  but obamacare is certainly speeding it up  or slowing down the costs  in this case  the kaiser foundation  in   also came to the conclusion the hangover from the great recession has had significant effects on consumer spending in general  and health spending specifically    has clearly had a large and direct effect on slowing down health spending in medicare  its effect on the rest of the health system is somewhat more speculative  but i believe it s real only one thing is for absolute certain  obamacare has no skyrocketed healthcare spending  it may not be the only thing slowing it  but it certainly isn t bloating the budget so when republicans scream that the healthcare law will add to the deficit  add to the debt  created a bloated budget  or anything else they want to throw out in the air  the should read this study all the doom and gloom the gop has peddled for the last six years has shown to be nothing but right wing conspiracy talk  drummed up to instill fear in people who are scared of a  socialist  takeover of healthcare featured image via joe readle getty images
