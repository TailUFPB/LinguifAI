thinking about going to the movies  you might want to avoid  hours  the secret soldiers of benghazi  and not just because of the film s poor reviews in case it s not obvious from the title  the film was created in hopes of drawing in a crowd of delusional right wing nuts  whose hatred for hillary clinton is only surpassed by their passionate love for firearms  in that respect  at least  the film seems to have done what it set out to do to illustrate the point  on january   as the benghazi film flickered on the screen  a drunken ammosexual playing with his substitute penis handgun while seated in the landing cinema in renton  washington   accidentally  shot the woman sitting in front of him according to renton police  preliminary accounts indicate that an intoxicated suspect entered one of the theaters and was fumbling with a handgun he had in his possession when it went off  striking another patron seated in front of him  the victim was rushed to harborview medical center  where she was listed in critical condition the unidentified  year old shooter ran out of the building  likely fearing a theater jammed full of  good guys with guns   locked  loaded and ready to fire at anything moving in the darkened cinema david grushke  who was in the theater at the time of the shooting  described the shooting to komo news in seattle  saying  there was a gunshot and we thought it was a light bulb exploding in the theater  so no one really reacted  grushke said by the time he and other patrons realized that the woman was shot  the shooter was already disappearing through the exit grushke told komo news that it appeared the woman had been shot in the upper chest the shooter s father later turned him into the police  he was arrested at his family s home in newcastle considering how badly this incident might have turned out  the fact that only one person was shot  and no one was killed  seems almost fortunate here s more on the story from  featured image credit  video screen capture
