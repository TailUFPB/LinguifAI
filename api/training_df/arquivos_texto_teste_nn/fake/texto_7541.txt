on friday night  megyn kelly decided to weigh in on the protest in chicago that sent donald trump packing  she  like must conservatives  accused the protestors of denying trump and his supporters their first amendment rights  his first amendment free speech rights have been shut down   kelly said   the right of those to listen to him  and as that one gentleman put it so well   i just want to hear him for myself  wanna hear him for myself   that was shut down by folks who have an agenda and that s fine  you can oppose donald trump  go for it  but  is this the way   kelly continues   is this the way to shut down the ability of chicagoans and those  in some cases  who have traveled for miles and miles and waited for hours and hours to get in  to have their say and hear him for themselves  for all these people know  they weren t trump supporters  maybe they would have walked away saying   you know what  he s not for me   we ll never know now  well  seems that kelly has forgotten a very key component to the first amendment  freedom of assembly is a right granted to everyone  that means that the protestors had just as much of a right to go protest trump  as trump has a right to go spew whatever hateful rhetoric he wants no one forced trump to run away  the chicago police did not advise trump s campaign to cancel the rally  this wasn t a  safe space  for trump and his supporters to preach hate against minorities and make jokes about how big their d cks are  it was an event open to the public  the public showed up and let everyone know how they feel  trump couldn t handle that it s important to keep in mind that earlier that day on friday  a trump rally in st  louis nearly turned into a full blown race war  when protestors show up and practice their right to freedom of assembly  they are met with violence from trump supporters  if we are going to talk about denying people their rights  let s talk about the trump youth s use of violent intimidation tactics to shut down peaceful protest against their leader you can watch kelly s commentary below featured image via video screen capture
