ted cruz is so hated that even his home state newspapers will endorse anyone but him and what they had to say about him is absolutely embarrassing despite being the only presidential candidate from the lone star state  the three major newspapers in texas refused to endorse the tea party senator  citing his dangerous agenda according to the san antonio express news  the freshman senator has demonstrated a frightening willingness to push the american economy to the brink of disaster to pursue his ideological agenda   even when he clearly does not have the votes to get his way the freshman senator s methodical run for the white house is obviously well planned  but cruz s self centered approach has thoroughly alienated even his republican senate colleagues  and that is obviously a recipe for a weak  unsuccessful administration  he lacks the temperament to be president instead  the newspaper reluctantly endorsed jeb bush  writing that he s  not the flashiest candidate in the crowded republican presidential field  and he lacks the mischievous charm that his older brother  george w  bush  used to navigate his way through campaign obstacles  that really sounds like a ringing endorsement  doesn t it the dallas morning news also rejected cruz  writing in their endorsement of  crusty  and  irritable  ohio governor john kasich that  as much as we d like to see a texan in the white house  we fear that cruz s brand of politics is more about disruption than governing and threatens to take the republican party to a dark place  as we ve written before  continuing obstructionist paths might excite primary voters  but it won t benefit the nation or the conservative cause  the houston chronicle echoed their rival newspapers  piling on the criticism of ted cruz while joining the san antonio express news by endorsing bush as well  he may not be a great candidate   the chronicle conceded   but he would be a great nominee   and a capable president   the paper continued in an obviously desperate bid to endorse anyone but cruz  whom they slammed as  disastrous for the republican party  disastrous for the nation  jeb bush and john kasich are currently polling in single digits nationally as cruz and trump continue to lead the field with their brand of conservative lunacy that appeals to a large swath of right wing voters who just want to light a match and watch the country burn but it s truly hilarious that even texas newspapers don t have the stomach to endorse to cruz  it should be embarrassing for him  but he hates the free press so he probably doesn t care  hopefully voters will care enough to stop supporting him featured image  nation of change
