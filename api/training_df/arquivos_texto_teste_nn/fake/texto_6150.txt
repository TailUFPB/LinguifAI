when listening to donald trump speak  he keeps talking about  the good old days  and how he wants to  make america great again   however  what exactly are these good old days he speaks of  and in case he didn t notice  america is already pretty damn great trump would see and hear protesters at his rallies and encourage violence  saying that they should be brought out on stretchers  and that they should be punched in the face  all the while offering to pay legal fees  he keeps saying that he wants to go back to the days when that was seemingly socially acceptable well  guess what  it s not acceptable  it s not now  and it should have never been putting together a mash up that will send chills down your spine is mother jones  they laid down audio from trump at his rallies over video from protests during the horrific segregation era in america when jim crow still ran rampant in several parts of the nation  where protesters were beaten  dragged  and sometimes killed it s an era we most certainly do not want to go back to  they most definitely were not the  good old days   and it will definitely not  make america great again   it would set us back decades  and it would divide the nation once again in a way that s just absolutely horrific to even imagine we need to make sure donald trump doesn t get anywhere near the oval office  this is not the america we need nor should ever want  not  at  all watch the mash up via mother jones here https   www facebook com motherjones videos  featured image via video screen grabs
