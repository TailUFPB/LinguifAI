thanks to a repeal of a long standing law in   kansas currently doesn t have discrimination protection on the basis of sexual orientation  but rather than rectify that blot on the state s reputation  republicans are focusing on a group that s a bit closer to home  the hapless gun dealer in a new bill  astounding in its sheer audacity  republicans want to  ban discrimination  against gun dealers and manufacturers  in short  they wish to make the sellers of firearms a protected class like those of race  gender and religion as the wichita eagle reports the bill  titled the kansas firearms industry nondiscrimination act  is scheduled for a thursday hearing by the senate committee on federal and state affairs  the proposal would function similarly to laws that prevent religious or racial discrimination and allow gun dealers to sue in cases where they felt discriminated against as one might expect  the bill is in direct response to something conservatives believe about obama but isn t actually true   newsflash  obama isn t coming for your guns   the bill s architect  sen  jacob laturner  r of course  made that clear when he said this was a way to protect gun dealers from the federal government s tyranny laturner said his bill is  intended to give these folks an avenue to push back  and would  give the firearm industry the ability to get some protection against this incredible overreach by our president  republicans have long floated the conspiracy theory that obama is attempting to destroy gun businesses by making banks scared to do business with them  the  jade helm  of this particular fantasy is a  initiative done by the u s  justice department called  operation choke point   like jade helm  the procedure was completely innocent  meant to block fraudsters from accessing bank accounts  but tin foil hat wearing gun enthusiasts see signs of something more sinister  at issue appears to be the fact that since operation choke point deals with overseeing banking operations  now  any time a gun dealer gets rejected for a bank loan for any number of reasons  they blame operation choke point for inspiring it reality check an audit conducted by the fdic s inspector general  released in september  found no instances where the fdic has pressured a financial institution to decline banking services to a firearm or ammunition dealer  but chasing the delusion all the way down the rabbit hole  laturner and his fellow republicans felt the need to put gun dealers on the same level as those who faced jim crow laws  lynchings  and anti semitism but back to leturner  it s not theoretical  it has happened around the country   laturner said   i ve got a business here in pittsburg that sells guns   they re a great company   and if a bank decides to stop doing business with them because the feds are breathing down their necks  they need to have some recourse  because if there is one group in the country that needs more protection it s gun salesmen feature image via wikipedia
