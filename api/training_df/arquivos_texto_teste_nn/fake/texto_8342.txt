president obama s speech from a mosque in baltimore  maryland this week was welcomed by most as an important and timely gesture to bring together americans of all faiths and none  but for donald trump  is was a chance to sow the seeds of division with a truly pathetic  racist reaction obama s visit to the islamic society of baltimore was the first time in u s  history that a president has delivered a speech from an american mosque  given the rise of hate crimes against muslim american and their places of worship  and unprecedented attacks on the faith from conservative lawmakers and media  this visit was much needed the center says on its website that it  aspires to be the anchor of a growing muslim community with diverse backgrounds  democratically governed  relating to one another with inclusiveness and tolerance  and interacting with neighbors in an islamic exemplary manner  obama endorsed this message and made an impassioned call for moderates on all sides of the political and faith spectrum to come together around their common humanity  he explicitly rejected the inexcusable political rhetoric against muslim americans made by the likes of donald trump  and other republican presidential candidates he replaced their rhetoric with a powerful and unambiguous message of hope and community  let me say as clearly as i can as president of the united states  you fit right here  you re right where you belong  you re part of america too  you re not muslim or american  you re muslim and american  what was donald trump s detailed  profound political response to this groundbreaking effort  speaking on fox news  in an interview with greta van susteren  trump responded  i don t know if maybe he feels comfortable there  because he is a kenyan muslim socialist  i mean  come on trump  and how do we know it s just a case of obama putting his muslim brothers above  natural born americans  we have a lot of problems in this country   trump explained   we have a lot of places he can go and he chose a mosque  the reason trump sinks to playing the race card with his reaction  is because it s actually the only card he has to play  he has no platform  no ideas  no vision for america  he only has a direct line to the prejudices of republican voters and fox viewers  it ll get him coverage alright  but it sure as hell won t get him to the white house featured image via screengrab screengrab
