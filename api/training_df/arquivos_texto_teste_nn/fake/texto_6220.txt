is the primary process in the united states messed up  to be blunt   absolutely  and last week tonight s john oliver took sunday night s show to highlight what makes the process so confusing and unbalanced  and what we can do to help fix it as far as who should be winning the democratic primary  this time around  it s the person who is winning the democratic primary   hillary clinton offering up a history lesson was the daily beast  states used to not have primary races  but that all changed at the  democratic national convention  when hubert humphrey received the nod despite failing to win a single primary or even be on the ballot prior to the convention  this  of course  resulted in a now legendary riot at the convention that left cbs newsman dan rather roughed up by security guards on the floor  so that leaves us with the primaries and caucuses system one designed to give party leaders more say  so  the system is better  but far from perfect  and still leaves control of who gets the nomination in the hands of too few  as we vote in primaries  if you vote in the primary  you are telling the delegates who you want to represent you  but it is still ultimately in their hands the daily beast also offers this regarding the now infamous superdelegates  for those unaware  superdelegates comprise about  percent of the   total delegates  and these superdelegates elected officials  former party presidents  and party bigwigs  are unpledged  and can vote for whatever delegate they want regardless of who won in their state or district  so  during his show  oliver offers some pretty damned good analysis that should clear things up for people still upset about how things are turning out oliver states  now for the record  politifact looked into the charges of rigging in nevada and found  no clear evidence the state party hijacked the process   and you can disagree with that  as i m sure bernie supporters will in the comments  section below this video alongside hurtful remarks about my personal appearance like   oh look  it s british millhouse  but the larger point politifact made regarding nevada  that i think everyone can agree with  is that  the arcane party structures don t reflect how most people assume presidential selection works   and that in itself is a huge problem  any competition should have clear rules  you don t get to the end of a football game and say   ok  who found the most eggs  he later added  sanders supporters might argue that doesn t include all caucus votes  but when the washington post estimated the rest  they found that  would still lead by   million votes  and even if you multiply all those estimated caucus votes by  to account for lower turnouts  even if you give bernie a bonus of   extra votes in every state that s voted so far  and even if you tack on an extra   votes just for shits and giggles  she s still comfortably ahead  and if you re still really angry at the system  getting mad at the rules after you ve already entered the game isn t going to do you a whole heck of a lot of good  does it suck  sure  but it s what you signed up for oliver offers a solution that many should take very seriously  but it s going to require people actually staying involved in politics past a favorite candidate running for office  he said  let s together pick a date early next year to actually write an email to the chair of each party and remind them politely to fix this  i propose february   now  that will be easy to remember because it s groundhog day  which does seem appropriate because  unless this primary process is fixed  we are all destined to live through the same nightmare scenario over and over again until the end of fucking time  the primary process has been around for several decades now  it isn t new  and to get mad at it now is good  but you need to stay angry beyond the given moment of your candidate losing  revolutions don t happen overnight  they happen over several years  and to truly enact change requires commitment  commit to change  make sure it happens  push party leaders to put together a better process  and hopefully  over time  it will happen  but complaining about it every four years like it s something new won t do a damn thing kudos to you  john oliver  for perfectly breaking it down watch the full segment here featured image via video screen capture
