the republican obsession with making it more difficult to vote reached its sickening  albeit inevitable  conclusion in ohio  state republicans approved an outrageous poll tax bill that would require ohio voters to put up tens of thousands of dollars in a cash bond if they want to keep polls open during an election day emergency   with the possibility of not getting the money back what was once considered a national duty and a democratic process that was the envy of the world has become diminished in recent years as republicans have discovered that disenfranchisement of minorities and the poor gives them an electoral edge  voter id laws and so called  poll tax  schemes have made it harder and harder for left leaning demographics to actually get a voice in elections  in ohio  republicans just jumped the shark the new bill could be considered the first step in the road to privatizing american elections  rather than the government picking up the tab as part of its sacred obligation to free elections  the ohio gop   ever paranoid about  big gubmint  spending   will require regular voters to put up thousands of dollars to help pay to keep polls open long enough that people can actually vote  the bill is a reaction to a few emergencies in previous elections that caused voters to be unable to reach polling places   a major car accident along a highway and an election ballot malfunction  for example an op ed written by republican sen  bill seitz  the bill s author  shows just how warped the minds of the voter id wing of the republican party really is  sadly  in both the november  and march  elections  rogue courts in hamilton county issued orders extending polling hours  these orders cost hamilton county taxpayers     and forced the inside poll workers to stay around for an extra  to  minutes after already working a  hour day  what seitz doesn t mention is that the extra hour of work meant that thousands of people were allowed to engage in the democratic process and vote  that seems like a pretty big oversight what seitz surely knows is that these polling challenges disproportionately affect the poor  the fox news viewer  average age of   is retired and therefore faces few obstacles to voting outside of figuring out how to dvr the latest fox and friends episode  those who work all day and have young kids don t have that freedom  a car accident blocking the entrance to a polling place for even an hour may mean the possibility of not being able to vote at all  mark brickner  of the aclu agrees  maybe the polling place lost power  or there was a tornado  or the machines malfunctioned  and voters were not able to vote during the day   he explained   now these people could be disenfranchised through no fault of their own  they can do the right thing and try to show up to vote  but they may not be able to wait around for hours if they have to work or go pick up their kids  plus   brings back a lot of ugly symbolism with the poll taxes of the past  when you had to pay to exercise your right to vote  it s hardly surprising that this is the new low to which the republican party would stoop  in a way  paying to vote represents the perfect union between their fanatical drive to privatize everything and their pathological need to keep the number of voters to a minimum  naturally  even ohio gov  john kasich  who billed himself as a  moderate  during his failed presidential bid  is thrilled by these dangerous ideas  the bill is being sent to his desk and he has shown no signs of not enthusiastically signing it if it goes through  the crucial battleground state of ohio will be one natural disaster away from asking its own voters to cough up tens of thousands of dollars just to vote in a presidential election  and a presidential election that could mean donald trump becomes president  the stakes have quite possibly never been higher and republicans want to rig the game before it starts featured image via library of congress politico
