gop presidential candidate and religious right poster boy mike huckabee was confronted over his relationship with the duggar family and decided to browbeat an iowa voter for pointing out his dysfunctional relationship the voter asked huckabee why he announced support for the duggar family  pointing out he propped up  child abuse  and the subsequent cover up of that abuse while attaching himself to josh duggar  who molested five girls  the duggars have been influential with the  religious right   a key constituency of former arkansas governor mike huckabee s support base in response huckabee melted down  accusing the woman of making a scene and getting her facts about the case huckabee yelled at the woman and insisted that because he had known the duggar children  since they were babies  she had no right to speak out about how the duggar family patriarch  jim bob duggar  had avoided reporting his son s abuse towards young children but the voter was right  huckabee had backed the duggars when the revelations about duggar came out  huckabee announced he was still backing the duggar clan janet and i want to affirm our support for the duggar family  josh s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself   inexcusable   but that doesn t mean  unforgivable   he and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities  no purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit josh or his family by sensationalizing the story  good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things yet as the campaign heated up and media scrutiny increased  huckabee apparently felt the heat and scrubbed his campaign website of material showing the duggar connection so far huckabee has been able to capture the magic of his  campaign when he won the iowa caucuses  he has been unable to qualify for the top tier debates and currently polls at an average of   among republicans  in all likelihood huckabee will return to the lucrative world of being a fox news pundit and cranking out history propaganda videos targeted at impressionable children featured image via youtube
