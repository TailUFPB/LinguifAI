some  try as they might  to say that hillary clinton will be soft on wall street when the opposite is actually true  she knows just how much wall street greed had to do with the recession that began with the housing crisis in   she also knows what we need to do to prevent such a crash from ever happening again  one also can t just throw blanket blame at any one company or bank or lender  the crash was a perfect storm of greed and taking advantage of those who simply didn t know better here are hillary clinton s remarks from december     now  who s exactly to blame for the housing crisis  well  that s always a question that the press and people ask and i think there s plenty of blame to go around responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers  who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards  pushed risky mortgages  and hid the details in the fine print responsibility belongs to the administration and to regulators  who failed to provide adequate oversight  and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of responsibility belongs to the rating agencies  who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities and certainly borrowers share responsibility as well  homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads  speculators who were busy buying two  three  four houses to sell for a quick buck don t deserve our sympathy but finally  responsibility also belongs to wall street  which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending  mortgage lenders didn t have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own  so wall street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure  some people might say wall street only helped to distribute risk  i believe wall street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not wall street may not have created the foreclosure crisis  but wall street certainly had a hand in making it worse  if anyone would bother to take the time to read her proposals to make sure a crash never happens again they d soon realize hillary s not about to let wall street get away with anything  here are her plans she s also making sure to hold those who break the rules accountable and if you re still not convinced  feel free to read a more comprehensive version of her plans here we need comprehensive reform  we need solutions that will no only be strong  but long lasting and unable to be manipulated by those still trying to scam others  listening to people go after hillary and say that she d be weak on wall street is not only misguided  but simply wrong  even elizabeth warren supports clinton s plan now  this isn t to put any other candidate down  or try to convince anyone who to vote for  this is simply just laying down the facts featured image via instagram
