mitch mcconnell probably wasn t expecting this from a fox news host yet  when the senate majority leader appeared on fox news sunday with chris wallace  the closest thing to an actual journalist fox can muster  mcconnell was confronted with what he has said in the past about judicial nominees compared with what he is doing now in the name of partisan politics mcconnell used remarks made by harry reid and chuck schumer in  and  to make the claim that republicans  are following a longstanding tradition  of not filling vacancies on the supreme court during a presidential election leave it to republicans to think that  years is a  longstanding tradition   the fact is  however  that current justice anthony kennedy was confirmed to the high court in   which was an election year  if we go back even further  we find that justice william brennan was confirmed in  and justice frank murphy was confirmed in   both during election years so it s clear an election year does not justify the refusal of senate republicans to do their constitutional duty but chris wallace hit mcconnell with his own words from  when he said on the senate floor that  in a democracy an up or down vote should be given to a president s judicial nominees  it isn t complicated  it s simple  it s fair  it worked for  years and it has served us well  frankly  isn t there a fair amount of hypocrisy on both sides here   wallace said  calling out mcconnell s own hypocrisy on this issue  senator  if an up or down vote for a judicial nominee is simple  fair  and a principle that has served us well for over  years  if that s true then  is it still true   wallace asked mcconnell  of course  tried to weasel his way out of it by saying that  it s apples and oranges  because supreme court nominees are somehow not considered judicial nominees even though the constitution includes the supreme court as part of the judicial branch  it s right there in article iii when asked if senate republicans would confirm garland after the election to prevent a more liberal nominee should hillary clinton become president  mcconnell proceeded to trash current nominee merrick garland as a liberal and complained that his confirmation would swing the court to the left  and if mcconnell and his fellow republicans are unwilling to confirm garland  you can bet that if the gop loses the election  they will continue to obstruct any nominee that clinton nominates to the suprem court as well here s the video via youtube basically  mcconnell just admitted that the real problem republicans have with confirming a supreme court nominee is that they don t want to lose the conservative leaning court they have used to roll back policies they don t like over the last couple decades  they are literally throwing a temper tantrum because they think late justice scalia should be replaced with a conservative judge who will be just like him but that is not how the supreme court works  it has always swung from left to right and back again depending on who the president is at the time a vacancy arises either from a death  which is the case now  or a retirement  justice scalia probably would have preferred to serve another decade or more on the bench  but even he would say that his vacancy needs to be filled even if the most liberal nominee in the world ends up filling it as it happens  garland is not a liberal  he is  in fact  a centrist  but according to mcconnell  even that is far too liberal for him and his colleagues to consider republicans are literally willing to keep the supreme court from working at full capacity for the next year or more until they get their way  so not only have republicans kept congress from working properly  they are now preventing the high court from working properly as well and that should outrage every american to the core enough to boot republicans out of public office for generations until they learn to do their jobs with honor again and start working for all of the american people instead of just their extreme right wing base  featured image via screenshot
