earlier today an unidentified male entered the u s  capitol s visitor center with a gun  the man was apprehended  resulting in a lock down of the capitol building and other buildings in the area  a female bystander  and the suspect were injured  but not seriously it wasn t long before republicans used the incident to racially profile muslims  even though no muslims are known to have been involved in the incident  i don t talk about going into muslim neighborhoods and putting an omnipresence there like stormtroopers   fox news contributor bo dietl said in an interview on fox business channel   what i talk about is having a lot more muslim police officers   uniform and plainclothes   which can talk to people   what s going on    you see something suspicious  i drive by  you call over  let me know   you have to have that communication back and forth  that s the most important thing  is intelligence  we have to realize one thing  we re facing this threat  complacency can t be setting in here  we have to be on guard all the time  the capitol certainly is a target  same as new york city is   said dietl   and part of my thing about the political correctness is  look  we ve got very  very fine muslim american people that live in neighborhoods  that have great families  and their most important thing in life is to take care of their families  dietl tried to affirm he wasn t being islamophobic and racist towards muslims while simultaneously linking an unrelated incident to republicans  warped belief surveillance on muslims needs to be increased  selective enforcement and surveillance based on race and religion has become incredibly popular these days in the republican party  as its front runners for the republican presidential nomination  donald trump and ted cruz  constantly one up each other on who is more racist towards muslims featured image courtesy of flickr
