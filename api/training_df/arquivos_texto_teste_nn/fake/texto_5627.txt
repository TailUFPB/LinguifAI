a little over a month ago  linda sorenson  the republican chair for delta county  colorado  posted the following facebook meme oh those wacky republicans and their unbelievable racism at first  sorenson was defiant in the face of public condemnation  stating  i really don t care if people are offended by it   she told me of the post  which was sent to me by a source   un friend me  stop looking at me on facebook   after all  this is a new day in america  this is donald trump s america and gosh darn it  white people won t stand for being oppressed by the pc police any longer  let freedumb ring but a funny thing about trump s america it doesn t actually exist  at least not yet  and certainly not in the very purple state of colorado  clearly  sorenson thought the people would rally to her bigoted side  instead  according to the the daily sentinel that posting not only prompted calls of her resignation from fellow delta county republicans  but also from several outside groups  including the colorado branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people and the greater metro denver ministerial alliance whoops in the face of all of this pressure  sorenson changed her story from   i m racist and i m proud   to the perennial favorite of politicians who make a social media blunder   someone hacked my account  i m the victim here  after four  accountability meetings  though  including an investigation into sorenson violating party rules by endorsing a local republican primary candidate  sorenson saw the writing on the facebook wall and resigned  the republicans central committee was quick to distance themselves suppes  who is not a member of the central committee  said it was an appropriate move  there s no room for racism  intended or unintended  in society   he said   it s best for the party  best for the county  that she step down  on the one hand  bravo to the colorado gop for dealing with this appropriately  on the other  sorenson is hardly an outlier  republicans have spent decades turning their party into a haven for racism and bigotry in all its many forms  sorenson was simply stupid enough to say it out loud  a trend that has been exacerbated  but certainly not started  by donald trump i wonder who she ll blame for her downfall  i m going to guess obama  what do you think featured image via screencap
