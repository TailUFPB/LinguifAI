her name is m h  weibe and she s here to rap about how evil trangender people are  and all that crap  this cartoon christian s mind was spinnin  about her need to protect girls and women from predatory men in dresses in the bathroom  then jesus gave her an idea  not a good one it s true  but thanks to the holy spirit she knew what she had to do  she stood on a stage and dropped her rhymes  and now she will be mocked till the end of time yes  this christian mother decided to get her point across   that transgender individuals do not deserve to be treated equally   with a shoddy  pathetic  embarrassing for her three kids rap song she seems to have hastily thrown together after a combination of methamphetamine use and heavy daydrinking  the song  entitled  gender bender   is a response to alberta  canada adopting legislation that would require schools to allow transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify to most  this makes sense  girls use the girls  bathroom and boys use the boys  bathroom  no matter what they look like on the outside  but weibe is of the mindset that mother nature doesn t f ck up and put someone in the wrong body sometimes  to combat something she views as unnatural  she has decided to speak out   and good god  it is horrendous weibe argues that tax dollars hsould not be spent making sure that children of all walks of life are free from discrimination  after all  she points out  it is only a  few  who would be protected by new guidelines   and who wants to worry about the rights of a few people   to  children by her count  when a minority in her religious circle have a problem with it  this is just a fender bender  all over sex and gender   she sings in the chorus   can we pick another issue  than to change our bathrooms for a few   of course  no changes would be made to the bathrooms   just to who can enter them without fear  but  of course  she doesn t care about the facts  the yucky transgenders are invading her bathrooms  after all weibe argues that the  animal kingdom  does it right because they  keep their gender  in the wild  though she offers nothing to explain how this is relevant  she also seems unaware that numerous species in the animal kingdom do  indeed  change their sexes for reasons that would be considered deeply personal in the human world  mothers and fathers  the back bone of society  why would we change legislation over notoriety   she raps poorly   if we change the legislation  in a generation will result in anger  pain  frustration  please citizens   she says   let s sieze the day  and pray for children  who are apparently harmed by treating those  few  with dignity while she disabled comments on her own upload for obvious reasons  someone else was nice enough to preserve this for posterity and mockery   and people in the comment rection tore her to shreds it s pretty clear that people are not fans  and that we will not be seeing her in a jay z video anytime soon featured image via screengrab
