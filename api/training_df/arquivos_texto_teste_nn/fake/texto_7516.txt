ever since donald trump decided to cancel his campaign rally in chicago  he and the conservative media have been doing everything they can to spin the narrative  they really want people to believe that protesters denied trump his first amendment rights   which is patently absurd one constitutional attorney  andrew seidel   who works as for the freedom from religion foundation  has been schooling some of trump s supporters on the law and it is hilarious  seidel wrote up an account of his educational trolling on storify  that s where he wrote  the rise of donald trump as a presidential candidate stopped being funny a few months ago  it s serious  this man  who is too thin skinned to hear an insult  will have control of our nuclear arsenal  he will have a presidential podium to hawk his steak  wine  and other infomercialesque products  the lives of every american serviceman and woman will be in his tiny hands  put simply  we have a duty stop bullies from attaining political power and trump is nothing but a scared bully  when he started claiming his first amendment rights were being violated by protesters fed up with his vitriol and dishonesty  i couldn t let it go  here is how seidel fought back against trump s lies   the first amendment protects citizens from the government  not from unfriendly audiences   realdonaldtrump  andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     i e   the president couldn t  open up  libel laws against the media without violating two  amendment rights  free speech and press   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     i e   the president couldn t assault reporters or have his staff rough them up so as not to dirty his tiny hands   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     the government didn t shut down your rally  in fact  the police didn t even raise safety concerns  despite what you ve said    andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     the protesters were exercising their first amendment rights to free speech and assembly  that s why the police didn t shut them down   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     you see  realdonaldtrump  the first amendment protects everyone  including fascists like yourself   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     the first amendment is the only thing that allows you to be such an insufferable  insubstantial blowhard   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march     and the only thing keeping your ass from getting sued for inciting violence  though you re not toeing that line very well  could happen   andrew seidel   andrewlseidel  march    seidel has so beautifully demonstrated  trump s claims about chicago s protesters are absolutely ridiculous if we look at some of the facts surrounding the events that unfolded on chicago friday night  it is is very clear that trump was asking to have a huge protest response  not to sound too conspiratorial  but it almost as if his campaigned planned this  chicago is a bastion of leftist radical organizing  it would have been shocking if there hadn t been a massive demonstration at the campaign event his campaign staff made the conscious decision to hold an event at the university of illinois at chicago  a racially diverse university with a politically active student body and a heavy black lives matter activist presence  now  trump is using the rally as a justification for his supporters to go to bernie sanders  rallies to protest sanders  trump is also once again enjoying having total domination of the media s focus now  trump isn t an idiot  he is  however   a master manipulator  he knows that his rights were not violated  he is only using this narrative to further crystallize his followers support and lionize them to take bolder actions against his opponents  the media needs to start calling him out on his bullsh t the same way that mr  seidel is doing featured image from gage skidmore via flickr with tweets added
