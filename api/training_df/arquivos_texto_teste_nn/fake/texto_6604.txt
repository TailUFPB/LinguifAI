imagine being a woman going to a university where instead of only investigating the person who sexually assaulted you  they also choose to discipline you as well  that s exactly what s happening to young women who attend brigham young university in provo  utah byu prides itself on mormon values  yet apparently standing up for women who have been sexually assaulted is not one of those values  instead  with their actions  they are in turn giving permission to rape  because it s likely not going to get reported  because the women being assaulted are also being punished one woman named brooke told cnn after she brought her story to byu s title ix office  an office that is supposed to handle sexual violence  i thought there would be some mercy  you know  i told them everything  and because of the fact that i was on drugs  they used that reason to kick me out of school after reporting it  you see  byu has an  honor code   and within that code one must not commit sexual misconduct  or participate in  illegal substances   when brooke came forward she explained that the sexual assault came after she had taken lsd  the school decided to send her a letter that read  you are being suspended from brigham young university because of your violation of the honor code including continued illegal drug used and consensual sex  effective immediately  and as it turns out   brooke is not alone  several women have come forward with similar stories of being shamed by byu s archaic  honor code   so many  in fact  that there is now a petition asking the school to  stop punishing victims of sexual assault  the woman who put together the petition shares her story  and says  i don t deserve punishment for choosing to report my rape to the police  but now i have to deal with a criminal trial and an honor code investigation  i don t want anyone to have to go through what i m experiencing now  that s why i m insisting byu creates a way for victims to come forward without being reported to the honor code office  also stating  i spoke up at a sexual assault awareness event at byu last week  in response  title ix official sarah westerberg defended her choice to deny me services and to initiate an honor code investigation against me  she recognized that the honor code has a  chilling effect  on reporting of rape and that title ix  does not apologize for that   i felt like i was being treated not as the victim  but as a perpetrator  byu has made it clear that victims will be punished if they report sexual violence   that s a huge reason why so many survivors are afraid to come forward and contributes to why byu s rape and sexual assault numbers are inaccurately low   without an immunity clause  byu will continue to be a hostile environment for rape victims  and that emboldens offenders and shames victims i can only imagine how many rape survivors have not gotten justice or help to heal because it might hurt their academic standing  it s just absolutely outrageous that women have to fear being suspended or expelled because they were victimized by a sexual perpetrator  they did not ask for what happened to them  they are not the guilty party  byu better take a good long look at their practices and how they handle reports of sexual assault  because this is utterly unacceptable  women should feel safe in their learning environment  and know that their school will be there for them if anything were to ever happen  instead  they are victim shamed and robbed of their education  appalling featured image via wikimedia commons
