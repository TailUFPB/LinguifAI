on friday  new jersey governor chris christie shocked everyone and became a donald trump fanboy  in an endorsement speech a day after the  republican debate  he claimed that he believed the billionaire is the only gop candidate who could beat the democratic frontrunner  hillary clinton  in the general election  however  the former national finance co chair for christie s campaign isn t buying it  and has now pulled her support for the governor hewlett packard ceo meg whitman released a statement slamming christie for his  political opportunism   chris christie s endorsement of donald trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism  donald trump is unfit to be president  he is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears  trump would take america on a dangerous journey  christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly  the governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support  and i call on christie s donors and supporters to reject the governor and donald trump outright  i believe they will  for some of us  principle and country still matter  the move to endorse trump was absolutely christie s attempt to share the candidate s limelight  and even though the real estate mogul pretended to be really  honered that the nj governor endorsed him  they way he spoke to christie after his endorsement proves otherwise it s also true that christie has said that trump is not fit to be president of the united states on more than one occasion  for instance on august   he told fox news  donald is a great guy and a good person  but i don t think he is suited to be president of the united states  i don t think his temperament is suited for that and i don t think his experience is  when trump s celebrating   muslim lie was all over the news  christie called trump a liar and said  but the facts are the facts  and that did not happen in new jersey that day  and it hasn t happened since  do those statements sound like things a supporter would say of course they don t  but then again  chris christie has always been a liar  featured image via video screenshot
