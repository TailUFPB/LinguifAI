north carolina republicans are reeling after a fourth circuit court judge decided last friday what every person on the left already knows  north carolina s gop implemented a series of voting reforms that are a blatant attempt to disenfranchise voters of color  on saturday  rev  william barber  a respected political activist  appeared on msnbc s a m  joy where he slammed north carolina republicans for passing these discriminatory laws the main target of barber s ire is north carolina s republican governor  pat mccrory  mccrory  while he wasn t busy reappropriating north carolina s disaster relief funds to fight for the right to discriminate against lgbtq people  signed voter disenfranchisement reforms into law  he is also now trying to do everything he can to keep those laws in place  including appealing to the supreme court barber touched on this matter during the interview saying  i think the supreme court will leave it like it is  this was a unanimous decision  the judge who wrote the decision actually dissented when we asked for a preliminary injunction  when she received the whole record  she reviewed it and saw that this was not disparate impact  but intentional discrimination  barber then went on to compare mccrory to the infamous racist george wallace  the suggestion that these jurists who are above reproach are involved in some kind of conspiracy  a partisan conspiracy  you know that sounds more like some of the things that george wallace said back in the  s  rather than what a  century governor should be saying  as other voting rights advocates have noted  the court decision under discussion is one of the greatest anti disenfranchisement victories in recent memory   given the consistently unanimous legal agreement n the matter  it is hard to believe that mccrory will get his way and continue the gop s nefarious scheme to keep voters of color from practicing their rights as americans you can watch the segment below  in full featured image via video screen capture
