this is why elections have consequences  during the off year election of   one of thew few bright spots was my new home state of virginia which elected democrat terry mcauliffe to the governorship  while the state senate and house remain in the hands of republicans  having a non crazy person as the governor paid off on wednesday as gov  mcauliffe vetoed a bill designed to protect  religious freedom  by granting the highly unconstitutional right to discriminate against the lgbt community richmond   gov  terry mcauliffe  d  on wednesday vetoed a republican backed bill that would have prohibited state agencies from punishing religious organizations that discriminate against same sex couples  mcauliffe vetoed the virginia bill during a radio appearance  it s unconstitutional  it is discriminatory   he said on wtop   it demonizes folks  it brings fear and persecution  we can t tolerate that  in north carolina businesses are pushing back against the law  and mcauliffe said the virginia bill would have hurt his efforts to grow the economy  we need virginia to be open and welcoming to everyone   he said republican legislatures have been pushing a series of these bills all over the country in a desperate bid to undo the supreme court s ruling on marriage equality  the problem is that corporate america understands that the culture war against homosexuality is lost and doing business in states that pass these laws hurts their bottom line  the pressure they apply to republican governors is enormous and they re capitulating  much to the extreme displeasure of the right wing in the case of gov  mcauliffe  he s simply being a decent human being  an alien concept to republicans just to reiterate  elections matter  mcauliffe ran against ken cuccinelli in   cuccinelli was infamous for championing an anti sodomy law because butt sex is all gross and icky so it has to be outlawed  if he had won in   this article would have been titled  anal sex obsessed republican governor signs anti lgbt bill into law  vows to reinstate stoning of homosexuals  at best  virginia would have wasted millions in tax payer dollars defending it in court only to lose when it reached the supreme court  at worst  it would have signaled the regressive right in the state that it was ok to openly attack the lgbt community again with little fear of repercussions sorry  republicans  virginia is for lovers and you don t get to tell us which kind of lovers are  acceptable  featured image via wamu org
