if you ve ever thought our government is completely run by the national rifle association  your mind won t be changed by this article a federal appeals court in san francisco ruled on monday that any laws that cities or states pass to protect their citizens from gun violence are unconstitutional the case was about three business partners in alameda  california  who wanted to open a gun store  but they were denied a zoning permit  the court ruled in the partners  favor  saying that the right to bear arms meant the right to buy arms  if  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  is to have any force  the people must have a right to acquire the very firearms they are entitled to keep and to bear   wrote judge diarmuid f  o scannlain  a reagan appointee  for the   majority  quoting the second amendment   one cannot truly enjoy a constitutionally protected right when the state is permitted to snuff out the means by which he exercises it  all of this makes sense until you realize that cities and states can regulate virtually anything else that s sold  if a city chooses not to allow a bar or a massage parlor  that s their right  it should also be the right of a city to help mitigate crime  and if fewer guns do that  they can ban the sale of guns unlike gun manufacturers  though  massage parlors and bars don t have massive lobbying arms to control their every move  these graphs are a couple years old  but little has changed  most of the nra s bribery money goes straight into the pockets of congressmen    of them republican and  democrats you can bet that it was the nra who propelled this case to a higher court in the first place judge barry g  silverman  named to the bench by president bill clinton  wrote in dissent  describing the case as  a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a second amendment challenge  conspicuously missing from this lawsuit is any honest to god resident of alameda county complaining that he or she cannot lawfully buy a gun nearby   judge silverman wrote the most ridiculous part of this case is that the ordinance that caused the gun store to be turned away doesn t ban gun stores  it simply says they cannot be less than  feet from a residence  they wanted to build it  feet away what this means is that as much as republicans claim to value property rights  and life   when it comes to guns  there are no property rights  if you don t drool over the thought of guns  your right to keep your children away from guns is non existent because in the united states  it s increasingly becoming guns before people featured image by ethan miller at getty images
