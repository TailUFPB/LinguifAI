the oregon state senate has just approved a bill that would increase the state s minimum wage over the next six years in incremental steps democrats can be thanked for pushing the measure through on a margin of    saying that it was necessary to help lift residents out of poverty and handle increasing costs of living  one lone sellout  democratic senator betsy johnson  voted no along with all republicans  the bill will raise the minimum wage to    in portland     in other urban counties  and    in rural counties to prevent harming business in lower cost of living areas  the current minimum wage in the state is     which is higher than the federal minimum  however  it still is inadequate  especially in urban areas the bill passed after a floor debate that lasted six hours  it was introduced by democratic senator michael dembrow  of portland  gradual increases will take place yearly  leading up to the maximum numbers in   the measure is set to move to the state house next  with expectations of approval by governor kate brown as usual  wealthy wanna be plutocrats have come out threatening doom and gloom over the attempt to make sure oregonians are not living in grinding poverty  jason brandt  ceo of the oregon restaurant and lodging association released the following statement  it will kill jobs  harm consumers  force school and government service cuts and hurt oregon farms and small businesses  we urge the house to defeat this plan that puts election year politics ahead of oregon s economy  source  oregonlive comall that anyone needs to do is refer to seattle seatac  who raised its minimum wage to   hour  the results are amazingly good  with an unemployment rate of only   percent   a rate not seen since   seatac is also one of the fastest growing airport hubs in the united states  which destroys the myth that a living wage will stifle growth and explode unemployment one of the most basic concepts of capitalism is lost on literally every republican who claims to love the system   the fact that more money in the hands of consumers equals higher demand which increases the need for employment  everywhere a minimum wage goes up  unemployment tends to trend down  and the anecdotal accounts of it weeding out already failed businesses or spiteful greedy owners can t counter the right wing propaganda anymore  it s happening  and the positive results are not going to stop featured image from twitter
