house democrats did something extraordinary today  they broke parliamentary procedure on the house floor and literally shamed republicans after they blocked an important lgbt amendment from passing now this should come as no surprise  republicans have always been hostile towards lgbt rights  and democrats have been fighting them on the issue for decades  so what changed this time well  for starters  the amendment originally was slated to pass  with  members voting yea  with more than  republicans crossing the aisle to join every democrat  the bill would have barred federal contractors from obtaining government work if they were found to discriminate against anyone in the lgbt community  this is something that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years and it looked as though it was going to pass  and the issue could be a thing of the past but then the tv voting monitor posted on c span showed that some of the votes from the republicans were rescinded  the amendment narrowly failed    republicans successfully convinced some of their colleagues to take the pandering cowards  way out and turn their backs on those in the lgbt community  thus giving the green light for federal discrimination democrats  rightfully so  didn t like that  after thunderous boos from every democratic member  they decided to publicly shame the republican cowards by literally chanting  shame  while pointing their fingers at them from across the aisle when the chair said  there will be order   democratic rep  gwen moore shouted back   no there will not be  democrats then set out a witch hunt to figure out who changed their votes  they were their offices haven t commented  so there is no telling as to why they changed their vote  who convinced them  and their reasoning for doing so  but if keeping to their history of being bigots  that s all the reason they need   to be bigots watch house democrats put republicans in their place  featured image via win mcnamee getty images
