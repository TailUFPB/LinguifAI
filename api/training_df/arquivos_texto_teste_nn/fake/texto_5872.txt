one of the nra s biggest talking points might have just been debunked  by the orlando police  it appears as though the brutal massacre in orlando might gave actually been more deadly because of the involvement of police the police allegedly screwed up on two different fronts early sunday morning  when they took more than three hours to storm the club and some of the casualties may have been from the bullets fired by the first responders  orlando police chief  john mina said   i will say that is all part of the investigation  but i will say when our swat officers  about eight or nine officers  opened fire  their backdrop was a concrete wall  and they were being fired upon  so that is all part of the investigation  we had a team of crisis negotiators that talked to the suspect  trying to get as much information as possible  what we could do to help resolve the situation  he wasn t asking a whole lot  and we were doing most of the asking   mina said but mateen soon began talking about explosives and bombs  leading mina to decide about  to detonate an explosive on an exterior wall to prevent potentially greater loss of life the explosives did not penetrate the wall completely  so an armored vehicle was used to punch a two foot by three foot hole in the wall about two feet from the ground  we knew there would be an imminent loss of life   mina said source  daily mailthe intent of this article is not to second guess the orlando police  not at all  but  this does completely debunk the nra s  and republicans   good guy with a gun theory  inside a crowded nightclub  it s hard to know where bullets are coming from and it s easy to accidentally hurt people you didn t mean to  this is from trained professionals   imagine a bunch of untrained civilians with handguns donald trump and others say that if there were more guns that fateful morning  there would have been fewer casualties  if you had guns in that room  if you had   even if you had a number of people having them strapped to their ankle or strapped to their waist where bullets could have flown in the other direction right at him  you wouldn t have had that tragedy   trump said source  huffington postthere actually was a good guy with a gun there  there was an armed security guard  but he wan t able to prevent over  casualties  there s absolutely no chance that an entire club filled with armed patrons wouldn t have ended even worse than the tragic outcome we already had  the fbi knows this  in fact  a  study found that people who run and call the police have a much better chance of survival than people who try to stand up to a shooter  this is a direct contradiction to a study done earlier by the very same person that is often quoted by the nra  in other words  good guys with guns can be very dangerous in situations with bad guys with guns  the orlando police admit it  it s time the nra does too featured image of presumed  good guy with a gun  via getty images
