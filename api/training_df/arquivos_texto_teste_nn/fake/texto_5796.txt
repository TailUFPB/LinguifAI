donald trump is the republican party s presumptive presidential nominee for the  election  however  there is a growing faction of the party that is not at all happy about this  trump has been a public relations nightmare since the day he started running  and he is showing no signs of stopping that trend  further  anyone with a brain can see that he is dangerously unqualified to hold the office of the presidency  however  that has not stopped major gop players from lining up behind trump like the spineless  party before country morons that they are  the  nevertrump faction of the party sees this as the massive problem that it is  though  and they have decided to openly revolt in an effort to deny trump the nomination at the gop convention in cleveland this newly formed group of  nevertrump delegates has rebranded themselves  they are now known as  free the delegates  the name comes from the idea that delegates bound to donald trump should be free to vote their conscience at the convention rather than being forced to vote for the presumptive nominee  they held a conference call sunday night  with a reported more than   republican delegates nationwide participating in the brainstorming efforts to stop trump from formally taking their party s nomination however  there is a problem  the party elite at the state and national level are not going to easily allow these country before party republicans to rise up against trump  delegates from the  nevertrump faction say that they are facing  intimidation  from party leaders who are insisting that they are all  as a party  obligated to support trump  a delegate from north carolina says that she and other n c  delegates are very much under direct threat from our state with a    fine  if they refuse to vote for trump  she also alleges that she was  threatened  via social media over her  nevertrump position  the same delegate says that in arizona  in order to participate in the convention  delegates actually have to sign a pledge that they will  unequivocally  vote pro trump despite the intimidation and threats  though  those on the nationwide sunday night call say that they want those who are uneasy about trump to  do the right thing  not the easy thing    nevertrump colorado delegate regina thompson said to those who support their cause  we want you to be proud to tell your children and grandchildren that the person we have nominated and are ready to elect as president is a moral person who will take seriously the oath of office  will you be able to tell them that you were not afraid of public opinion or party leaders  luckily  the  nevertrump delegates already have an outside pac  called courageous conservatives  that is going to be collecting funds to help with legal fees due to the inevitable blowback those looking to oust trump will face  spokesman steve lonegan says to the delegates that it will help to provide you support should you be threatened on the state level with some form of retribution  kendal unrah of colorado is on the rnc rules committee and firmly  nevertrump  she says of the planned ousting  it s just kind of an easy sell  and i don t think that there s going to be enough organized resistance on the other side to defeat it  unruh does acknowledge how difficult it will be to get rid of trump  but she is also optimistic  i m just very glad that we ve just all come together so quickly  because we have a monumental task to actually accomplish  but i will tell you the momentum that i have seen within the last week   it is just astonishing how fast this has come together   she said  we re going to be hitting our peak right at convention time  good luck   nevertrump delegates  you re the only remotely moral gopers left in your party either way  this gop civil war should be massively fun to watch for democrats here is a video detailing the newly revived  nevertrump effort  via nbc news featured image via joe raedle getty images
