while the federal government is at a chronic standstill in dealing with gun violence  the largest state in the union is doing something about it  on friday  california s governor  jerry brown  signed six bills into law that would make it harder for the wrong people to get guns the bills would require background checks to buy ammunition and the purchase would be registered with the california department of justice  the term  assault rifle  will be broadened to include more guns  as assault rifles can only be loaned to family and magazines will be limited to  rounds or fewer  my goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner  while protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners   brown said in a statement source  usa todaybrown also vetoed some bills  including one that would make stealing a gun grand theft  that  brown said   proposes to add an initiative that is nearly identical to one which will already appear on the november  ballot  he also vetoed a bill that expanded the definition of  firearm  to include the homemade kind  it also would have limited purchases of guns to one a month   while well intentioned  i believe this bill would have the effect of burdening lawful citizens who wish to sell certain firearms that they no longer need   said brown the third vetoed bill would have allowed employers  coworkers  metal health workers and school workers to get restraining orders against gun violence  currently  restraining orders are only available to family members when it comes to gun violence the fourth would require gun theft victims to report to law enforcement within five days   i continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible do not   brown said   it is not likely that this bill would change that  california currently has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation  they work  the last time california passed major gun laws was in the early  and the result has been dramatic gun violence across california dropped   from   gun deaths in  to   in   according to the study  which took into account california s expanded population from about  to  million people over the same period among all  states  california has perhaps the strongest gun control laws   california is at the very top end of firearms regulation   legal expert bryan l  ciyou and author of  gun laws by state  told msnbc the current laws include a ban on military style weapons and high capacity magazines  there are also laws empowering law enforcement and adding safety requirements to handguns  the bills that brown just signed will strengthen the laws that are currently on the books featured image via justin sullivan with getty images
