fox news received an email from general john kelly last night in response to a personal shot taken at him by a member of congress this is not just any member of congress it s the bitter open borders democrat luis gutierrez  this chicago democrat is all for opening the flood gates for illegals last week  you may remember that democrat luis gutierrez  in slamming president trump s decision on daca  went after kelly in particular and said the following general kelly  when he was the head of homeland security  lied straight to the faces of the congressional hispanic caucus about preventing the mass deportation of dreamers  now as chief of staff  this former general is executing the plan to take away their lifeline and taking steps to criminalize young people who live and work here legally  general kelly is a hypocrite who is a disgrace to the uniform he used to wear  he has no honor and should be drummed out of the white house along with the white supremacists and those enabling the president s actions by  just following orders  gutierrez received a lot of criticism but gutierrez is standing by his criticism  he told the washington examiner last week   he s a politician  he works for donald trump and now supports donald trump s xenophobic  racist policies  and he s carrying them out as his chief of staff  i m not talking about him as a general  i m talking about him as a politician  what gutierrez forgets is that obama in  said this about daca  now  let s be clear   this is not amnesty  this is not immunity  this is not a path to citizenship  it s not a permanent fix  this is a temporary stopgap measure   congress needs to act  there is still time for congress to pass the dream act this year  because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two year increments  general kelly strikes back fox news reports today that kelly reacted to gutierrez s remarks thusly in an email to fox news late sunday  kelly responded by saying congress did  nothing  to help so called dreamers when they had the chance  as far as the congressman and other irresponsible members of congress are concerned  they have the luxury of saying what they want as they do nothing and have almost no responsibility   kelly said   they can call people liars but it would be inappropriate for me to say the same thing back at them  as my blessed mother used to say  empty barrels make the most noise  he concluded   the congressman has a right to his opinion  kelly also said in the letter   every doj and dhs lawyer says daca is unconstitutional  every other legal scholar   right and left   says the same thing  trump didn t end daca  the law did  that said  i worked and succeeded to give the congress another six months to do something  i am not confident  read more  fox news
