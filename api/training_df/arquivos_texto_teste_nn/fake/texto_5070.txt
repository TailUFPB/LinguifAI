legendary actor robert de niro was in sarajevo on saturday to accept an award in recognition of the anniversary of his character in the film taxi driver  but while speaking about the movie  de niro compared his character of travis bickle  who has psychological issues and violent tendencies  to the republican nominee  i don t know  it s crazy that people like donald trump he shouldn t even be where he is  so god help us   he began as the crowd cheered  what he s been saying is really totally crazy  ridiculous   he is totally nuts  but i think now they are really starting to push back  the media   finally they are starting to say  come on donald  this is ridiculous  this is nuts  this is insane  here s the video via youtube indeed  donald trump has drawn outrage from around the world with his offensive and threatening remarks ever since he entered the race for the republican nomination in june of last year perhaps most worrying to people living in sarajevo is trump s refusal to rule out using nuclear weapons in europe but trump s outbursts have also included claims that the upcoming presidential election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and his call for  second amendment people  to do something to stop hillary clinton from nominating liberal judges to the supreme court  which is essentially a call for gun nuts to shoot her bosnia and herzegovina  whose capital city is sarajevo  is probably also concerned about trump s ties to russian president vladamir putin  especially since the republican nominee has threatened to pull american support from nato and russia has been aggressive in eastern europe make no mistake  trump is crazy and the people in sarajevo and the rest of the world really appreciated de niro for speaking out against trump at a time when many americans really do want an egomaniacal dictator wannabe in the white house featured image via screen capture
