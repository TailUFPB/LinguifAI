the artist who painted a nude portrait of donald trump might be landing in a bit of hot water  due to the fact that trump is now threatening lawsuits over the artist s work ilma gore  the artist who painted the famous nude portrait of trump  has been getting threats from trump s legal team of impending lawsuits   plus they are also issuing digital millenium copyright claims against her via facebook  facebook has actually been conceding to the claims and they have also warned her of legal action under the same premise think about it  out of the oodles and oodles of trump pictures online  the only one he can file copyright over is one showing his wiener this means that trump actually is claiming copyright on his penis  let s think about that for just about five seconds or so special note  the size of the pixelation is in no way indicative of the size of anything it may or may not be hiding ms  gore told the new york daily news   i don t believe i did anything wrong  it s my work and i ll stand by it no matter what  once the image hit the internet  it went instantly viral and has gotten bids for over    after it went on display this month in london at the maddox gallery as hilarious as this is  for obvious reasons  ilma gore has had some very serious blowback that isn t funny at all ms  gore also said that since the image of the painting hit the internet  she has also been receiving many threats of rape  death threats  and had to deal with several stalkers at her home  it s typical of a trump supporter  or even just your average republican   when a woman does something to make you angry  threaten her with physical violence  terrorism  and death  at least trump s supporters are an accurate depiction of the man the portrait got a big boost in publicity due to an unexpected development during the republican primary season  ms  gore painted the portrait in february  but not long after that trump started bragging about the size of his manhood during presidential debates  you literally couldn t buy a better publicizing platform for your work than that as i see it  trump has two options here  he can either claim the painting is defamation by visually proving in court that it misrepresents his genitalia in some disparaging way  or he can enforce copyright by proving it s identical  so  what s it gonna be  donald featured image via ilma gore
