how does the saying go  fox news isn t racist  but number one with racists  pretty sure that s it  and keeping true to form  they re playing directly to their number one demographic by talking about  pride  of course  they infer that it s  american pride   but when you listen to sean hannity speak  he tells the tale of a life that was granted to him  and not so much for others hannity talks about how he s worked since he was eight years old  from being a paperboy  to working in a restaurant  to working in construction  to finally being able to pursue his dreams in broadcasting  to be honest  the first thing i thought of while watching this promo was  how nice for a white man in america to so easily be able to pursue his dreams   and then the word  pride  flashed up on the video hannity loves saying  only in america   yes  here in america where we still have systemic racism that prevents others from pursuing those same dreams that he had  but will he see it that way  no  of course not  does he mean it that way  probably not  because he s too blind to his privilege  however  going on and on about how he was granted opportunities that were granted to him primarily because he won the genetic lottery  is that really something to be  proud  about  to him  apparently it is this video might as well have read  white pride  at the end watch for yourself  and then  i have an opportunity to pursue a dream only in america      seanhannity  proudamericanhttps   t co   fox news   foxnews  july    image via video screen capture
