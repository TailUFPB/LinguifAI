trump fanboy newt gingrich thinks that the best way to root out terrorists and potential terrorists in the u s  is to take us back to the days of the red scare and mccarthyism  and create a new house un american activities committee  speaking on fox   friends  because of course   he said  we passed several laws in  and  to go after nazis and we made it illegal to help the nazis  we re going to presently have to go take the similar steps here  pssst newt it was nazis and communists  and then they went solely after suspected communists for decades after that  often ruining innocent people s lives in the process the house un american activities committee was possibly the most un american government body ever dreamed up  they relentlessly went after anyone in the general population they suspected of being a communist  or of having communist ties  issued subpoenas to those people  and then grilled them for hours on end  they asked about a  suspect s  political beliefs and activities  and to give them the names of others who might have been involved in subversive activities failure to comply meant getting sent to prison for contempt of congress  victims of the committee would also lose their jobs  and their employers would blacklist them  making it impossible for them to get another job once they were out of prison in short  the house un american activities committee was engaged in a decades long witch hunt and that is what newt gingrich wants to bring back  oh  sure  it s all for the safety of the country  so nobody should really object  right  wrong  he d change his tune real quick if he were pulled in front of just such a committee and then saw his life ruined for it  watch his interview below  via media matters for america featured image by win mcnamee getty images
