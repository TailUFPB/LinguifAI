on saturday  bernie sanders released a much anticipated statement on michigan s governor rick snyder and the flint water crisis  in the statement  sanders calls for snyder to resign  there are no excuses  the governor long ago knew about the lead in flint s water  he did nothing  as a result  hundreds of children were poisoned  thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead  gov  snyder should resign   sanders said in a press release in april   flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using detroit s water system to using the flint river for water  the decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city  it turned out to be a disaster  there is an unusual amount of salt in the flint river  the river is also extremely contaminated  so when the salt began to corrode the pipes of flint s water system  lead leaked into people s drinking water one study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as   a day  now it is estimated that it will cost up to    billion dollars to fix flint s water system  there has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one  when evidence was shown that flint s water had become contaminated  snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act  that s why snyder is currently being investigated by the epa just before the new year  snyder released an official apology to the people of flint and michigan  considering people are so angry at snyder  that they are calling for his arrest  the apology has been almost universally lambasted  i want the flint community to know how very sorry i am that this happened  and i want all michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience  because flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure   snyder said in the apology sanders  like so many others was critical of that apology  because of the conduct by gov  snyder s administration and his refusal to take responsibility  families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives  children in flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems  the people of flint deserve more than an apology   sanders said sanders is absolutely right  snyder should resign  it is the only move he could make that would leave him with a scrape of dignity  every moment that snyder continues to stay in office  is a slap in the face to residents of flint and the rest of michigan  though  i am sure snyder won t resign featured image credit  gage skidmore via flickr  cc by sa
