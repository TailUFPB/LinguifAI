gop presidential frontrunner donald trump wants everyone to believe that he is this hyper masculine ladies man that every guy on the planet should strive to emulate  however  as real time host bill maher points out  nothing could be further from the truth  trump is actually more like a whiny brat than he is like anyone s version of a real man maher started out by asking the guests on his show how anyone could think trump is masculine  tell me what is masculine about donald trump  i don t see anything masculine about this guy   the most thin skinned erratic non logical whiny person in the world  that s the  old woman  stereotype  but i don t see what is so masculine about him  then  the conversation turned to the  woman card  insults that were directed at hillary clinton  and one of maher s guests  kelly conway  insisted that the comment was trump putting clinton  on notice  that she better fight for the votes from the ladies  saying  hillary clinton s having a hard time getting these young women in the democratic primaries  they re voting for bernie sanders  so why is that  if it were just as simple as   i m pro choice  or  i m for pay inequality  she d be running away with it  bill  she would be the nominee  then again  though  conway is a ted cruz supporter  so she clearly doesn t know much about being pro women s rights  despite being a woman herself after that ridiculous moment  rob reiner  who was also on maher s panel  shut conway down  saying  so she s not just playing the  woman card   indeed  she is not  she is doing well because she is qualified  reiner later pointed out the obvious and gave trump an epic beatdown  when he said that everything that comes out of his mouth is moronic to the nth degree  maher reminded reiner that moronic or not  trump s idiocy is authentic  reiner replied  he is authentically moronic  yes  yes  trump is a moron  hopefully  there are enough people out there who recognize this as fact and not merely opinion to keep that fool from becoming the next president of the united states https   youtu be  image via video screen capture
