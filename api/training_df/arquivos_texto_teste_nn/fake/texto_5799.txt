it seems that part of donald trump s plan to  make america great again  involves building the keystone xl pipeline  the reason he thinks it will make us great again has nothing to do with the jobs it will  or won t  create  and has nothing to do with oil sales from canada to the u s   since keystone xl will just deliver oil to the gulf for export  trump wants a direct piece of transcanada s profits in return for allowing the pipeline to be built that sounds great  doesn t it  we should be compensated for allowing transcanada to transport oil across the entire width of the u s   right  plus  it d be an influx of cash  trump even said  i want it built  but i want a piece of the profits  that s how we re going to make our country rich again  all right  score one for the little guy or not  under international law set forth by the world trade organization  governments must apply the same tax treatments to both domestic and foreign products  trump s plan amounts to an extra tax on transcanada that domestic drillers  particularly in north dakota  would escape despite also using the pipeline  there are also problems with his plan usurping congressional authority on taxes  which is why congressional republicans aren t happy about this however  trump sees the issue through the lens of his shady business acumen  and not through the realities of international relations and laws  so of course he thinks he can simply make a deal with transcanada and with canada itself  plus  he knows transcanada is willing to do almost anything to get that pipeline built  so he believes he d have them over a barrel  no pun intended  and could extract whatever concessions he wants from them  international law be damned there s also the issue of hurting relations with canada  he s already hurt our relationship with mexico and would continue to do so as president   does he really think alienating the only two countries with which we share land borders is a good idea  jeffrey jones  a columnist for globe and mail  called this  kooky proposal  uncomfortably close to nationalization  jones also said  in fact  why stop at oil pipelines  mr  trump could demand a fatter take from natural gas lines or even restaurants and retail stores  and trump would  because that s how he s going to  make america great again   in his mind  the world owes us a ton  and while many might agree  many of those same people don t agree with the tactics he plans to use to make them pay up  including ripping up existing trade agreements like nafta this isn t the first time that trump has said we  need a better deal   on keystone xl  but  last year  he said that he would approve the pipeline project as is immediately upon taking office  that s since changed  and as long as the u s  gets the better deal  he doesn t really care about the law  it s a similar situation with what he wants to do with china   against international law  but a better deal for us and so he ll find a way to force it president obama has repeatedly blocked the construction of keystone xl because we don t need another environmental disaster waiting to happen running the entire width of the country  in fact  obama met with canadian prime minister justin trudeau about it  and while trudeau was disappointed that obama would block keystone  they both believe action on climate change will depend on both of them working together and making compromises trump  on the other hand  thinks climate change is a hoax for a whole host of illogical reasons  not the least of which is because it gets cold and snows in some places in the winter  his motive for wanting to build keystone xl is purely profit driven  like any good little corporate mogul s motives would be  at least obama has solid reasons for opposing keystone xl  trump just wants money  money  and more money the sad thing is that it s not likely that even his idea would  make our country rich again   he s thinking about his own profit  who knows where that money would go should king trump actually get elected  given his disregard for all sorts of laws  he d probably find a way to divert that money to his own coffers  at least until he was caught and hauled before an international court over the issue good ol  trump  looking out for  the little guy   because that s clearly himself featured image by ralph freso getty images
