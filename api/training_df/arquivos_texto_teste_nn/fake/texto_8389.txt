with his son ammon bundy in jail with most of the the militants who had been occupying the malheur wildlife refuge in harney county  oregon  cliven bundy has decided to take matters into his own hands  in a letter addressed to the authorities responsible for the arrests of many of the militants and the death of one  cliven bundy says that the folks still occupying the refuge will fight to the death  the letter read  in part  this is notice that we the people of harney county and also we the people of the citizens of the united states do give notice that we will retain possession of the harney county resource center  harney county resource center  is the name the militants have given to the refuge in place of its original name the letter was posted to the bundy ranch facebook page  in full         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt notice to harney co  sheriff share share share   posted by bundy ranch on monday  february    stunt shows that bundy is even more of an idiot than his son  who had requested that the occupation end after the arrests and after the death of lavoy finicum  bundy said to the media during an interview  what this is saying is that cliven bundy is taking control of things  if we don t retain it  then we ve lost everything that we ve done in the last two months  we re not gonna give up  this is not ammon s message  this is my message   we ve made a decision to retain it   the feds are going to get out of there  remove all federal and state policing agents out of harney county  so  with his son in jail along with the majority of supporters jailed as well  cliven sees fit to make demands of all authorities  he also says that he does not believe that ammon really wanted the occupation to end  but said that he did under duress  that s what he said  but i never believed it  i don t think that s what s in his heart  he probably got his arm twisted  ammon bundy s statement  however  seems to run contrary to what his father wants  to those who remain at the refuge  i love you  let us take this fight from here   please stand down  go home and hug your families  this fight is ours for now  in the courts  the four who are left are choosing to remain  demanding that they not be prosecuted despite the huge number of crimes they have obviously committed bundy and all involved in emboldening this ridiculousness all need to go to jail for a long  long time  their demands be damned  this lawlessness has gone on more than long enough featured image from gage skidmore flickr via raw story
