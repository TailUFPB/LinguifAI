yet another  responsible gun owner  caused her child to nearly die after she left her kids in the car with a loaded and unsecured handgun on thursday  this  mom of the year  candidate decided that it was not only appropriate to leave her children alone in the car while she went shopping at the village market in birmingham  alabama  but didn t think to remove her firearms from the vehicle   a  mistake  far too many gun enthusiast parents make according to birmingham police spokesman sgt  bryan shelton  the children did what all children do when left unsupervised   they found something to keep themselves occupied  the older of the unnamed woman s children found her mother s gun  picked it up  and the firearm discharged  the bullet grazed the woman s four year old son s head  but did not enter the skull  fortunately  the child was transported to a nearby children s hospital where he is in stable condition  if you choose to own a gun you have to be safety minded and exercise a higher standard of care   shelton said   we re glad he s ok  while this was obviously a horrific and preventable incident caused solely by the arrogance and stupidity of one of the nra s chosen  commenters on the story at al com spoke up in her defense  after all  it s not as bad as abortion  right  earlier this month  florida second amendment advocate jamie gilt   who previously ran a pro gun facebook page   was shot in the back after her four year old son found her loaded handgun near his car seat   before the shooting  gilt bragged that her  year old gets  jacked up  to shoot guns with her  something she learned when she allowed him to have access to a gun through sheer negligence unlike the alabama woman  gilt ran afoul of a state law that makes it a crime   only a misdemeanor  but still a crime   to store a loaded firearm in such a manner that it is likely a child will gain access to the weapon  she faces up to  days in prison   far too little time  but still more than we usually see after this sort of incident until these  responsible gun owners start spending real time in prison  this sort of thing will continue to be commonplace  and the nra will continue to convince its followers this was a horrible  accident  that could happen to anyone  never mentioning that  anyone  only includes people who view themselves as  good guys with guns  featured imge via al com
