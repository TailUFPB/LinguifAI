president barack obama is sick and tired of talking about republican nominee  and he didn t hesitate to let everyone know how eager he is for trump to disappear from the political limelight while on his  day vacation in martha s vineyard  obama took a short break to join democratic nominee hillary clinton at a fundraiser   and honored everyone in attendance with an insult the gop will never forget  speaking to the  donors in attendance  obama said  i know this is not an audience where i need to make a hard sell  to some degree  i had you at hello when it comes for voting for hillary  then obama laid down some cold truth for the republican party   trump is doing such a good job at destroying himself that no one needs to spend time and energy making a case against him  frankly  i m tired of talking about her opponent  i don t have to make the case against her opponent  because every time he talks  he makes the case against his own candidacy  ouch  the gop knows this is true  too   they are currently planning on dumping trump if he can t stay on message and turn his campaign around  without a doubt  obama s words are going to hit too close to home obama also spoke about the gop s  unrelenting negative campaign  against clinton  and urged americans to continue to take this election seriously and be fierce in getting their fellow americans to the polls to vote against trump  even though numerous sources report that trump s campaign is tanking  obama warned that this is no time to relax  if we are not running scared until the day after the election  we are going to be making a grave mistake  if we do our job  then hillary will be elected president of the united states  but if we do not do our jobs  then it s still possible for her to lose  when i say do our jobs  what i mean is we are going to have to continue to be engaged  we are going to continue to have to write checks  we are going to continue to have to make phone calls and rally people behind her candidacy  obama doubled down and said we have to be aggressive in our campaign for  days and that s not a lot  but when you think about the stakes  there s nothing more important  featured image via pool and joe raedle getty images
