for anyone who s been paying attention to donald trump  you can t help but wonder how in the world this individual is leading polls by a large gap for the republican nomination to be president of the united states  after watching stephen colbert s analysis of trump s week  one can only conclude that there are many not so smart republican voters out there take  for example  trump s visit to liberty university to attract the evangelical vote  during his speech  trump misnamed a book in the bible   trump loves the bible so much he doesn t even need to read it  apparently because he had a little trouble with one of the names of the books of the bible  second corinthians    said colbert  then he showed a clip of trump calling it  two corinthians    it s like two corinthians walk into a bar  mused colbert  trump however did compliment the bible  saying that it  blows away  his book  the art of the deal do these folks actually believe that trump is religious or that he even pays attention to the bible  if they do  they seem to be either quite delusional or not so smart  they re probably both then there s the apparent endorsement of the dead john wayne  trump was endorsed at the john wayne museum by the famous actor s daughter  who said that if her dad were alive today  trump would be his guy  colbert said  that s right with trump s new found spirituality  trump has reached through the veil of death and dragged back the endorsement of john wayne  the unfolding trump saga and his crazy support base is humorous when colbert sums it up but it s also quite frightening that this guy leads in the polls featured image via youtube screenshot
