this week  black men died at the hands of police in two unjustified and high profile scenarios  the murders of alton sterling in baton rouge  louisiana  and of philando castile in falcon heights  minnesota  have once again reminded us that there is an unequal system of justice in america  if you re white  you re arrested and charged  if you re not  something as simple as jaywalking can be a death sentence video of the sterling shooting shows officer pinning the  year old man to the ground before he was shot multiple times in the back and chest  as for castile  well  we saw him die live on facebook after his girlfriend turned on her camera following the shooting  they had been pulled over for a  busted tail light   and the  year old was shot as he was reaching for his id and wallet as police requested  castile had a gun on him   he licensed to carry a concealed weapon   but this incident serves as more evidence that the second amendment is a  whites only  thing both of these men  like michael brown and eric garner  john crawford and the numerous black men gunned down by racist police  clearly did not deserve to die  it s not like they drew a weapon and fired at police  who would do that  anyway  oh  right ray    was arrested peacefully by police after he innocently stood on the roadside in wake county  north carolina  as he pointed his shotgun at passing cars  you know  exercising his second amendment rights and all that  when sheriff s deputy d r  farmerstopped to question him  ray became belligerent and pointed the shotgun at the officer  this alone would give farmer reason to  at minimum  draw his weapon  but it gets worse  the deputy luckily grabbed the barrel and pushed him back   sheriff donnie harrison said   the man says   i got something for you  and reached in his pocket and came back with a pistol  farer pushed the   caliber handgun aside  but not before ray was able to fire off a shot  luckily  nobody got hurt  that s the good thing  god was looking out for us   harrison said    ray  was very fortunate that he didn t get shot  very fortunate that anybody didn t get shot  why didn t he get shot  what could possibly be the difference between this man and those who were so recently outright murdered by police ray s defense attorney and neighbor says mental health is the issue  but police point out that alcohol was a factor as well  ray was drunk at the time of the incident  after his arrest  ray continued to be uncooperative with police  snatching cameras off the wall of an interrogation room he has been charged with two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm and one count of injury to personal property because of the camera incident at no point was he beaten  shot  deprived of food and water  or denied medical care  it s almost as though he s considered a human being with rights   which is treatment above and beyond what many african americans receive from police across the nation  even if they are lucky enough to live long enough to see the inside of a jail cell  as we noticed with sandra bland  death is always lurking around the corner   and it s usually wearing a badge watch a report on the arrest below featured image via screengrab
