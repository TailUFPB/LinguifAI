donald trump s mouth gets him into trouble a lot  there have been endless examples of his inability to curb what he says  which in and of itself means that he is disqualified from the presidency  there are many right wingers who are so terrified of trump that they are backing democratic nominee hillary clinton  and while others won t vote for clinton  they won t vote for trump  either well  now  conservatives have another option  former cia operative evan mcmullin  while he has never held public office  mcmullin is certainly a sight better than trump  his candidacy  at this late stage of the  race  is most likely just a way to stop trump  after all  he entered the race far too late to gain any real traction  and independent bids for the presidency in america always fail spectacularly  however  thanks to the outrageous nature of trump s candidacy  mcmullin is definitely shaking things up appearing on abc s this week  mcmullin had quite a few choice words for trump  he said  he s not a credible candidate  it s clear  the numbers  the fact that donald trump can t control what he says  he s never had to control what he said  never in life has he had to do that  it s unrealistic to expect him to do that now  mcmullin went on to make the case for voters to consider him instead of one of the two major party candidates  we need someone who will bring this country together  i firmly believe that the time has come in this country for a new generation of leadership  and that certainly is not donald trump nor  hillary clinton  clearly i disagree with the guy regarding hillary clinton  she is easily the most qualified person to ever run for the office of the presidency  but mcmullin is definitely right about trump  there s no way in hell that guy should be anywhere near the nukes  all mcmullin s candidacy would do is help further shift things in clinton s direction  and that is a ok with me watch mcmullin s remarks below   evanmcmullin  trump s  never had to control what he says it s unrealistic to expect him to do that now   https   t co   this week   thisweekabc  august    image via video screen capture
