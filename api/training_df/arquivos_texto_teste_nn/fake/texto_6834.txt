canada s new liberal prime minister went viral after he deftly answered a question on the importance of quantum computing to a room full of reporters  for many  the ease with which he broke down the science was a testament to his intellect  his curiosity  and his interests in promoting science and technology  unfortunately  for conservatives  any display of scientific literacy is immediately viewed as either elitism or fraud conservative writer j j  mccullough went with the latter in a piece on his blog breathlessly titled  the north koreanification of canadian political reporting   he floated the idea that prime minister justin trudeau s answer was a con job meant to make him look smart  moreover  he accused the media of helping the prime minister stage  the quantum computing incident like propagandists out of north korea in the reporting that followed  the canadian media deliberately and pointedly did not place trudeau s verbal essay on quantum computing in the context in which it occurred  they instead chose to present the story in a fashion that would ensure maximum pr benefit to the prime minister   namely  this idea that trudeau confidently called the bluff of a patronizing reporter to put it another way  the canadian media has actually reversed the realities of the story  degrees  what is being falsely presented as a story of a scrappy prime minister resisting a hostile press is actually a story of a slavishly subservient press who are actively shaping their reporting to suit the government s needs this would all be completely eyeroll inducing if not for the fact that professional media contrarian sites like gawker   usually so good at holding the spewers of nonsense accountable   instead quickly grabbed the narrative and ran with it  in writer j k  trotter s own breathlessly titled piece   justin trudeau s quantum computing explanation was likely staged for publicity    he concurs that trudeau s display of rudimentary understanding of quantum computing is impossible to explain if it weren t a vast media conspiracy somehow  we ve gotten to place where an interest in science and technology and a willingness to unabashedly share a love for it are considered negative character traits  we ve crossed an intellectual rubicon and on the other shore aggressively ignorant anti intellectuals like ted cruz are waiting for us with open arms  it s true that under a president cruz  we would certainly never have to worry about having him explain quantum computing  or evolution  or climate change  or renewable energy   but is that supposed to be a good thing it s worth noting that trudeau s office vehemently denies the fact that the prime minister set up anything  the reporter who posed the original question to trudeau also contacted gawker to essentially tell them to screw off  if this is a conspiracy  it s an incredibly subtle one but let s apply occam s razor for a moment  instead of a  north koreanification  of the press  perhaps trudeau s excitement in learning something new about a cutting edge field of technology allowed him to understand and explain the science behind it  perhaps he approached the researchers with legitimate questions and listened to their answers with legitimate interests  perhaps what we saw during that interview was exactly what it looked like  perhaps that s the kind of progressive values that led millions of canadian citizens to vote for justin trudeau instead of his conservative counterpart in the first place and perhaps we should applaud his effort  rather than demonize him just because other politicians have led us to believe science is scary and dangerous watch trudeau explain quantum computing and confuse conservatives below featured image via youtube screengrab
