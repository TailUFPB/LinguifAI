the conservative political action conference  cpac  is full of hard right christians who hate the usual groups of people that we ve all heard of that group hating   most notably  those who do not believe in the christian god  so  to that end  the last thing they want at that particular event is a group of atheists  however  that is just who showed up to the  edition of cpac david silverman is with what is arguably the largest and most vocal secular group in america   american atheists  he also ran a booth at cpac  as you can imagine  this was not a well received endeavor  however  being one of the most outspoken atheists in america has its advantages  and full frontal host samantha bee broadcast silverman s trolling of righteous christians at cpac on her show  full frontal  what happened can only be described as brilliant comedy gold silverman s booth and display included signs with messages such as  keep your theocracy out of my democracy   silverman also broadcast his contempt for religion  saying  religion is a lie  a scam  a con  it has no redeeming values and it has no place in today s society  there were also undeniable statistical facts in the clip that gave the message that refuted the idea that there are no atheists  especially since the number of non religious americans is at    and growing  it warned believers  stop saying   hey  atheists  go away  the thing is  we atheists aren t going anywhere  in fact the opposite is true  we are the fastest growing  religious  group   especially among young people  including conservatives  this was evidenced by the fact that young conservatives began approaching silverman s booth and listening to what he had to say  silverman even referenced gop frontrunner donald trump as a reason young conservatives are turning away from religion  saying through another animation  the conservative coalition  with its disparate components  has always been a platypus  stitched together with other platypi to create a platy franken pus  now it s rotting at the seams collapsing into a festering pile of platy  frank and pus  feasted on by orange maggots  this oozing and tropic goo might present a nourishing culture medium for the atheists at cpac  but many were unhappy to see them  the thing is  silverman is right  religion in general is quickly dying  especially the extreme conservative variety  the fact that a huge secular presence was at them most conservative event held each year is most ominous indeed for that movement  and great for ours  good for samantha bee for broadcasting this phenomenon  and for david silverman for bringing it to light watch the video below in all its secular glory featured image via video screen capture
