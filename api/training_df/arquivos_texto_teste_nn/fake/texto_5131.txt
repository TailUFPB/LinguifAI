with nothing of substance to go on  conservatives have recently decided that the best way to  prove  hillary clinton is unfit to be president is to concern troll her health  on monday  right wing garbage pit zero hedge published an article that postulates that hillary clinton is not healthy enough to be president because of a photograph that began making the rounds on right wing websites over the weekend north charleston  sc   february   democratic presidential candidate  former secretary of state hillary clinton slips as she walks up the stairs into the non profit sc strong  a  year residential facility that helps former felons  substance abusers  and homeless move into self sufficiency february    in north charleston  the south carolina democratic presidential primary is held on february    photo by mark makela getty images this recent rash of attacks on clinton for the photograph  which shows her being helped up the stairs after she slipped in february  is being presented as something recent   and certainly not as a simple stumble on the stairs  this desperate attempt to malign clinton has  in the short time since the photo s publication  become so downright insane that glenn beck s  the blaze  was forced to step in and be the voice of reason however  despite the photo s date  conservative outlets and blogs ran with the  shock photo  to showcase the  questionable health condition  of the former secretary of state in stories dated sunday  aug   the drudge report even bannered the images on its site sunday night with links of years when clinton has supposedly fallen  mediaite reported that the other links on the drudge report homepage included a youtube video of clinton stumbling as she boarded air force one in  and a new york times story about her treatment for a blood clot in  despite that idiotic speculations about clinton s health have officially become too insane for the blaze  the right wing has adopted them whole hog  another rumor the stupid part of america is using to support this insane theory spawned from a photograph of clinton slipping on a stair accuses her of having  seizures  on camera   zerohedge posted random photos of clinton coughing over the years  claiming that  hillary has at multiple times had convulsions that appear to be seizures on camera  including a series of seemingly inexplicable coughing fits  and then there was her on camera  seizure  that wasn t a seizure  a frequently referenced video  shown below  alleging that hillary may have seizure like conditions emerged several weeks ago and has so far failed to lead to a conclusive explanation whether hillary may have ongoing health problems and potential residual aftereffects from a blood clot in her brain sustained three years ago  zerohedge published a choppy gif with no sound and multiple rewinds in an effort to deceive their really  really stupid readers into believing it was actually a seizure  the actual video shows clinton was using exaggerated facial expressions to feign surprise when she was asked if she had spoken to elizabeth warren about the vice presidency after her exaggerated reaction  which drew laughter from those surrounding her  clinton suggested that people try the chai  holding up her cup  snopes noted last month that  notably  rumors that clinton was captured on camera undergoing a seizure didn t start circulating until well over a month later  when they were presented without any evidence beyond uninformed speculation  but  hey  why not completely misrepresent it to cause conservatives to speculate about her health  their other baseless attacks aren t working anyway  they re even speculating about clinton s  handler   who appeared on stage with secret service when a recent rally was interrupted by protesters  the man told her to  keep talking  and assured her that the protesters would be handled secret service agents walk on stage during hillary clinton rally https   t co   abc news politics   abcpolitics  august    informs us that the man might be a doctor  completely without evidence  who may or may not carry something that resembles a diazepam pen for hillary clinton s alleged seizures since these accusations are baseless at best  they are quite popular with zerohedge s readers                  sorry  conservatives  but you have shown no evidence that there is need to question hillary s health  back to the drawing board  i guess featured image via mark makela getty images  modified
