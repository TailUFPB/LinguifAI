fox news and other conservative outlets are doing everything they can to spread the conspiracy theory that bernie sanders is behind chicago s protest that shut down donald trump s rally on friday  during a segment on fox business network  ben   jerry s co founder  ben cohen  was questioned about the matter  cohen responded appropriately by laughing at the show s host neil cavuto mentioning that trump has accused sanders of being behind the protest  he cavuto asks cohen  what do you make of it that there were many sanders protesters there  cohen responds  saying  i got no idea who was there  but i can tell you that donald trump brings out a lot of strong feelings  and i believe a fairly significant majority of americans do not agree with donald trump and are embarrassed by the way he is conducting himself and   cohen is then interrupted by cavuto  who says  well that s your opinion and you re entitled to it  cavuto  bizarrely  then brings up the time that sanders  rally was interrupted by black lives matter activists  cavuto s attempt to equivocate the two protests is rather weak  when sanders was interrupted  he let the two courageous young women who interrupted him  take the podium  that showed sanders has the one of the most important qualities of a great leader   the wisdom to know when to listen trump and his supporters  on the other hand  have an entirely different attitude towards those who disagree with them  cohen responds to the cavuto  saying  well  there are two different ways of handling protesters  i mean there has always been protesters  there has always been people who are trying to disrupt political speeches  but going and telling people to rough them up  beat them up   it s not american  it s not what i want to see in my country  conservatives are so desperate to put this conspiracy out there  they are willing to completely destroy a woman s reputation by spreading a rumor so ridiculous it shouldn t even need a snopes article to bust it yes  there were sanders  supporters at the rally that night  they were involved in one of the greatest protests in history  they did not  however  shut the rally down  trump choose to end the event  those sanders supporters were also a very small group of people among thousands of activists who came to together to show trump that he cannot just roll into any community and subject them to his vitriol without dissent chicago is a bastion of radical leftist resistance organizing  i would personally have been surprised if the campaign hadn t seen the type of protest that took place on friday  this was going to happen no matter what other candidates are running it should be noted that while cohen s commentary on the protest is sound  he does seem to imply in the interview that trump and sanders might have a lot of common ground on issues  this shouldn t in any way be interpreted to think that a trump presidency wouldn t be disastrous  trump and sanders may have some overlap in their observations of problems facing this nation though their policy prescriptions are as different as night and day  come election day in november   people need to accept that any candidate would be better than trump you can watch the fox news segment below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot via youtube
