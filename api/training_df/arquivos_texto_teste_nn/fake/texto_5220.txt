donald trump has gotten himself in a world of trouble over his slams of gold star families  particularly the khan family  he whined and cried that khizr khan  whose son died in iraq  had attacked him at the dnc and he s just been defending himself   this whole time  he s brought up all the sacrifices he has made  because everything he does is totally the same thing as someone giving their life for their country what were those sacrifices  they re listed below as part of this david granlund cartoon that makes all of life in the spotlight very awkward if you re trump  nevertrump  goldstarfamilydonald trump hasn t tweeted in over  hours pic twitter com akkmytdpst  trumphasn ttweetedin   hehasnttweeted  august    to recap  trump has sacrificed let s see the disaster that was his atlantic city properties is enough evidence to call most of this true  of course  he doesn t see it that way at all  he s a raving success for his entire life  and his failures are just lies made up by the evil  liberal  mainstream media trump university is more evidence of the above because he scammed thousands of students out of thousands of dollars each  he s done all kinds of weaseling about that  but the fact remains that trump u  was a scam and students were left on the hook for their money and without learning anything useful  like trump s path to riches and glory a few days ago  trump was asked specifically what he gave up for his country that was in any way comparable to a soldier giving up his life  he seriously thinks that he gave up as much as captain khan and every other soldier who s ever died  and their families  in creating those thousands of jobs he likes to brag about he also thinks that donations are this huge sacrifice  and actually said he works very  very hard  bragged about his tremendous success   and talked up the fact that he thinks he s done a lot here  the truth is  general draft dodger mcsmallhands created all those jobs  built all those structures  and made all those donations to enrich himself  whatever benefits there were to society are side deals to him and if people are hurt when his deals go south  too bad for them  it seems as for the future of the gop  well  he s sounded their death knell  they re too cowardly to stand up to him and his gross insults of gold star families  and most of america is outraged over both trump s statements and the gop s lack of meaningful censure so those are the sacrifices that trump has really made oh wait  there are two more  he sacrificed two marriages in order to build his empire  be still our beating hearts featured image by alex wong getty images
