a black cincinnati police officer is currently receiving backlash over a controversial facebook post where he warned his african american friends and family about white officers that may be targeting them because of their race officer freddie vincent had shared the message earlier this month  which instructed black people on what to do if they happen to get stopped by police  the post read  a message to all my afro america friends and family  when you are encountered by a white officer make sure that you are in a public place  and comply to all of their commands  because they are looking for a reason to kill a black man  and always keep your hands in the air  and never resist  i m so tired of cops using these famous words  i was in fear of my life   i m praying for louisiana  that could have been my nephew in b r  facebookthis post was written after the high profile police brutality incidents in louisiana and minnesota  so it is perfectly understandable why those tragedies would be weighing on vincent s heart and he would want to warn his loved ones of the dangers they might encounter  vincent also had other posts on his facebook account that addressed police brutality  one of them  posted on july   was an illustration on  rules of survival if stopped by the police   vincent commented over the illustration  i can t promise you that this is   true  but it s about   to   and you just might make it home safely  unfortunately  vincent s post has landed him in hot water  according to cincinnati police chief eliot isaac  vincent s post is being reviewed to see if it falls within the department s  social media procedure and our rules and regulations   in a statement  isaac said  the cincinnati police department strives to maintain a culture of professionalism  as well as transparency and accountability for our actions  i am proud of the work of the men and women of the cincinnati police department and our efforts to work collaboratively with the community  we are aware of a recent post to a commonly used social media site by one of our officers that refers to an interpretation of a law enforcement officer s actions  the comments that were posted are under review as they relate to our social media procedure and our rules and regulations  a panel discussion was later held at new prospect baptist church in roselawn  where an audience asked isaac if there was racism in the cincinnati police department  isaac responded  i don t think anyone can say there is not racism inside the department  vincent s post may be even more prominent now  as we are seeing situations where black men are doing everything that police tell them to  and still being shot  just earlier this week  unarmed black man charles kinsey was shot with his hands in the air while trying to take care of a patient with autism  fortunately  kinsey lived but many are not so lucky  referencing kinsey s incident  bishop bobby hilton of word of deliverance ministries and president of the local chapter of civil rights group national action network commented on this horrific incident  when there is a hint of this  that we have police officers who have this thought process about black men  these officers have to be dismissed  we are now seeing situations in minnesota and florida  where black men are doing what they are told by police   putting their hands up  complying with all instructions   and they are still shot  it s understandable why vincent s posts have caused a stir  but to pretend that there wasn t some truth to what he was saying is ignorant  african americans have been targeted and mistreated by police for far too long  and it is a situation that must be addressed featured image via flickr
