a birmingham  alabama abc affiliate sought out voters in columbiana  al to gauge their reactions to the washington post report that alleged republican u s  senate hopeful roy moore engaged in inappropriate conduct with four teenage girls more than  years ago none of the respondents according to walsh told her they believed the post s reporting  it s hard to believe the events that transpired yesterday   gordon fluker of nearby wilsonville  al said to walsh about the washington post report moore continues to lead his democrat opponent by double digits voters are not buying the accusers story the latest problem with the story is the mother of the accuser s story  she just made a huge mistake in her recounting of what happened over  years ago the character assassination of republican senate candidate roy moore continues with different rino republicans coming out to say moore should step down as a candidate for us senate  the problem is that the press and the anti moore politicians have crucified moore we thought you were innocent until proven guilty another key fact  the claim is a  year old claim brought to light by a woman who has ties to the dnc so many things about this claim just don t pass the smell test  breitbart news has yet another item that doesn t help the accuser s case mother makes big mistake  the mother of leigh corfman  who says that alabama senatorial candidate roy moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was   has contradicted a key detail of corfman s story  speaking by phone to breitbart news on saturday  corfman s mother  nancy wells    says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that moore is reported to have allegedly called corfman   purportedly on confman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter moore strongly denies corfman s claims the washington post  which first published its newsmaking  on the record interview with corfman last week  cited corfman as remembering that she provided moore with her number when she was   she said that she spoke to moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom citing corfman  the post reported after her mother went into the courtroom  corfman says  moore asked her where she went to school  what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime  she remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after  she says she talked to moore on her phone in her bedroom  and they made plans for him to pick her up at alcott road and riley street  around the corner from her house soon after  corfman said  he called again  and picked her up again at the same spot later on  corfman described a third phone call she says that after their last encounter  moore called again  but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him  she says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with moore  she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man corfman clearly claimed she spoke to moore on what she said was  her phone in her bedroom  on at least one of those occasions  the post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone wells  corfman s mother  was asked by breitbart news   back then did she have her own phone in her room or something  no   she replied matter of factly   but the phone in the house could get through to her easily  how could he be guilty the post story relies heavily on corfman s memory and her ability to recount events consistently the newspaper reported that  corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with the post  the post story uses the word  remembers   times when quoting or paraphrasing corfman here are those  times   the post cited corfman thusly   i wanted it over with   i wanted out   she remembers thinking  this detail related to corfman s claim that moore drove her to his house  removed his own clothes besides his underwear  took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear   during the initial alleged encounter  when corfman said that moore was watching her while corfman s mother went into the courtroom  the post reported   she remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after     i remember the further i got from my house  the more nervous i got   corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with moore from her house      the post used the word three times when citing corfman in the following paragraph she remembers an unpaved driveway  she remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next  and that at some point she told him she was   she says they sat and talked  she remembers that moore told her she was pretty  put his arm around her and kissed her  and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home  which she says he did    referring to the alleged sexual encounter  the post reported she remembers that moore kissed her  that he took off her pants and shirt  and that he touched her through her bra and underpants  she says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back    in that same encounter  the post relates she remembers thinking   i don t want to do this  and  i need to get out of here   she says that she got dressed and asked moore to take her home  and that he did meanwhile  wells told breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the post s story   it s truthful and it was researched very well   she said asked if she could remember moore  then a  year old assistant district attorney  allegedly asking to watch her daughter in  while wells went into a courtroom  wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the post wells told this reporter   we were sitting in the hall  he came up and started talking to us  we were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court  he said  you know   what are you doing   you know  we told him  he is roy moore  and he said   you don t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering   and i said   no   he said   i will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in   and so that is the way it started  probably if it were in today s times that never would have happened   wells added   he sounded like someone that i could trust and we were there in the courthouse  corfman described her own troubled background to the post  including three divorces  bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse the post related she says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking  drugs  boyfriends  and a suicide attempt when she was  as the years went on  corfman says  she did not share her story about moore partly because of the trouble in her life  she has had three divorces and financial problems  while living in arizona  she and her second husband started a screen printing business that fell into debt  they filed for bankruptcy protection three times  once in  with    in unpaid claims brought by the internal revenue service and other creditors  according to court records moore strongly denied corfman s claims   these allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the national democrat party and the washington post on this campaign   moore said in immediate response to the post s story moore s campaign said in a statement   this garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation  the campaign pointed out that moore has been married to his wife  kayla  for nearly  years and has four children and five grandchildren  it also noted that moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made the statement said the judge has been a candidate in four hotly contested statewide political contests  twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice  he has been a three time candidate for local office  and he has been a national figure in two ground breaking  judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage  after over  years of public service  if any of these allegations were true  they surely would have been made public long before now   the statement continued on saturday  moore further addressed the allegations  now i want to address something that some people have come here to hear about   moore said at a local campaign event   shortly after becoming the republican nominee for the united states senate  the washington post began an attack on the foundation for moral law  on my wife  and on me  for weeks  we read about my salary which they distorted  about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got  but we endured that  later  they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race   he continued   just two days ago  the washington post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the united states senate  these attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly  years ago  but more than being completely false and untrue  they are very hurtful to me personally  i wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present  i have not provided alcoholic beverages beer or anything else to a minor  i have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone   he declared   these allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on dec    why now  for forty years i have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media  i have had investigations by the attorney general  i ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion  i ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary  i ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research they do investigations  as you can see in every one i ve ever run and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the ten commandments and same sex marriage   he continued   i ve been investigated more than any other person in this country  that grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable
