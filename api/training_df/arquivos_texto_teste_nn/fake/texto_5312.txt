the u s a  freedom kids performed at a rally for donald trump in florida last january and played a song containing  lyrics which were terrifying   unless you re pro war   after that  the kids were a hit  featured at media appearances  with the three pre teen girls even telling inside edition that donald told them that he planned to listen to their cd all night long  however  that cozy relationship has changed since then the father of one of the freedom kids  jeff popick  who authored  freedom s call    told the washington post monday that he is planning to file a lawsuit against the trump campaign for violating its agreement with the group  this is not a billion dollar lawsuit   popick told the post   i m doing this because i think they have to do the right thing  and if this means having to go through the court system to enforce them doing the right thing  then that s what i have to do  i m not looking to do battle with the trump campaign  but i have to show my girls that this is the right thing  popick said that promises were made by various agents of the trump campaign it started in pensacola  when popick first reached out to the trump campaign about performing  he spoke with various people including former campaign manager corey lewandowski  his understanding from the campaign was that the kids would make two appearances in florida  where popick lives  the first event didn t come to fruition  and popick says he asked for    in payment for the second performance  in pensacola  the campaign made a counter offer  how about a table where the group could presell albums  popick took the deal after arriving at the venue  the group found that there was no table  and he said it ended in  complete chaos    adding   they clearly had made no provisions for that  afterward  popick attempted to contact the trump campaign to no avail  popick said money was spent on promotional material for the table  which never existed  in addition  popick said he lost several promotional opportunities over the confusion with his relationship with the campaign after donald opted not to be featured during the fox news debate due to friction with the network  a trump campaign representative called popick to see if the freedom kids might perform  popick   tell me if this sounds familiar   was promised that there would be  huge  exposure for the kids from the event  so an agreement was made the freedom kids and their parents flew out to iowa only to find a message from the campaign saying there was a change of plan  the performers attended the rally but were told not to talk to the media  they just were constantly coming over  wanting pictures   popick said of the news media   they wanted to take pictures  they wanted to ask questions   and i had to be a real jerk   in the end  the trip  flights  rental car and hotel were all paid by popick after that  he kept reaching out  again and again and again and again   without luck  he was passed around between staffers  calls went unreturned even after calls were promised  emails popick sent to the campaign  which he shared with the post  detail the interaction between himself and the campaign and his ultimate request   we are now asking and demanding for what has been promised to us and is now long overdue  and has been rightly earned by us   that is  a performance at the convention   an email dated july  reads   or  be made whole  these are guys that insist they re straight shooters   popick said  i ve invested a lot of time  effort  money   he continued   and it s just been complete silence  popick has consulted with an attorney who believes that he has a very strong case popick was a fan of the reality show star turned gop nominee but he s not so sure anymore  at this point  my position is that i have no position  really   popick said   what he s done to my group or what he s not done for my group doesn t necessarily make him the best candidate  it doesn t make him the worst candidate  i still have to mull that over  he might still be the best candidate as president of the united states   or not  this whole story sounds familiar  it sounds like the trump  university  scam  we re not sure what mr  popick has to mull over  if a person is ripping off your kid  then you wouldn t normally cast a vote for them but we re not going to tell the father of the freedom kids how to freedom stand in line  mr  popick  donald has been involved in   lawsuits featured image via via screen capture
