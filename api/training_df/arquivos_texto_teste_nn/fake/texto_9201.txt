room was evacuated watch  as the room is cleared during the net neutrality vote new  fcc meeting on net neutrality takes abrupt recess due to security concerns https   t co  pic twitter com   cbs news   cbsnews  december    communications commission chairman ajit pai was in the middle of his speech during a hearing on net neutrality thursday when he was interrupted by security responding to a bomb threat  i am being advised by security that we are going to have to take a break   pai calmly told the audience  soon after  a security guard could be heard loudly advising everyone in the room   both the commissioners and the public visitors   to exit and leave their belongings in the federal agency chambers foundation that there was a specific bomb threat  another senior official in the room said someone called into the office and said a briefcase was set to explode the commissioners and the audience were eventually allowed back in after federal protective services surveilled the area and situation a bomb threat occurring right during the middle of pai s testimony is not surprising as public intrigue around the issue of net neutrality has become so intense that many incensed people have resorted to vile  racist actions   daily calleris this the new  normal  for the left when they don t get their way repeal supporters claimed the rules unnecessarily regulated the industry and impeded upon the free market under the rules rescinded thursday  internet service providers were prohibited from influencing loading speeds for specific websites or apps  the vote rolled back the policies that treated the internet like a utility and could potentially lead to the creation of different lanes of speeds for websites or content creators willing to pay for them  critics worry that those costs could be passed along to consumers internet service providers will have to disclose whether they engage in certain types of conduct  such as blocking and prioritization  following thursday s decision  they must further explicitly publicize what is throttled and what is blocked  with the information posted on an easily accessible website hosted by the company or the fcc repeal is a hallmark victory for the fcc s republican chairman ajit pai whose  month tenure has seen him strongly advocate for reduced regulation  pai was named fcc chairman in january by president donald trump  who has made no secret of his interest in reigning in obama era business regulations in july   net neutrality supporters organized a  day of action  in support of net neutrality regulations  large tech companies like facebook  google  and amazon all showcased their support for the regulations net neutrality is the notion that internet service providers  isps  shouldn t be able to  slow down  speed up  or block data as it is routed from its content originator to end users  in order to favor particular sites  the net neutrality regulations put in place under the obama administration involved subjecting the internet to title ii of the  communications act  where it s considered a public utility that is subject to the iron grip of the fcc the fcc is now trying to kill these regulations  and they are right do so  here are seven reasons why   the instances of isps slowing down or blocking data to favor certain sites over others are few and far between   under title ii  the internet is subject to a bevy of regulations at the whim of the fcc   the fcc can also subject isps to a slew of taxes under title ii   the fcc also has the power to prevent isps from charging websites at rates they deem to be unfair and ends  paid priority    it s a form of censorship   it s crony capitalism in favor of web giants like facebook and google  that s why they support net neutrality  since it targets their competitors   the better way to ensure net neutrality is to breathe more capitalism into the isp market rather than government control
