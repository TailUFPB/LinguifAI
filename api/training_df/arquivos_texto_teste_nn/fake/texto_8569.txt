it gets more outrageous by the day for the trump campaign when it comes to racism and racists  it appears trump has assembled a political team and a fan base of individuals who are racist to the core  take for example current trump campaign spokesperson katrina pierson  back in   pierson took to twitter and lamented at the lack of  pure breeds running for president in reference to president obama  who has a father of kenyan descent  and mitt romney  whose father was born in mexico perfect obama s dad born in africa  mitt romney s dad born in mexico  any pure breeds left   cnndebate  katrina pierson   katrinapierson  january    her tweet  pierson implies that having a parent born oversees somehow makes someone less american  or to put it in more eugenical terms  less pure   that s interesting  since donald trump s mother was actually born in scotland  one can easily infer why she would find scotland more acceptable to be born in than kenya or mexico pierson is in agreement on all of trump s policies  including supporting the ban on muslims from entering the united states  she also advocates using america s nuclear arsenal in some capacity against perceived enemies saying   what good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you re afraid to use it  katrina pierson is not without a checkered history  she s been accused of collecting thousands of dollars in welfare benefits while working   she also made a recent appearance on cnn where she wore a necklace made of bullets  after anti gun advocates called her out  she promised to wear a necklace made of fetuses  pierson also has an arrest record for shoplifting   ironically  four years before her wacky tweet  pierson sued her previous employer for racial discrimination donna pierson s antics and her checkered history shouldn t be surprising  after all  she s helping steer one of the most racist and frightening presidential campaigns in american history  let s hope that the country can find a few good laughs with these crazies and put them all in the dust bin of history when the time comes featured image via youtube screenshot
