because he was such a greedy prick that decided that profiting was more important than smart conservation and management of resources  cliven bundy s herd of cows is rumored to be facing starvation  since the early   cattle have been left to fend for themselves in the desert after cliven bundy  a private rancher  lost his privilege to graze on federal public lands that belong to all americans  this once small herd of around  animals has grown to hundreds or more over the course of   years and now badly exceeds the ability of the land to feed and nourish them  they range over an immense area about half the size of the state of rhode island  while the area is large  it only receives about  inches of precipitation a year and vegetation is very sparse  once upon a time  the west was wild and cattle ranchers let their cows do whatever the hell they wanted  and what cows want to do is eat  and eat  and keep eating until there s nothing left  this is called  overgrazing   and it s really really bad for both the land and the cows  if you eat all the grass  it stops growing and the dirt blows away  think  dust bowl    and then it takes a very long time  if ever  for the grass to come back which means the cows go hungry the ranchers  being all rugged and individualistic  originally thought that they could keep a handle on it  after all  the ranchers knew that overgrazing was bad so they would have an incentive to conserve the commons but then the ranchers learned that even though people as a group were smart enough to conserve  there was always individual assholes that would take advantage of the situation  they would let their herd graze an area to death s door and then move on to do it somewhere else  getting rich off of hogging the resources that was supposed to be shared by everyone enter the bureau of land management  these awful evil big government types exist to keep the aforementioned assholes in check  what bastards of course  this infuriates people like bundy who only see dollar signs and to hell with everyone else rob mrowka  a senior scientist with the center  said by phone that bundy had given up his grazing rights in  and simply let his cows loose to reproduce  leading to the situation where hundreds are starving now   normally areas of the range are rotated for grazing  with periods of rest to let it grow back  but mrowka said the cattle  are there     days this is why bundy was forever letting his cows go onto public land to eat our grass for free  why worry about keeping your own land in good condition when you can make money by stealing the resources  grass is a staple food source for cows  making it a resource  from the public in the process  bundy is destroying the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise  but so what  he was making a hefty amount of money and that s all that mattered to him this sense of entitlement and narcissism is why he s rotting in jail and will probably be there for the rest of his life  so sad meanwhile  now we have to deal with his starving cows before they actually start to die  letting them suffer is unconscionable  we just have to hope that no one starts shooting at the federal agents that go to round them up before it s too late featured image of a random starving cow via getty
