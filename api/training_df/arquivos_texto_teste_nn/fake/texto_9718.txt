this is unbelievable  the russia collusion scam has been going on for months now with fingers pointing everywhere there is a trump team member  specifically  jared kushner and donald trump jr  who have been defending their meeting with a russian lawyer and others for so long  now we know it was nothing and even cnn now proves it yes  cnn  can you believe it via newsmax the controversial june  meeting at trump tower between russians  donald trump jr  and others was indeed about the magnitsky act  not dishing dirt on hillary clinton  cnn reported documents provided to cnn back trump jr  s account   and that of jared kushner   that the meeting was insignificant and a waste of their time an attorney for the russian billionaire who requested the meeting provided the documents to cnn  and suggested the mixup originated with the publicist who brokered the meet and greet with trump jr   kushner and other members of president donald trump s campaign the attorney  scott balber  told cnn that the publicist  rob goldstone   probably exaggerated and maybe willfully contorted the facts for the purpose of making the meeting interesting to the trump people  and the seeds of a russia collusion story were born  cnn reported  the documents   are consistent with my client s understanding of the purpose of the meeting which was from the beginning and at all times thereafter about her efforts to launch a legislative review of the magnitsky act   balber told cnn goldstone knew the trumps from the  miss universe pageant in moscow where he had a client who performed at the pageant
