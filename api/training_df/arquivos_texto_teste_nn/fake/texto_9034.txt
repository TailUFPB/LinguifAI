garret wayman  a  year old waiter in wichita  kansas  tweeted photos of a   dollar tip he received while working where it quickly went viral  the reason  the   dollar bill that was left underneath a ketchup bottle turned out to be note left by a fundamentalist christian  that was only disguised as a   dollar bill someone seriously left this as my tip today  pissed is an understatement  i was so excited when i saw   pic twitter com czntdlgoqs  garret   beanburrlto  december    note  once opened  reads   don t be fooled  there is something you can have more valuable than money   this is followed by a very long argument as to why a person should read the bible  and become a christian photo courtesy  garret wyman via twitterbesides being an incredibly cruel trick of the note being made to look like a   dollar bill  the note is essentially just like any other piece of propaganda a proselyting christian might hand out on the street  the person who left the note apparently wants it to be made very clear that wyman cannot be truly happy until he finds jesus  things and people will disappoint you  nothing in this world will really satisfy  that is because there is a void in your life that can only be filled by god  who created you   the note reads photo courtesy  garret wyman via twitter i m  years old     in debt because i had to buy myself a car  juggling full time school  and working seven days a week   wayman told tech insider  adding that he was excited to see the cash at first because  getting a   tip at the restaurant i work at is very  very rare  restaurant servers make almost nothing without tips  so it is understandable why wayman is angry about the trick that was played on him  he just left that   wayman said   i wanted to tell him that i only make   an hour and bust my a  at my job to make way less than i deserve  but he was gone by the time i had the chance to  the internet has no love for people who are rude to servers in general  people in the service industry work hard for almost no pay  and are almost entirely dependent on the tips they receive  i m sure that to the deranged individual who left this  tip  probably thinks that they were doing a good deed  but all they did is just show the world once again how horrible religious proselytizers actually are featured image credit  screenshot via twitter
