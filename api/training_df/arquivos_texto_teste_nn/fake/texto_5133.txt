donald trump is so far out and detached from reality that even fox news has had enough  after declaring  three months out  that the election will be rigged to favor  crooked  hillary clinton  the public knew exactly what was going on   trump is already preparing for a loss but even though trump has shown he can t lose with grace  media outlets are not letting him get away with the insane assertion that an entire national election  which requires the participation of all  states to work  will somehow be  stolen  from him and fox news may have delivered the most brutal smackdown of this assertion in a recent op ed  julie roginsky  who runs a crisis management firm  slammed trump for lacking the  patriotism to put his country and its institutions ahead of his own ego  and delegitimizing the american electoral process never in modern history has the loser of a presidential election challenged the legitimacy of our national elections   even in these times of unprecedented partisan rancor  candidates have put partisanship aside in the interest of patriotism and national unity   what has separated the united states from third world nations is our fundamental faith in our institutions and the belief that our laws supersede political strife this week  donald trump changed all that   even before the first vote has been cast  he informed sean hannity that our electoral process was fundamentally illegitimate  that our democracy was as subject to political whims as that of putin s russia or mugabe s zimbabwe over  years of a nation that prides itself on fair  open and honest elections  crapped on in one minute by a racist reality t v  star  all that work  that bipartisanship and good spirited nature  gone  because the fat  orange blob said so while giving no evidence as to how  and citing the often debunked claims of voter fraud  trump is successfully convincing his base that he s such a winner that if he loses  it must be because the states and the party elite are in bed for hillary clinton  even though multiple polls have her beating trump by over  points   he s even successfully convincing his supporters that the united states is a corrupt entity  with a secret group of elites who enforce a dictatorship like approach when determining who wins presidential elections this is why  citizen presidents  like trump and jill stein are so damaging to our electoral process   everyone is crooked but them roginsky then drew a parallel between the great al gore and trump despite being urged by many of his supporters to keep fighting during the florida recount in   vice president al gore conceded the election to governor george w  bush in the interest of national unity  stating that   onight  for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy  i offer my concession  george w  bush s election was certified by a republican secretary of state in florida  where his brother was then governor and with a conservative supreme court handing the victory to bush  still gore did not complain one iota  he accepted the results  and was poised like a real leader should be   disappointed  but supportive of our institutions trump is completely inept  and the fact he s already preparing for a loss  which he calls rigged  shows that he has failed to grasp how america s most sacred institutions work featured image via scott eisen getty images
