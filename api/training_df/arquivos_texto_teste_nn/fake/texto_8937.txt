paul krugman asks a simple question about why white  conservative  people who fly into a rage always seem to do so over really stupid things something that strikes me  however   and which i don t fully understand   is that when people like this turn to angry rhetoric  with at least a hint of violence  the trigger events tend to be trivial  there are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working class whites now  i loves me some krugman but he s missing the super obvious here  white conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people  it was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did  decade after decade  white people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities  but the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering  except for the rich  of course the end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place  what are they going to say   hey  where are all the white jobs   on top of this frustration is the cold and horrible  for white people  realization that they no longer have total control over the government  with a black president in the white house  there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold  those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of america  they aren t coming back this leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives  but to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they  white people  benefited at the expense of black people in the first place  most white people  including liberals  would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap  and so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage  a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be  it really is that simple featured image via ai archives
