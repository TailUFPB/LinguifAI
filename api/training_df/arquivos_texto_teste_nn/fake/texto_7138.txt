among the slew of baseless attacks launched against hillary clinton this election cycle has been the accusation that she s in the pocket of big oil because she s taken gobs of money from them  it feeds nicely into the  hillary is a corporate shill and totally evil  narrative and is now currently gospel among anti hillary voters too bad it s not true after clinton was confronted by a greenpeace activist demanding she answer for her  ties  to the fossil fuel industry  clinton uncharacteristically blew a gasket  i have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies  i am so sick   i am so sick of the sanders campaign lying about me  this caught my attention because clinton doesn t normally get that hostile  as a seasoned politician  she s not prone to outbursts  but  as it turns out  she had good reason to be frustrated according to the center for responsive politics  as of march   the clinton campaign has received nearly    for individuals in the oil and gas industry  the sanders campaign has received nearly    in  you include contributions from outside groups supporting a candidate  clinton s total increases slightly to     compared to sanders     a    difference may sound like a lot to you and me buuuuuuuut  as our colleague philip bump noted  about   percent of clinton s campaign and outside pac money is from the  oil and gas industry   compared to   percent of sanders s contributions yes  you read that correctly    percent  as in   less than percent   as in   a little more than one tenth of one percent   now  you could still insist that    is a huge amount but you d still have to deal with that pesky fact that that money is from individuals that work in the industry  not the industry itself which  according to the washington post  has only given    of all the money it s donated this cycle to democrats  not just clinton but all democrats combined are part of that    you know how some people say both parties are the same and in the pocket of big oil  those people are idiots that should try living in the real world for a while it s also been suggested by greenpeace that any and all money donated to clinton super pacs is all from the fossil fuel industry if the lobbyist has a fossil fuel company as a client greenpeace counts all of the money raised or contributed by lobbyists as  oil gas industry  funds  but these lobbyists have many other clients besides the oil industry  ben klein  one of the lobbyists highlighted in the greenpeace report  also lobbies for american airlines  cigna  and hearst  according to the lobbying disclosure database  so in theory his contributions to the clinton campaign could also be labeled as funds for airline  insurance or media industry it s a convenient fiction that  again  plays into the  hillary is evil  narrative  and  again  this is now gospel to those who hate clinton  but the fact checkers at the washington post say otherwise the sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that clinton has received from the oil and gas industry  in the context of her overall campaign  the contributions are hardly significant  it s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money  given  by the fossil fuel industry this lands the  hillary is in bed with big oil  story a whopping three pinocchios in my opinion  the recent exaggerations and flat out lies about hillary clinton stem from the fact that republicans have spent  years and millions of dollar inventing scandal after scandal with nothing to show for it  none of the old stories have worked and despite clinton supposedly being guilty of all kinds of crimes and corruption  no one can ever seem to prove anything  at all  this means that she is either the smartest criminal in the history of the world or that she s not the epitome of evil we should probably leave lies and innuendo to republicans  we re supposed to be better than this featured image via washington post
