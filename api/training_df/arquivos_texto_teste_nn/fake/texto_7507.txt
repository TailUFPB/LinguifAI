the loving v  virginia supreme court decision in  effectively made interracial marriage legal  and forbade discrimination on the grounds of disagreement and bigotry against such marriages  this is the year   so you d think this would be an issue that is in the dustbins of history at this point  right  wrong  kentucky is taking us all back to the dark days of legalized segregation and racial discrimination  as their state legislature is currently advancing a bill that would legalize discrimination against interracial couples  the bill  called sb   says in part  protected activities  means actions by people commissioned  employed  hired  retained  or otherwise used by the public or the government to provide customized  artistic  expressive  creative  ministerial  or spiritual goods or services  or judgments  attestations  or other commissions that involve protected rights   protected activity provider  means a person who provides protected activities  and  protected rights  means the rights of persons to be free from governmental actions that impair  impede  infringe upon  or otherwise restrict the exercise of any right guaranteed by the united states constitution or the constitution of kentucky  including but not limited to a person s right of conscience  freedom of religion  freedom of speech  freedom of the press  and right to peaceable assembly so in other words  if your boss is a racist and finds out your spouse is of a different race from you  he can fire you  the bill is obviously aimed lgbt people  but it is so broadly worded that at this point  it could mean literally anything   including and especially related to interracial dating and marriage  the worst part of it all is that these people can hide behind  religious beliefs  to discriminate  and there is no provision in the bill for legal recourse on the part of the victims of this discrimination and if you think this won t happen  think again  there are still plenty of people who oppose  race mixing  and anything they perceive to be against the bible in that arena  this will truly turn back the clock on civil rights like we ve never seen before if this horrendous bill becomes law featured image via wikipedia
