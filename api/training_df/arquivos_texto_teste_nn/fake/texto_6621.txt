gop presidential candidate john kasich would like us to believe that he is the non bigoted alternative to the likes of extremists like donald trump and ted cruz  however  whenever he opens his mouth on certain issues   specifically those of the lgbtq variety   we see more and more that nothing could be further from the truth  case in point   a situation kasich recently found himself in when he was interviewed at the commonwealth club in san francisco by kelly bryan  when bryan asked kasich if he believed gayness is something folks are born with  the candidate attempted to dodge the question by saying  i m not going to get into the analysis of this or that  bryan wasn t letting kasich off that easily  though  he pressed  it s not analysis are people born gay  kasich answered uncomfortably  probably  i don t know how it all works  are they  in all probability  they are  bryan then pressed kasich on the issue of lgbtq rights  saying   don t we deserve free  regular rights like everyone else  kasich insisted that lgbtq people do have  free  regular rights   when  of course  nothing could be further from the truth on that point  you have free regular rights  we re not denying you any rights  i m not  in ohio  i m not out to discriminate against you   i think you should have as good a life as anybody else  if kasich truly believed this  he would include lgbtq people in the hate crimes statutes in his state of ohio  of which he is governor  further  he would not be supporting a party platform that opposes marriage equality and other rights for lgbtq people  the only thing kasich did right during this exchange is to vaguely insinuate that he does not support anti trans bathroom bills like north carolina s   on that front  kasich said  i think we should just try to  like  take a chill pill  relax  and try to get along with one another a little bit better instead of trying to write some law to solve a problem that doesn t frankly exist in big enough numbers to justify more lawmaking  well  that s something  at least  but then  when asked about marriage equality  kasich feigned ignorance  bryan said of the issue as far as the official gop platform goes  republicans don t believe in marriage equality  it s your platform  kasich shot back  is it  i haven t read that thing lately   he went on to refer to the republican party as  my vehicle  not my master  the thing is  though  this interview makes kasich s positions clear  he is just as anti gay as his gop comrades  he just dresses his bigotry up in nicer language do not be fooled  people  john kasich is just as extreme as donald trump and ted cruz   he just does a better job of hiding it from everyday people watch the exchange below  via raw story  featured image via video screen capture
