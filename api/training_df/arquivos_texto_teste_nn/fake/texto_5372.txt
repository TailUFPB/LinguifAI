conservatives may have the nominee they wanted but they killed the republican party in the process and   perhaps just guaranteed their own political doom for generations that s what republican strategist nicolle wallace felt like after donald trump concluded his acceptance speech on thursday night throughout his speech  trump attacked hillary clinton and president obama and vowed to turn america into a nation that would be totally unrecognizable and unfriendly to our allies and ourselves trump wants to approach every problem from a business perspective and thinks he can bully our allies to renegotiate longstanding treaties without consequences to him  everything is broken in america and he wants to rebuild it his way from the top down or destroy things altogether if conservatives want him to do so he wants america to be feared instead of respected and wants to return to a pre world war ii political philosophy that led to such a war in the first place so it s no wonder why wallace lamented the death of her party in a discussion with chuck todd at the rnc convention as trump s speech came to a close  you know  listening to this  i was struck by two things that i always believed during my two decades in the republican politics  one  the voters always get it right  and two  the republican party that i worked for for two decades died in this room tonight  we are now represented as a party by a man who believes in protectionism  isolationism and nativism  and those are the forces that george w  bush and  i believe  john mccain were most worried about during their times as the leaders of the republican party  indeed  george w  bush is worried that he may end up being the last republican president precisely because of how extreme trump is chuck todd asked wallace if she really believes the party is dead  and she didn t back down  well  the voters picked this guy  this is where the republican party is now  they now are attracted to those forces of isolationism and protectionism  but the party i was part of for two decades is dead  here s the video via youtube hopefully  voters are smart enough to vote against trump in november  especially republican voters who want their party to remain viable in the future featured image via youtube
