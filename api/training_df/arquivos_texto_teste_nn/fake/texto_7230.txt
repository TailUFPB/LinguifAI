sometimes you just have to point the obvious out  because a lot of people just don t see the error in their own ways  this is exactly what grey s anatomy star and activist jesse williams did when he took to twitter to point out what an ass donald trump is truly behaving like trump tweeted out  just released that international gangs are all over our cities  this will end when i am president  now  terrible grammar aside  this is an absolute ridiculous statement  first of all  wtf  he s just trying to incite fear and hatred  once again of  the other   secondly  trump is coming across like he s batman out to save the day completely ignoring how to actually get something done noticing this buffoonery  williams tweeted out in response to trump s ridiculous tweet  you literally could ve been anything and you chose to go down in history as a preposterously oafish laughing stock  via twitterquite honestly  it doesn t get much more perfect than that  trump time and time again says the most ridiculous things that hold no basis in reality  and uses twitter as his own personal troll fest to be as big of an asshole as possible  his followers eat it up  but to those of us who clearly have a grasp on common sense and reality  trump is turning himself into one of the biggest embarrassments of all time trump was born in to massive wealth  and like williams said  the republican front runner could have been anything in the world he wanted to be  hell  he could have just sat on his fortune  made a few investments and lived his life in peace  but instead  he chose to go down as a  preposterously oafish laughing stock   who at this point  will never ever recover trump  we get that you re a narcissist  but to actually believe that you can handle being the leader of the free world  nah  you re absolutely out of your disheveled head featured photo by tommaso boddi getty images   twitter
