a texas teacher has been removed from her classroom after she openly called a  year old muslim boy a terrorist and did nothing as the other students proceeded to bully him waleed abushaaban was simply watching and enjoying the movie bend it like beckham with his classmates at the fort bend independent school district in fort bend county  texas when his teacher made racist remarks toward him just because he laughed at a funny scene in the film according to khou  abushaaban remembered the incident clearly  we were in the class watching a movie  and i was just laughing at the movie and the teacher said   i wouldn t be laughing if i was you   and i said why  she said   because we all think you re a terrorist  to make matters worse  the teacher s remarks touched off a storm of bullying as the students around him began to verbally harass him  they were like   oh i see a bomb   and they started all laughing and making jokes  i was upset and i felt like i was put in the corner and like everybody was just looking at me  in just a matter of seconds  abushaaban had become a victim of racism and hate and had been humiliated by his fellow classmates who only suddenly turned on him because the teacher did understandably  his parents are mad as hell and they want the teacher terminated from her position at the school  just because my son is a muslim doesn t mean he is a terrorist   said malek abushaaban   he s an american  he s as american as anybody else  he was born here  that s all he knows  is how to be an american  here s the video via khou of course  school officials are claiming that the teacher merely misspoke in an attempt to teach about negative stereotyping  but did condemn her words in the following statement  while the teacher reports her statements were made in the context of trying to make a point about negative stereotypes  district officials do not believe that the teacher exercised the appropriate sensitivity expected of the district s educators  and do not believe that the statements were made in a manner that is in keeping with the district s core beliefs and commitments  keep in mind that this happened while the students were in the middle of watching a movie  which makes the job of a teacher a little easier  there was absolutely no need to try and teach anything  in fact  it makes no sense to teach lessons during a film and she was clearly not teaching the rest of the class about negative stereotypes  in other words  this teacher is just trying to cover her ass with a bullshit claim texas schools seem to be obsessed with terrorism these days  just last year  a texas school freaked out because a muslim student brought in a clock he had built himself and school personnel called the police because they thought it was a bomb another texas school acted even more ridiculous by suspending a nine year old boy for bringing a replica of the one ring from the hobbit to class  the school actually accused the boy of committing terrorism because he was pretending that the ring made him invisible  seriously texas schools really need to get it together featured image  screenshot
