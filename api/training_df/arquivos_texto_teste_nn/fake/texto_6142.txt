this is sad and infuriating in february  former secretary of labor robert reich suffered the loss of his father despite his dad s death  an insurance agent called to inform reich that his dad is behind on his car insurance payments now  one would think that being informed of the death would not only draw condolences  but also an end to the business at hand considering deceased people can t drive  nor can they pay insurance from the grave but this auto insurance agent couldn t get the reality of the situation through his thick skull  he proceeded to try and bully reich into paying hundreds of dollars and even informed reich that not paying would affect his father s credit rating reich described the phone call on facebook  i just got a call from my father s auto insurer  telling me he s behind on his payment  i explained he died in february  he still needs to pay for the last two months   said the man from the insurance company  but he can t pay  he s deceased   i said  he owes     for the period april  to june    he said  but he didn t drive then  he died in february  no one has driven his car since he died  well  someone has to pay or his insurance will be cancelled  and it will hurt his credit rating  i m sure he d be okay if it s cancelled   i said   and i don t think he cares about his credit rating  are you infuriated yet clearly  this insurance agent must be a truly heartless person  he even became snippy with reich upon hearing that reich s father won t care about his credit rating and the conversation continued to go in circles as the insurance agent tried another intimidation tactic and didn t seem to get that his client was dead and no longer needed car insurance  are you trying to be smart with me   asked the man from the insurance company  no  i m just trying to tell you that my father is deceased and he doesn t need car insurance  have you cancelled his car registration  no  i haven t got around to that  well  you should  if he s deceased  he shouldn t have a registration  i understand  nobody s supposed to have a registration if they re not paying their auto insurance    right  so  are you going to pay the insurance that s due  i wasn t planning to  then it s an illegal car  but it won t be on the road  still illegal  sorry  that could be a problem for him  he s no longer with us  i know  you made that clear  i m referring to his estate  i don t see how  well  let s say the state of florida imposes a penalty for having a car registered in his name but no insurance  and let s say that penalty holds up any legal proceedings in resolving  the insurance agent still tried to get reich to pay the insurance  even going so far as to talk about a hypothetical situation in order to force reich to reach into his pocket and pay for something that was no longer necessary frustrated and growing tired of the phone call  reich asked the insurance vampire who he is supporting for president  and the answer explains everything  may i ask you a personal question  personal  who do you support for president  for president  i don t mean to pry    oh  no problem   he said  you have a favorite candidate   i asked  as a matter of fact  i do   he said  and who is it  that trump fella  really  yeah  trump  good man  no bullshit  here s the post via facebook personally  i would have hung up the phone rather than keep repeating myself to the same asshole  but there you have it  folks  an ignorant insurance agent who tries to bully money out of people even if they are dead  that sounds exactly like the kind of person who would support donald trump featured image via comunicas
