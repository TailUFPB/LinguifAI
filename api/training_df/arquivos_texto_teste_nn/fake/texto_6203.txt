racists  homophobes  misogynists and other bigots are out in droves these days   and not just in america  case in point   a rally held by neo nazis in madrid  spain  where the hateful group was protesting immigrants  however  a gay couple there gave these idiots a real run for their money  by choosing to hold an impromptu make out session right in front the moronic haters who chose to refer to them as  faggots    queers   and   aids patients   it seems that just the sight of the two men holding hands in public was too much for the neo nazis to bear  so the couple decided to give them even more to complain about david fernandez and gregor eistert were simply out and about like any other couple  having a good time and minding their own business  but their very existence sparked a firestorm of hate from the group  their actions were brave beyond belief  as we all know how violent hate group members can be  fernandez says of the encounter  i was filled with rage when i heard what they said  so  i took gregor and began to kiss him  it was great  i then remember hearing screams and insults about being gay  unfortunately  it seems that the local police were more concerned with the delicate sensibilities of hate group members than they were with the safety of these two men  though  because they asked them to stop kissing  which is nothing short of shameful still  though  good on david and gregor  they really stepped up to show these awful people what they think of their hate watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
