in case you weren t paying attention  just as george w  bush s disaster of an administration was coming to an end the effects of his policies combined with a horrible deal pushed on bill clinton by a republican congress to balance the budget caused the greatest economic collapse since the great depression  from the first signs of the housing bubble bursting in  to the market crash of october   we watched as financial institutions failed to cover their horrible bets hedged with credit swaps from other horrible bets  sending the global economy into a tailspin  it wasn t until march of  that the dow jones industrial average closed at a rock bottom of  points  a  percent loss from the day of the crash  that the economy began its slow but steady recovery in the meantime   were decimated  homes purchased for   were worth half of that seemingly overnight the ability to pay back the loan was already suspect  as banks used the deregulation and repeal of imperative portions of glas steagall to loan money to anyone applying for credit  with those debts sold for debt that was leveraged with debt and so on   until the pile collapsed in on itself  builders who borrowed   to build a small spec house were issued millions of dollars instead to build entire neighborhoods  some of which are still empty or incomplete to this day  the actual cash value of american real estate plummeted  killing a massive chunk of working and middle class construction and service jobs all of that because the first big bank to fail didn t have a sufficient plan to secure its debts if it needed to wind back  tighten credit and use protections in place to stay the course and weather the storm  this time  there would be none of that  this time  the people who held the country s economy hostage without even knowing it were the same ones who lost their jobs and found themselves standing there with their arms outstretched wondering what the hell just happened for years we suffered  our newly elected president got to preside over an economy handed to him in ruins  people who lost everything had to grit their teeth while congress handed the big banks the money to loosen the credit that had come to a halt and provide the upper class and one percenters with the lavish lifestyles they d grown accustomed to  one would imagine that with a track record like that  the big banks would update their plan b  the drop back nine and punt with a solid strategy to cover their investments and hedge their losses should things start to tumble according to a letter sent by the fed and the fdic  the agency that secures deposits with federal funds  the nation s largest bank  jpmorgan chase  is far from the goal of being able to save itself without another catastrophic incident  an independent blog run by a former wall street operative and a professional publisher called wall street on parade analyzed the letter and found the contents extremely disturbing at the top of page   the federal regulators reveal that they have  identified a deficiency  in jpmorgan s wind down plan which if not properly addressed could  pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the united states   why didn t jpmorgan s board of directors or its legions of lawyers catch this it s important to parse the phrasing of that sentence  the federal regulators didn t say jpmorgan could pose a threat to its shareholders or wall street or the markets  it said the potential threat was to  the financial stability of the united states  that s frightening  jpmorgan is worth more than   trillion with   trillion in notional amounts of derivatives  it s total value as a leveraged asset  that means that without stop gaps in place to catch a fall in progress  the collapse of a single bank could potentially cost more than a quarter of the value of the entire us economy  sound familiar  what happens next is a domino effect  as jpmorgan ranks number one in  risk of contagion  to other institutions  in other words    all over again far too soon for the country to put on the brakes and stop the inevitable recession and possibly depression that will follow this is not a joke or an episode of alex jones  this is the federal reserve telling the kingpin that a ball is spinning in its direction and the best thing it can hope for is a seven ten split  something for some innocent people to hold onto as the rest fall off into a dark abyss  why hasn t the mainstream media picked up on this  bernie sanders is supposed to be the watchdog making sure big banks don t destroy what the people have managed to rebuild  hillary clinton is supposed to be all about reform  applauding dodd frank and reporting that she s personally scolded wall street for its nefarious activity  donald trump and ted cruz  well  they re idiots  where is cnn  abc  and nbc  not even the doom and gloom seekers of fox news can remove themselves from donald trump s rear end long enough to make note that even though they ruined countless lives less than a decade ago  big banks aren t taking measures to stop it from happening again bad things are happening downtown  somebody really should say something
