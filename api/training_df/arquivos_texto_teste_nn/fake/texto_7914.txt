president obama delivered an address from the white house on tuesday to announce a major  unfulfilled campaign pledge which he is going to spend his final months in the white house delivering  he is going to close guantanamo bay there is not doubt that guantanamo has become a stain on the american flag  and a matter of national shame  as obama put it  our closest allies raise it with me continuously   the creation of an extra judicial prison  in which human beings are trapped and tortured  outside of all laws covering nations and war is a chapter of u s  history that every american should relish closing  this should not be a partisan issue  it should be a matter of conscience  if america is to pride itself as a nation of laws  it cannot operate outside of those laws barack obama s criticisms of the war on terror and his commitment to close guantanamo formed a central promise of his election to the white house in   sadly  many of the dreams remained unfulfilled  drone strikes not only continued  but escalated  the u s continued to intervene in matters of regime change  from ukraine to syria  this left the world with two possible conclusion to draw both those options left america  and the world  in a very uncertain era  either  there is no politician we can trust to lead the nation in a just and honorable manner  or  even if there is  that person will be unable to effect the change we seek  both of these issue are a crisis for u s  democracy and the international community but obama s announcement today could well signal shift in u s  policy at home and abroad ahead of the next  likely democrat  presidency  in short  america could be refocussing on domestic policy at home  and good neighborliness oversees the pentagon has prepared a full proposal for shut down  including  new sites on u s  soil to house inmates that cannot be freed or returned to their nation of origin  but the pentagon and the white house are keen that this is a plan that must be agreed and delivered across the aisles and branches of government  a press release from the defense department  stipulates that the plan  does not endorse a specific facility to house guantanamo detainees who cannot be safely transferred to other countries at this time  the administration seeks an active dialogue with congress on this issue and looks forward to working with congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible  in concluding his hour long review of the plans  and president was unambiguous in his views  stating simply  this plan has my full support  the pentagon is behind the plan  the president is behind the plan  if guantanamo bay is not closed by the time obama leaves the white house  america and the world will know where the real barrier to progress on this issue resides   with republican senators and congressmen  they are the only ones who stand in the way of putting america back on the right side of history you can see the president s full address below featured image via flickr creative commons
