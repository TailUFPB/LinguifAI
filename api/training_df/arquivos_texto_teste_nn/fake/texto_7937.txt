on january      year old rex orval iverson died in a box elder county  utah jail cell  his only crime was that he had failed to pay a    ambulance bill according to his obituary  mr  iverson was not a deadbeat  instead  he was a hardworking man  who took great pride in his accomplishments  like most people  he held many different jobs throughout his lifetime  but according to his family  no matter what he was doing he always made the best of it  he worked for peter kiewit construction as a heavy equipment operator in denver  colorado where he worked on the trex project  he loved coming home and showing us pictures of what he had done and he took great pride in being able to work on such a big project  his employment with kiewit construction allowed him to travel to different states working on the roads  according to chrissy sabala  who described him as someone who was  like a brother   mr  iverson s parents were both killed in a car accident sabala told the standard examiner he quit living when his parents died  life stood still for him  sabala says that iverson continued to live in his parents  home  following their deaths she described someone who was clearly experiencing ptsd  along with other possible mental health problems  saying  everything in that house he left exactly like his mother had left it  mr  iverson was no longer employed  but sabala says that he did what he could to help everyone  whether tilling a neighbor s garden or giving of the little he had  in order to help a friend in need sabala said that he gave her his beloved harley davidson when she fell on hard financial times she also stressed that he just didn t have any money   adding   when those people died  his life stopped  on christmas eve of   because of an undisclosed illness or injury  an ambulance was called to iverson s home he later received a bill for    it was a bill he could not pay he was sued by the city of tremonton  which won a small claims judgement against him  after he failed to show up for court under utah law  a person can be jailed for failure to pay a debt  including a medical debt so if you get sick in utah and you need medical care  you can be arrested if you can t pay for it that s what happened to mr  iverson he was arrested for failure to pay his medical debts on january   he died in the box elder county jail later the same day the northern utah critical incident investigative team is investigating mr  iverson s death according to the standard examiner  during the   fiscal year  the city of tremonton alone processed  civil cases for unpaid debt in utah s  justice courts  more than half of the judges that hear civil cases regarding unpaid debts in the state do not even have a law degree in order to become a judge in a utah  justice court   all you need is a high school diploma the standard examiner reports that these justice court judges hear the majority of cases in the state defendants in these courts often have little understanding of the law  and no access to an attorney yet  in these courts  a judge with a high school diploma can sentence a person to jail for failing to pay an ambulance bill debtors prisons have been illegal in united states for more than  years  but that has not kept judges from sending people to jail for being poor more than  years ago the u s  supreme court upheld the ban on debtor s prisons  ruling that judges can t send a person to jail simply because he or she is unable to pay a debt  but a loophole in the ruling allows people to be jailed if a judge determines they  willfully  refuse to pay but as think progress reports here  more people are being imprisoned for unpaid debts than ever before in the united states  in part because of the tactics used by dishonest collection agencies  and in part because judges are not informed about debtor s rights it s one thing to put someone in jail who willfully ran up credit card debt  and later refused to pay for it  but people who engage in this kind of behavior are often protected by bankruptcy laws when cities make it a priority to arrest and incarcerate people like rex iverson  who simply could not pay an ambulance bill  that s something else altogether at this time  the cause of mr  iverson s death has not been made public  regardless of what caused his death  this man should not have died alone in a jail cell  where he was imprisoned for the crime of needing an ambulance he could not pay for image credit  rogersandtaylor com  rex orval iverson obituary photo
