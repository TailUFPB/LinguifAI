after north carolina passed their new bigoted anti lgbt law and governor pat mccrory signed it into law  he alongside the state has received a massive amount of backlash against the legislated hate taking this backlash into account  mccrory released a statement  after listening to people s feedback for the past several weeks on this issue  i have come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of misinformation  misinterpretation  confusion  a lot of passion and frankly  selective outrage and hypocrisy  especially against the great state of north carolina  based upon this feedback  i am taking action to affirm and improve the state s commitment to privacy and equality  which basically is a non answer and he s just pissed people are pissed at himself and his state  what exactly does his executive order include  a whole lotta nothing here s what mccrory s executive order states  common sense gender specific    what does that even mean  he s literally taking his hand  raising it up  and slapping the transgender community in the f cking face with that load of bullshit  and he s still letting private businesses be bigoted jerks if they so choose  even if they serve the public at large    amendment be damned  then as an ultimate cop out he s leaving anything to actually be done about the hate to  local governments   the only thing that maaaybe could be considered decent and humane is to expand the employment policy and seek legislation  however  he s seeking legislation in the same damn state house that wrote the legalized discrimination in the first place  so  all in all   this executive order is a big ole piece of useless horseshit mccrory honestly doesn t seem to see the error his state legislator s ways or his own  he s  in essence  doubling down on anti lgbt hate  and not doing a damn thing about the law itself  what needs to happen is for the law to be entirely repealed and protections enacted not for religious zealots  but for lgbt individuals north carolina s governor ought to be ashamed of himself  this is nothing but just another giant slap in the face to the lgbt community featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
