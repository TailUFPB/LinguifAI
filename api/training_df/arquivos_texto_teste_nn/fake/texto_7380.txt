governor rick scott of florida may be the worst governor in modern history  so  of course he formally endorsed donald trump and has been cited as a possible vp choice for the likely republican presidential nominee  rather than let trump take all the glory in racist provocations  insane proposals  and a supporter base which represents the worst things about this country  governor rick scott matches trump in how low a public official can really go  and may offer a glimpse into what lies in the future for this country if donald trump is elected president the giant  for profit  hospital chain  tenet healthcare  was investigated by journalists in july  amid claims the hospitals were failing miserably in living up to the state of florida s quality standards for children s heart surgery  a cnn investigation found the mortality rate for these surgeries was more than three times the national average instead of improving the quality of care in their hospitals  tenet healthcare responded with a    donation to florida republicans  and in kind  governor rick scott got rid of the standards  allowing tenet healthcare to continue making thousands of dollars from performing these surgeries while endangering the lives of thousands of children born with heart defects  of course  governor scott and tenet denied having conversations with one another  despite the coincidence that governor scott decided a couple months after the investigation to repeal the standards when he had since the time he took office in  to do so florida s department of health excused the repeal due to the legislature not having the authority to have enacted them in the first place  regardless the standards have been in place for an uncontested  years  parents and cardiac pediatricians took the state of florida to court over the state s repealing of the standards  but the florida judge ruled in favor of the state  the same judge ruled in   a doctor accused of handcuffing and beating a patient over the course of a yearlong sexual relationship can continue to practice medicine  i can t think of anywhere else in the country where you have safety standards and someone doesn t like them  so you just have it repealed   dr  peter pronovost  senior vice president for patient safety and quality at johns hopkins medicine  told cnn in an interview this past january  these standards have been in use for more than  years  and they re widely acknowledged to ensure safety   why would you repeal them  if the state really felt it didn t have the legislative authority to have the standards  why wouldn t they go out and get that authority  this is exactly the kind of corruption we don t need in government  and in the worst possible industry  sacrificing the health of your constituency for political donations is as low as it gets featured image via flickr
