footage has been released of a leader of the republican national committee ranting for a full five minutes about the need for a rebellion against presidential candidates like donald trump  the video serves as evidence that it s not just liberals who know that conservatives are going to lose in  with extremists like trump on the ticket the star of the footage   holland redfield  who represents the u s  virgin islands   uses some rather colorful language in his incitement against the likes of trust fund tycoon donald trump  if i didn t say this  i d go home very troubled   redfield tells the audience of the private  rnc winter meeting  when we have allowed the party to be representing a tremendous amount of anger we are playing a very dangerous game does the tail wag the dog  or does the dog wag the tail  he rails against the gutter level language being used by candidates like trump and others  and the  disrespect  for ethnic minorities which risks making the party unelectable to americans who aren t white  not only is this morally reprehensible  but it s electoral suicide in a rainbow nation and what happens when a party member voices concerns about these issues  redfield argues that  we re almost terrorized as members of our party   shut up  toe the line  embrace each other  and let s go forward  redfield refuses to name trump because he fears   i will be targeted  it is likely redfield speaks for a sea of moderate conservatives across the united states who cease to feel represented by a party which has been seized by christian and right wing extremists  these moderate conservatives might well be forced into the position of voting democrat in   or abstaining altogether  with the absence of a gop candidate who speaks to their vision of america  the eisenhower republicans  who aren t afraid to invest public money to make america a world leader in education  science  technology and engineering  who would rather the u s  spent a little less on engaging in permanent war overseas  and a little more on roads  schools  and hospitals at home  how could they ever vote for a trump  or a ted cruz this video of this desperate plea for a new direction by this lone rnc leader speaks to the bigger crisis for conservatives in america  the religious right has pulled the entire party off it s axis  and is speaking to an ever smaller  echo chamber of extreme conservatism  in doing so  they are doing the job of putting a democrat in the white house in  all by themselves featured image via flickr creative commons
