leaving a young child alone in a vehicle is irresponsible   especially in florida during the summer  so far this year   children have died after being left in a hot car  talisha martin left her child alone in a vehicle for more than  minutes while she allegedly went shopping inside a florida walmart on monday according to a statement from the palatka police department  the store s loss prevention team notified them at about   p m  that a  year old child was unattended in a vehicle in the parking lot  the vehicle was running and the air conditioner was on  but it was blowing hot air   something that adds to the heat problem of being abandoned by one s mother in the parking lot of a walmart during the day in the florida heat  the child told officers that he was hot and  scared because mommy left me  when martin finally arrived  her speech was stuttered and slurred  she didn t even notice her child was no longer in the car until an officer asked her if something was missing  the alleged  mother  was arrested and held on a   bond  the child was released to the custody of her husband  scott martin  more on him later  after her release from custody  martin did what could be expected from a parent who practices such unabashed negligence  she whined about her  stupid  arrest  blaming it on black people in her facebook post  martin contends that she ran into walmart to  buy toilet paper a run out that was it   she told a news station she had been exchanging bras   according to her  she was only in the store for a total of  minutes   enough time for the car to reach  degrees without hot air blowing from the air conditioner  as it was  that day but then  a black women   unclear if she means one or multiple   had her nose in business where it didn t belong and went and told walmart   this  of course  ruined everything for this obviously responsible parent by calling police  she says it s  pretty damn stupid  that they would charge her for child  neglect when  it could be  different charges they could give  her  after all  her child  the one who was scared because mommy left him   asked  to stay in the car  she says she then praises her loving husband  the one to whom the little boy was released   who bonded her out  for his support  while one might expect the other half of this relationship to give a damn about the child s safety   remember that the boy was released to him   scott is very supportive of his wife  all this is b s  my wife wasn t even gone from the house for fifteen minutes and i get a call from the police   he writes in the comment section under the post   they told me that my son was in the car for over an hour          pardon my language  but that is all f       b             i am beyond being mad      he then angrily demands that police bust meth labs and other  people who are really breaking the law  rather than negligent mothers who leave their children unattended in hot vehicles with hot air blowing out of the air conditioner  it is s    like this why i am thinking about leaving this f    d up county  and state for that matter   saying f    all of this s              he adds   and if there is anyone who disagrees with what i said  guess what  too bad  it s called the  amendment  look it up while the martins might have expected sympathy  they didn t get much from their friends and family   as some commenters mentioned  the department of children and families will be investigating this matter  not only is it illegal for a child to be left in a car  it is also inhumane and potentially deadly   spokesman john harrell said   we will do a full and thorough investigation regarding this incident  unfortunately  while martin admits she was wrong and pledges to be a better mother in the future  it is unlikely that she nor her husband have learned anything from this  scott martin  whose facebook profile indicates that he is former military police  says that  all those that don t believe the truth  and think my wife dont care about our children  then y all can just go to h     a few posts below one in which he claims they are loving parents is a share from conservative post that advocates hitting your children rather than exercising more reasonable and sane conflict resolution and disciplinary techniques as for talisha martin  she told  that police and  apparently security footage  are lying about her  she says she won t do it again but denies that she was in the wrong for blasting hot air on her child in an already hot car   police  said that i was in there  minutes and that is a lie   martin said   also something about it wasn t even cold air coming out the vent  it was hot air  and that is not true  i just think it s wrong that i m being blasted out like that when i m a mother and have been a mother for almost ten years  i clearly won t do it again  i mean  i don t think i was in the wrong but it is   martin said   something could happen  you know  they can break the window out  i mean  stuff could happen  but it was only a few minutes  martin has been arrested numerous times since   twice of charges of petit theft and twice for probation violations it would be nice if they would at least learn from this  but it seems that they are dedicated to just being terrible people featured image via facebook
