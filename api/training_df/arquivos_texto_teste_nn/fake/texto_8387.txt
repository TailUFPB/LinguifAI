donald trump came in second place in the iowa caucus  and while it may not seem like a bad position to be in  it s a disaster for his campaign  trump has always positioned himself as a  winner  and painted everyone lower than him in the polls as  losers   he used his supposed popularity in the polls to justify all manner of nasty hate speech and shameful policies  his entire candidacy is hinged on him being the  best   and he just lost second place might as well be last place  and nobody seems to believe that more than donald trump   and the internet couldn t wait to remind him about it during trump s long  mind numbing  career on twitter  he s repeatedly recycled a favorite quote of his from walter hagen  no one remembers who came in second  he tweeted it in   and liked it so much that he then tweeted it again in  needless to say  the silly message stuck in people s minds  especially tonight when trump found himself falling short to his rival ted cruz by a considerable margin  he may very well become the second place finisher that no one remembers love this quote cited by the donald  especially tonight  think it ll haunt his campaign   iowacaucus  uspoli  iowa pic twitter com   jim harris   jimharris  february    will be fascinating to see how trump handles losing  if history is any indication  he ll react very poorly  throughout his campaign  we ve seen that any time his poll numbers started to slide or another candidate started to emerge as a threat  trump has lashed out with ugly aggression  in a telling example  trump was very friendly with cruz when cruz had no chance  but as he established himself  trump quickly turned on him   even going full birther on the canadian born senator even more embarrassing for trump  his  no one remembers who came in second  tweet began going viral  having been dormant for years  suddenly just after trump s loss in iowa  the  tweet began getting thousands of retweets  no one remembers who came in second     walter hagen  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december     that will be trump s legacy  paradoxically taken down by the very blustering egomania that gave him a platform in the first place  trump has gained thousands of fans by loudly claiming he wasn t a loser   what happens when they start to wander if maybe he is one after all  feature image via gage skidmore flickr
