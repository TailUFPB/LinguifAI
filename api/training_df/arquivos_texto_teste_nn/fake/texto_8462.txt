stephen colbert had his own solution to trump skipping the debate on thursday  since   million  viewers were denied the opportunity to see trump debate  colbert decided to moderate his own hilarious debate where trump debates trump and where colbert would would pick up those  million viewers for his own ratings the late show host said that the gop front runner was  the star of this year s top reality show   and renamed it  celebrity the president   so it was only fitting that he have his chance to shine on the stage colbert used footage of  two trumps  being asked the same question  but with contradictory responses on different occasions  for example  on jan    trump had said that  no one likes  ted cruz  once they get to know him   yet on  dec    trump said that he liked the texas senator  a lot  trump had also said as recently as this month that he loved the people of iowa but during a speech in november  he wondered  how stupid are the people of iowa  in july  trump said that hillary clinton was the   worst secretary of state in the history of the united states   however   in march   he said hillary was a  terrific woman   saying   i think she does a good job and i like her  and of course  there was megyn kelly  this week  trump said he had  zero respect  for kelly  adding that she s  highly overrated  and doesn t do a good job  however  a previous clip shows that in  trump told kelly during an interview that she has  done a great job  by the way  and i mean it   he said  with a creepy smile in his segment  colbert is able to show the contradictions and hypocrisy that trump exemplifies in a way that is hilarious but shocking in terms of how trump  despite being trump  continues to lead in the polls featured image via youtube screenshot
