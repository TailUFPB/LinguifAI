in   gilead sciences inc  filed an application with the fda for a new drug that they claimed could cure hepatitis c  the drug was nothing short of a miracle the new wonder drug was named sovaldi  where previous hep c treatments had a minimal success  rate and involved   months of grueling treatment that involved a slew of harsh side effects  sovaldi cured people at a    rate in one  week treatment  it was so good  that gilead received the fda s breakthrough therapy designation  which is given to drugs that show a tremendous advance over existing options and treatments after an astonishingly fast review process and approval by the fda  gilead filed a patent for harvoni which is sovaldi combined with an  inhibitor  demand for harvoni skyrocketed globally because currently there are approximately  million to  million people living with hepatitis c around the world to call this a medical advance of historic proportions would be putting it mildly  the unfortunate fact is that the very thing that makes harvoni so wonderful is what makes it absolutely terrible  if you happen to live in america in the u s   a  week course of harvoni costs          it works out to approximately   per pill  if you lived in india  the cost per pill is   i get it  the cost to develop a drug can be staggering  research and development work  plus the employees who perform it  are not free  then there are trials and further tests  it all gets expensive  but here is the problem  gilead didn t do any of these steps  it turns out  sovaldi was already invented by a group called doctors of the world at cardiff university in  dotw is claiming that gilead merely copied their publicly funded research  rushed it through fda approval and patenting  and then immediately jacked the price to reap an absolutely insane profit  it worked  in   gilead had a total revenue of    billion compared to    billion in  comparing this to india  you start to see the disgusting truth of it all  the indian government denied gilead a patent in their country  on the grounds that they couldn t prove that the drug was more effective at treating hep c than what was invented at cardiff university in   this has forced gilead to actually compete in a free market due to not having a government sanctioned monopoly in india  gilead was forced to sell their pill at    this results in a total cost to save your life of about   for the cost of the same treatment with the same pill in america  where we have  the most amazing healthcare system in the world   you could literally move to india  live there for about  years  take the drug for a few weeks during that time  get cured  then move back and still come out saving money how freaking ridiculously insane is this  a lawsuit was filed by doctors of the world against gilead as well  on the basis that the drug molecule was not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent  seeing as india s regulatory agencies and patent office has already concurred with the opinion in this lawsuit  things do not look to be going well for gilead in the future  i personally wouldn t be buying their stock this brings us to the heart of the problem  gilead essentially ripped off publicly funded work  copied a drug  then  innovated  by mixing it with a secondary drug to call it unique  this justified the technicalities required for a patent  but it violated the spirit for which patents are intended  if the fda and u s  patent office did some due diligence and used india as a precedent  denying gilead their vulture capitalism cash cow  this would not be an issue the fda has a problem with revolving door crony capitalism  one example is fda member milton packer  who chairs the cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee  packer reviews applications for drugs submitted to the fda for regulatory approval  he is also financed by novartis and has spoken on their behalf to the advisory board he himself chairs  he has also gone to bat in his own committee for glaxosmithkline in   spoke for sanofi in   and consulted for pfizer in  packer s activities  while part of a government board meant to impartially regulate pharmaceuticals on behalf of the nation  scream conflict of interest  and he is only one person among many who participate in this sort of nonsense government involvement in a market  especially one like pharmaceuticals  is desperately needed  however  when that government involvement ends up being corrupted to where it serves the needs of corporations over people  it becomes a government sanctioned monopoly that is enforcible by law real progressive regulatory and patent reform is so desperately needed in america  and any presidential candidate who is serious about helping the middle class should make it a primary focus of their campaign featured image via drugs com
