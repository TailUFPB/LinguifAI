just in time for the election  the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit based in new orleans found what democrats have known for months  texas  voter id law  the strictest in the country  violates the voting rights act because it places an undue burden on minority voters in the state   more specifically black and hispanic voters when the law was passed in   over   texas lacked the identification necessary to vote  as the court correctly pointed out  the overwhelming majority of these voters were non white according to the new york times it was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and hispanic voters the ruling did not strike down the law in its entirety  leaving in place the heart of the law but requiring the state to accommodate those who will have a harder time obtaining the identification necessary the fifth circuit also sent back to the lower courts a reconsideration as to whether or not the texas legislature acted with intentional discrimination  should it be discovered that it did  judicial oversight would be required if texas sought to change their voting laws it should also be noted that the fifth circuit is considered one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country  with  out of  seats being occupied by republican appointees  and four out of seven senior judges being republican appointees of the  judges  senior and active  who heard the case  nine  including  republican appointees  voted in favor of the people  not the racist government of texas  when the majority of the majority opinion are republican and tell you your state is racist  you might want to take a step back the state of texas has not confirmed if it will be appealing to the supreme court  which in april decided to leave the law intact but revert back to the lower courts  the fifth circuit  the supreme court did  however  issue a warning  should the law be muddied by the lower courts  yet again   the supreme court would not come to its aid the fifth circuit s decision may be the final nail in the coffin to a shameful  racist  hateful law that had one purpose  purge as many blacks and hispanics off the voter rolls as possible once again  voting rights have been protected  will republicans learn from it  not at all  but are republicans now weakened heading into the general election  absolutely over   people were given back their rights  now they need to exercise them in november featured image via stephanie keith getty images
