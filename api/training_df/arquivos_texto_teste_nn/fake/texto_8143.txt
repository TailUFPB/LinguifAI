espn has a bit of a conservative bias problem  the network devoted to sports may have anchors of all political backgrounds  but the right leaning ones keep managing to embarrass everyone else nowhere is that more clear than with sage steele  an espn reporter with an inexplicable seething hatred for president obama and his landmark healthcare reform  how much does she hate the idea of universal healthcare  watch her painfully ham fisted attempt to stop arcade fire s win butler from endorsing the seemingly uncontroversial idea that everyone should have health insurance butler wanted to use the opportunity of playing in a celebrity all star basketball game in toronto to bring up the issue of healthcare  he starts to make a comparison between canada s model of universal healthcare and america s rather lousy counterpart when steele rudely interrupts him with this astoundingly dumb line  we re talking about celebrity stuff  not politics  priorities heaven forbid celebrities talk about issues that matter  especially in the lead up to a very important presidential election  instead of what they re wearing  who they re dating  and how exciting it is to win an mvp trophy at a celebrity all star game but steele isn t just shallow  she s tenaciously anti obamacare  she wasn t just trying to move the show along  she was trying to prevent butler from putting pesky ideas like  nobody deserves to go bankrupt when they get sick  into the heads of the american public watching the show and it s not just singers that steele doesn t think should be allowed to talk about healthcare   she also bashed the president of the united states for doing it comical hearing  barackobama pimping his health care plan on  espncolin  s show  it s espn   let s stick to his take on hoops     sage steele   sagesteele  march    guest starring on the view in   steele was in the mood to discuss obamacare   but only to say that it would destroy america so far espn has remained silent about one of its reporters so shamelessly censoring the liberal political opinions of someone on their show  unfortunately  this lack of backbone isn t surprising  espn recently came under fire for suspending one of their reporters when he called out espn contributor curt schilling for being astoundingly ignorant of evolution following one of schillings almost daily anti science rants on twitter  schilling received no punishment espn wants to be more than just a sports channel  but in order to do that it needs to start respecting the idea of the free exchange of ideas  the people who watch the network probably like watching celebrities play basketball  but they also want to be informed about the world  this kind of blatant censorship has no place  no matter how much sage steele might prefer it feature image from screen capture via youtube
