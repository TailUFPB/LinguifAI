a state republican in georgia made an astonishingly racist set of remarks  in his defense of the south s confederate and racist history state rep  tommy benton has flat out denied that the civil war had anything to do with slavery  compared the confederate leaders to the founding fathers  expressed his profound displeasure with what he called  cultural cleansing  of southern history  he insisted that the kkk was not a racist organization   but rather  a vigilante thing to help keep law and order   claiming that made a lot of people  straighten up  where do we even begin here  let s start with the assertion that the civil war had nothing to do with slavery  we can refer to the cornerstone speech  which was given by vice president alexander stephens of the confederacy  a few weeks before the confederacy started the civil war our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas  its foundations are laid  its cornerstone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man  that slavery  subordination to the superior race  is his natural and normal condition he suggested that the civil war was wrong because the north didn t address the loss of what was approximately two billion dollars worth of  property  that belonged to the south  yes  he meant that the slaves were the property of the south benton also is critical of african americans for not denouncing their own african ancestors for selling slaves then comes the idea of  cultural cleansing   the offensiveness of this kind of assertion is profound  cultural cleansing is another term for genocide  the latter of which didn t exist as a word until the nazi s tried to cleanse europe of people they considered to be  undesirables   no  the removal of a confederate flag is not equal to the gassing of the jews in nazi germany benton expanded on the cleansing remarks by saying that the removal of things like the confederate flag or renaming of things like streets or buildings which were named after confederate legacy is directly equivalent to isis destroying cultural sites in the middle east  that s no better than what isis is doing  destroying museums and monuments   he said   i feel very strongly about this  i think it has gone far enough  there is some idea out there that certain parts of history out there don t matter anymore and that s a bunch of bunk  no  nobody in the south is ripping up roads or smashing buildings after executing the local population in order to  cleanse  confederate history  we are simply asking that it not continue to be glorified as some kind of noble cause our founding fathers would have hated the guts of republicans like this guy  the founders embraced things like science  being smart  to them  was an advantage   not a liability  the kkk was also not ever in its history a  justice movement  meant to keep the peace  its purpose through history was to restore white supremacy and terrorize former slaves  immigrants  catholics  jews  and anybody promoting the civil rights of the groups that the klan hated remember  republicans keep saying that their party is the party of civil rights because abraham lincoln was one of them  i sure am glad they cleared that up  otherwise  people like tommy benton would make me think the republican party is full of racists watch local news coverage of an interview featuring benton below featured image via video screen capture
