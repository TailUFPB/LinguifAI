ammon bundy and his wayward crew of temper tantrum throwing white guys with guns are now claiming that god talked to them and told them to seize the federal wildlife refuge on friday  bundy told a meeting of fellow right wing domestic terrorists that he refuses to end the occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge because  the lord  told him to go there in the first place  i was asked to do this by the lord  i did it how he told me to do it  it sounds like bundy and his band are suffering from a form of mental illness  because the mormon church that bundy is a member of sure doesn t agree with him in a statement earlier this month  officials from the church of latter day saints rejected bundy s claim that his seizure of federal property had anything to do with religion  church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles  this armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis  exactly  and that is why we can no longer tolerate this armed occupation  bundy and his pals are committing treason and domestic terrorism  they have illegally carried guns on federal property  along with breaking and entering and threatening violence against federal officials  they have forced the town of burns to live in fear as schools and businesses are closed to avoid putting innocent children and adults in harm s way if bundy and his group were a bunch of armed black people or muslims  federal and local law enforcement would have already riddled the building with bullets on the first day and ammon bundy would look like swiss cheese but because these guys are white rednecks with guns  law enforcement is giving them free reign to do as they please  bundy thinks him and his buddies should be able to walk free when this is all over and they assume the government will give in to their demands  if that were to happen  nothing will stop these terrorists from becoming more emboldened in the future  perhaps they ll set their sights on the capitol building or the white house next this armed takeover has been totally unjustified from the very beginning  not only have dwight and steven hammond  the arsonist ranchers whom bundy says he is fighting for  rejected his cause  history and the law are firmly against him as well bundy claims the federal government stole the land from ranchers  but that is far from the case according to oregon live  the federal government has legally held the title to all public lands in oregon since it was a territory  after exhaustive research  the supreme court also ruled in  and  that this is the case  furthermore  ranchers have willingly sold and been paid fair value for their land by the federal government to expand the wildlife reserve over the years in short  the bundys do not have religion  history  nor the law on their side  they are terrorists  pure and simple  and they need to be arrested and thrown in prison  or treated just like we have treated terrorists in the middle east  who ironically enough also claim religion justifies their cause featured image  wmur
