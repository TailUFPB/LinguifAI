donald trump has suggested that women should face  some sort of punishment  for having an abortion  ted cruz just admitted that he wants to punish women for being raped during an interview with fox host megyn kelly  cruz made it clear that he believes rape victims should be barred from terminating any pregnancy that results from the crime women  think you may be too far right on social issues   kelly told cruz while pointing out that the gop presidential wannabe s stance on abortion rights is repelling female voters away from a republican party that needs votes from women if it hopes to survive in november but ted cruz refused to budge from his extremist views and openly stated that he believes rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies that result from rape to term  rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person  but at the same time  as horrible as the crime is  i don t believe it s the child s fault  we want to do every thing we can do to prevent the crime on the front end and to punish the criminal  but i don t believe it makes sense to blame the child  kelly fired back by informing cruz that women think he  would be forcing the mother to go through unspeakable trauma to carry her rapist s baby for nine months  on that point  kelly is correct  forcing a woman to endure nine grueling months of a pregnancy she did not want only helps the rapist torture his victim more  it rewards the rapist with a child  and in far too many states  a rapist can then sue for parental rights and would be able to harass the victim for the next  years of the child s life cruz  however  avoided replying to kelly like the coward he is and dubiously claimed that the decision would be left to the states if roe v  wade were to ever be overturned  here it would be a question for wisconsin  what should the laws be governing abortion  if roe v  wade was not the law  it would be up to the people of wisconsin and the people of wisconsin might decide to allow some exceptions or not allow some exceptions because everyone agrees that you always want to protect the life of the mother  here s the video ted cruz is literally pretending that he would allow each state to have their own abortion laws  in december  cruz stated his intention to ban abortion nationwide despite what the supreme court has ruled furthermore  cruz has also voiced support for a federal ban on abortion after  weeks that provided zero exceptions for rape victims  he also supported the life at conception act  which would ban all abortion for any reason and would even outlaw some forms of contraception in short  cruz is lying through his teeth when he claims that the states will be able to make their own abortion laws  as president  cruz would absolutely sign a total ban on abortion if republicans manage to hold onto the senate and house after the election in november  in fact  it would probably be one of the first things he does  and that means women absolutely should not trust ted cruz  featured image via screencapture
