many republicans have expressed the opinion that donald trump is an absolute idiot  but this new diss from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell gives new weight to that harsh truth yesterday  in speaking on bloomberg politics  masters in politics podcast  mcconnell basically said that trump needed to have a vice president that was more qualified than him  because it is  pretty obvious  that trump  doesn t know a lot about the issues   ouch mcconnell said  he needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it s pretty obvious he doesn t know a lot about the issues  you see that in the debates in which he s participated  it s why i have argued to him publicly and privately that he ought to use a script more often there is nothing wrong with having prepared texts  mcconnell has previously criticized trump for several things  his blatant racism being just one of them  more recently  the senate majority leader called trump s controversial comments about judge gonzalo curiel not being fair in overseeing the fraudulent trump university case because of his mexican heritage  totally inappropriate   mcconnell added on the podcast  i object to a whole series of things that he s said vehemently object to them  i think all of that needs to stop  both the shots at people he defeated in the primary and these attacks on various ethnic groups in the country  unfortunately  despite the fact that mcconnell practically admitted that he thinks trump is an idiot and incapable of running the country  he still found it in himself to say   i m comfortable supporting him  i m not going to speculate about what he might say  or what i might do  but i think it s pretty clear and i ve been pretty clear publicly about how i think he ought to change direction and i hope that s what we are going to see for all of his obvious shortcomings  donald trump is certainly a different direction  and i think if he is in the white house he ll have to respond to the right of center world which elected him  and the things that we believe in  so i m comfortable supporting him  they may be on different sides of the political spectrum  but trump s incompetency is something that mcconnell and our president can actually agree on  mcconnell s comments about trump not knowing anything about the issues that america s commander in chief would face is something that obama has previously said about the business mogul at a nuclear summit in washington d c   obama called out trump s ignorance on nuclear proliferation and global politics  in a statement that was clearly directed at trump  obama said   tell us that the person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy  nuclear policy  the korean peninsula or the world generally  you can watch that diss below noting that the rest of the world was closely watching the u s  election  obama added  what we do is really important to the rest of the world  the president of the united states needs to know what s going on around the world  honestly  it doesn t matter who would be trump s vp   he s proven time and time again that he doesn t listen to anyone but himself  the only way to keep this country safe from trump s idiocy is to make sure he doesn t get into the white house featured image via alex wong   getty images
