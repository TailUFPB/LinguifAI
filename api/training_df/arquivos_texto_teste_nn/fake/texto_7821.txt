things just keep going from bad to worse in regards to everything coming out of the donald trump campaign  if he s not being a racist blowhard or blaming the media for himself being a douchebag  then he s throwing insults around like a schoolyard bully who doesn t have any friends now  on top of the many  many misspelled tweets coming from the trump campaign  misspellings so bad even the merriam webster dictionary felt compelled to call him out on them  he now can t even spell the name of one of his key endorsements properly on his website as we all know by now  donald trump embraced sarah palin s bombastic personality full on  likely because the pair goes together like peas and carrots  neither have the experience to run for any sort of public office  but both feel just because they are loud and inappropriate that should be enough to get bigots to the polls to vote  however  as much as trump seems to love having palin s endorsement  he and his staff couldn t take the time to spell her name correctly via donaldjtrump com as we all know  palin spells her name  sarah  not  sara    and you d think if trump respected palin as much as he says he does  he would ve at least taken the time to spell her name properly is this a big deal  no  but considering this just continues to fit the pattern of trump s inability to spell  it makes you wonder if he s even capable of tying his own shoes  let alone run the nation featured image  youtube
