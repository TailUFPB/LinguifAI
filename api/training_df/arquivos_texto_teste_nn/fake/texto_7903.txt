bernie s combination of calling it like it is  and his tendency to get pissed off a little easily at republicans often results in some epic smackdowns being delivered by him  one of these gems came up again during a democratic town hall event hosted by cnn bernie started to talk about the unprecedented decision by republicans to essentially cut obama s final term short to only  years by blocking any effort at nominating a  scotus judge following the death of antonin scalia  however  rather than act like it s some kind of new thing  he avoided the rhetoric and called it exactly what it is it s just the latest link in a very long and unbroken chain of choices made by republicans to disrespect  delegitimize  and smear the legacy of the first black president of the united states  yes  republicans would love to get a scotus judge installed if they can delay until after the election  however  they tip their hand too easily in how they attack obama compared to other democrats like bernie pointing out a glaring fact  bernie mentioned that his father came from poland yet nobody has asked where his birth certificate is  it s so obvious yet no republican even realizes it  bernie has just as much of a reason to have his citizenship questioned as president obama  yet it never occurred to a single republican to do it  as he said  there s one obvious reason  which he mentions in the video clip watch bernie end the discussion on why republicans are such incredible idiots below          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt bernie sanders  speaking at cnn s democratic candidates town hall  gets off the first zinger of the night at donald trump posted by mashable news on tuesday  february    featured image via video screen capture
