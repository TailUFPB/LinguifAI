michigan s embattled conservative governor  rick snyder  came to washington with his head still on his shoulders  but he might not leave that way  at a congressional hearing meant to explore the failures of snyder s government leading up to and in response to the flint water crisis  democrats did what synder s republican colleagues seemed unable or unwilling to  they held him accountable the republican governor has become a symbol of how conservative ideals can   quite literally   poison an entire state  his plan to save a few bucks and  reduce big government  by diverting the water  supply from a riskier source blew up in his face and led to the deaths of several flint  michigan residents and the lead poisoning of thousands more  children who grew up under synder s rule  and were especially susceptible to the effects of lead poisoning  may now face developmental and physical illnesses for decades at his congressional hearing  snyder seemed to parrot the things his pr crisis team had prepped him with  he denied any knowledge of problems with flint s water and blamed everyone else  this was not just a slap in the face of the committee he was testifying in front of  but an insult to the people who had been hurt or killed thanks to his shoddy administration  democratic congressman matt cartwright of pennsylvania was having none of it  gov  snyder  plausible deniability only works when it s plausible  and i m not buying that you didn t know about any of this until october  you were not in a medically induced coma for a year  and i ve had about enough of your false contrition and your phony apologies  cartwright pointed out that other people in snyder s administration had already resigned in disgrace  and yet the  buck stops here  governor was still making excuses for himself  it was simply inconceivable that snyder could pretend he wasn t at fault  there you are dripping with guilt  but drawing your paycheck  hiring lawyers at the expense of the people  and doing your dead level best to spread accountability to others and not being accountable  it s not appropriate  it led cartwright to his final punch  a line so good it quite literally left rick snyder speechless  pretty soon  we will have men who strike their wives saying   i m sorry  dear  but there were failures at all levels   the pennsylvania democrat said  visitors in the gallery let out various sounds of shock  people who put dollars over the fundamental safety of the people do not belong in government  and you need to resign too  gov  snyder  for the rest of the country  cartwright managed to channel all of the outrage we have felt and put it into just a few lines  even better  he actually got to say it to gov  snyder s face and had the courage to do so  it was a great moment and perhaps the beginning of snyder s richly deserved downfall   repcartwright to gov  rick snyder   you were not in a medically induced coma for a year  https   t co  https   t co xgvsvwjgec  msnbc   msnbc  march    image via msnbc
