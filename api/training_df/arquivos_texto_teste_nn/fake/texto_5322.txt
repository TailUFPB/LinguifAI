there are things that  with all the excitement going on at both the rnc and the dnc  are getting overlooked right now  however  representative hank johnson  d ga  spoke on one such issue that needs much closer attention  that of illegal israeli settlements in palestine  johnson has a choice word for the settlers  and it s bang on target  there has been a steady   almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you ve been eaten up and you fall in on yourself  and they are  for the past several decades  israel has been eating up palestinian land and treating palestinian citizens like subjects and much worse while their leader  bibi netanyahu  says israel must occupy all the land in order to ensure their own safety  there s no regard for the people already living there  termites stream in and eat the wood of our houses  israelis stream in and eat the houses of palestinians   an apt description if there ever was one johnson went on to say  you see one home after another being appropriated by jewish people who come in to claim that land just because somebody did not spend the night there the home their  ancestors lived in for generations becomes an israeli home and a flag goes up  the palestinians are barred from flying flags in their own neighborhoods  nobody in the u s  would tolerate being told they can t fly the american flag  nobody  but we ll gladly call a country that does this  and so much more with glee  an  ally   disgusting why is this so important right now  don t we have more important things to worry about the answer to those questions is  yes and no  it isn t just important because we re busy supporting an apartheid state  or because of israel s gross human rights violations  it isn t just because we shouldn t support them if we re going to call ourselves the bastion of freedom we think we are  it s also because our support of israel has poisoned many of our leaders to the point where they actually want to criminalize freedom of expression the bds movement  which stands for boycott  divest and sanction  is under attack here because of our blind love for israel  staunch supporters of israel have been quietly criminalizing that movement  despite the fact that this very same thing helped bring about an end to apartheid in south africa boycotts are also a staple of american protest  yet the pro israel crowd would destroy freedom of expression in dogged support of an ally that maybe shouldn t be an ally  staunch defenders of the constitution would tear up the first amendment before denouncing israel  it s sick israel uses us  sure  some may say that we need them for intelligence on more hostile middle eastern nations  when a lot of our support is because of sheldon adelson  his money  and aipac   so we send billions of dollars worth of weapons and equipment to them  for which we the taxpayers are on the hook  and pretend not to see their relentless and violent crawl across palestine we wouldn t turn a blind eye to termites  relentless crawl through the structures of our houses  though ben cohen  of the daily banter  put it just as perfectly as rep  johnson when he said  israelis routinely claim that they have to defend themselves against palestinian attacks  but occupying someone else s land is an attack itself  so it is impossible to defend yourself if you are the person attacking  so can we please stop pretending israel is being attacked  as of march  half of israeli jews actually supported ethnic cleansing  we have white supremacists here that support the same thing  we fought a war in bosnia over ethnic cleansing  it s only something we must stop when we hear calls for ethnic cleansing coming from people and places we don t like  israel  they ve brainwashed us into thinking they re always the victim our growing problem with islamophobia isn t helping  either going into the final stretch of this election cycle  israel isn t just a distant foreign policy issue   something to be dealt with  maybe  after the new president and congress take office in january  israel s atrocious and disgusting policies toward palestine impact us in a direct way  because our support of them could cost us our own freedom  at least we have some leaders here who understand that featured image by alex wong getty images
