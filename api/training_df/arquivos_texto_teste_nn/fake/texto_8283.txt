marco rubio was looming large in new hampshire  but chris christie made marco rubio look very small on saturday night in a span of only a few minutes  christie knocked rubio off his game so badly that he ended up repeating the same line on multiple occasions even after the new jersey governor accused him of being scripted and it all started when christie absolutely shredded rubio s lack of leadership experience  you have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable   christie said   you just simply haven t  and the fact is   the fact when you talk about the hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did  you weren t even there to vote for it  that s not leadership  that s truancy  indeed  rubio has been roundly criticized for not doing his job according to gov track  rubio has missed   percent of votes since   and that percentage skyrocketed last year  currently  he has missed up to  percent of votes in the senate because he would rather be out campaigning  and that disqualifies rubio from being president  christie says  the fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them  it does matter when the challenges don t come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day  but when the problems come in from the people that you serve i like marco rubio  and he s a smart person and a good guy  but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the united states and make these decisions  rubio responded by bringing up christie s own lack of leadership during natural disasters and then he used a line that would get him stuck like a broken record for the next several minutes  let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing  he knows exactly what he s doing  barack obama is undertaking an effort to change this country  to make america more like the rest of the world  christie responded by accusing rubio of memorizing a  second speech that his advisers gave him  and rubio only helped christie by repeating it again and again  let s dispel with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing   rubio said later on   he knows exactly what he s doing  he is trying to change this country  and again here s the bottom line  this notion that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true  he knows exactly what he s doing  here s the video via youtube in the end  rubio looked a like a robot who was pre programmed with key phrases prior to the debate but went haywire upon being challenged this was not a good performance by rubio  especially since he had been rising in the new hampshire polls  but after the beating he took from christie on saturday night  rubio can probably kiss his presidential aspirations goodbye featured image  nbc latino
