no matter which candidate you re pulling for to be the democratic presidential nominee  you re likely to find the cold open from saturday night live s season finale pretty damn hilarious  of course there will be some who won t see it as funny  and those people need to calm the hell down  because it s comedy and no one is perfect  and snl just perfectly encapsulated what s happening in the democratic race  whether you like it or not both kate mckinnon and larry david reprised their roles as hillary clinton and bernie sanders  and met up at a bar to unwind from what s been a pretty grueling race  the bartender announces that the bar is closing  but bernie refuses to leave announcing that he ll leave when he s good and ready to leave  it s at this point that hillary and bernie have one last drink at the bar   bernie a drink that that s  refreshing and revolutionary  that  draws huge crowds   while hillary had a beer  no one likes  but gets the job done  the pair then rehashes over the campaign and what they might have done differently  and while bernie admits that he secretly imagines being a millionaire and eating fancy foods  hillary  admits  that she  really really  wants to be president  something bernie is keenly aware of hillary then invites bernie to dance where  of course  she insists on leading  and the two dance off throughout the snl studio it s going to be a long summer without the snl cast going after the candidates from both sides at every turn  but one thing is for certain  the season premiere this fall is bound to be pretty damn epic watch the cold open here featured image via video screen capture
