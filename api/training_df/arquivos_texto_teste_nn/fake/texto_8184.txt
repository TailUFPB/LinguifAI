an explosive allegation has come out of tasnim news against republicans  the secretary of iran s supreme national security council said that the recent prisoner exchange between the u s  and iran had an attempt made by republicans to sabotage it when they requested iran delay release of the prisoners until the eve of the  election ali shamkhani  secretary of iran s supreme national security council  released the following statement  in the course of the talks for exchanging prisoners  the republican rivals of the current us administration who claim to be humanitarians and advocates of human rights sent a message telling us not to release these people  american prisoners  and continue this process  of talks  until the eve of us presidential elections  however  he said  we acted upon our independent resolve and moved the process forward  source  tasnim newsthis is the second time that the allegations have been raised that republicans requested americans were to be held hostage by iran in order to serve their domestic political interests  the first time came from the suggestion that republicans conspired with iran to delay the release of american hostages until ronald reagan was inaugurated in   they were to be rewarded for this by reagan then selling them weapons  this was supposedly done to hurt carter s re election while allowing republicans to claim that the act of electing a republican made our enemies cower in fear  iran did end up releasing the hostages  minutes after reagan completed his inaugural address now here we are again  there is an upcoming presidential election  republican prospects look grim as usual and now they might have gotten caught using the same old trick a second time  if this turns out to be true  the consequences could destroy the party one could discount this by saying it s iran  and we can t believe what they say because they are an  enemy   however  if you look at the fact republicans have admitted to trying to work with iran to hurt america before  it seems very plausible  republicans tried to sabotage the iranian peace deal by contacting iran directly and suggesting that any peace deal would not last after obama left office  they have a history of trying to conspire with iran  for political reasons at home republicans are obsessed with hurting this nation  and it s people  in order to create an environment of fear  rage and paranoia  only in this mindset would americans ever want to vote them into power featured image from pinterest
