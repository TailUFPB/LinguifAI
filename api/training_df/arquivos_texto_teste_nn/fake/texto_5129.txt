donald trump is nigh universally recognized as a walking  talking  national security disaster  from the donald s promise to our allies that we can t be trusted if he becomes president  to his threat to essentially throw out the iran nuclear deal by modifying it until it is meaningless  to his almost salivating over the thought of pushing the  big red button  and unleashing our nuclear arsenal on  presumably  the first world leader to make him angry on twitter  the donald has succeeded in getting himself ranked as one of the top  global security risks it s gotten to the point that fifty top republican officials have now signed a letter acknowledging that trump would put at risk our country s national security and well being   according to these republicans  many of whom were top aides or cabinet members for george w  bush  so they are well aware that a president can be a top national security risk   trump lacks the character  values and experience  to be president and that he would be the most reckless president in american history   the ny times reports the letter says mr  trump would weaken the united states  moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the constitution  it says he has  demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding  of the nation s  vital national interests  its complex diplomatic challenges  its indispensable alliances and the democratic values  on which american policy should be based  and it laments that  mr  trump has shown no interest in educating himself  none of us will vote for donald trump   the letter states  though it notes later that many americans  have doubts about hillary clinton  as do many of us  among the most prominent signatories are michael v  hayden  a former director of both the c i a  and the national security agency  john d  negroponte  who served as the first director of national intelligence and then deputy secretary of state  and robert b  zoellick  another former deputy secretary of state  united states trade representive and  until   president of the world bank  two former secretaries of homeland security  tom ridge and michael chertoff  also signed  as did eric s  edelman  who served as vice president dick cheney s national security adviser and as a top aide to robert m  gates when he was secretary of defense robert blackwill and james jeffrey  two key strategists in mr  bush s national security council  and william h  taft iv  a former deputy secretary of defense and ambassador to nato  also signed  he is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood   the letter says   he does not encourage conflicting views  he lacks self control and acts impetuously  he cannot tolerate personal criticism  he has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior  all of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief  with command of the u s  nuclear arsenal  many of the signatories declined to add their names to a similar letter in march  but say trump s promise that russia would be  rewarded  for hacking his political enemies and his vow to be selective with which allies we defend caused many to change their minds john b  bellinger iii  who served as ms  rice s legal adviser at the national security council and the state department and who drafted the letter  says that  some  of the signers  will vote for  clinton  and some will not vote  but all agree trump is not qualified and would be dangerous  trump indeed would be dangerous  not just to our allies but to average americans thanks to his proposed muslim ban and his unabashed attempts to prop up the ku klux klan by warmly embracing their support   among  of course  other things you can read the full letter below   donald trump national security letter by german lopez on scribdfeatured image via getty images scott eisen
