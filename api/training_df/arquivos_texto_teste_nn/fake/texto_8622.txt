sen  ted cruz may be seeing a surge in the republican primaries  but that s probably just because voters don t know him well enough yet  if ever there were a more unlikable person running for president  you d be hard pressed to find him  just ask anyone   literally anyone  who has ever had the misfortune of knowing ted cruz on a personal level while it s not surprising that most democrats view cruz and his right wing policies as morally abhorrent and intellectually idiotic  members of his own party are sounding the alarm as well  this week  former presidential candidate bob dole broke ranks and very publicly went after cruz  dropping some uncomfortable truth bombs  i question his allegiance to the party   mr  dole said of mr  cruz   i don t know how often you ve heard him say the word  republican    not very often   instead  mr  cruz uses the word  conservative   mr  dole said  before offering up a different word for mr  cruz   extremist  i don t know how he s going to deal with congress   he said   nobody likes him  dole is being a bit too kind to cruz  though  his allegiance isn t to republicans or conservatives   it s to ted cruz  this is the man  after all  who almost unilaterally orchestrated a government shutdown to prove an insane political point about obamacare  it cost the country billions  destroyed america s financial credibility overseas  and ultimately accomplished nothing   but it did get cruz s name out there  would cruz do it again  in fact  he s already tried but it s not just fellow politicians   on both sides of the aisle  who despise cruz  his past is littered with people who are eager to publicly dish on how awkward  weird  and misanthropic cruz was when they knew him  his former roommate at princeton  the now legendary craig mazin  has spent much of the past few years relentlessly mocking cruz on social media  he paints a very disturbing picture of his former princeton peer i have  followers now  and all i had to do was be stuck in a room with ted cruz for a year  i m sure you re all nice  but so not worth it  craig mazin   clmazin  january    gauchefilms he s not my buddy  i loathe him  and i loathe what he stands for   craig mazin   clmazin  october    freshman year college roommate ted cruz is going to be elected senator  in case i hadn t made it clear  he s also a huge asshole   craig mazin   clmazin  october    maybe mazin has a personal beef with cruz  maybe cruz was a messy roommate or something  nope  another former classmate recently backed up mazin s assessment people might think craig is exaggerating  he s not  i met ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour  https   t co   geoff   gacohen  january     the daily beast decided to track down more of his classmates to see if their stories matched mazin s  what they found was an almost universal feeling that cruz was a creepy  politically extreme asshole in addition to mazin and leitch  several fellow classmates who asked that their names not be used described the young cruz with words like  abrasive    intense    strident    crank   and  arrogant   four independently offered the word  creepy   with some pointing to cruz s habit of donning a paisley bathrobe and walking to the opposite end of their dorm s hallway where the female students lived  i would end up fielding the  complaints   could you please keep your roommate out of our hallway    mazin says cruz exuded such creepy vibes that even in stories that are ostensibly not about how much he s loathed  people can t help but suggest it  the new york times recently ran a story about cruz s time working as a law clerk for supreme court chief justice william rehnquist  the story quickly devolved into former colleagues uncomfortably noting cruz s sick fascination with murder  it freaked everyone out in interviews with nearly two dozen of mr  cruz s former colleagues on the court  many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices  but also several from conservative chambers  depicted mr  cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment  some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges but don t worry  it s not just co workers  roommates  politicians  and pundits that dislike cruz  average people do as well  in   abc news decided to take a novel approach to judging a politicians popularity  see what people were saying about them on facebook  what they found was that  percent of the mentions of  ted cruz  on the social media site were unambiguously negative so how does cruz survive in politics despite being hated by everyone  it s not as hard as you d think  for one thing  he s backed by a small but powerful group of millionaires who like his anti government policies  secondly  he s a power hungry  shameless opportunist who seizes the spotlight any time he can  for politicians there is no such thing as bad publicity  the more cruz s mug shows up on fox news  the more conservatives learn to live with his inherent creepiness it s hard to imagine that particular set of skills translating to an effective presidency  however  at this crucial time in america s relations with other nations  having a man who oozes unlikability in the oval office could be a disaster in the making  it s also clear that cruz will use any opportunity to glorify himself  even if it is at the expense of the good of the country   see  government shutdown  the fact that everybody hates ted  and that the hatred only grows once you get to know him  should be a massive warning sign that something is not right with the guy  is that someone we want running the most powerful nation on earth feature image via gage skidmore flickr
