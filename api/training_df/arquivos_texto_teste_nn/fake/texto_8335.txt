a michigan man just received a disturbing letter  the letter alleges that he has violated his probation for  threatening  michigan s governor  rick snyder  on facebook in   chris wahmhoff  of kalamazoo  michigan was arrested for protesting the rebuilding and expansion of a pipeline that ruptured in   creating the largest inland oil spill in history  in december   wahmoff was sentenced to probation  in lieu of a jail sentence wahmhoff received a letter from his probation officer  claiming that he has violated the terms of his probation on three counts  the first count is for his failure to pay back restitution  the second is for failing to provide his dna for testing  the third count is where things get quite disturbing the letter says that he has violated his probation for allegedly threatening rick snyder  the letter reads count   on    the defendant displayed threatening behavior on social media  facebook  when he responded to a posting pertaining to the governor of michigan hiring two public relations firms in lieu of hiring to restore the infrastructure to provide clean water for flint when he stated  so when y all are ready to march in and take his ass across the street i have my torch  i got warm socks  i m waiting on y all  this is in no way a credible threat of violence  in fact  it is actually quite tame compared to many of the things that have been posted about snyder  cher caught wind of the situation going on in flint  michigan before the story had reached critical mass  she called for snyder to be put in front of a firing squad  a michigan militia has even taken sides against snyder wtf is going on w powermad greed driven killer incompetent politicians they r crimnals gov rick snyder of mich  firingsquadworksforme  cher   cher  january    or not a snyder and his cronies are found culpable for their role in the flint water crisis  or not remains to be seen  that being said  the people of michigan    well  people all over the u s  and the world for that matter   have already found snyder to be guilty  he has eroded democracy through his expansion of michigan s emergency manager law  he has poisoned an entire city  at least ten people have already died from water contamination  when people refer to snyder as a baby killer  it is by no means an exaggeration i spoke to wahmhoff over the phone  he says that he was publicly calling for a citizen s arrest of rick snyder  wahmhoff is emphatic that he does not think that people should go into the capital building  guns blazing   he doesn t want any violence to come to snyder  he does  however  think he needs to be removed from office immediately  wahmhoff told addicting info  i never intended to call for violence against rick snyder   but according to michigan law    b   i have the right to  and do intend to legally invoke the arrest of governor rick snyder for felonious child endangerment  not just for flint  but for detroit  for the kalamazoo river  and for the children who will continue to suffer as long as rick snyder is in power  the right wing has usurped and bastardized the concept of government tyranny and the expulsion of tyrants  to the point where birthers think that president obama should be removed from office by force  those people are insane  i by no means support violence  though i have to say  i am sure that the founders of the united states would consider the snyder administration a domestic threat  as many have pointed out  the poisoning of an entire city s water supply is an act that any isis member would look upon with envy there are mobs of people out there who actually would tear rick snyder to shreds  given the opportunity  in light of that  the idea that someone would actually take a person s vague comment from facebook seriously enough to consider it a violation of their probation  is absurd  especially when the person who made the comment is on probation for protesting a corporation that created the worst environmental disaster in michigan s history   not including the current crisis in flint  of course  michigan activists are planning a protest  to stand in solidarity with wahmhoff  featured image credit  donkey hotey via flickr  with letter screenshot added by joe fletcher
