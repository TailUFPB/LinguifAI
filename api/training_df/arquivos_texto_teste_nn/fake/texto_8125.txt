after beyonc  came out with her new single  formation   which instantly became another hit for the artist  there was a lot of buzz surrounding the content of the lyrics  the song speaks truth to power and depicts the ongoing conflict that far too many people of color face in regards to police brutality  the song  however  doesn t have the usual music behind it that many of her past hits have had  so  if people aren t being critical of the content of the song  they re being critical of the composition and beat  well  not all people  pretty much just white people  white people who would prefer beyonc  stick to pure pop and dance to top it off  after beyonc  stole the show at the super bowl halftime performance  even more people became critical of the legendary singer  she was far too  black  for the folks over at fox news  and seemingly many other places as well  after all  how dare she speak the truth and hurt the feelings of those who are too afraid to hear it saturday night live  noticing the ridiculousness of everyone criticizing beyonc  for her new song  perfectly satirized the outrage and confusion coming from far too many white people  in a sketch titled  the day beyonc  turned black   they show white people everywhere freaking the f ck out and losing their damn minds after listening to her new song  it s as though they just found out  that after all these years of beyonc  releasing hit after hit that white people adore  all of a sudden she releases a song that shows her as a powerful black woman speaking truth to power  and no one knows what to do with themselves  heaven forbid people of color have their own voice and not just be forced to cater to white people all the time  right anyway  this is absolutely brilliant featured image  screencap
