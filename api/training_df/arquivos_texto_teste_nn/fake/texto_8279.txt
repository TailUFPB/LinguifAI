not content with being a mere robot who repeats the same scripted line over and over during a debate  marco rubio demonstrated that he is a cold heartless robot on sunday everyone knows that the florida senator is an extremist when it comes to a woman s right to choose an abortion last july  rubio vowed to outlaw abortion  at home and around the world   making clear that women are only voting against their own freedom if they vote for rubio to become president rubio s position on abortion is one of the most strict among the gop field  especially since he opposes exceptions for rape victims  whom he would gleefully force to carry their rapist s baby for nine grueling months with the risk that her rapist will claim parental rights and terrorize her for the rest of her life and rubio did little to soften that position on sunday  telling george stephanopoulos that he would look a rape victim in the eye and tell her to carry her rapist s baby to term  abortion to me is not a political issue   rubio said   it s a human rights issue  he then said that he would sign an anti abortion bill with exceptions  but only because it would be a step toward banning abortion altogether  i do require an exception for life of the mother because i m pro life  number two  as i ve said  if they pass a law in congress that has exceptions  i ll sign it  because i want to save lives  the abc host then asked rubio point blank what he would say to a woman who gets pregnant through rape  to which rubio replied that he would tell her how sorry he is but she should have the baby anyway  it s a terrible situation  i mean  a crisis pregnancy  especially as a result of something as horrifying as that  i m not telling you it s easy  i m not here saying it s an easy choice  it s a horrifying thing that you ve just described  i get it  i really do  and that s why this issue is so difficult  but i believe a human being  an unborn child has a right to live  irrespective of the circumstances of which they were conceived  rubio conceded that most americans disagree with him on this issue  but nevertheless  he said he would still sign a bill banning abortion despite the opposition from the people here s the video via youtube indeed  the washington post reports that support for the right to choose has never been higher  and even  percent of republicans support choice rubio is clearly echoing former republican candidate rick santorum  who called a rape pregnancy a  gift from god  four years ago  indiana senate candidate richard mourdock felt the same way  and both men lost their bid for public office because of their extreme stance as you also recall  the republican war on women cost the gop dearly in  as women flocked to the voting booth to give their overwhelming support to president obama  and seeing as how the gop has only become more extreme against women s rights  it looks like  will at the very least be a repeat  but could end up being a landslide for democrats if an anti abortion fanatic like rubio becomes the gop nominee women should always have a choice when it comes to making decisions about their bodies  but republicans want to force women to have babies against their will even if that pregnancy was forced upon them by a rapist  that makes republicans no better than the  make rape legal  activists who are only becoming more emboldened as the conservative anti women fervor gets more extreme by forcing women to give birth to their rapist s baby  republicans would reward rapists with progeny and give them even more power over their victims  while subjecting women to months and years of trauma  we do not need these kinds of men running our government  they only contribute to the rape culture that is plaguing this country  and that means most of the republican field of candidates are unfit to be president featured image  woman survival
