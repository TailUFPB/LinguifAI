mississippi republicans are taking a  shoot first  ask questions later  approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious  security  squads tasked with killing perceived threats  this week  the state s republican led senate passed the so called  mississippi church protection act  which would militarize the state s churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight the bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons  it would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security the bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in mississippi  expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse  satchel or briefcase  and another recent law that allows open carry in public the bill also seeks to prohibit mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution   an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by congress mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as  security  which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of  justifiable homicide    the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty  pourmecoffee it passed pic twitter com   pourmecoffee   pourmecoffee  march    could go wrong much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to nra lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a  polite  society of heavily armed citizens  exploiting tragedy  and ignoring irony  the nra has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns  not less  the narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms  shootings like the one in charleston  south carolina  could be prevented the premise  as tempting as it sounds for would be vigilantes  has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice  data suggests that as the number of guns increase  the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases  places with a lot of  good guys with guns  tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries  go figure  at the same time  anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well  we ve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents  while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship with the removal of even permit requirements  mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained  untested amateurs who won t even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger  a militarized church security unit assigned by the church  trained by the church  and meant to protect the church by any means necessary  if mississippi legislators can t see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the house of representatives to be finalized  then we are in a lot of trouble featured image via george frey getty images
