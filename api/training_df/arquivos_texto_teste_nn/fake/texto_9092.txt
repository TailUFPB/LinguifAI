the trump administration on friday announced the united states will deny pakistan military aid amounting to   million as it expects islamabad to take decisive action  against terrorists and militants on its soil   the united states does not plan to spend the   million in fy  in foreign military financing for pakistan at this time   said a spokesperson of the president s national security council in a statement to hindustan times  the president has made clear that the united states expects pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil  and that pakistan s actions in support of the south asia strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship  including future security assistance  the administration continues to review pakistan s level of cooperation  the statement reflected and sealed the administration s complete disillusionment with pakistan  which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by president donald trump personally and leading members of his cabinet  such as secretaries james mattis and rex tillerson financial times reported last week that  the trump administration is considering dropping pakistan as an ally as it examines tough measures to quell more than  terrorist groups it says are based in the country   here again  the president who is daily derided and ridiculed by foreign policy  experts  is right  and they are wrong  pakistan is no ally  and has not been for years  this is a rupture that is much needed and long overdue president trump has accused the pakistani government of  housing the very terrorists that we are fighting  and it s true  with the most notorious of these being osama bin laden himself  journalist carlotta gall  who reported from afghanistan for the new york times for twelve years  reported in march  that soon after the navy seal raid on bin laden s house  a pakistani official told me that the united states had direct evidence that the isi chief  lt  gen  ahmed shuja pasha  knew of bin laden s presence in abbottabad  the information came from a senior united states official  and i guessed that the americans had intercepted a phone call of pasha s or one about him in the days after the raid   he knew of osama s whereabouts  yes   the pakistani official told me  the official was surprised to learn this and said the americans were even more so he shouldn t have been  it had been obvious for years at that point  and remains obvious  that the pakistanis had been aiding the same jihadists that the u s  government has been giving them billions of dollars to fight  this could be the severest blow dealt to islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it   said a leading us expert on pakistan  who did not want to be identified   there is more coming   the expert added   iotwreportthe amount    million  is left over from    billion aid earmarked for pakistan in   and which included non military aid as well  it was cleared for handing over in august  just days before it would lapse as unspent money first reported by the new york times  the move to withhold the money  which may not be large but would have signaled us backing  is reported to have come shortly after pakistan refused to hand over to the americans an operative of the haqqani network apprehended during the rescue of an american canadian family in october the haqqani network is an affiliate of afghan taliban and works out of pakistan  inflicting massive casualties on the us led international coalition in afghanistan  frustrated by islamabad s reluctance to give them  the united states has tied large portions of military aid payments to pakistan for its actions aimed at debilitating the network pakistan  however  has chosen to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in such payments over  and   instead of kicking out the terrorists  and it has lost equity the trump administration was clear from the start it wouldn t countenance continuity in ties and aid without real changes   we have been paying pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting   president donald trump had said unveiling his new south asia strategy in august   but that will have to change  and that will change immediately    hindustan times
