internet hacktivist collective anonymous is not to be f cked with  while they are huge supporters of free speech and freedom of expression  what they are not huge supporters of is organized hate  therefore  it should be no surprise that they have used a ddos attack to take down a website belonging to one of the oldest hate groups in america  the klu klux klan  as of this writing  the loyal white knights of the kkk website is still inaccessible the group was questioned regarding their insistence that the klan does not deserve to spread their message online  despite their adamant position that everyone deserves a voice  they told hackread  we targeted the kkk  we believe in free speech but their form of beliefs is monolithic and evil  we stand for constitutional rights but they want anyone who is not caucasian removed from earth so we targeted the kkk official website to show love for our boots on the ground and to send a message that all forms of corruption will be fought  we are not fascist but we certainly do not agree with the kkk movement  they are the fascists and they are the racists  anonymous is right  of course  free speech is one thing  while hate speech is quite another  the klan  the aryan nation  and other racist hate groups incite violence and mayhem at every turn  resulting in the terrorizing of minority communities  violence against said communities  and sometimes even death  they are also responsible for the crime of creating new generations of bigots among impressionable youth  and they keep systemic bigotry going and help continue its perpetuation as an integral part of the society in which we live the klan is a group that should not be allowed to exist  however  since the constitution forbids the government s disbanding of such hateful organizations  we must have groups that counter their disgusting messages of bigotry  if that includes hacking their websites and disallowing the spreading of their hate via the interwebs  then so be it good going  anonymous  keep up the good work featured image via jean christophe verhaegen  getty images
