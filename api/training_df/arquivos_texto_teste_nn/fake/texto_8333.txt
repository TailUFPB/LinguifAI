ted cruz has a lot of explaining to do regarding the actions of his campaign staff  cruz s campaign took a report that ben carson was diverting to florida after the iowa caucus  without heading to new hampshire  and very selectively cherry picked it to mean that ben carson was suspending his campaign and or dropping out of the presidential race  this was immediately followed by a plea to cruz workers to tell all carson caucus goers this falsehood while encouraging them to caucus for ted cruz instead carson s own campaign clarified at   pm he was not dropping out of the race  cruz s deputy iowa campaign manager sent an email at   pm   minutes after carson clarified things  saying carson was taking time off from the campaign trail after iowa and making a big announcement next week   the email also said to inform any carson caucus goers of this and convince them to support cruz instead  the first phone call by the campaign to a cruz precinct captain in iowa came in at   pm  with the same instructions to tell carson supporters to caucus for cruz instead  another phone call came in at   pm  both calls came after cnn also clarified that carson was not suspending his campaign the cruz campaign has so far insisted that they were acting on an  accurate  report that carson was suspending campaigning after the iowa caucus  the thing is  there doesn t seem to be any accurate report that exists  cruz had blamed cnn for reporting that carson suspended his campaign  but cnn did no such thing  iowa republican steve king linked to cnn s report then inferred on his own that carson was quitting the campaign  king clearly was clueless  because cnn said no such thing  however  the fact cruz took king s word for it without reading the actual article he linked is hard to believe  cruz might claim they just made a mistake but it seriously strains credulity to think they are that inept nancy bliesman  a precinct captain for cruz received the voicemails because she didn t take the calls as they were coming in  this prevented her from unknowingly lying to carson voters  it isn t immediately known how many other precinct captains or other campaign workers may have gotten the misinformation and acted on it  one thing is for sure  this puts a stain on cruz s  win  and could prove problematic for him in future caucuses once voters get wind of his shenanigans listen to the voicemails that were sent by the cruz campaign below featured image from flickr
