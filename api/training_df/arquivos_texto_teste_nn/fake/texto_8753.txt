during thursday night s undercard debate on fox business channel  candidate rick santorum  who s somehow still in the race  asked viewers for a very special favor the former pennsylvania senator said   go and google rick santorum and hillary clinton  you ll see a five minute debate  i ll let you decide who won the debate   he continued   i ll tell you who won  i know i m out of time  i m going to take some of rand paul s time here for a second  yes  rick santorum wants us to  google  him  why is this so goddamn funny there was a time when the absolute last thing rick santorum ever wanted you to do was to  google  him  not too long ago  lgbt commentator dan savage produced one of the greatest political pranks of all time  in response to santorum saying publicly that same sex marriage will lead to man on dog sex  savage re defined the word  santorum  to mean the  frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex  worse  enemies of santorum rigged it so that googling the republican s name would only produce results that led to that definition  hence  santorum probably didn t spend much time asking people to google him until thursday night  brave of him because  fortunately  google no longer produces the new definition as a search result  but people who despise the republican haven t forgotten  twitter erupted with reactions to the inadvertent reference to google historic moment  rick santorum just told people to go google rick santorum   daniel dale     january    who should never say  google me   rick santorum  and well  me     sydney leathers   sydneyelainexo  january    hi  i m rick santorum  please don t google me   andrew katz   katz  september    go and google rick santorum    nooooooooooooo  brett logiurato   brettlogiurato  january    not google santorum  t  becket adams   becketadams  january    i m rick santorum  i don t need to introduce myself  just google me  just make sure your kids aren t in the room   donald j  trump   realdonaidtromp  september    t happen to a nicer guy  huh featured image via video screen grab
