while speaking in fargo  north dakota  ted cruz pandered directly to his audience by fear baiting them with absolute malarkey  he went on and on about the supreme court and who the next justice needs to be to replace the recently departed antonin scalia his words are absolute bs  but unfortunately you know so many eat it up out of fear and simply not knowing any better  after all  the republican party needs its base as uniformed as possible to fill their minds with vile nonsense so they vote against their best interests regarding the court  cruz said  you know  just a few weeks ago with the passing of justice scalia  it underscored the stakes of this election  and it is not one  but two branches of the federal government that hang in the balance  we are one liberal justice away from a radical five justice majority the likes of which this country s never seen  because you know  a five justice conservative majority hasn t at all been radical   cruz continues  we are one justice away from the supreme court effectively stripping religious liberty from americans all across this country  what  no  seriously   what  unless someone from the government were to come into your home as a private citizen or protected place of worship and tell you not to worship how you do  religious liberty is still there  no one is stripping anything  except for the freedom to use religion to legally discriminate  if you serve the public  you abide by public laws  including equal protection under the law cruz didn t stop there though  he continues  we are one justice away from the court effectively erasing the second amendment from the bill of rights  abiding by the  well regulated  part of the second amendment and holding true to its truest intent is not  erasing the second amendment   however  if we re gonna get real about the necessity of the second amendment  which was originally written to amend article  section  of the constitution so that all state run militias will have the capability of being armed and trained when called forth by the republic in time of need  see also  whiskey rebellion   perhaps we should look if the second amendment should either be amended or replaced to fit modern needs  that s just common sense  though  and something many would rather ignore cruz s pi ce de r sistance is when he says  we are one justice away from the supreme court making us subject to the world court and the united nations and international law and giving up u s  sovereignty  what the actual f ck  how is abiding by international law and treaties to be well respected around the world giving up u s  sovereignty  does he want to rule with an iron fist  does he want to be dominant and bully nation s we need to continue diplomatic relations with  cruz is proving now  more than ever  that he s not ready to be commander in chief  because he literally doesn t know how to be a world leader cruz s talk is dangerous and it holds no place in reality  he is talking out of his ass like some bizarre gop freak show and he needs to be held accountable for his words and actions  how do we do that  make sure he doesn t win the white house   vote blue no matter who   tedcruz   we are one justice away from the court effectively erasing the  amendment from the bill of rights  https   t co   fox news   foxnews  april    image via video screen capture
