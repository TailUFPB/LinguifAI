well  it looks like republican presidential frontrunner donald trump is throwing his biggest temper tantrum yet  for days now  he s been complaining about the upcoming gop debate on fox news and the fact that megyn kelly will be moderating it  he even went to twitter and instagram to poll his followers about if he should even bother attending  fox news responded  pretty much calling him a wimp  saying  sooner or later donald trump  even if he s president  is going to have to learn that he doesn t get to pick the journalists   we re very surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by megyn kelly  however  trump doesn t care if they call him a scaredy cat or not  he s now completely pulling out of thursday s fox debate  earlier in the day on tuesday  he told the press  i probably won t be doing the debate  i m going to have something else in iowa  now trump s refusal to attend has been confirmed by his campaign manager corey lewandowski  who told washington post  he s definitely not participating in the fox news debate  his word is his bond  apparently  he s boycotting the debate and instead holding an event elsewhere in iowa to raise money for veterans  including the group wounded warriors  trump said of fox news  they re dealing with someone who s a little bit different  they can t toy with me like they toy with everybody else  and here s trump s latest post on instagram  campaign statement on fox news debate  https   www donaldjtrump com press releases trump campaign statement on fox news debatea photo posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on jan    at   pst the hotel magnate is clearly extremely upset that fox chose megyn kelly to moderate the debate  someone who he s had an ongoing heated kerfuffle  however  fox news is clearly the one who will have the last laugh  as they told mediaite earlier  we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings  and fox news  roger ailes stands behind megyn kelly  saying  megyn kelly is an excellent journalist and the entire network stands behind her   she will absolutely be on the debate stage on thursday night  they re not about to get bullied around by donald trump and his obviously fragile ego  as well as his inability to be criticized to his face so  to trump  you go and hold your event  hopefully  you raise a lot of money for veterans  however  if you want to be leader of the free world  sometimes you re going to have to do things you don t agree with  so maybe this proves now  more than ever  that you belong nowhere near the oval office  the debate  and the world  will go on   video featured image  wapo
