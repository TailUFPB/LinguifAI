bernie sanders has a knack for being able to look at issues facing our society and to point them out bluntly  unlike most politicians who dance around issues  sanders is a straight talker and he doesn t shy away from telling it how it is  whether his style emanates from decades of activism and politics  or whether it s just as a result of experiencing life  his style is refreshing  especially for a politician his approach was on display on thursday when he spoke at a rally attended by thousands of native americans at twin arrows navajo casino east of flagstaff  arizona   the culture of native americans is so rich  so important  that all of us will gain by preserving it   he said sanders conceded that the us government has not treated native americans well and that he would work to better the relationship once he becomes president  he said  native american people have been lied to  cheated  and negotiated treaties have been broken  often  native american people have not been heard on issues that affect their communities  they have been told what to do  they have not been involved in the process  sanders also touched on issues directly affecting the native american community  promising to work to raise the minimum wage once he becomes president  directly addressing  arizona gov  doug ducey  who has threatened to take away state support from cities that set their own minimum wage higher than the state s  sanders said i say to this  governor  i ve got some bad news for you  we re going to raise the minimum wage to   an hour  i will fight for a   minimum wage  there s nothing the governor can do about it  it is stunning to me that a governor would want to prevent the minimum wage from going up  sanders also discussed his idea of tuition free public education  an idea that can empower a generation of americans and prevent them from sinking into college debt as previous generations have  he said  the world has changed  the economy has changed  people today need more education  when you talk about public education today  you need to talk about making public colleges tuition free  i believe we need to have the best educated workforce in the global economy  it makes no sense to me that we have hundreds of thousands of people who are not getting an education because they can t afford it  all people would be eligible  sanders  whose rallies have drawn thousands  drew cheers from the crowd  his ideas are attractive to millions of americans and if last night s rally is any indication  the  democratic nomination for the presidency isn t over by a long shot watch video here featured image via wikimedia commons
