a rather interesting detail has emerged about donald trump s mother that is threatening to derail part of trump s campaign that he s heavily relied on to win over america s most racist voters according to a recent report released by the national  trump s mother  mary anne macleod  was actually a poor scottish immigrant that came to the united states to make a better life for herself   a realization that stands in stark contrast to the story the business mogul has been telling it shouldn t come as a shock that the donald would hide the fact that his mother came to america with nothing but   in her purse  why wouldn t he want people to know that his mother came to the country dirt poor and became a multi millionaire philanthropist  other than the fact that he has slammed immigrants all throughout his presidential campaign  after all  his website says this  the influx of foreign workers holds down salaries  keeps unemployment high  and makes it difficult for poor and working class americans   including immigrants themselves and their children   to earn a middle class wage  nearly half of all immigrants and their us born children currently live in or near poverty  including more than  per cent of hispanic immigrants every year  we voluntarily admit another two million new immigrants  guest workers  refugees  and dependents  growing our existing all time historic record population of  million immigrants we need to control the admission of new low earning workers in order to  help wages grow  get teenagers back to work  aid minorities  rise into the middle class  help schools and communities falling behind  and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the american dream  the  low earning worker  that trump is trashing on his website is the very person his mother was when she left scotland to come to america in   despite that he has his mother to thank for the opportunities he was given  trump can still find it in himself to say foolish  hateful things like  we re building a wall  it s going to be a wall that is not   nobody s going through my wall  trump builds walls  i build walls  the report by the national isn t the first time the fact that trump is the son of an immigrant has threatened to ruin his hateful anti immigrant rhetoric  earlier this year  trump s former gop rival ted cruz called trump out during a childish  birther  fight  cruz said  the legal issue is quite straightforward  but i would note that the birther theories that donald has been relying on  some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on u s  soil  but have two parents born on u s  soil  under that theory  not only would i be disqualified  marco rubio would be disqualified  bobby jindal would be disqualified  and interestingly enough  donald j  trump would be disqualified because donald s mother was born in scotland  you can watch that moment below but before cruz  real time s bill baher did an even more amazing job at highlighting the hypocrisy in trump s immigration stance   and it goes much deeper than his own mother  laying into the presumptive republican nominee  maher pointed out that two out of three of trump s wives have been immigrants  maher said  nobody brings this up about donald trump  who is always on about   we can t have foreigners coming into this country   his first wife is from czechoslovakia  his current wife is from slovenia  so  if you think crawling under a wall is the most disgusting way to become an american  somewhere there is a panamanian woman hiding in a truck full of chickens with ten pounds of heroin filled condoms in her stomach who s thinking   well  at least i didn t have to blow donald trump  featured image via tom lynn   getty images
