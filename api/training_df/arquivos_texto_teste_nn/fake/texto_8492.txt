for everyone other than maybe his investment partners  his wife  and his white nationalist supporters  most people look at donald trump with utter disgust  no  not because he s orange with something that can only be described as an endangered species on his head  but rather because of his attitude towards life and how he apparently thinks people and things should be treated  just by listening to his hissy fit over the fox news debate  he has to make it about ratings and how he s really the thing that drives the entire event  to put it mildly he s full of himself  to be absolutely accurate  he s an egomaniac with narcissistic personality disorder and this isn t anything new for trump  the republican frontrunner has always been this braggadocios character who sees himself as the absolute best at everything and thinks everything he touches turns to gold  if he had a nice personality  many people would be able to look past this sort of ego  but since he s also an ass  well  people are going to call him out on it the folks over at sesame street did just that back in  when they created the character  donald grump  that oscar the grouch and all the other trash loving grouches looked up to and admired  they put the word  grump  all over everything  just like trump does with his name  oscar the grouch in the introduction leading up the appearance of  grump  explains to show staple maria  donald grump happens to have the most trash of any grouch in the world  his name is on every piece of trash in town  then after a brilliant song completely satirizing trump   donald grump  emerges and is everything you d ever imagine the muppet to be  with lines like  who s name equals trash  to you and to me   and the grump saying  who do you wish you all could be  elmo s even turned down from being mr  grump s helper because he s  too nice   however  grump changes his mind when he hears elmo is  nice and annoying   qualities both grump and trump know help manipulate people to his fancy  grump also yells at maria when he doesn t like what she says by saying   scram  you re fired   and when she says   you can t fire me  he says   i just did   which is all very foreshadowing to the revelation that trump truly wants all latinos to scram but enough of me explaining what happens  the entire thing is just pure comedy gold and absolutely accurate enjoy video featured image  youtube
