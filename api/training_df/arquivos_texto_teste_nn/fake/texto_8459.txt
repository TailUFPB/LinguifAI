donald trump s ridiculous stunt on thursday has garnered him quite a bit of attention   positive from the stupid part of america  and negative from everyone who is able to figure out how to operate a spoon without adult guidance  in an effort to hide the fact that he is scared of fox news  megyn kelly  trump pretended to care about our nation s soldiers for an evening with a  fundraiser  campaign event he scheduled in opposition to the debate he elected to skip of course  veterans  groups practically climbed all over each other to inform the donald that the money would not be accepted  and donations were made to his foundation rather than actual veterans  this is a problem  of course  because barely  percent of his foundation s donations are given to vets  on friday  cnn s jim sciutto confronted trump spokeswoman katrina pierson about the donations   specifically  which veterans  groups would be receiving the millions of dollars in donations trump had gathered for the donald j  trump foundation  the money is going to a trump organization now  name one veterans organization that has agreed to accept that money   sciutto said  pierson explained that the money would be  spread across the country  to veterans  groups  aside from those who refuse to accept it  however  sciutto didn t let her slide with that answer  asking her to name a single organization that has agreed to accept the money  i m sorry  i can t hear you   pierson s replied as the gerbils that perform her basic brain functions struggled to spin the wheel fast enough to enable the bullshit circuits in her head to connect  pierson said there might be a list on trump s website  but no such list exists  there is simply a donation form realizing that he was not going to get a straight answer  sciutto moved on to another issue  pierson s downright insane twitter account  pierson has previously complained that there are not enough  pure breeds  left in politics as she took a stab at obama  who she calls the  head negro in charge  and a  jihadi    remarks that many have found questionable at best  pierson  of course  took the tried and true conservative path of blaming liberals  so of course you could pull any of those tweets out of one of those heated discussions because a lot of times it s in the sphere of fighting off other liberal activists  i got to tell you  it s interesting that this has made some sort of news cycle when we have all of the things that are happening in the world  including a presidential race  to go back   tweets  pull them out of context of the discussion and try to make that a news story  that s right  she got angry with liberals so she called the president a half breed  a  negro   and other awful things unfortunately  this behavior is typical of conservatives  who feel that anger is justification to spew slurs and hatred watch pierson s flimsy excuses below featured image via screengrab
