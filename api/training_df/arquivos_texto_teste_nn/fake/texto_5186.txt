the idea of a donald trump presidency has been terrifying from the second he rode down that escalator and announced that he was running for president  however  his behavior in recent weeks has been so completely unhinged that people on both sides of the political aisle have been questioning his mental stability  even the sitting president did something completely unprecedented and came out and said that trump is quote   unfit to serve as president  now  a democratic congresswoman from california  karen bass  has done what no one has had the courage to do  and started a change org petition calling for donald trump to undergo a mental health evaluation  bass  who had a career in healthcare prior to running for office  says of her decision to move forward with what is surely to be a controversial move regarding the other party s standard bearer in her petition  donald trump is dangerous for our country  his impulsiveness and lack of control over his own emotions are of concern  it is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world mr  trump appears to exhibit all the symptoms of the mental disorder narcissistic personality disorder  npd   mental health professionals need to come forward and urge the republican party to insist that their nominee has an evaluation to determine his mental fitness for the job  also  in case people had any doubt about what narcissistic personality disorder is and how trump fits the profile  rep  bass laid all of that out as well  from the hill in her petition  bass laid out the nine symptoms of npd  which are a grandiose sense of self importance  a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success  a belief that he or she is special and can only be understood by others with a similar status  a requirement of excessive admiration  a sense of entitlement  interpersonal exploitation  lack of empathy  envy of others and arrogant or haughty behavior well  that definitely describes trump s public behavior to the letter  and therefore rep  bass s request is completely justified  hopefully  the gop leadership heeds this warning and   even if it is done privately   has trump evaluated  if for no other reason than the fact that they actually care about the american people they represent you can sign this very important petition here at change org featured image via joshua lott getty images
