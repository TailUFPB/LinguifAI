republicans have been vowing to honor the memory of recently deceased racist hatemonger  supreme court justice antonin scalia  by blocking any and all nominees obama might put forward to replace him  no matter who they are  while scalia himself  would disagree with  the intrusion of politics into the judicial appointment process   ted cruz promises to filibuster any nominee and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says he will use every tool at his disposal to block nominations until after the election  when they hope a republican is in office  good luck with that  guys  while republicans often invoke ronald reagan as they struggle to excuse most of their actions  they are similarly ignoring the former president s opinion on the matter  in   saint ronnie made it clear while urging the senate to confirm anthony m  kennedy that he doesn t quite agree with childishly blocking nominations  either in the year ahead  we re not going to be on the defensive  shoring up problems and answering our critics  we are moving forward  and i have no doubt that when we look back  will be a year of great accomplishment toward our goals  this is the year when judge anthony kennedy will be confirmed and the supreme court will again be brought up to full strength  the federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football  i would hope  and the american people should expect  not only for judge kennedy s confirmation but for the senate to get to work and act on  other judicial nominations that have been left in limbo for quite awhile now that s right   republicans are so desperate to deny obama a judicial nomination that they are willing to ignore tradition  the wishes of the person they are supposedly honoring in this destructive and asinine action  and even the words of their messiah watch the remarks from saint ronnie s january    state of the union address below watch ronald reagan urge the senate to confirm justice kennedy during an election year  from     pic twitter com msawaymglr  igorvolsky   igorvolsky  february    image via screengrab
