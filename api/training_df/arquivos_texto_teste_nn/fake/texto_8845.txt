folks  barack obama s tyranny has hit the fine  upstanding patriots currently occupying a federal building in oregon hard  not only did the crazed  armed occupiers  mommies forget to pack snacks for them  but they seem to have run out of clean underwear and tampons   as well as other items needed for their pretend revolution  don t worry  they do have plenty of guns  even though police have promised them the freedom to move in and out of the malheur national wildlife refuge   a strange thing to grant terrorists   these grown men playing cowboy seem entirely incapable of driving to the store to buy their own supplies  the new wish list  posted to twitter by extremism analyst j j  mcnab  includes much more than snacks the militants now want supporters to provide them with tampons  underwear  t shirts  money  blankets  socks  bed sheets  shampoo  deodorant  let s face it   that many teabillies in one place can get a bit smelly   gaming supplies  and cigarettes the need for tampons is no laughing matter  recently  one of the militants announced that they plan to use women and children as shields against anything they view as an attack   in that case  the presence of women and children was used to dissuade the evil government from shutting off the electricity  this  of course  is a tactic that was used at bundy ranch as well  with one armed terrorist revealing that  if they are going to start shooting  it s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot  i personally think that helping them would be a great idea  send as many tampons as you want  using that big  bad government mail system  to malheur national wildlife refuge  c o y all  sodhouse lnprinceton  or  s send them more tampons than they will ever use  they can find their own damn coats if you don t want to waste money on tampons  make a phone call and urge the fbi to finally take action against these dangerous domestic terrorists featured image via freakoutnation
