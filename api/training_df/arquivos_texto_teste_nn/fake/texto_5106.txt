chris christie has always been adamant that neither he  nor his staff  knew anything about the washington bridge lane closures intended to create serious traffic problems for a town whose mayor refused to endorse his re election bid in   however  some new texts have surfaced in which two staffers discuss how christie flat out lied at a  press conference where he insisted they were all innocent the exchange was between christina renna and a campaign staffer  peter sheridan  and went like this  are you listening  he just flat out lied about senior staff and  former campaign manager bill  stepian not being involved   the aide  christina genovese renna  wrote in a text message to campaign worker peter sheridan as they watched the dec     press conference  when the so called  bridgegate  scandal was just beginning to unfold  i m listening   sheridan replied  he added   gov is doing fine  holding his own up there  renna wrote back   yes  but he lied  and if emails are found with the subpoena or  emails are uncovered in discovery if it comes to that it could be bad   lawyers for bill baroni  one of christie s allies who s going on trial soon for his role in bridgegate  submitted those texts as evidence that the blame for bridgegate really lies with other people  they re trying to convince the court that the government ignored key evidence in their investigations christie is becoming a well known liar  when asked about these texts  he flat out said  i absolutely dispute it  it s ridiculous  it s nothing new  there s nothing new to talk about  he also tried to cast doubt on the texts by saying they came from a defense lawyer  and not from someone under oath  christie seems to think he can remain innocent in the eyes of  well  whoever thinks he s actually innocent  by implying the texts are either fabricated or taken so far out of context that they re meaningless christie hasn t been charged in the scandal  depending on what happens with this new evidence  though  that may change  either way  christie looks worse than ever featured image by alex wong getty images
