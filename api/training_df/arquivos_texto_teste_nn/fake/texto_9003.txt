what s happening in oregon isn t  by any means  an act of  patriotism  or the  duty  of citizens  what s happening in oregon is a temper tantrum  and nothing short of treason  this seditious behavior is quite illegal  and the united states constitution explicitly states that a well regulated militia can be used against insurrections  not in the allowance of such horrific behavior in article   section  of the constitution  it states  to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union  suppress insurrections and repel invasions to provide for organizing  arming  and disciplining  the militia  and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states  reserving to the states respectively  the appointment of the officers  and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress  the founders use of civilian militias was not one to  overthrow  the government if citizens felt they were being wronged  it was to protect the union from insurrectionists who were a threat to the nation how did they make sure these militias were well regulated and armed in case of insurrection  invasion  or to maintain the law of the land  with this thing called the second amendment  a well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed  see how everything pieces together when you don t just cherry pick the parts of the constitution you want to make sure every dimwitted tom  dick or sally is armed to the teeth  the purpose of the militias was to protect the newly formed government  and while dissent is patriotic  sedition is not  if you don t like how the government is being run  we have this glorious thing in the united states called  democracy  and we re able to vote for who writes our laws what s happening in oregon  by definition  is exactly treason  it could also be considered a  seditious conspiracy  if two or more persons in any state or territory  or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states  conspire to overthrow  put down  or to destroy by force the government of the united states  or to levy war against them  or to oppose by force the authority thereof  or by force to prevent  hinder  or delay the execution of any law of the united states  or by force to seize  take  or possess any property of the united states contrary to the authority thereof  they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years  or both  these  patriots  need to be locked up for a good long time if you still question the intent of the founding fathers  effort to thwart insurrection  please take note of the whiskey rebellion  not much unlike what s happening in oregon with pissed off farmers  the government imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits  which these farmers decided to rebel against  well  president george washington called forth the use of the militia to stop the insurrection and this refusal to follow the law  in fact  here is the transcript of his proclamation from september     whereas  from a hope that the combinations against the constitution and laws of the united states  in certain of the western counties of pennsylvania  would yield to time and reflection  i thought it sufficient  in the first instance  rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody them  but the moment is now come  when the overtures of forgiveness  with no other condition than a submission to law  have been only partially accepted  when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of government has been adopted  without effect  when the well disposed in those counties are unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury  and are compelled to associate in their own defence  when the proffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will march with reluctance  when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy  endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support  and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection  when it is manifest  that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to enforce the laws  when  therefore  government is set at defiance  the contest being whether a small proportion of the united states shall dictate to the whole union  and  at the expense of those who desire peace  indulge a desperate ambition now  therefore  i  george washington  president of the united states  in obedience to that high and irresistible duty  consigned to me by the constitution   to take care that the laws be faithfully executed   deploring that the american name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their  own government  commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion  but resolved  in perfect reliance on that gracious providence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country  to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the laws  do hereby declare and make known  that  with a satisfaction which can be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the states of new jersey  pennsylvania  maryland  and virginia  i have received intelligence of their patriotic alacrity  in obeying the call of the present  though painful  yet commanding necessity  that a force  which  according to every reasonable expectation  is adequate to the exigency  is already in motion to the scene of disaffection  that those who have confided or shall confide in the protection of government  shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arms of the united states  that those who having offended against the laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity  will be treated with the most liberal good faith  if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct  and that instructions are given accordingly and i do  moreover  exhort all individuals  officers  and bodies of men  to contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those crimes  which produce this resort to military coercion  to check  in their respective spheres  the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth  and their discontents in the place of stable government  and to call to mind  that as the people of the united states have been permitted  under the divine favor  in perfect freedom  after solemn deliberation  in an enlightened age  to elect their own government  so will their gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain the constitution and the laws and  lastly  i again warn all persons  whomsoever and whersoever  not to abet  aid  or comfort the insurgents aforesaid  as they will answer the contrary at their peril  and i do also require all officers and other citizens  according to their several duties  as far as may be in their power  to bring under the cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises  if there were such a thing as a  mic drop  in the day  it would have hit the floor with the strength of a thunderous boom honestly  washington s words could be said today in the same regard to the thousands of armed wannabe  patriots  who are taking up arms against the nation in wrongful insurrection  these men in oregon need to be stopped  they need to be arrested  and this sort of behavior  in any way  cannot be condoned or allowed  it goes against everything we are as the united states of america featured image  wikimedia commons
