anyone following the current election has every right to be absolutely disgusted with the republican party and the behavior of its candidates  even more conservative americans are coming around to the fact that the gop hasn t been doing its part and is actually worsening the country while embarrassing us all on tuesday  republican sheriff newell normand had a moment of clarity during the metropolitan crime commission s annual awards luncheon in louisiana  normand is a republican himself  but he couldn t hold back his disappointment in the party when he slammed the gop s elected officials and the state s former governor  bobby jindal  in his speech according to normand  jindal was a complete fool who made a mess of louisiana s finances and was more like a cult leader than a governor  admitting that he had once  endorsed that idiot   normand was left disappointed and regretted standing behind jindal once he was governor and left louisiana in shambles  the enraged cop entertained the audience by calling jindal out  what a mess  bobby jindal was a better cult leader than jim jones   we drank the elixir for eight years  we remained in a conscious state  we walked to the edge of the cliff  we jumped off and he watched us  and guess what  unlike jim jones  he did not swallow the poison  what a shame  normand also accused jindal of attempting to rewrite history by using social media to reframe his handling of the budget  even when the rest of the state doesn t  even know what history is   currently  louisiana is facing a hefty budget shortfall of    billion  but jindal is bragging on twitter about what a great job he did as governor  normand isn t having it  he said  we have to just say no  i m a republican but i m not a hypocrite  we have to look at ourselves critically as a party and figure out where we are and what we re going to be about  thanks to jindal  the state is trying to fix is budget problems by cutting funding to mental health and closing several state prisons   all which initiatives will cause issues for law enforcement  suggesting that republicans stop attacking and actually start working on solutions  normand noted that a medicaid expansion would take care of costs like mental health and drug addiction  the frustrated sheriff slammed conservatives once more  telling them to actually get to work instead of blaming obama for the country s woes  and i have to listen to my republican counterparts talk about gobbledigook  blah  blah blah  and i m so sick and tired of hearing  obama  obama  obama  you know how much intellect it takes to blame something on somebody else  this much    normand held his hand up to signal  zero   propose a solution  work together  you can watch normand s impassioned speech below  it s something that every republican should hear fox  wvue new orleans news  weather  sports  socialfeatured image is a screenshot
