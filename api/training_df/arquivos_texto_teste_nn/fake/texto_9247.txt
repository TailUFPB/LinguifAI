if you live in wisconsin and want your working neighbors to fund your existence  you may need to start peeing in a cup to prove your dependency on the government isn t related to your dependency on drugs  the governor of wisconsin is a love em  or hate em  kind of leader  conservatives love him for making public sector unions pay more of their own benefits   liberals hate him for daring to stand up to the powerful  organized mega donors of the democrat party  governor walker is about to shake things up again in the blue state of wisconsin  and liberals are not gonna be happy gov  scott walker is moving forward with an effort to drug test some food stamp recipients  with testing expected to begin in as little as a year absent action from lawmakers or the federal government wisconsin s republican governor has submitted a plan to state lawmakers for drug testing able bodied recipients of the state s food share program  if the state legislature doesn t object within  days  the plan will go into effect  though it will take at least a year for actual testing to begin the program won t necessarily have a massive effect  however  the walker administration estimated in october that only about  food stamp recipients statewide   or just    of able bodied adults   would test positive in the first year  employers have jobs available  but they need skilled workers who can pass a drug test   walker said in a statement   this rule change means people battling substance use disorders will be able to get the help they need to get healthy and get back into the workforce  a year ago  walker had asked then president elect donald trump and his incoming administration to clear the way for the change in the food stamp program  which is overseen by the state but largely funded by federal taxpayers  so far that hasn t happened but a walker spokesman said monday that the governor believes the state can proceed without any federal action  our position is we have the authority to implement the rule   spokesman tom evenson said the now departed appointees of president barack obama didn t see it that way  in january   right before trump took over the white house  the former u s  official in charge of the replacement program to food stamps said such testing would require a change in federal law  the law clearly does not allow it   said kevin concannon  undersecretary at the federal food and nutrition service within the u s  department of agriculture  walker s  office forwarded that request to us and it was very clear  we consulted the legal counsels here and the law absolutely does not allow it  the trump administration  however  may not see the issue in the same light    journal sentinel
