last night during the democratic presidential town hall in iowa  democratic presidential candidate absolutely skewered the  republican candidates for their  dangerous  rhetoric clinton s fiery rant against the gop came as a response to islamic air force veteran erum tariq munir  who asked a question that no parent in america should ever have to wonder  but it s completely understandable now that the far right is upping the crazy  noting the rising islamophobia in the country  tariq munir asked  as a mother of three young children  as an american muslim  how can i make sure that this country is the best place on earth to raise my family  clinton paused and thanked tariq munir for her service before launching into an attack against the people most responsible for the growing bigotry in the united states  once she got going  the former secretary of state couldn t hold back  allowing disgust and anger to flow freely while clinton s criticism was intended for all gop contenders  front runner donald trump was singled out specifically  clinton admitted that  one of the most distressing  parts of the  campaign has been hearing the republican party s offensive  bigotry fueled rhetoric  visibly upset and disturbed by what this coming election has revealed so far about america s conservatives  clinton said  one of the most disturbing aspects of this campaign has been the language of republican candidates  particularly their frontrunner  that insults  demeans  denigrates different people  i found it particularly harmful the way  has talked about muslims it s not only shameful and offensive  which it is   i think it s dangerous   we cannot tolerate this  we must stand up and say   every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect  once she was content that she d ripped the gop enough  clinton tied tariq munir s question to foreign policy  she said  we need a coalition that includes muslim nations to defeat isis and it s pretty hard to figure out how you re going to make a coalition with the very nations you need if you spend your time insulting their religion  later on  clinton solidified her position as a great presidential candidate  demonstrating an amount of poise and class that her gop rivals would have never been able to pull off  she said  i want to be the president for everyone  and i believe that is exactly what any president should do  you can watch clinton s passionate response below standing up against the gop is now something that comes naturally to clinton  time after time  she demonstrates that she will stand up for all americans   not just the rich white ones twitterfeatured image is a screenshot
