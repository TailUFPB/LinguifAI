republican senator orrin hatch tried to justify not doing his job and chris cuomo was having none of it during an appearance on cnn on tuesday  senate judiciary committee member orrin hatch attempted to defend the decision of senate republicans to refuse to hold confirmation hearings for anyone president obama nominates to fill the vacant seat of justice antonin scalia  who passed away on saturday ever since news broke of scalia s death  republicans have made it clear that they won t allow president obama to fill the empty position on the bench  opting instead to wait a year until whomever is elected president in november takes office  which they hope will be a republican but host chris cuomo told hatch that he and his gop colleagues should do their damn jobs as the constitution requires  especially since the document conservatives claim they love so much says nothing about a president not being able to pick a judicial nominee during an election year  you don t get to not vote on judges just because it is an election year and final year of someone s presidency  so  that hypocrisy is as play as well   cuomo bluntly said   you don t have to like whom he nominates  but shouldn t you go through the process  of course  like a good little obstructionist hatch continued to insist that republicans don t have to do anything   no  i don t think there is any real reason to do that   he said  to which cuomo asked   what about the constitution  hatch responded by claiming that president obama has been treated fairly by senate republicans  which we all know is a crock of shit considering the record amount of obstructing the gop has done since president obama first took office seven years ago  at the end of his response  hatch revealed the only real reason why republicans want to wait to replace scalia  look  this president s been treated fairly   percent of the federal judiciary up and republicans have allowed votes on all of those  now what they are saying is look  we are in a tremendous presidential campaign  there is a lot of bitterness on both sides  let s diffuse this thing and let s put this until the next president of the united states  we ll wait and use discretion  and whoever is the next president will do the job  now the democrats of course naturally want this because they want to have a   majority on the court  throughout the interview  hatch claimed that democrats muddied up the system by not confirming conservative extremist robert bork to the high court  however  cuomo pointed out that democrats at least held confirmation hearings as required by the constitution and went through the process  it s just that at the end bork wasn t confirmed  which is the senate s right  the senate does have the power to reject a nominee  so it appears hatch and his fellow republicans all have a case of sour grapes because democrats did their job  as it turned out  anthony kennedy ended up being confirmed to the supreme court instead of bork the bottom line is that senate democrats went through the process even though they eventually rejected bork  fun fact  six republicans voted against bork as well cuomo then informed hatch that a   court is not a good thing because many cases won t be settled due to constant ties  which would delay a real decision while cases pile up since unresolved cases have to be refiled and argued again  but hatch thinks a   court is a good thing  a   court functions it s functioned in the past  it will function this time  just on the really controversial issues they will probably put them off for a year  it is not the end of the world  as a matter of fact  it is a smart thing to do  and as he had done multiple times throughout the interview  hatch brought up the presidential election and how it would somehow be unfair to hold hearings during this time  and when cuomo mentioned that the constitution doesn t say anything about not confirming judges during a election year  hatch claimed the constitution  gives you every right to defer this  and to make sure that it is done in the best of ways so that both sides have an opportunity to have their person in the presidency and then  you know  if the democrats win we ll go through this process the way it ought to be gone through  here s the video via youtube again  hatch makes a bullshit claim because we all know that if republicans still control the senate in   they will continue to throw a temper tantrum and refuse to do their job if hillary clinton or bernie sanders is the president who makes a nomination  in other words  things will be no different than they are right now hatch and senate republicans are the reasons why our government can t get anything done for this country and now they are threatening to derail the judicial system and break all precedent just because they don t want the supreme court to shift away from the extreme conservative ideology that has controlled the court for decades  this is totally outrageous and the american people need to punish republicans for this failure to do their jobs  after all  if any normal american worker failed to do their job  they d be fired  so should senate republicans  featured image from raw story
