you know when you re told to smile for a photo but the person next you just let one rip  well  that s pretty much the expression on ted cruz s face right after being told by a person taking a photo with him that she is gay this new wonder woman was able to snag a photo with cruz at one of his events and clearly took the anti gay republican texas senator completely off guard  and it is spectacular according to pride com  at a ted event  a young queer hero approached him  and said   i am gay   flash forward to   seconds later  she took a selfie with mr  cruz  where he looks frozen in his awkward and uncomfortable face via pride comhe looks as though he is literally about to catch gay cooties  and her face is absolutely amazing  it reads   yeah  i just punked you  you bigoted jerkface  as you may or may not be aware  cruz is steadfast in his hatred of all things gay  not only is he against marriage equality and the protection of lgbt citizens from discrimination  but he even hates pride parades  what kind of monster hates a joyous parade  apparently the guy who looks like the ignorant fool in this picture next to a new brand of american hero kudos to this young woman who was courageous enough to come out to cruz s face and then be even braver to snap the photo less than a second later  it may be the best thing seen from this entire election season yet featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
