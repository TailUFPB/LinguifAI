you know what scares republicans more than black people voting in elections  an army of women exercising their rights  for quite some time  the right wing has been on the attack against planned parenthood  and now the women s health organization is fighting back in the best way possible  by  as they say  working to  engage historically disenfranchised communities  on friday  planned parenthood announced that it will begin registering voters at its clinics  on college campuses  and at other locations  regardless of their background  beliefs  or political ideology   in other words  they don t care if a woman is exercising her right to have an abortion or is standing outside holding signs and spewing threats at people who enter their facilities  they just want more people to vote  if we can t all participate in our government  we all get cheated   anna keene  a planned parenthood spokeswoman  told the huffington post   we re launching the  my vote  my voice  campaign to help ensure that every voice is heard and every vote is counted in communities across the country  no matter what your political beliefs are  if you don t or can t vote  then you can t elect officials who will keep your best interests in mind  while the campaign itself aims to register any voters  it is unlikely that conservatives will allow themselves to be registered by planned parenthood  since the organization attracts the young  low income people  and people of color   all groups that are more likely to support democrats  the launch of the program is tied to the  anniversary of the voting rights act  a  law that once protected the rights of african americans to vote before the conservative heavy supreme court gutted it in   our purpose is to engage historically disenfranchised communities   erin carhart  planned parenthood manager of youth organizing  explained   our hope is to encourage folks to participate in democracy  this is just one more reason republicans will continue their desperate and nonsensical attempts to close planned parenthood clinics nationwide  not only will they be enabling women to make the healthcare choices that are right for their individual circumstances  but the organzation will be creating more and more voters who will be likely to vote blue in november  make sure you join them at the polls if you d like to register to vote  click the following link featured image via pbs
