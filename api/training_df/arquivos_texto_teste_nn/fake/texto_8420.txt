the nightmare that is donald trump just keeps barreling on  and there seems to be no end in sight  in fact  it seems that he just might become the gop nominee for the  presidential election  there are endless reasons that this is beyond scary  and he has given us yet another earlier this week  trump showed just how ignorant he is of the law in a bumbling interview with george stephanopoulos on abc s this week  the host didn t go easy on trump in a conversation about the supreme court and the appointment of justices  and trump showed himself to be utterly unqualified to be in any position of political power  much less president of the united states and leader of the free world  here is a transcript of the exchange  courtesy of the new civil rights movement stephanopoulos  let s talk about some of the issues  judges  what kind of judges will you appoint  will they be conservative what does that mean to you and how will you ensure it trump  well  first of all  we have a lot of judges that have to be appointed because we have a lot of openings in terms of judges  and i m very happy about that  to be honest  because i think  you know  appointing judges is a very important and a very  frankly  a very  very important element of what we re doing stephanopoulos  but ted cruz says he s going to appoint rock rib conservatives with a paper trail  what are you going to do trump  well  i m going to appoint conservative judges  i m going to appoint people that have great reputations  that are great with the legal profession stephanopoulos  like trump  well  i can say like any   you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is justice thomas  i mean  if you look at   if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the supreme court  justice roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives  i mean stephanopoulos  but how are you going to trump  wait  let me first say  ted cruz  was the one that really wanted justice roberts to go on the supreme court  you know that  right  have you heard that stephanopoulos  so  how are you going to make sure you don t get a justice roberts  are you going to ask your appointees trump  well  excuse me  excuse me  how are they going to make sure  bush appointed him  and cruz was the biggest advocate  cruz fought like hell to get justice roberts in there  justice roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster  he turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us obamacare  so  you tell me  ask cruz  why did he push stephanopoulos  i m asking you  how are you going to make sure trump  no  i m asking you  why did he push so hard to have a judge who has absolutely set the conservative movement back and said everything stephanopoulos  when i interview him  i ll ask him  how you re going to make sure you don t get betrayed by your appointees trump  i will study it carefully  i will work with people that i respect  conservative people  and we ll appoint judges that will be good  and i don t think i ll have any catastrophic appointment like justice roberts  which was really more than anybody else  pushed by cruz and bush with this level of incompetency on full display for all to see  trump went on fox news sunday to redeem himself on the same issue and this time  he did what every republican does when trying to woo audiences and cover up for mistakes  he turned the discussion to those fox viewers hate the most  lgbt people  in fact  trump says that if he is elected president  the justices on his supreme court will be those who oppose marriage equality  and he would find a way to have them throw out the obergefell v  hodges decision that made equal marriage the law of the land first  trump dodged the question  simply telling host chris wallace  they have ruled on it  i wish it was done by the states  wallace didn t let trump off the hook though  and plowed on  finally forcing trump to say to the conservative audience on the issue of justices who would overturn the marriage equality decision  i would strongly consider that  yes  there you have it  folks  we knew trump was a bigot  but he had never come out and said he d actively work to roll back lgbt right on this level  not surprising at all  though  just another reason to make sure his fantasy of ruling america never becomes a reality featured image from gage skidmore flickr
