one of the hallmarks about jeb bush s failing presidential campaign has been just how pathetic it has turned out to be  his latest campaign ad won t help that perception of the republican once spoken about as a shoo in for the nomination the ad features jeb bush s mother  barbara bush  and she takes a swipe at donald trump the former first lady says jeb bush wants to be president for the right reasons  unlike some other candidates in the field  rather than talking about how popular they are or how great they are  he s doing it because he sees a huge need and it s not being filled by anybody   mrs  bush says  likely referring to trump  the gop front runner after months of being depicted as out of touch and a wimp  it probably won t help to have your mother now fight your battles for you  it s an approach that is sure to attract the derision of donald trump and other  more pugilistic republicans it has been startling how the bush campaign and its affiliated super pac has made so many mistakes throughout their campaign  starting with a candidate with very strong name recognition and a   million plus war chest that reportedly scared off a campaign from mitt romney  by this point bush was supposed to be on the verge of accepting the nomination instead  he is polling in single digits  behind trump and cruz  he s served as the poster boy for the impotent republican establishment  while his super pac has been lighting money on fire on things like nonsensical ads making fun of marco rubio s boots bush himself has been a dud of a candidate  leading some to comment on how his brother and father seem to have had far more natural political talent  bush has been awkward on the campaign trail  showing quirks more often associated with a political rookie rather than someone elected to govern in a populous state like florida featured image via youtube
