republicans have revived an old and overused piece of right wing trash in an effort to try to invalidate the unmitigated success of president obama s recent diplomatic victories with iran the myth that they have dug back out of their closet is that ronald reagan freed american diplomats and citizens held hostage in iran  simply by becoming president  republicans like to infer that reagan was some kind of ultra tough republican cowboy  and this caused iran to be petrified with fear causing them to surrender the hostages the moment reagan was sworn into office  as rachel so eloquently explains  nothing could be further from the truth watch rachel completely destroy the republican effort to try to deny obama the legacy he earned below if you want to look at who operated from a position of power in the negotiations  you need to look no further than the soft spoken jimmy carter  he froze   billion in iranian assets after they seized the hostages  iran was engaged in a war with iraq at the time  suddenly the iranian s had second thoughts    billion in  dollars was huge and they needed this for the war effort  the unfreezing of assets  plus an american pledge to not meddle in internal iranian affairs and an agreement to work together to resolve post revolution financial claims  were the only things we had to give them  to sum it up  jimmy got virtually everything and iran got nothing except being left alone the only aspect that ronald reagan played in the freedom of the iranian hostages was coincidental at best  if iran had not released them when they did  they risked reagan nullifying the agreement  and in turn  they would lose everything that was already on the bargaining table  you could replace reagan with literally any other person that existed on earth at the time  and you would have gotten the same result  he did nothing except occupy space  it stands in a stark contrast to reagan s true legacy on iran  remember the one where he illegally sold weapons to iran in order to try to get them to facilitate the freeing of american hostages from lebanon and using the proceeds of the sale to fund an illegal war in central america  but  that s none of our business according to republicans featured image via msnbc screen capture
