with speaker paul ryan  r wi  canceling his wednesday press conference  it left many wondering why he would do such a thing one reason could certainly be because he doesn t quite know how to answer questions regarding trump and his racist comments about a federal judge  ryan  of course  also endorsed trump  so there s the question of why would he back a clear racist as well spotting this clear dodge of the press was none other that house minority leader nancy pelosi  d ca   and she decided to have a little fun with it pelosi s deputy chief of staff  drew hammill  tweeted out a pretend press release  clearly intended to mock ryan s endorsement of trump it stated  speaker ryan to hide from reporters todaywashington  d c    speaker paul ryan will not be available to answer your questions today about his surrender to donald trump  speaker ryan has cancelled his regular wednesday press conference so you don t ask him about donald trump s racist commentary against a federal judge  and why  ahead of their national security agenda rollout tomorrow  the house gop wants to hand the nuclear codes to a person who engages in textbook racism    speakerryan in hiding today pic twitter com   drew hammill   drewhammill  june     ha well  that certainly didn t mince words one bit  and that press release certainly isn t wrong  sure  ryan said he canceled his press conference to host india s prime minister narendra modi  who just made an address to a joint session of congress  but that s surely a cop out considering a press conference takes barely any time at all out of his day  and you know  the fact that it s part of his job ryan has gotten himself into quite the pickle with his endorsement of trump  who is clearly a bigot  so  a press release stating  speaker ryan to hide from reporters today  is perfectly accurate  because why on earth would he want to stand there and defend a racist well played  pelosi  well played indeed featured photo by mark wilson  chip somodevilla getty images
