this is so funny but so infuriating  rep  sheila jackson lee apparently makes it a habit of bumping first class passengers on flights  she might think twice before doing it again after the angry woman she bumped took photos of lee enjoying the seat the passenger paid for  ouch sheila jackson lee  d texas  in seat  the one i paid for dearly  and the one united gave to her without my consent or knowledge  fellow congressman on same flight said she does it repeatedly   united pic twitter com   jean marie simon     december    reports jean marie simon was a passenger on a flight from houston to washington d c  and has accused united airlines of giving her first class seat to u s  rep  sheila jackson lee  d houston  the flight attendant threatened to remove her from the plane for complaining and snapping a photo of the houston congresswoman a mechanical problem with the plane delayed take off and after about  minutes  she said  passengers were invited to consult with a gate agent about alternative flights simon said she went to the front and snapped a photo of jackson lee and told a flight attendant that she knew why she d been bumped in her statement  jackson lee said she overheard simon speaking with an african american flight attendant and saw her snap the photo jackson lee pulls the race card  since this was not any fault of mine  the way the individual continued to act appeared to be  upon reflection  because i was an african american woman  seemingly an easy target along with the african american flight attendant who was very  very nice   jackson lee said in the statement   this saddens me  especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people  but in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart  if it is perceived that i had anything to do with this  i am kind enough to simply say sorry  simon said jackson lee s statement accused her of racism  adding   i had no idea who was in my seat when i complained at the gate that my seat had been given to someone else   she said   there is no way you can see who is in a seat from inside the terminal  passenger threatened about five minutes after simon took the photo on the plane  simon said  another flight attendant sat next her and asked if she  was going to be a problem  simon said she replied that she just wanted to go home is the   voucher evidence of wrongdoing by the airline  what happened when simon arrived at the gate  it was just so completely humiliating   said jean marie simon  a  year old attorney and private school teacher who used   miles on dec   to purchase the first class tickets to take her from washington d c  to guatemala and back home when it came time to board the last leg of her flight home from george bush intercontinental airport on dec    after a roughly hour long weather delay  simon said the gate attendant scanned her paper ticket and told her it was not in the system did you cancel your flight   the attendant asked  no   she said she replied   i just want to go home  her seat    was taken  she was told  simon was given a   voucher and reseated in row   economy plus simon later learned that jackson lee was in her pre purchased seat and has alleged that the congresswoman received preferential treatment  which united denies this entitled mentality will hopefully get jackson lee kicked out of congress
