it really is beginning to seem like some church communities are full of child molesters  then again  those of us not brainwashed by propaganda already knew that  here s another case of two children s lives being ruined by a devout  christian  in a position of authority douglas j  allison is the  year old principal at a small christian school that is an arm of the seventh day adventist church in port angeles  washington  he is one of two teachers  as well as the principal of mountain view christian school  detectives heard the creepy old man confess to raping one of  his young victims   the girls were ten and eleven  respectively   on a taped conversation  he also never tried to say he was not guilty of what he was being accused of when officers arrived at his house to take him away for his horrific crimes  in fact  this monster confessed to raping those little girls again  to the arresting authorities allison is in jail on    bail  and hopefully no one pays it  he is charged with eight counts of molestation and four counts of child rape  detectives are also working with authorities in california  as douglas worked in a school there as well  there are likely more victims of his horrible and gross behavior associate pastor collette pekar says of the situation  we are very  very sad  our congregation is grieving  we love our kids  we love our families  we re praying for complete healing  for complete justice  the thing is  though  this sort of thing is all too common in religious communities  some christian cultures teach complete submission  and those in positions of authority  and often the churches are more concerned about their images and their collection plates than they are about the victims  it s disgusting and despicable  but true  that is why sexual predators are allowed to run rampant in those communities hopefully  these repeated cases of this sort of thing wakes people up  and they stop submitting to these creepy preachers and letting them abuse kids and others watch a video on this case below  via komo featured image via video screen capture
