racism is still very prevalent in america  and not just in the way we usually talk about it  either  perhaps one of the most pervasive forms of racism is in everyday beauty standards  and it was on full display in the comments section of an instagram post by mac cosmetics  the company was promoting a new shade of lipstick  and they used a black model with dark skin and very full lips to promote the lipstick  here is an embed of that post royal romance at  ohnetitelny     macbackstage  nyfwa photo posted by m a c cosmetics   maccosmetics  on feb    at   pstinnocent enough  right  well  not to the racists in the comments section  not long after the post went up  the racist trolls were out in force  mocking the model s lips  here are just a few of the worst comments  before whoever runs mac s instagram account started removing the negativity  courtesy of attn com and  as i said before  those are just a few  the post went viral  with thousands of horrible comments  and mic news editor ashley alese edwards screen capped and tweeted some of the more offensive ones what happens when mac posts a photo of a beautiful black woman s natural lips on instagram pic twitter com   ashley alese edwards   ashleyalese  february    funny thing is  plenty of white women get injections and all sorts of treatments to make their lips look like   gasp    a black woman s natural lips  it s only ugly and repulsive to society when it s displayed on black women  that is what is so sickening about all of this   it s just sheer  unabashed hatred based upon race hopefully  one day  they see the irony behind what they are doing here  somehow  i doubt it  though featured image from screen capture via mac cosmetics instagram
