when donald trump isn t bragging about the size of his d ck  threatening his enemies  spouting horrific racist remarks  attacking easy targets ted cruz and marco rubio  or screaming angrily that prominent religious figures disagree with his bigotry  he falls back on one of his favorite hobbies  enjoying the show as his racist  violent supporters beat people up in his name  it s almost impossible to watch the three ring circus that is a trump rally without seeing his uneducated fans beat someone up for expressing an opinion trump s supporters  favorite targets are rather unsurprising given his massive support among white supremacists  recently  the donald ordered police to remove about  peaceful african american students from one of his rallies just for being there while black  but  of course  things could have been much worse for them  normally  if an african american speaks out against trump at one of his events  he or she is met with violence after an african american man at a rally in birmingham  alabama  stood up for himself and declared that black lives matter just as much as white lives  trump supporters descended on him  punching  kicking  and dragging the man simply because expressed an opinion as well as calling him a  n gger  and other slurs  trump could have denounced this violence and hate  instead  he explained that  maybe he should have been roughed up  one trump supporter  robert kiger  told cnn at the time that the man deserved it because birmingham  alabama  a historical hotbed of kkk activity in which many civil rights battles took place  is  no place for black lives matter to try to bring their issues to the forefront  more recently  a trump fan was discharged from the united states marine corp  for his role in an attack on a black woman at a rally in louisville  kentucky  again  trump responded to the controversy surrounding the regular attacks  in this case  he chose to reference an attack on a new hampshire protester who was one of the few white people his supporters attacked  by telling his supporters it s ok to attack  protesters  the donald called the various beatings protesters receive at the hands of his fans  really amazing to watch   and explained that he was tired of  political correctness    the right wing term for not being a homophobic  racist  misogynist prick   when it came to how dissent is handled at his rallies  when he was interrupted by a protester  he again condoned his supporters  actions  are trump rallies the most fun   he said   we re having a good time   while most would consider an environment where violence is the response to mild dissent an absolute f cking nightmare while most would consider an environment where violence is the response to mild dissent an absolute f cking nightmare  trump and his fans embrace it wholeheartedly watch trump give his supporters permission to attack protesters below featured image via screengrab
