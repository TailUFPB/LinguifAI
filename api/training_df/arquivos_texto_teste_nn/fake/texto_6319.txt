donald trump never runs out of new ways to disgust and offend people  ever since the first day of his presidential campaign  the presumptive republican nominee has created controversial moment after controversial moment   behavior that has unfortunately won over the hearts of america s most racist  bigoted citizens  however  now that he s beat out all of his conservative rivals and has a more clear view of the white house  he wants america to forget all of the ways he s tarnished his chances of appearing presidential  in a recent interview with the washington post  trump tried to reframe a horrific incident that happened last november  in which he made a disgusting mockery of a new york times reporter s physical disability  it was a cringe worthy moment that was heavily circulated  and trump got rightfully blasted for it after it happened   but now  he s trying to deny it  and as expected  any time trump tries to defend himself  he only makes it worse  here s what he said  i would never say anything bad about a person that has a disability  i swear to you it s true   percent true who would do that to  handicapped  i ve spent a lot of money making buildings accessible  is he serious  for trump to act like he makes his buildings accessible for people with disabilities is absolutely ludicrous   because that kind of accessibility is required by law  this is also coming from a guy who posted a picture of himself eating a taco bowl to show how much he  loves hispanics    a particular minority that he has insulted and made racist comments toward during his entire campaign  so obviously  just because trump s buildings are accessible to people with disabilities  that doesn t mean he wouldn t mock or be prejudiced against them but it gets worse  the washington post also reported that after trump bragged about how his buildings were so accessible  trump then satirically reenacted the scene  his arms jerking all around  and said he was trying to show  a guy who grovels    oh  oh  i didn t say that  i didn t say that   that was the imitation i was doing  now  is that a believable story  what an idiot  if you need a refresher  here s the original video where trump made fun of the reporter  watch this  and see if you think trump s latest pathetic excuse for his behavior is  a believable story  corey lewankowski  trump s campaign manager  who physically assaulted a female reporter a few weeks ago  has spoken on trump s effort to rebrand himself  this is deeply personal for mr  trump  he will do anything he can to correct the narrative  he wants to point to specific things that are absolutely false about him and go out and talk about them  well  he s doing a really shitty job so far featured image is a screenshot
