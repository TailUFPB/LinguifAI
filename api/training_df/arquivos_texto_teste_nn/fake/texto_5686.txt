this guy just wants everyone dead pastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church in arizona just does not know how to shut his mouth the day after the orlando mass shooting  anderson praised the  murders and called upon the government to execute all gay people across the nation just this past sunday  anderson repeated his call to execute gay people but added a call to purge any christians who supports the lgbt community and now anderson is calling for reinstating the death penalty against anyone who is tried and convicted of committing adultery  adultery is not a crime in the united states  but anderson called for punishing those who commit it with death in a written manifesto on his blog last week  when someone says that homosexuality is worthy of death according to the bible  people inevitably will bring up other sins that were also punishable by death in the old testament   he wrote   they think they are somehow catching us in hypocrisy  but the truth is  bible believing christians do agree with those other old testament penalties as well we just need to realize that god s laws were the law of the land in those days  today  adultery is not punishable by law in the united states  but it should be  just as he did when he called for executing gay people  anderson laid out his vision of a  righteous government   presumably made up of conservative  christians  who will shred the constitution and replace it with the bible  and said such a government would make adultery a capital crime worthy of arrest and death if convicted by what one can only imagine would be a kangaroo court  this  anderson says  is the way he would prevent adultery and divorce yes  a righteous government would implement the death penalty for those tried and convicted of adultery  we all know normal people who have unfortunately committed this grievous sin  and of course we wouldn t want them to die for it  if we were to somehow vote in a law making adultery illegal  it would not be retroactive it would be the law going forward  and adultery rates would plummet and so would divorce rates  think about it  though  do you really think as many people commit adultery in societies where it is punishable by death  of course not so you can relax about your aunt trudy who cheated on her husband thirty years ago  if aunt trudy had lived in a society that enforced the death penalty for adultery  chances are she would never have committed that sin in the first place indeed  other nations in the world do  in fact  punish adulterers with death  there s only one problem as it turns out  punishing adultery by execution is something that occurs today mostly under islamic law  conservatives like anderson would refer to this as  sharia law   and usually it overwhelmingly punishes women  especially women who have been raped according to the week the un has issued numerous calls to governments to repeal laws that criminalise adultery  arguing that they are predominantly used to discriminate against women   provisions in penal codes often do not treat women and men equally and establish harsher rules and sanctions for women   writes human rights expert frances raday countries governed by islamic law  including saudi arabia  pakistan and somalia  all strictly prohibit  zina   or  fornication outside marriage   prosecutions are common and punishment can include fines  arbitrary detention  imprisonment  flogging and in extreme cases  the death penalty  women are overwhelmingly targeted human rights organisations argue that in several muslim nations  adultery laws are often used against women who have been raped  under such legislation  the burden of proof is on the woman to provide evidence that she was raped  or be prosecuted for adultery in short  what anderson is proposing is a barbaric practice that is mostly practiced in countries that are governed by some form of sharia law and is used primarily to punish women basically  he is calling for the united states to be governed by christian sharia law  you know  the same sharia law that conservatives freak out about and pass laws against anderson concluded his  sermon  by claiming that the death penalty deters crime and shrugged at the notion that people don t want their loved ones executed just because they had an extramarital affair in countries where adultery is still a capital crime  it s not an everyday occurrence and usually ends up in the news  just as capital punishment is a strong deterrent against murder  it has the same effect on other crimes telling us that we would not want people we know and care about to be put to death is a straw man argument  we don t want our friends and family to be convicted of murder either  but they probably won t kill anyone  so we don t worry about it  when the children of israel committed adultery  they knew the risk going in however  it s worth noting that multiple studies by researchers have been unable to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent to crimethe bottom line is that is that anderson is a maniac who wants to bathe america in blood in order to create what he considers the perfect christian utopia  millions upon millions of americans would be murdered in this endeavor if anderson had his way  and that is precisely why conservative  christians  can never be allowed to have power in our government featured
