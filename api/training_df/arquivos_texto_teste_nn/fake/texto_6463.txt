trump s been known to dodge difficult questions during interviews  but what happened monday morning on cnn was pure madness less than a minute after the presumptive republican nominee started his interview with chris cuomo on new day  trump was attacking cuomo and the network  after immediately criticizing the way cuomo was questioning him  trump took aim at cnn  claiming that the network favored democratic frontrunner hillary clinton and purposefully did not air favorable coverage during his campaign this chaos erupted right after cuomo asked trump why he would choose to attack clinton for the actions of her husband  he asked trump  you are attacking hillary clinton for the sexual past and indiscretions of her husband  what is your thinking on this line of attack  well  trump didn t even come close to answering that question  the presidential hopeful got super fiesty with cuomo and snapped   well this is a nice way to start off the interview   in all seriousness  trump threw a temper tantrum and sounded like a child as he continued his pathetic attempt to shame cuomo and cnn  first of all  you should congratulate me for having won the race  i thought  you know  at least there would be a small congratulations but i m not surprised with cnn because that s the way they treat trump  you know  they call it the  clinton network   and i believe that  so  uh  let s start off right there  cuomo fired back and reminded the dense business mogul   i said congratulations the last time we spoke  what followed next was completely unbecoming of a presidential candidate   but perfectly expected from trump  the presidential hopeful bickered with cuomo over what was said and when  and then trump had the nerve to say to the show host  i understand cnn perhaps a lot better than you do  then  continuing his obvious plan to avoid answering cuomo s question about his attacks on clinton and her husband s marital infidelities  trump went on a bizarre rant about pretty much everything except what cuomo asked him  all the while  he continued to attack cnn for not giving him the kind of coverage he wanted  trump said  nor does cnn ever show the crowds  i could be making a speech for an hour and they ll never show the crowds  the interview was completely awkward  but shows perfectly that trump s main strategy for getting through debates and interviews is to distract the interviewer and audience with his hissy fits and over the top bragging  you can watch trump have his meltdown below featured image via john sommers ii   getty images
