one of the many benefits of legalizing the sale of marijuana for recreational use is all the new tax revenue that states are taking in  oregon is now reaping the financial benefits of legalizing the sale of the marijuana  reports show that just after one month  oregon has taken in    million dollars in new tax revenue this is incredible news for the state of oregon  the state initially expected to bring in a total of   million dollars of new tax revenue from marijuana sales   for the entire year  not every county and city in oregon has chosen to allow the sale of marijuana  that means  counties in oregon will receive a share of the tax revenue oregon live reports on some of the details of the state s marijuana tax policy  oregon s medical marijuana stores have been allowed to sell a limited amount of cannabis flowers  as well as starter marijuana plants and seeds  to anyone  and older since last october  the state s temporary  percent tax didn t kick in until jan   that tax will eventually be replaced with one ranging from  percent to  percent once the oregon liquor control commission assumes control over recreational marijuana sales later this year  the legislature set the base tax rate at  percent  but cities and counties may adopt ordinances that add up to  percent more next year  the first full year of sales under the liquor commission  state economists expect recreational cannabis sales to generate    million in tax revenue after the state covers startup costs  that number is expected to climb to    million for the   biennium  other states that have legalized recreational marijuana have received similar tax windfalls  colorado  the first state in the u s  to legalize marijuana  took in   million dollars in taxes and fees in   colorado is pumping most of their new tax dollars into schools and other education initiatives the state of washington raised    million dollars in tax revenue from recreational marijuana in   they are expected to raise more than   billion dollars over four years  this money goes into washington s general fund and to help fund health services of course  marijuana is still illegal on the federal level  so far  the federal government has decided to respect state s marijuana laws  the federal government s attitude towards recreational marijuana can change  for better or worse  depending on the whim of the administration in charge featured image from katheirne hitt via flickr
