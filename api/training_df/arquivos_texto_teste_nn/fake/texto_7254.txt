this is how brussels deals with right wing extremists the march against fear in brussels  belgium kicked off on sunday despite threats from right wingers and a suggestion on saturday that it be postponed due to security concerns the march was planned in the aftermath of terrorist attacks by isis that left over  dead and hundreds injured as a way to fight back against right wing efforts to demonize all muslims and as a way to to stand up to terrorists and say that their attacks will not disrupt our society but as thousands gathered in place de la bourse to pay tribute to those who lost their lives  right wing protesters arrived in an effort to derail the march the hateful protesters harassed muslims with nazi salutes and offensive language until the police had finally had enough at that point  they turned water cannons on the right wingers and chased them up the street as the marchers cheered here s the video via twitter just in  police fire water cannon after tensions rose between protesters near  brussels square  https   t co   msnbc   msnbc  march    the united states  right wing leaders like ted cruz and donald trump have ramped up their bigoted and hateful rhetoric ever since the bombings occurred trump has called for torturing muslims and banning them from entering the country while cruz has called for mass surveillance and police patrols of muslim communities trump s own violent and racist rhetoric has drawn the support of extreme right wing groups such as neo nazis and the kkk republicans even used the attacks to score cheap political points against president obama  who was in the middle of the first trip to cuba by a sitting american commander in chief since calvin coolidge  years ago  they demanded obama drop everything to return home in a panic and lock himself in the situation room of the white house or travel to belgium  either of which would have only made the situation worse instead  president obama remained calm and offered his condolences and support to belgium s prime minister and continued his trip  as right wingers in the united states panicked and let isis control them with fear  obama refused to let the terrorists win perhaps we should think about using water cannons on right wingers  maybe that will cool them off next time they try to use a terrorist attack to spread hate and fear  featured image via screen capture
