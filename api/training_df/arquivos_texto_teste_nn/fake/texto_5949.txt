today  president obama endorsed hillary clinton for president of the united states  the media was abuzz  clinton s campaign website saw a spike in viewership  and sanders supporters started uniting behind the nominee but there was one person who was not impressed  donald j  trump in typical trump fashion  the blowhard republican nominee decided to take to his precious twitter account to bash both president obama and hillary clinton obama just endorsed crooked hillary  he wants four more years of obama but nobody else does   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     who has chided the republican candidate over his sophomoric use of twitter  clearly didn t have time for his crap  so she decided to send a message  a message most americans probably agree with   delete your account  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  june    the twitter world  then one tells another to  delete your account   that usually means the person has said something so incredibly stupid or offensive that they shouldn t have the grace of even being on social media   in trump s case  that s exactly what clinton s implying now the number of retweets doesn t explicitly show who is more favored  but it should be noted trump s cheap  little attack got a mere  thousand rt s while clinton s cool  confident comeback reached over  thousand  and counting    the most on her twitter account but in all seriousness  clinton  who plans a major speech denouncing trump similar to the one she gave last week  is done with his twitter games and is ready to take him on in the general mainstream media is already branding this the beginning of the twitter wars  but some would argue the twitter wars happened when clinton reminded trump of all his stupid comments from the past you literally said all those things  https   t co  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  june    lesson clinton seems to be learning from the  campaign is the use of social media  which the obama campaign used to help usher in a win the message is clear  donald trump is unstable  and he really should delete his account featured image via justin sullivan getty images
