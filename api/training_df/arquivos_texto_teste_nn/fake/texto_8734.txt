the new movie about the attack on the u s  facility in benghazi  libya  is stirring up conservatives and their now legendary hatred of hillary clinton gawker writer christopher hooks went to the premiere of michael bay s  hours at the dallas cowboys stadium in arlington  texas  after interviewing some of the attendees  he came back with a report on the intense clinton hate that the movie had activated  it wasn t pretty certainly  the people who d come to the stadium because they didn t like clinton felt fired up after seeing it   she s a piece of shit   said one man who declined to give his name and didn t make eye contact   but i already knew she s a piece of shit  i hope it defeats hillary   said another  don lochran   they covered the whole thing up   it was lochran who then suggested bombing them all others were less sanguine   oh yeah  i d shoot hillary clinton in the fuckin  head  i don t like the bitch at all   said len toomey  who identified himself as a veteran of desert storm and somalia  he d seen the movie with some vfw friends   choke her  she should be in the pisser and i should be pissin  on her every night  whether you back clinton or not  the abject misogyny and hate that base conservatives have for her is grotesque to behold  about the only thing rivaling it in intensity is their hatred for president obama to many factions of the right   and those are often the same people yelling the loudest for donald trump s white power presidential campaign   the former secretary of state and first lady is the absolute devil incarnate in this go around they erroneously believe she and the president left men to die in benghazi  when in fact real life is not like an action movie and forces were constrained by the reality of time and space in how they could respond  even so  they did eventually get on the scene  something conservatives leave out of their benghazi storytelling  hours is unlikely to change anyone s minds pro or con with clinton  but it at least is serving a purpose in once again putting on display just how hateful the right can be without even trying that hard featured image via paramount pictures
