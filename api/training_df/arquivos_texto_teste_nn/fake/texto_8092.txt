ordinarily we would not celebrate the death of another human being  but some people are just so awful that they make us want to run into the streets and jump for joy when they finally bite the dust  supreme court justice antonin scalia was one of those people  while the republican party is mourning his death  liberals aren t doing any such thing  sure  we feel sympathy for his family because they lost a loved one  but that s where it ends antonin scalia spent his career on the supreme court violating the rights of everyone who was not a white  christian  republican male  not only did he help place george w  bush in the white house in   he also fought against women s rights  voting rights  and lgbt rights   justice scalia was also a racist who believed that african americans are not smart enough to attend elite universities with white students no  we are not saddened by his passing  we are relieved that he will no longer be able to inflict harm on the people of the united states  seriously though  i hope someone did that  doesn t seem very pro life to me  but his decisions rarely were  hahahahaha best day ever  i stand with god  do you  very few   who is clarence going to copy now   omg what s going to happen to him   we have decided that jesus wouldn t like that very much  thankfully  president obama now has the opportunity to replace satan s spawn with a justice who actually supports the constitution and all of its amendments  republicans are going to fight like hell to keep this from happening  because they  like scalia  do not care about this country or its citizens  and this  my friends  is why it is so important that we put our bernie hillary fighting aside and vote for whomever the democratic party picks as our candidate i m going to leave you with this  the truest of all the scalia memes  all images from facebook  twitter  instagram
