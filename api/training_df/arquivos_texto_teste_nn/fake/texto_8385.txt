donald trump is about as a racist as they come  no matter his claims to the contrary  his entire campaign has been a nod to the most vile elements of white supremacy and all manner of bigotry that the bowels of american culture has to offer  after all  he kicked off his circus of a campaign by declaring that  all mexican immigrants are rapists  and later called for a ban on all muslims entering the united states   even those who are citizens but simply traveling abroad these examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to trump s racist rhetoric  and some brilliant person decided to call trump out for what he is in an amazingly brilliant way  by defacing his star on the hollywood walk of fame with a swastika  the vandalism apparently occurred on friday and has since been cleaned up   but not before someone snapped a photo of it and uploaded it to social media site reddit  here is the image via redditwhoever did this deserves a medal  trump s rhetoric is definitely reminiscent of the tone that was the preamble for the horrors that occurred in nazi germany  and it needs to be called out for what it is to the anonymous brave american who did this   sincerely  thank you featured image via video screen capture
