while donald trump may be winning among those taking part in the republican primaries  his method for garnering votes will probably not hold up as well in the general election if he were to be the gop nominee  so far  he s been incredibly racist and xenophobic  not to mention sexist  juvenile and just outright rude  all things that play well with a large part of the republican base  and trump clearly knows this knowing he s getting closer and closer to securing the republican nomination  and knowing hillary clinton is very close to securing the democratic nomination  trump has made a clear pivot to the general election in his campaign strategy  now  instead of making fun of his gop competitors like cruz and kasich  he s putting more energy into making fun of hillary clinton  and i say  making fun    that is literally in the most sophomoric sense it can be taken while in connecticut  trump decided he would imitate the former secretary of state and how she conducts herself with speeches  you know  like an adult   like a person who wants to be president after talking about how many have asked him to be  more presidential   he tells his crowd he simply can t do such a thing  because he needs to rile up and entertain his crowds so they don t fall asleep  then he brings out his new attack line and nickname for clinton and asks the crowd   have you ever seen crooked hillary   then imitates her walking on stage  then he says   hello  how are you  this is crooked hillary clinton   and of course his crowd ate it up  because let s be real  they d be entertained by a paper bag floating in the wind   oooh  so pretty    the imitation wasn t only horrible  it was in horrible taste  trump is a man vying for the highest office in the entire nation and whoever wins the election will be leader of the free world  and he clearly thinks being a vile  misogynistic child is the way to behave to gain people s respect trump doesn t deserve our respect  he deserves our condemnation  and any decent person with half a brain should agree  so  let him perform for his crowd of imbecilic simpletons  the adults who will be deciding the general election will make damn sure he never sets foot in the oval office watch his insane performance here   realdonaldtrump says acting  presidential  is easy  does a hillary clinton impression  https   t co  https   t co   abc news politics   abcpolitics  april    image via video screen capture
