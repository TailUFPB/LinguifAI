lindsey graham  r sc  has been going through an existential crisis over the future of his party for a while   especially now that he s backed presidential candidate ted cruz  who he doesn t believe will stand a chance against democratic frontrunner hillary clinton on thursday  graham went on msnbc to share his thoughts on the election and make a prediction that truly showed how depressed graham has become over the whole thing  the former presidential candidate reluctantly said that republicans would  probably  lose the  election due to the extremely unlikeable qualities of leading gop candidates donald trump and ted cruz graham had backed cruz after ending his own campaign for gop nomination  clearly because the texas senator was the only alternative to trump  graham made it perfectly clear that the endorsement didn t mean that he suddenly liked cruz  a man that graham previously joked about murdering  not to mention that earlier this year  graham said that choosing between trump and cruz was like being shot or poisoned  what does it really matter  but now  graham seems like he s accepted the fact that the democrats have the  race in the bag  during the interview  he said  we can lose in  and probably will  here s my concern  trump gets wiped out  ted  i don t know if he can beat hillary clinton or not but at least we ve got a fighting chance if trump is the standard bearer  it s not about   it s about losing the heart and soul of the conservative movement  i m not going to stand behind a guy that gets david duke s support  you can watch graham resign all hope in the video below   lindseygrahamsc  we could lose in  and we probably will https   t co   morning joe   morningjoe  march    reason graham is feeling so hopeless is that he knows he s right  both trump and cruz are extremely polarizing to voters  ted cruz has an uncanny ability to make most people   whether politicians  family members or voting americans   hate him  which might be linked to the way his face looks   and trump tends to turn many gop voters off for his vulgar language and constant flip flopping on policies  both of these candidates are an embarrassment to the republican party  and graham was dead on when he said it would take generations  for the gop to recover from this election cycle  featured image via getty images
