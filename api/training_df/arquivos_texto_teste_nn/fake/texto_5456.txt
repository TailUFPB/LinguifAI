it s like a day doesn t go by without some backwoods  right wing jackass threatening the life of the president donald baker of the anchorage fire department was suspended after issuing threats to the president on social media  the controversy began when a reader sent a screenshot of the remark to   under an article titled obama hijacks memorial with sick message   apparently from right wing garbage pile america s freedom fighters   baker wrote that someone should  please put a bullet in this f cker s head   referring to  worthless piece of sh t  obama when the station contacted baker s employer  an investigation was launched  chief william rockwood confirmed on thursday that the post was being investigated  and that he had suspended baker while he determines if the department s social media policy was violated by this direct threat to the president  the anchorage fire protection district finds this post extremely troubling and inappropriate  the district does not condone or allow the use of inappropriate conduct or language by its employees in person or through instant technology  sadly  baker is finding a lot of support on  s facebook page    some of his more vocal supporters have their own thoughts on the president   perhaps it s time for the secret service to pay mr  baker a visit  all too often we see threats against the president go completely unanswered   a dangerous thing when right wing terrorism is on the rise at minimum  baker should definitely lose his job  after all  can he really be trusted to do his job to the best of his ability if he pulls up to a fire at a house with democratic political signs in the yard  how deep does his bigotry go  does it extend to all african americans  we are still awaiting the results of the  investigation   but hopefully the department does the right thing  free speech is important  but it can and does have consequences featured image via screengrab
