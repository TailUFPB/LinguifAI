after tuesday s semi coronation of donald trump as the republican nominee  a lot of people  both liberal and conservative  took to social media to hyperventilate over the impending disaster of trump winning the  election donald trump is never going to be president of the united states  ever  hillary clinton is going to be the democratic nominee and she s going to mop the floor with him here are a few facts to consider there s more but you get the idea  trump is toxic in every way imaginable  his message of hate combined with pretending to care about the middle class will not scale up to the national level despite what you may hear  hillary is actually a strong candidate  as a former first lady  former senator and former secretary of state that s spent her entire adult life fighting for one liberal cause or another  women s rights  universal healthcare  lgbt rights  etc    hillary clinton is insanely prepared and qualified to be president  she s also smart  really smart  obama smart  run circles around donald trump smart whether you like her or not  you cannot deny that hillary clinton has strong grasp on the issues  she can rattle off facts and figures faster than most people can google them  she has detailed plans that she is more than happy to explain at great length if you want  compare that to trump s   grade grammar and flimsy grasp of any issue and you re looking at a series of debates that will be humiliating for  the don  something else to to consider is that while the gop was hampered in its ability to attack trump  the left will be under no such constraints  there are hours and hours of footage of donald trump saying horrible things about pretty much every group of americans that are not white men  the ads write themselves and trump s hate only sells with his chunk of the gop s already racist base  hillary will have an embarrassment of riches to choose from  added bonus  she won t even have to play dirty to do it  while hillary is no stranger to a down and dirty political fight  something else that will serve her well as president   she can take the moral high ground and let trump fling mud at himself another useful clinton fact is that she is the single most scrutinized and vetted politician on the planet  yeah  yeah  yeah  she s  untrustworthy  and a  crook  but when you ask the people saying that what crime she s committed  you get vague comments about her emails or something about taking bribes as secretary of state  they can t produce any evidence but  darn it  they know she s guilty of  something but after   years of republicans spending an unlimited amount of resources  manpower and time into digging up dirt on her  hillary has yet to have a scandal stick  the  liberal  media has been trying to claim her scalp for just as long and have failed miserably  these are the people that uncovered some of the deepest  darkest secrets of the united states government but the best they could come up with on clinton was rumors and innuendo i don t know about you  but that suggests that maybe  just maybe  there s no real scandal to dig up  and let s be honest  the right has tried so hard  for so long  to pin something  anything  on her that the public has been inured to it by now  they overplayed their benghazi hand so badly that it stopped being a campaign issue right when they needed it the most  the same thing will happen for all of their new  scandals   they ll rush them out  the  liberal  media will breathlessly report them as total fact and then the  scandal  will crumble  rinse  repeat it didn t work on obama and the public isn t biting anymore and finally  this is what the electoral map looks like right now according to statistics genius nate silver and it s only going to get bluer the more both clinton and trump speak this doesn t mean we should get complacent  quite the opposite  in fact  we have an unparalleled opportunity to take back the house  the senate and several state governments  trump will both energize the blue vote and seriously suppress the red vote and we should be swarming the polls to take back the country from the tea party idiots that made trump the nominee in the first place stay calm and vote blue featured image via twitter
