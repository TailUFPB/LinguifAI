donald trump s spokeswoman katrina pierson went on national television to try and validate and justify trump s comments about muslims hating americans  this time however  she was schooled by muslim journalist dean obeidallah during the interview  pierson labeled the  culture  of islam as the problem and referenced polls in some muslim countries that showed a distaste for america  however  obeidallah pointed out that her information is misleading because indonesia  which is the largest muslim country in the world  has a more favorable view of the united states than germany and if a muslim country has an unfavorable view of america  it s because of u s  foreign policy and not some congenital hatred for the united states for example  pierson cited that polls show that the palestinian territories  the majority of whose inhabitants are muslim  have an unfavorable view of the united states  while this is true  it s because when palestinian civilians are tear gassed  gunned down in the streets  or bombed from the air  it s with us made weapons it gives to israel  if the palestinians were majority christian or jewish  they would still have an unfavorable view of the united states watch here obeidallah also fired back at pierson and trump s idiocy by pointing to trump s business dealings in muslim countries  he said  let s be honest  donald trump says here in america  islam hates us  then he goes to dubai and does multi million dollar business deals  donald trump loves muslims when he s making money with them  he loves you when he s making money and demonizes you when he s getting votes  he s a despicable hypocrite  a special kind of hypocrite  there are many more proud and capable muslim americans like dean obeidallah in the united states and it would be great if we continue to see them on national television to rip apart the racists in our midst  featured image via video screenshot
