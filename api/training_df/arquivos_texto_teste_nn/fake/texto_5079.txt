did you know that there are two words muslims are not allowed to use  well  according to  christian  conservatives  there are  the words  god  and  greatest   especially together in a sentence   as was demonstrated by christians at a california catholic church throwing themselves into a panic when a group of three muslim gentlemen shouted  allahu akbar  that phrase  sometimes shouted by religious terrorists who speak arabic  simply means  god is the greatest  this or  jesus is lord  would be the exact thing shouted by some christian extremists in america today  as an atheist  i personally find neither phrase alarming  both muslims and christians  as well as jews  worship the same god  and it doesn t matter in which language someone offers praise that being said  these particular muslim men shouted  allahu akbar  into an oh so dangerous megaphone   exactly as christian street preachers can be seen doing on a regular basis  just in a different language  however  some  christian  extremists simply show up at mosques with guns  the unidentified muslims pulled up in front of st  andrew orthodox church in riverside  california  on public property  and shouted  allahu akbar  a few times before driving off  this was a completely harmless encounter with no weapons involved  and they were simply sharing the christians message   god is the greatest  but fox news reports they said the phrase  maliciously   as though they do not praise the same god in their own religion  nevertheless  these men are muslim  so panic ensued  via fox news  allahu akbar   the unidentified man repeated several times as the unnerved parents drew their infants close and exchanged worried glances witnesses were able to give riverside police a description of the green honda civic  but not of the three occupants  some told police they believed one or more of the men may have been taking photographs  according to officer ryan railsback  although trenham insisted multiple congregants heard the arabic phrase  railsback noted no mention of it was in the police report whatever the case  no law was broken   even if an unmistakable message was sent and received this completely harmless incident that even fox news had to admit was not a criminal act prompted the  christians  to increase security  and they want the muslim men to  repent  for saying  god is the greatest  be calm and to keep a special vigilance over the property and our children while we are at church   trenham wrote in an email to parishioners  pray that these provocative young men might repent of their intimidation and be saved   he says that the situation   the situation  once again  being that some muslims said  god is the greatest  at a church   is  tense and tenuous  and has vowed to keep new church security officers on hand for all regular services  yes  those two words were so dangerous that they think they need security   it is a deep sorrow to live this way in the  new america  trenham told fox jim hoft  head honcho at gateway pundit and architect of the  michael brown fractured darren wilson s eye socket  lie and many others  decided to portray the incident as such no  you re not suffering from anything and if you need your eyes checked it has nothing to do with this  he actually portrayed the phrase  god is the greatest  as a  threat   just to add to the drama  muslims is in allcaps  hoft s readers were more than happy to heap more hate on the manure pile             this was a brilliant move on the part of the muslim men  all they had to do was repeat a common christian message in arabic  and the bigots quickly revealed themselves for who they are  was it a bit immature  sure  but it was effective featured image via screengrab
