it s hard to believe  but donald trump does have a sizable amount of supporters who agree with his ideas on immigration and guns  unsurprisingly  one of those people is ann coulter  a racist in her own regard  she falls perfectly into trump s fan base after the shooting massacre at a gay nightclub in orlando  florida  coulter tweeted out  to my gay friends  please consider the possibility that hillary s immigration policies might get you killed  see trump s speech today  to my gay friends  please consider the possibility that hillary s immigration policies might get you killed  see trump s speech today   ann coulter   anncoulter  june     first  what gay person would be her friend  and before you get offended in any regard to that question  you know who you are  i m a lesbian and find coulter repulsive on every level  which leads to the bigger question  what person  in general  would be her friend during his speech  trump of course spent time doubling down on his racist and islamophobic remarks that muslims should be banned from immigrating to the united states does coulter  and trump  not even recognize the fact that the shooter  whose name i ll never mention  because that s what he wanted  was actually born in the united states  and was able to access his arsenal of weaponry and ammunition because of florida s  and the united states  lax gun laws  just like almost every shooter before him  and the only way to truly combat this sort of issue is to try to prevent them from happening in the first place you can t always change a mindset  but you sure as hell can try to prevent a potential terrorist from owning a gun the thing is  this is just ann coulter being ann coulter  she s a bigot and she s proud to be a bigot  and she doesn t care if you think she s a bigot  she s an isolationist who seems to think white people should reign supreme it s just amusing to think that she wants us to believe she has gay friends  if  however  she really does have gay friends  they should probably realize they re friends with a bigot featured photo by frederick m  brown getty images   twitter
