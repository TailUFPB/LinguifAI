if this keeps up there won t be enough republicans left to justify the existence of the party utah gop state senator mark madsen attended the republican national convention last week and witnessed his state make every effort to keep donald trump from becoming the nominee  but they failed  and trump gave a gloom and doom acceptance speech formally making him the leader of a party coming apart at the seams in the wake of the disappointing convention  madsen decided that the time was right to bolt from the republican party because  every decision and inclination i had before was reinforced  although madsen claims that trump s nomination isn t what ultimately changed his mind  it s kind of hard to believe that it wasn t a factor  after all  the longtime utah republican has concerns about trump s inexperience in fact  madsen bizarrely claimed that he is leaving the party because it is somehow too progressive  therefore  he has decided to join the libertarian party  which apparently frowns upon progress he also said the republican party  makes me want to cry because i ve invested a lot in that party  libertarian party chairman nicholas sarwark did not refrain from bashing the republican party and said that the reality clown show is what is causing many republican lawmakers to abandon ship  after the disaster that we saw in cleveland  in which a party that was once storied has nominated a reality show star for president  where the convention chairman s cutting off the microphone of a sitting u s  senator  it s broken   sarwark said   it s fundamentally broken and it s dying  even madsen s own wife is voting against the republican party and she also had no problem blaming the convention for her decision  that was my tribe   erin madsen said   that was my people    i believed deeply in what i thought the republican party believed  but after having gone to the convention in cleveland  i don t think that s my tribe anymore  they don t believe what i believe  and you re going to think this is crazy but it s like a death in the family for me  it breaks my heart  here s video of madsen announcing his switch via youtube last week  a lifelong texas republican formally resigned from the republican party by writing an epic resignation letter that went viral  i will not contribute my name  my work  or my character to an utterly indefensible cause   chris ladd wrote after being a republican for the last  years   no sensible adult demands moral purity from a political party  but conscience is meaningless without constraints  a party willing to lend its collective capital to donald trump has entered a compromise beyond any credible threshold of legitimacy  there is no redemption in being one of the  good nazis  donald trump is the poison pill that republicans forced themselves to swallow so they really shouldn t be surprised that their party is dying featured image via john sommers ii getty images
