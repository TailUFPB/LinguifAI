just when we thought that sarah palin was out of our lives  she seems to have found a way to creep back in  the self described conservative and the vice presidential running mate of republican senator john mccain in  was asked whether she would be presumptive republican nominee donald trump s running mate  palin said that she would be ready to serve but she worried about being a  burden  to the presumptive nominee  palin said  i think i m pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted  i think there are so many other great people out there in american that could serve in this position i think if somebody wanted to choose me  they already know who i am  what i stand for  they wouldn t be in for any surprises palin did acknowledge that she came with lots of baggage  she said  i want to help and not hurt  and i am such a realist that i realize there are a whole lot of people out there who say   anybody but palin   i wouldn t want to be a burden on the ticket and i recognize that in many  many eyes  i would be that burden  so  you know  i just want the guy to win  i want america to win  burden  is an understatement  a trump palin ticket already sounds like a clown show but the thought of a trump palin presidency is a terrifying prospect for america  as president obama has warned  the presidency is not reality television or entertainment  it s the most powerful position in the world where important decisions must be made  trump and palin do not qualify to hold these positions watch video here featured image via video screenshot
