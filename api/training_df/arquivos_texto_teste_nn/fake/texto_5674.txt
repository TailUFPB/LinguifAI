a struggling mom sent an email to all  of mississippi s lawmakers asking for help getting insulin and an insulin pump for her diabetic daughter  this was after she called  suppliers  trying to find one that would take medicaid following her former supplier s move out of medicaid s network  her daughter has type  diabetes  and needs six to ten insulin injections per day just to live nicole nichols  was flabbergasted  when she received this response from state representative jeffrey guice  i am sorry for your problem  have you thought about buying the supplies with money that you earn  wow  a struggling mom gets desperate and emails her lawmakers for help  and she gets slapped down with a horrifically insensitive reply from someone who doesn t know squat about her or her family  guice is the perfect example of what s wrong with the gop  the bootstraps crowd over there has a very limited understanding of these things guice issued an apology for his terrible response  which actually just reinforces the fact that he doesn t care about anyone outside his little bubble  i realize my remarks to mrs  nichols were completely insensitive and out of line i am sorry and deeply regret my reply  i know nothing about her and her family and replied in knee jerk fashion  i d like to think the people of mississippi and my constituents know that i m willing to help where i am able  i replied in knee jerk fashion   that s basically an admission that he thinks anyone receiving government aid is a lazy good for nothing living high on the hog off of the backs of hardworking taxpayers  that s what the entire gop thinks about people on aid  what an obtuse piece of flotsam nichols told her story to the clarion ledger  going into more detail in a video about her situation and why she needs these supplies nichols is a stay at home mom  but her husband works two jobs to provide for their family of four  the insulin pump  which her daughter needs to avoid having to go through six to ten injections every day  is     the insulin itself can run as much as   per month  struggling families can t afford that  and no amount of  get a job  is going to change that nichols actually did receive two other replies  both of which were sympathetic to her situation  thankfully  people like guice aren t calling the shots here  nichols posted about this on her facebook page  prompting a barrage of outraged comments from people who read it  mississippi medicaid saw her post  actually had some compassion  and reached out to nichols about this very situation guice  and the rest of the gop  are heartless brutes  he might regret his comments  but the fact that he even made them shows that he s just another one of those who thinks everyone should just magically grow bootstraps with which to pull themselves up featured image via screen capture from embedded video
