in a desperate bid to normalize the republican party s insane stance on keeping scalia s seat on the supreme court empty  a new talking point is being tried out by conservatives  there s no time limit in the constitution  and there s nothing magical about there being nine justices   reuter said during a panel meeting at the conservative political action conference  cpac   the country started out with six justices  we ve had as many as ten at some point in time   he continued   as recently as   when justice elena kagan came on the court  she had been solicitor general so she recused herself in over a third of the cases  so  i don t see a sense of urgency  i fully expect this to be repeated over and over again and eventually mimicked by the corporate media  if there s one thing besides crippling america that the gop is really good at  it s making their sabotage seem perfectly normal  the corporate media is always a willing accomplice to this charade as they will tie themselves into knots to avoid calling out the historic extremism of the right a side benefit of using this kind of rhetoric to keep the  seat empty for so long is that when a democrat wins in november  they ll already have normalized a reduced court  it s like stacking the court  adding seats to dilute the power of one set of justices  but in reverse on the flip side  if republicans were to somehow win in november  i wouldn t be at all surprised if they suddenly  realized  that  justices just aren t enough and we really should have    of whom would just happen to be conservative  for a group that calls themselves  conservatives   ostensibly the party that preserves the status quo  the american right wing has zero interest in preserving tradition  precedent or the constitution  they re only interested in preserving their own power at any expense featured image via rational politics
