a tennessee man did what thousands of ammosexuals across the nation do on a regular basis   paranoid that someone somewhere is out to get him  he brought an assault rifle and a loaded handgun with him to church on easter sunday the nra regularly urges gun owners to  be vigilant  and ready to stand up to any and all threats   real or perceived   in the great nation of amerikastan  citing unspecified and mostly nonexistent threats  the second amendment warriors say that ammosexuals should pack heat wherever they go   just in case a  bad guy with a gun  shows his dirty  rotten  face  unfortunately  far too many people fall for the right wing group s propaganda   and one such man is marcus donald    of memphis donald was arrested on sunday after he attempted to enter easter services at a baptist church  like many scared white men across the nation  donald came to church locked and loaded  for years  the baptist church has been  pointing people to christ with gun giveaways and calls for congregations to arm themselves  while donald s decision to show up to church armed to the teeth would normally be celebrated  there was one problem   his skin color aside from the obvious exterior features   donald is black   he seems like the typical nra acolyte  but that didn t stop police from showing up to arrest him  the man came to church with  a loaded  caliber beretta in the pocket of his pants and a  blackout assault rifle in a backpack   according to police  upon his arrest  he told law enforcement that people in society are a threat to him and that he must be vigilant  if donald had been white  he would have been permitted to walk straight into the church and endanger the   people present   but a security guard stopped and disarmed him before he had a chance to make it through the doors  we are thankful for the diligence of  our  security and the memphis police department   jim barnwell  bellevue baptist church  director of communication services  told fox   this is a photo of barnwell  what were the man s intentions  we don t know   he said  a question that would likely have not been asked with regard to a white man   we are thankful for our security people  what a great job that they do  donald  like many people on the right should be when they carry an assault rifle around town  to the grocery store  to church  or anywhere else where guns are not appropriate  was taken in for  emergency commitment  despite that tennessee state law allows guns inside churches unless that property is being used for a school event or if signs are posted that weapons are banned  the only time a mentally ill person can be taken into custody solely for being mentally   according to the crisis intervention team at the university of memphis barnwell says he is unaware if the church has a policy against guns  but his staff was very quick to call police when they saw a scary black man with a gun even though there was nothing aside from donald s decision to carry loaded weapons around  once again  something crazy crackers do all the time  to indicate he is mentally ill police say he may not be cited for carrying the weapons around if he had a valid permit   but it is interesting that he was accosted by police at all  while this should be the standard reaction whenever anyone runs around with loaded firearms  it s not  had donald been white  it would have just been another sunday at church apparently  the second amendment simply does not apply to people like donald  who fail to pass the racial litmus test watch a report on the arrest below featured image via screengrab
