saturday afternoon  a group of protesters gathered on the main road leading into fountain hills  the location of donald trump s latest hatefest  and set up a  quarrantine  of the rally  traffic was backed up for miles as the demonstrators peacefully protested the rally   but many trump fans were displeased that people chose to act in opposition to their leader s wishes on social media  some fanatical supporters of the donald called for the protesters to be  tear gassed and shot   while others had another idea    run them over   some even began inquiring as to the legality of pancaking peaceful demonstrators with one s car  while it might seem unbelievable that someone would take these insane fringe nuts up on their suggestion wkbw reports that one jeep driving trump fan wanted to get to the rally so badly that he plowed into the protesters  with his vehicle video of the scene shows the unnamed driver pushing his way through the crowd with zero regard for the safety of the human beings in front of his vehicle  the demonstrators can be seen moving out of the way  some obviously panicked  while others attempt to stop their assailant from moving any further it might be expected that the police who were present would wish to stop the driver  but they can clearly be seen on the video providing an escort  even shoving around people who are attempting to stop the driver whose appointment with trump was more important than the safety of the demonstrators fortunately  no one was injured  though this incident makes it clear that the cops were there for one purpose  to protect donald trump rather than the people in   a vehicle moving at a similar speed plowed through a crowd of michael brown supporters  while it was not moving quickly  one protester s leg became trapped by the wheel and she was dragged at least  feet before she was able to free herself  like the operator of this jeep  the driver kept going with zero regard for the assembled crowd it is unclear why police chose not to intervene  but it is noteworthy that law enforcement reaction to the protest is managed by anti hispanic bigot  sheriff joe arpaio  who recently endorsed the donald  is it any wonder that his men did not care about the safety of anyone who was not there to worship trump watch the video below featured image via screengrab
