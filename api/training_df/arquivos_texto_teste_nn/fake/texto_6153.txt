what is the price of one s dignity  florida senator marco rubio recently found himself wrestling with that question and came up with the answer  i d exchange it for nothing  just as long as i get  more minutes in the spotlight   donald trump obliged having just months ago described trump as a small dick lunatic con artist  remember how insane the republican primary was    rubio knelt down and kissed the ring this week  on twitter  he officially endorsed trump in the most roundabout way possible in florida only  legitimate candidates on ballot in nov  i wont vote for clinton   i after years of asking people to vote i wont abstain   marco rubio   marcorubio  may    s the kind of spineless politician who won t abstain from voting for trump  a guy whose rallies he once colorfully described as  a frightening  grotesque  and disturbing development in american politics   he s voting for that guy the day before  rubio said he would give trump a more ringing endorsement if he let him speak at the republican national convention this summer  at one point  rubio was poised to be the republican nominee  now he s reduced to begging trump to let him share the same stage apart from the promise of a few  rubio endorses trump  headlines  it s baffling to think of why rubio decided to sell out  and so quickly  the washington examiner  a right wing publication no less  blasted rubio for his shamelessness it s one thing to begrudgingly argue that as dangerous as he thinks a trump presidency would be  that he thinks a clinton presidency would be even worse  but to actually say that he would be  honored  by the chance to speak on trump s behalf at the gop convention  and to downplay his previously stated problems with trump as mere  policy differences   is to prove the rubio skeptics right that is  far from being an inspirational moral leader  rubio has shown himself to be more of an opportunistic politician with his finger to the wind the major problem  supporting trump is almost sure to backfire  in the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown coming in november  those closest to trump are going to be fatally radioactive  in chernobyl they were referred to as the  walking ghosts   already doomed but still alive  in november  they ll just be called  trump s supporters   rubio  who is retiring from the senate at the end of his term  he hardly bothered to work there anyway   is reportedly having second thoughts  he may see throwing himself at the feet of trump as one way to get his hat back in the ring if he decides to run again it s a bad miscalculation  trump may seem popular to the guy who just got absolutely smoked by him in the primary  but the american people still actively loathe trump  new jersey governor chris christie learned that lesson the hard way  already unpopular  a recent poll found that after he announced he would be serving as trump s campaign jester  a whopping  percent of new jersey voters said they  dislike everything about gov  christie   as polling questions go  that s about the sickest burn imaginable the internet was quick to reminder rubio of the fate he just chose for himself  marcorubio so you ll vote for a guy you called a con artist  a guy you called a lunatic  a guy you called unfit to be president   sellout  raj chudgar     may    tricking rubio into a senate loss that would permanently end his career would be the universe s way of making a case that karma exists  lolgop   lolgop  may    on how rubio has  further  diminished himself in the last  hours  maybe trump s nickname was apt  after all   jon ralston   ralstonreports  may    think ted cruz will rise to run another day  marco rubio will not  https   t co   jamelle bouie   jbouie  may    rubio   i will help donald trump get elected  yes  he s a crazy  unstable con man  but i love the gop more than i love america    top conservative cat   teapartycat  may    s almost as if opportunistically attaching yourself to a lying  sexist  islamophobic blowhard who once derisively called you  little marco  makes you look bad  who knew featured image via joe raedle getty images
