it s no secret that the comedic host of hbo s real time  bill maher  is no fan of religion  in fact  it s safe to say that he really pretty much hates the practice  he is one of america s most outspoken celebrity atheists  and friday night s edition of his show saw him once again ripping religion for the amusement of his largely secular audience  what maher had to say this time  though  wasn t just making fun of people who believe in god s   he actually called for the internal revenue service to make these institutions pay taxes during his  new rules  segment  maher began  why  in heaven s name  don t we tax religion  a sexist  homophobic magic act that s been used to justify everything from genital mutilation to genocide  you want to raise the tax on tobacco so kids don t get cancer  ok  but let s put one on sunday school so they don t get stupid  maher went on to say that the fact these churches owned billions in property got him  quote   hopping mad   he also pointed out something that likely has most religious people either panicking or in complete denial  religious belief is largely on the decline in the united states  which is traditionally seen as the most religious country in the developed western world  in fact  the youngest generation of americans   millennials   largely not only aren t actively religious  but they are uncomfortable with most mainstream religion  mostly due to the homophobia  misogyny  and other harmful ideas and practices therein maher continued on his rant  almost a quarter of us are being forced to subsidize a myth that we re not buying into  why am i subsidizing their sunday morning hobby  they don t subsidize mine  after that brilliant closer  maher flashed a photo of himself getting high with a friend on what is presumably one sunday morning the thing is  bill maher is right  we shouldn t be subsidizing churches  these people push all kinds of horrible things  including lobbying  at least indirectly  to enshrine bigotry into law against people they believe to be  sinners   our tax dollars should not be spent to uphold religion  people can believe what they like  but the rest of us shouldn t be paying for it thank you  mr  maher  for another hilariously brilliant   and oh so true   monologue on the truth about the tax free status of america s religious institutions watch the video below  via raw story https   youtu be  image via video screen capture
