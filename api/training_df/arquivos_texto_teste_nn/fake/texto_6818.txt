michigan governor rick snyder was thirsty to prove that the water in flint is safe to drink  so he drank it and promised to drink more  but rachel maddow had some bad news to share in response to an open invitation to drink some of the water he himself had declared poisoned after ignoring the man made travesty for a year or more  the republican told a reporter   yeah  i mean if someone  i m happy to look into that  but snyder didn t exactly look happy about the prospect of voluntarily drinking tainted water that could make him seriously ill as he turned away  so  after many tests of the tap water in one home  snyder took a drink and claimed to like it so much that he would keep drinking it for  days though it is not known how flint residents will be able to verify that the three gallons he took with him is the same water he ll be drinking  i completely understand why some flint residents are hesitant to drink the water and i am hopeful i can alleviate some of the skepticism and mistrust by putting words to action   snyder declared after drinking the water   flint residents made it clear that they would like to see me personally drink the water  so today i am fulfilling that request  and i will continue drinking flint water at work and at home for at least  days  flint residents certainly are not buying into the act  not only should he and his wife drink it  they say  his whole family should drink it as well as bathe in it and cook with it indeed  that s what flint residents were forced to do for a long time before state officials finally acknowledged that the water supply was poisoned and began to do something about it  it could have been avoided had republicans not switched the city s water supply from lake huron to the flint river  which has been contaminated for decades as a matter of public record and because state officials allowed the tragedy to unfold  thousands of children now face future health issues due to the high levels of lead in the water but rachel maddow had some news for snyder  he may have made sure that the tap water he was drinking was safe before ever taking a sip  but that doesn t mean it wasn t poisoned when he finally got around to drinking it  as best as we can tell  that house where governor snyder drank this water through the filter today  it s been tested for lead several times in recent months   maddow said  the federal danger threshold for lead is  parts per billion   she continued  however  a test conducted on march   just over a month ago  revealed levels of  parts per billion   more than  times above the federal threshold   maddow pointed out  so careful governor  i hope it was a good lead day at that house when you filled up those jugs  here s the video via youtube make no mistake  despite his attempt to make flint residents feel better  snyder and other state officials should be sitting in a jail cell right now awaiting prosecution for all the lives they have ruined by their irresponsible management of flint and the city s water supply  they literally put saving money above public health and safety and that is unforgivable featured image via screen capture
