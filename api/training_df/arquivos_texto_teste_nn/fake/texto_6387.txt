patrick stewart despises donald trump so much that he had to make himself feel better by paying a guy to not vote for him the actor most known as captain picard in star trek  the next generation and the x men film franchise was in new orleans earlier this week and spotted a homeless man holding up a sign stating that in exchange for   he would not vote for trump not only did stewart give him    he gave him four more dollars on top of that for extra measure  made me forget the humidity for a moment  worth  bucks   stewart wrote on twitter complete with an image of the man and his sign made me forget the humidity for a moment  worth  bucks  pic twitter com   patrick stewart   sirpatstew  may    isn t the first time stewart has slammed donald trump  just week ago  he expressed to vice that he can t believe anyone takes trump and his  antics  seriously  well  of course  we had no idea that dreadful trump would be up to these antics that he is up to now  and i call them  antics  because how could they possibly be taken seriously  stewart made the remarks in response to being asked how donald trump s extremism and support among white supremacist groups makes his latest film green room  in which stewart portrays a neo nazi  timely clearly  patrick stewart is not a donald trump supporter  and who can blame him donald trump is the scariest political candidate in the presidential race and the fact that a man with strong support from white supremacists and other racist hate groups could very well end up becoming the leader of the free world is a nightmare all too close to turning into reality faced with this kind of person in office  perhaps we should all give five dollars to people to keep them from voting for trump featured image via wikimedia
