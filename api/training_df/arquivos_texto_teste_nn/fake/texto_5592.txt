donald trump held a campaign rally in raleigh  north carolina on tuesday night and once again his habit of simply saying what s on his mind led him to step in it  he decided that  while discussing terrorism  to praise a man once called  the butcher of baghdad   saddam hussein sweet moses  pic twitter com   jim weber   jimmweber  july    conceding that hussein was  a bad guy   trump praised him for killing terrorists  a job he did  well  apparently citing a middle eastern dictator as his model for combating international terrorism  trump went on to praise iraq under hussein s iron fisted rule as a nation that didn t bother with reading rights to accused suspects moving forward to the current time  trump said that iraq in  was  like harvard  for terrorists  like many of his other speeches outside of those delivered with a teleprompter  it didn t make much sense when saddam hussein was captured by the u s  after the invasion of iraq  he was put on trial and accused of the murder of  people  torture of women and children  and with illegally arresting at least  people  he was found guilty of crimes against humanity  and was sentenced to death and hanged trump has consistently made a mess of speaking about terrorism  arguing for waterboarding  which military experts say is a useless tool for extracting information and is considered torture under the geneva conventions  and for engaging in the barbaric practice of murdering the families of terrorists  even if they had nothing to do with terrorist acts the republican nominee has also played fast and loose with the facts on terrorism  blaming the orlando attack on syrian refugees when the shooter was a natural born american citizen  trump has also been at the head of the line on the right that has blamed all terrorism on muslims  and called for a ban on muslim travel to the united states and a system to track muslims within the united states trump s supporters have cheered on his advocacy of big brother  fascist policies  with some going so far as to refer to trump as  daddy   for the paternalistic world view he has offered many of them who are skeptical of a black president in reality  president obama has had more senior leadership within terror networks like al qaeda and isis targeted and killed during his tenure than his predecessor  in obama s time as commander in chief  american forces killed osama bin laden and taliban leader mullah akhtar muhammad mansour featured image via twitter
