for the entirety of the last week  there has been an endless string of politicians and pundits filling the internet and airwaves with accusations that the black lives matter movement has created a negative view of police officers across the united states  even president obama scolded social media commentators  asking those that communicate there to not give into over generalizations about the police oddly enough  those same people have been very quiet about the extremely racist rhetoric coming from both police officers and their supporters  whatever that means  take for example this extremely racist and inappropriate post that the texas sheriff s deputies facebook page shared just after the shooting in dallas  texas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers this isn t an over generalization  it isn t just a funny post that was posted by those  trying to find humor to cope with stress  hurt  and anger  as one of the admins claims  it is an incredibly racist  inappropriate  and misinformed image macro  during a time when racial tensions in the united states are at a boiling point  when people are seriously concerned there is going to be a full blown race war  a pro cop page shares something like this  there are a plethora of examples of police officers  saying  writing  and sharing racist things on the internet or elsewhere police officers and their supporters need to think twice about what they post online  there is no justification for this type of  humor  ever   but especially right now in this precarious time  one cannot support or be a good cop and support inflammatory racist messaging like this  right now  more than ever  police officers need to take a cue from homeland security   if you see something  say something featured image from screenshots
