the late show with stephen colbert had a very special guest on to celebrate mlk day   black lives matter activist deray mckesson  nothing could be more appropriate  and the two sat down and talked about something about   of white people refuse to talk about  race the conversation began with colbert s telling mckesson of the reaction to his wearing a  black lives matter  bracelet on the air  he says that with the way his white counterparts acted   you would have thought i d slapped a baby  mckesson s frank response was  of course  spot on  i think that people are uncomfortable talking about the racist history of this country and what we need to do to undo the impact of racism  people would just like to act like we don t have a legacy of racism here  i think people get really uncomfortable with it  but we know that we can t change it unless we address it  right  he went on to remind colbert and the audience what most of us have known all along  that the  all lives matter  crowd just want to distract from speaking about the real issues surrounding race  if  all lives matter  was true  we wouldn t have to be out in the streets  the police have killed  people just in   indeed  mckesson then addressed the  blue code of silence   which everyone is aware of  cops don t squeal on cops   even if it means covering up murder  across the country it has been so similar  we know that it s not just isolated events  it is actually a systemic problem  he also reminded everyone of the responsibility that comes with the power of policing  especially the power to kill  that means they have a different responsibility and accountability that is not present right now  so true  they have a responsibility to serve first  and be rational  rather than militant and trigger happy mckesson was them asked about dr  king  people misremember king today  they remember  like  the safe king   they don t remember  like  the radical revolutionary king  he talked about redistribution of wealth and economic justice   he was more aggressive than the dream that people remember  mckesson  who rose to fame through twitter  then pointed out how social media is important to today s activist  though  at the root of it all   nothing has really changed  the issues are the same  we didn t invent resistance  we didn t discover injustice  but technology has allowed us to amplify these issues in ways that we couldn t before and has accelerated the pace of organizing in ways that are really powerful  after speaking about the democratic candidates and his experiences with them  the conversation turned to the issue that is at the root of all of this  white privilege  unfortunately  that is something most white people will never want to speak about  however  colbert is definitely not afraid  and he asked mckesson how to understand his own privileges from being white  mckesson responded  it s about role  and it s about access   and what you can do is extend that privilege so that you can dismantle it  right  you can create opportunity for people  you can amplify issues in ways that other people can t and you can use your resources to create space for people  colbert then made the ultimate confession  which is that privilege also comes with fear  i can t speak for other white people   but  i feel guilty for anyone who does not have the things i have  that includes black people or anyone  because i am so blessed   i think there s always a fear that it will be taken from me  and that is the very essence of why so many white people fear the breaking down of the system of white supremacy  they fear that their wealth and societal position will be taken if black people get so much as a crumb of the pie  much less a slice  but  they should fear not  for giving other people rights is not their oppression such a basic concept that so few understand watch the absolutely perfect video below featured image via screen capture from raw story
