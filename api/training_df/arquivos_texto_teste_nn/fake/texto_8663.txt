the clampetts are at it again  as usual  the  responsible  gun owning population can t make it a single day without shooting or threatening to shoot someone over something nonsensical  on saturday  one brave patriot decided that two men waiting to harvest the meat from an animal someone hit along a montana highway were getting just a bit too greedy   so he proposed a second amendment solution to the problem an elk had been hit by a car earlier in the day  and two men stopped to wait for it to die so they could grab it  take it home  and salvage the meat from its corpse  sure  eating roadkill is something one would not expect to create an issue in    but a third man apparently got a bit jealous over the bounty of road splatter as the men waited  somehow unwilling to put the elk out of its misery   year old kenrick workman drove to the scene where the two men were eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have themselves some roadkill  after arguing with the gentlemen who were patiently awaiting dinner  workman pushed one of the men and retrieved a handgun from his car  he then threatened to shoot them the men called police  who arrested workman on existing warrants for a dui  resisting arrest  and assault with a firearm the nra regularly assures us that gun owners are exactly the people who will save us from oblivion  while they draw a distinction between  good guys  and  bad guys with guns   the problem is that in the eyes of the nra everyone is a  good guy with a gun  until they commit a crime  in other words  everyone should be trusted with a weapon until it is too late   even someone who would rush out of his home to threaten people in a bizarre argument over who gets to eat the animal someone left on the side of the road it is unclear if anyone got to eat the elk featured image via
