mike hagan has a used car dealership and repair shop in rochester  new hampshire and is running a very odd and frankly irresponsible promotion  he s offering a free ar  to people who come buy a car from him  because  murika hagan is a combat veteran who served in afghanistan  he knows what these kinds of guns can do  and yet  according to wftv   he s not worried about whether any of these guns might be used to murder people later on  thus far  he s given away four of the weapons  along with a  beretta  which is an alternative for people who don t want an ar   and he thinks his promotion is a wild success this kind of promotion is bad enough  and to refuse to end it following a horrific tragedy like orlando is just plain insensitive and cruel  the gun nuts apparently don t see it that way  though  they ve taken to facebook to celebrate hagan s promotion  lest the  evil libruls  finally come to confiscate everyone s guns               there has been some backlash  though  not just on social media  but also from a couple of people that  tv spoke to  at least there are least still some sane people out there  to me that s just getting more of the nut jobs out there doing harm to more people that don t deserve it  my opinion  military and police are the only ones that should have them  hagan has partnered with a local gun dealer to run his promotion  and customers have to go there to go through a background check and get the weapons  apparently  that makes it all okay because it means he knows he can t give them out like they re candy besides that  he believes that the people who take advantage of this promotion will be fully responsible  because everyone knows that all the people who obtain their guns legally are very responsible gun owners   oh wait  omar mateen  and so many other mass shooters  bought their guns legally  not to mention all the idiots who have no clue what gun safety is  and end up accidentally shooting someone to death hagan claims he won t extend the offer to someone from whom he gets a bad feeling  so  what  he s telepathic and knows who has bad intentions  horse hockey  this is still sick  it s still irresponsible  and it s still cruel and insensitive  it also demonstrates just how sick as a society we ve become where this kind of thing is seen as something to celebrate by so many featured image via screen capture from  tv report
