just when donald trump has his biggest opportunity to act in a truly presidential manner  he decides instead that what needs to happen is more attacks on people who no longer matter much to the race  speaking for the first time following the rnc  he went on the offensive against both ted cruz and john kasich  and then confirmed rumors that he will try to destroy them in two years  when they re both up for re election laying into cruz first  he said  you know   come and endorse over the next little while he ll   because he has no choice  but i don t want his endorsement  what difference does it make  and i don t want his endorsement  i have such great   i don t want his endorsement  just   ted  stay home  relax  enjoy yourself again  i don t want his endorsement  if he gives it  i will not accept it  just so you understand  if he gives it   i will not accept it  that s the equivalent of children saying   fine  i didn t want you to be my friend anyway   but anybody who doesn t pay king trump proper homage will find themselves the subject of his wrath  and making sure they pay for their  crimes  is more important than proving he ll be a good president  cruz will no doubt find this about as heartbreaking as a hangnail that s not all his royal trumpiness said  though  he also blasted ohio governor john kasich  another primary opponent of his  for not coming to the rnc at all  see  to me  that s dishonorable  to me  not signing a pledge is dishonorable  okay  it s dishonorable  not a nice thing to do  and i talk this way  because we re all together  watch below as if that s not bad enough  trump s plans to destroy kasich and cruz involve funneling millions of dollars into a super pac that works against their re election bids in   because that s totally more important than running the country maybe he thinks mike pence is presidential enough for the both of them thin skinned trump  whose narcissistic tendencies mean he d rather take individual people down even when they no longer matter  will spend his entire presidency getting revenge for every slight imaginable  yet another reason that he s ridiculously unqualified to be our president featured image by drew angerer getty images
