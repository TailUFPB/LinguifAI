if you ask members of the democratic party who is to blame for the rift in the party many of them will place the blame on democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz   including former obama advisor van jones as the leader of the party  the last thing schultz should be doing is criticizing one of our candidates  but she did  on tuesday  schultz told cnn s wolf blitzer that bernie sanders was condoning violence after the nevada convention erupted in chaos   response was anything but acceptable  it certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel to the fire  it is never ok for violence and intimidation to be the response to that frustration  that s what happens with the trump campaign  we can never resort to the tactics that they engage in  on tuesday evening  van jones slammed wasserman schultz s comments and said she is making the rift in the party worse  if you re gonna come out  you re gonna talk about violence  and you re the dnc chair  you ve gotta be fair about it  i think she made it worse  we need to bring these people together   that did not happen first of all  bernie did say in his statement that he was against the violence  also  if you want to talk about violence  only one person s been arrested  it was a hillary clinton supporter  wendell pierce  arrested for assaulting a sanders supporter  jones is spot on  first of all  as i said  the only thing she should be doing is bringing our party together and frankly  she has failed miserably  second  can sanders supporters be obnoxious  yes  but so are clinton s  to say that bernie sanders is anything like trump is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard  trump actually tells his supporters that he would hit someone if he could  he encourages violence at his rallies as a person who has been to a trump rally and a sanders rally  i can tell you that the difference between the two atmospheres is like night and day  bernie s was peaceful while trump s was full of people hurling insults  the nevada convention got a little heated  but it was still nothing like a trump rally  schultz comments are a perfect example of why some people believe she favors clinton over sanders  did she compare hillary to trump because one of her supporters hit a woman  no she did not  so  she should have kept her mouth shut about bernie i hate do not believe in the bernie or bust movement  but i do know that the leader of the dnc damn sure isn t helping matters  we are never going to get through to  busters  with this kind of divisive nonsense watch jones  comments below featured image via leigh vogel getty images
