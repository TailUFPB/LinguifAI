 first amendment  supporting conservatives are once again up in arms over what they perceive to be political correctness run amuck lisa greenwood  a loan officer from loan point financial  posted on her twitter calling michelle obama an  ugly black bitch  luckily  her facebook showed where she worked  and complaints to the company quickly poured in lisa s company responded by firing her  they posted on their facebook page explaining why the individual who made reprehensible comments regarding last night s speech by the first lady is no longer employed with home point financial  home point financial does not agree with nor condone such comments  which were made on the individual s twitter account  we hold true to our we care philosophy   our responsibilities extend beyond the workplace and into our communities ever since the announcement  the company s facebook page has blown up with support  with hundreds  possibly thousands  of people now looking for a new home loan  luckily  home point financial is licensed in  states this is a perfect example to set for today s youth  and apparently adults   be very careful about what you post on social media  you never know who may be watching or what your company may think thankfully  home point financial doesn t tolerate racism and sheer disrespect for our nation s first lady conservative s love to accuse democrats of playing the race card  yet time and time again  they are the ones who bring up the obama s race and make racially charged statements   like calling them monkeys  gorillas  africans  panthers  the list goes on and on the company should scrutinize greenwood s cases  to find if there was ever any racial discrimination in her loan process  judging by her charge against michelle obama  it wouldn t be far fetched that she completely undermined black americans trying to get a home kudos to the company for stamping out hate  let this be a lesson to conservatives and trump supporters alike that racism is no longer being tolerated featured image via joe readle getty images
