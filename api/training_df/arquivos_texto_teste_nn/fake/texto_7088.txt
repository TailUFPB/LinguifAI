the members of a roman catholic church in poland have demonstrated to the world how compassionate christians can shut down priest when they preach politics  not religion  from the pulpit the women were at a roman catholic church in gdansk  which is spearheading the outlawing of abortion in the eastern european country  the priest began reading a letter to the congregation in favor of the ban  which triggered a large number of mostly female worshippers to stand  turn their back on the priest  and leave the church as the journal reports the message from poland s catholic bishops  presented at churches nationwide  called on lawmakers to back the proposal being considered by poland s right wing government the move would tighten what are already some of europe s most restrictive laws on pregnancy termination  current legislation  dating from   already bans all terminations except when pregnancy results from rape or incest  poses a health risk to the mother  or if the foetus is severely deformed pro life activists support even tougher legislation but the move has sparked a backlash and thousands of marchers took part in a protest outside the country s parliament in warsaw yesterday  as well as in several other cities the move is in sharp contrast to christian conservatives in the united states  who are actually rallying behind candidates and religious leaders who wear their prejudice and intolerance on their sleeve  even pope francis is being pilloried by the christian right in america for his refusal to hate and preach against muslims in fact  there is not a candidate left in the gop race for president who believes in a woman s reproductive rights over her own body  donald trump believes women should be  punished for having abortions  ted cruz would outlaw abortion  with  no exceptions    even in cases of incest or rape  even the candidate who is selling himself as the moderate  john kasich  also calls for a total ban on abortion  there is no pro choice version of the republican message anymore in economic policy  the ultra right of the conservative movement has killed off the eisenhower republicans   the gop lawmakers and voters who believed in investment  taxation and welfare as the pillars which support free enterprise and a stable  prosperous society  at the same time  the evangelists have killed any hope of social liberalism in the party what s left behind is a cold  cruel  and crazy mob  who simply do not care about facts  evidence or rational discussion  they are zealots  let us hope that for the sake of the republican party  and the country  that a complete slaughtering in election  brings everyone back to their senses  https   www facebook com  videos   mref messagebubblefeatured image via screengrab
