trump bashes china so much and blames them for american problems so often  that if he wasn t such a racist you could arguably say it s the central theme of his presidential campaign  with that in mind  you have to wonder if trump has some kind of multiple personality disorder  on one hand  he completely savages them with rhetoric every chance he gets  on the other  practically every aspect of his business is dependent on them to survive as if it wasn t embarrassing enough for him to be busted on live tv for producing his overpriced and gaudy clothing in china  now it turns out that the  crown jewel  of his empire   that being real estate development   is also dependent on chinese money to survive a trump branded luxury apartment building called trump bay street is being built in new jersey  the project is receiving substantial funds from chinese investors  bloomberg reported that the investors were sold on the idea via a  sopranos  style video campaign filmed from a moving car with the  work up this morning  theme song from the show playing in the background  i didn t know the sopranos were so big in china if the fact he pandered out to chinese investors wasn t hypocritical enough  this next part really takes the cake the project was also funded to the tune of   million by a controversial visa program that essentially sells legal us residency for immigrants who can front a huge wad of cash  the program is called eb   and it allows foreigners who invest at least    in an american project that will create at least  jobs to receive a  year visa the program is intensely popular as a capital source for real estate developers and has ballooned from  visas in  to   in   approximately   chinese millionaires essentially bought a visa while millions of regular immigrants wait patiently to come here legally the eb  program has come under a lot of fire as well  for its ability to be easily exploited by unsavory individuals in addition to reaching wealthy foreign investors  the program has become a magnet for those seeking to sidestep the scrutiny of the traditional immigration process  in one case  immigration officials pushed through a visa application from chinese investor in a las vegas hotel project despite an internal review that found the investor had previously been turned back at the border  and much of his visa application had likely been fabricated  immigration records show a feb     homeland security internal review obtained by abc news also lays out in stark detail the breadth of the troubles afflicting some of the roughly  so called regional centers   private sector entities certified by homeland security to recruit foreign investors for specific business ventures that will qualify for eb  visas  the document summarizes  investigations  some open and some now closed  into allegations ranging from espionage to fraud to drug trafficking involving investors in various eb  investment projects source  gawkertrump has been pissing and moaning about china for literally years now and explained how he will mercilessly beat them up in the name of america if elected president  meanwhile  he s literally receiving a government handout from them  via a shady visa program that sells a spot in the u s  for an obscene amount of money i guess the question is  can he even afford to be tough on china  or will it bankrupt him featured image via youtube
