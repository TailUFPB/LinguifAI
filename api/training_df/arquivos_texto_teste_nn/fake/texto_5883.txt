everyone has their own idea about what made omar mateen murder  people at the pulse nightclub in orlando  he was supposedly driven to commit this sick and disgusting act after seeing two men kissing  and he d allegedly pledged allegiance to isis less than an hour before opening fire  there may be an even darker side to this  though  and it s one that permeates our entire society  whether we want to admit it or not witnesses say that mateen had been a regular at pulse for at least three years  ty smith and chris callen  who both performed in a drag show at pulse  remember him being escorted from the club on numerous occasions  drunk off his gourd  when they saw his picture on tv in connection with the massacre  they were floored  both professed shock at seeing his face on tv   it s the same guy   said callen  who performs under the name kristina mclaughlin   he s been going to this bar for at least three years  they expressed incredulity at the story being told by mateen s father in the wake of the shooting  that the gunman had once been scandalized during a visit to miami by the sight of men kissing each other they say mateen saw plenty of men kiss   and far closer to home than miami  that s bullcrap  right there  no offence  that s straight up crap  he s been around us   smith said monday in an interview at the glbt community center of central florida  some of those people did a little more than  kiss  outside the bar   he was partying with the people who supposedly drove him to do this   another regular at pulse  kevin west  told the los angeles times that he and mateen messaged off and on for a year on a gay chat app  msnbc s chris hayes reported on this  too here s what reporting we know  several people on the record saying shooter was on several gay dating apps and messaged with them  christopher hayes   chrislhayes  june    several regulars at pulse who recognized the shooter  one saying he d been coming regularly for the past  years   christopher hayes   chrislhayes  june    a gay classmate of the shooter in the police academy who says he used to go to gay bars w the shooter  who asked him out once   christopher hayes   chrislhayes  june    s terrifyingly possible that mateen himself was gay  which is a very tough and painful pill to swallow in light of what he did  the idea that a gay man could sink to such evil  and perpetrate such a horrific massacre against the very community to which he should have belonged hurts  however  he was muslim and possibly an extreme muslim  they have values that mirror the right wing christian values that allow for hatred of the lgbtq community in what s supposedly the  freest nation in the world  eric biesterfeld  who is a gay man himself  explained this in a facebook post   f you wondered why we need gay pride  it s because pride is the opposite of shame  if this is true  shame over an unchangeable  harmless facet of our humanity caused so much pain that he brought  lives down with his own and yes  i blame those who would use religion to cause shame in another for this act  louis alemayehu  who wrote the post that biesterfeld shared  said something similar   some of us suspected this  internalized oppression is deadly in so many ways  we must be nurturing and accepting of one another from an early age  self hatred and or denial has implications way beyond the individual  the family  the community and ultimately the world  our interconnections are profound and immediate  they have a point  not all hateful  bigoted homophobes are straight  cisgender people who think being lgbtq is so gross it has no place in our society  some are lgbtq people who have internalized that bigotry because we have so many hate filled homophobes who have very loud  influential mouthpieces  and who are trying to enshrine oppression of the lgbtq community in the laws that govern our land in the name of  religious freedom  despite that  chris hayes tweeted that this doesn t excuse mateen for anything  and he s bang on right with that  make no mistake  there is no calling mateen anything but what he was   a murderer  none of this would exculpate the sheer hatred  rage and evil of this murderer  or even  explain  it in any sense  but it complicates  christopher hayes   chrislhayes  june    hayes is right that it does complicate this  because now it s a tragedy with its roots in a societal ill  and that ill is this vile idea that the lgbtq community is wrong and dirty  that their very identities are wrong and disgusting  and that the only true way to practice a religion is to force it on others through oppression  or worse  violence there s no way to know what was really going on in mateen s head  his hate  whatever drove it  was so evident that it made his co workers uncomfortable one of mateen s ex coworkers at  security told me he complained about the man s frequent slurs attacking gays and blacks   david ovalle     june     he would never have more than  or  sentences without using the word n    r or queer or dike  it was always about violence   he told me   david ovalle     june    also dalliances at pga village neighborhood   all he wanted to do was cheat on his wife  he had very little respect for women   david ovalle     june    he was driven exclusively by an extreme religious ideology that made him a bigot consumed with hate  or he was filled a self loathing that was so powerful  and so all consuming that it came out in a horribly violent pyroclastic eruption  the tragic result is the same right wing christians need to look in the mirror if they want to discover all the possible causes of this massacre  because when it comes to the lgbtq community  their values are identical the values of islam  they re just as guilty as mateen for all those senseless deaths featured image via screen capture
