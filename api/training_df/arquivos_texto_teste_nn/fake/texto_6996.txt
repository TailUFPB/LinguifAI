there are apparently still folks who believe that because the lgbt community is gaining more and more equality  and because women have the right to make their own medical decisions  they are being forced to promote being gay and apparently forcing abortions on everyone case in point   arizona pastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church anderson seems discontent in knowing the united states is offering too much freedom for all  he seems to think the rule of his god should be the ruler of all  and now  he s even going after the pledge of allegiance  because he somehow thinks that by reciting it he s being forced to promote homosexuality and abortion during one of his sermons  he said  one nation  corrupt  perverted  promoting abortion and homosexuality to all  not gonna do it  my friend  get mad at me  quit the church  umm  granting equality under the law to people who are part of the lgbt community or letting women have control over their own bodies is not  promoting  anything   it s freedom  something the united states kinda prides itself on  he doesn t seem to understand that he isn t being forced to do anything he doesn t want to do  he can still live his life with hate in his heart and no one will do a damn thing about it  he said  i don t want anything to do with sodomy  it s wicked  i don t want anything to do with abortion  i don t want anything to do with the things that our country is starting to stand for  then he steps further onto the crazy train by perpetuating the myth that the united states is pushing for a  new world order   he doesn t seem to realize that he isn t forced to pledge allegiance to the flag  nor that there is separation of church and state that protects the church as much as it protects the state  he said  the problem with making an oath or pledge or affirmation is that you might sit there and pledge allegiance  right  and then  like   years later  what happens when that country is a totally different place  what happens when that country stands for something totally different  and you ve already pledged allegiance to it  i mean  we don t want to do that  we don t want to get wrapped up in that  sure  but he doesn t seem to have a problem pledging allegiance to an archaic text that was written thousands of years ago by men who claim the are writing the word of god  it s more than fine to believe in the bible  it s more than fine to believe in god  that s his freedom that is protected under the constitution of the united states  he s allowed to worship freely under full protection of the law as so long as he doesn t harm anyone  so  before he goes and swears off our  earthly government  he should probably think long and hard about the fact that freedom is granted to all  not just some  featured image via video screen capture
