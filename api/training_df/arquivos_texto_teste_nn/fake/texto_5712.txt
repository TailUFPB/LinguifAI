donald trump appears to be backing off on his pledge to deport immigrants  at least he appeared to be earlier on saturday  instead  trump is accusing obama of being too anti immigrant yes  you read that right  in an interview in scotland  he said that he would limit deportations to countries with known terrorists and he would start over again on the trans pacific partnership trade deal  he toned down his usual xenophobic rhetoric to say that his policies would have  heart   unlike  according to him  president obama  president obama has mass deported vast numbers of people   the most ever  and it s never reported  i think people are going to find that i have not only the best policies  but i will have the biggest heart of anybody   trump said pressed on whether he would issue  mass deportations   trump answered   no  i would not call it mass deportations  source  bloomberg comit s a damned good thing that trump has the best health insurance money can buy  because he s risking a serious case of whiplash  in the last few months alone  trump has said about immigration  donald j  trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on  according to pew research  among others  there is great hatred towards americans by large segments of the muslim population  that s pretty definitive  i think islam hates us   trump told cnn s anderson cooper after he was asked whether he thinks islam is at war with the west   there s a tremendous hatred  we have to get to the bottom of it  there is an unbelievable hatred of us  if islam hates us  they don t   then why let in immigrants from any country at all  i will build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me  believe me and i ll build them very inexpensively  i will build a great  great wall on our southern border  and i will make mexico pay for that wall  mark my words  the entire foundation of his campaign was built around this  wall   i never thought of mexico as a muslim country  let alone one that hates us  i do business with the mexican people  but you have people coming through the border that are from all over  and they re bad  they re really bad  you have people coming in  and i m not just saying mexicans  i m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they re coming into this country  i guess he won t be keeping these people out  we must have strong borders and not let illegal immigrants enter the united states  as has been stated continuously in the press  people are pouring across our borders unabated  public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants  if anything  this latest pivot could be a misguided attempt to appeal to bernie sanders voters  who often disagree with obama s deportation policies  yes  it is true that obama has deported a record number of immigrants  but that s not a fact we would have heard from the donald trump of last week or last month  or likely of tomorrow h t  newsday  america s voice   featured image via jeff j  mitchell with getty images
