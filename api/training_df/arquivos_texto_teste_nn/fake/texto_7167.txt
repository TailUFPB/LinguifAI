the donald isn t having a very good week at all  his campaign manager was charged with battery for assaulting a lady  multiple protesters are suing him for assault and battery  his communications director quit and told the truth about him  and his supporters won t even be able to bring their guns to the gop convention in case things get messy  now  it looks like he will be facing a criminal investigation for buying ben carson s endorsement with an illegal job offer last month  ben carson made it very clear that he did not endorse donald trump because he likes him  agrees with his policies  or even thinks he should be president   trump offered him a job in his future administration in exchange for carson s unwavering servitude  so far  he s been a good little  house boy  for the billionaire  heaping praise on the  hopeful and even defending trump s recent comments that women should face punishment for having an abortion but this latest bought and paid for bromance may cause some complication in trump s life  public interest group the american democracy legal fund has filed a complaint with the department of justice criminal division  asking for an investigation into trump s actions  noting that federal law prohibits a candidate from promising a position to  any person  in exchange for support  the adlf penned a letter demanding that trump s illegal actions be investigated american democracy legal fund   adlf   is a group established to hold candidates for office accountable for possible ethics and or legal violations   it has recently come to light that mr  donald trump may have willfully offered dr  ben carson an appointment to his administration should he become president in return for supporting his candidacy in violation of  u s c       adlf respectfully requests that you investigate this matter and take all appropriate action as soon as possible former presidential candidate dr  carson endorsed mr  trump for the republican presidential nomination on march      mr  trump and dr  carson met the day before to discuss and finalize the endorsement   three days later  on march   dr  carson gave an interview to newsmax tv to discuss his recent endorsement of mr  trump   during the interview  dr  carson stated that he believed mr  trump would  surround himself with very good people   when asked if he would be one of those people  dr  carson responded   i will be doing things as well   when the interviewer asked whether that meant in a trump administration  dr  carson replied   certainly in an advisory capacity   the interviewer then asked dr  carson if  that s been determined  and followed by asking   when you sat down with  that was discussed   dr  carson openly admitted   yes   and said that while they  hadn t hammered out all the details    it is very important that we work together    when asked if this meant a cabinet position  dr  carson declined to  reveal any details about it right now  because all of this is still very liquid  pursuant to  u s c       hoever  being a candidate  directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment  or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment  for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year  or both  and if the violation was willful  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years  or both  dr  carson s comments strongly suggest that mr  trump promised him an administration position in return for his endorsement   in his interview  dr  carson stated that he would  certainly  have an advisory capacity within a potential trump administration   when asked directly whether this role was discussed during their endorsement meeting  dr  carson responded   yes   dr  carson s assured answers lead to the reasonable conclusion that mr  trump promised dr  carson an administration post in order to secure his endorsement in violation of  u s c     federal law prohibits a candidate from directly or indirectly promising the appointment of any person to any public or private position in exchange for his or her support   dr  carson s comments indicate that mr  trump used the promise of a role in his administration to secure dr  carson s support for his presidential campaign   for the above stated reasons  we respectfully request that you undertake an immediate investigation of this matter trump cares nothing about the law  this is obvious to even the most casual observer after hearing him talk about killing terrorists  families  establishing a national muslim database  and establishing muslim concentration camp  trump  a man who promises to pay for his supporters  legal defense when they beat up african americans at his rallies  is completely detestable  somehow  it is almost poetic that his illegal interactions with a black man might finally bring him down now we must wonder  who else did he buy off featured image via bloomberg finance
