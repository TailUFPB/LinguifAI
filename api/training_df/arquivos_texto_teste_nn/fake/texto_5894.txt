in the wake of the worst mass shooting in american history committed by an isis sympathizer  donald trump appeared on fox news to accuse president obama of helping the terrorists after hearing that  people were massacred at an lgbt night club in orlando on saturday night  trump s callous first reaction was to give himself a pat on the back for being  right  about terrorism  you know  because not just any idiot can predict that an attack of some kind will happen in the future but on monday morning during an interview on fox   friends  trump crossed the line by actually suggesting that president obama is not doing anything to fight terrorism and may be aiding the terrorists  he doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands  it s one or the other   trump said   and either one is unacceptable  we re led by a man who is a very   look  we re led by a man that either is  is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind  and the something else in mind  you know  people can t believe it  people cannot   they cannot believe that president obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical islamic terrorism  there s something going on  it s inconceivable  here s the video via youtube president obama doesn t need to say words to defeat isis  despite what trump says  obama has been fighting isis for a long time now even as republicans in congress refuse to declare war on the terrorist organization they paved the way for in the first place by invading iraq back during the bush administration  claiming that president obama is in league with the terrorists is just absurd and outrageous airstrikes killed a top isis leader in march  which was only the second such strike to take out a member of isis that month  a strike also took out an isis commander in iraq in january and yet another strike killed an isis leader in libya last november and that s only four of the many such airstrikes that have dealt major blows to isis and their operations but according to trump  president obama only has to say three words and isis will somehow magically disappear off the face of the planet  thus demonstrating once again that trump is completely unqualified to be president  because while he is congratulating himself for a prediction that any three year old could make and running his mouth about what president obama should say to defeat isis  our commander in chief has been taking action  if trump really wants to blame someone for not being hard on isis he should blame the republicans in congress for not exercising their power to declare war  the president can only do so much without congress and republicans are sitting on their hands instead of doing their jobs featured image via christopher furlong getty images
