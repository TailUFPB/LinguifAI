donald trump is more than likely leaning toward picking retired lt  general michael flynn as his vice presidential running mate after this during an interview on the week with guest host martha raddatz  flynn referred to undocumented immigrants as  illegals  flynn is currently on trump s shortlist of possible running mates so he made sure to match the republican nominee s anti immigration rhetoric raddatz asked flynn if all undocumented immigrants should be rounded up and deported  flynn not only replied by using what many consider to be a racial slur  by using it he suggested that trump would round them all up and send them back across the border as he builds his massive and expensive wall along the u s  mexican border  let s talk about immigration   raddatz began   let me ask you immigration  should all undocumented immigrants be deported  so undocumented or illegal   flynn asked in some attempt for clarification  undocumented  illegal  raddatz replied then flynn proceeded to lecture raddatz  are they here illegally  i mean  if they re here illegally  then it s illegal  i mean  again  back to my very first point  the rule of law in this country is probably the single biggest strategic advantage that we have  above and beyond all other countries in the world  and we cannot allow the rule of law to break down  here s the video via youtube  the anti immigrant remarks begin at the   mark while the act of crossing the border without permission is illegal  the people doing it are not  actions are illegal  not people  but because they are inherently racist  conservatives prefer using this term to describe hispanic people whom they do not want in america that s why the correct term to use is  undocumented  elsewhere in the interview  flynn also accused hillary clinton of blaming all white people for the killing of innocent black people by police officerslt  general michael flynn served his country honorably during his many years of service  some of which were under president obama  who appointed him as director of the defense intelligence agency in  he is also a registered democrat  although he claims that today s democratic party isn t the same one he grew up with  which is weird considering democrats are fighting for social justice  women s rights  and civil rights just as they have been doing since flynn was a child in the   so it s a little bit of a head scratcher as to why he would want to ruin his reputation by agreeing to be vetted as a potential running mate for a racist bigoted republican candidate like donald trump featured image  screenshot
