what happens when conservative lawyers from the cato institute  georgetown university and the hoover institution get together well  besides their opposition to obamacare  they all come to the conclusion that donald trump  the republican nominee for president of the united states  is bad for the law in a recent article from the new york times  these lawyers  all politically conservative  lambasted the billionaire mogul for his attacks against the first amendment  individuals  the separation of powers  and the rule of law all together in other words  these lawyers  without saying it  contend that trump would be more crooked  more criminal  and more disastrous than richard nixon pointing out that his promise to tighten libel laws undermines the first amendment  and that his proposal to ban muslims from coming into the u s  violates the constitution s guarantees of religious freedom  due process and equal protection  attorney ilya sharpiro   who works with the cato institute   said plainly   who knows what donald trump with a pen and phone would do  but it was volokh conspiracy  a conservative legal blog  writer and attorney david post who had the harshest words for trump  saying his comments regarding gonzalo p  cruiel  the judge presiding over the trump university case  resembled  authoritarianism   post argues that these outbursts disqualified him  this is how authoritarianism starts  with a president who does not respect the judiciary  you can criticize the judicial system  you can criticize individual cases  you can criticize individual judges  but the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law  that is his constitutional obligation  so not only does trump hate the law  he has vowed to restore trump university after the judge s decision  this blatant disregard for the rule of law should send chills down every american s spine  if donald trump  a now public  political figure and possibly future president  can openly disregard the law  who s to say the average american can t randy e  barnett  a law professor at georgetown who was the architect behind the first major challenge to obamacare  feels trump doesn t know his limits  you would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers  on congressional powers  on federal powers  and i doubt he has any awareness of such limits  richard epstein  attorney with the hoover institution  was more blunt  i don t think he cares about separation of powers at all   i think obama s been much worse on that issue  pretty consistently  and his underlings have been even more so  but i think trump doesn t even think there s an issue to worry about  he just simply says whatever i want to do i will do  i never thought the day would come when conservative lawyers would view trump more dangerously than they do president obama maybe trump really does suck  perhaps republicans will begin to see the light when hillary clinton thrashes him on the debate stage featured image via elijah nouvelage getty images
