after winning the iowa caucus  ted cruz is following the pattern of the last two republicans who won that contest and fading out of the presidential top tier  losing both the new hampshire and south carolina primaries  this is very sad for self described  rodeo clown  and conservative radio host glenn beck beck endorsed cruz and has been on the trail with the candidate  touting him as the direct heir to george washington  but now that cruz s path to the presidency is getting bumpy  beck is starting to sound somewhat detached from reality beck has called for cruz supporters to join him in a fast in honor of the candidate  if that sounds like a strange thing to do you aren t alone  even among conservatives  some have pushed back on beck s suggestion in response  beck is now saying that the backlash proves that the church is  dead   he wrote a message to his followers on facebook as part of his push back since when has a fast and prayer been crazy it was standard practice to beseech the powers of heaven for not just your country but personal guidance and revelation at one time have we really become a nation that mocks those who pray and fast the sad answer is yes i am not telling you who to vote for  i am asking people to pray and humble themselves before the lord  if you wish to do that for your candidate please do so  god will not answer you or me  with prayer and fasting  approached with humility and a broken heart  we may fall closer into alignment with his will beck goes on to say that  we are closer to losing our nation and liberty than we were on september    in his view  candidates like marco rubio and donald trump are not pure of heart enough to save america the way that ted cruz would beck is prone to dramatics and oddball announcements   which are part of the reason he was eventually let go from fox news having a freak out over ted cruz s lackluster performance is just the latest episode of beck having a tantrum when he doesn t get his own way featured image via youtube
