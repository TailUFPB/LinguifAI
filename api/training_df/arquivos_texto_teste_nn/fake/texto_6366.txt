 racism doesn t exist anymore  the united states is as inclusive as it s ever been  white supremacists don t live in the usa  we have a black president  that proves it  this is the kind of bullshit you hear from the right wing all the time  according to them  we live in a post racial america where everyone loves everyone else and racism is a thing of the past  it is very clear that people who believe this are either lying  stupid or completely unaware of what is going on in the world  i think it s a combination of the three   because it hard to genuinely believe that when you turn on the news and hear about things like the following story arthur hill walked into a barbershop in rock hill  south carolina on tuesday and asked for a haircut  the barber  larry thomas  responded by saying he doesn t  cut black hair   hill  shocked by the answer  asked thomas what he meant and that s when he saw a silver   caliber snub nose revolver in the barber s hand  i was shocked  i was shocked for my life  because i m thinking that could ve been me laying on the floor dead   hill  the would be customer  told nbc affiliate wcnc   he did not point it at me  but it was clear in sight like he meant business  thomas told police that hill was lying and that his guns were all in a shed out back  officers looked in the shed and found handguns that matched the description hill gave to them   shocking  york county sheriff s deputies arrested the barber and charged him with  pointing and presenting a firearm at a person   a felony deputies say rock hill barber told african american man that he  does not cut black hair    pulled a gun on the man pic twitter com   wbtv news   wbtvnews  may    the dipshit was released from jail  his story about where he had the guns suddenly changed  according to the washington post he told media outlets that he had the gun because he was afraid  i always have a gun right here   thomas told wcnc  as he tapped his cabinet   but i felt threatened because that man came walking back here to where i was  i felt threatened and i picked up the gun and i had it here by my side  i told him i did not do black hair and he kept coming towards me and i stepped back here and i always keep a gun right here and i just picked up my gun and put my gun at my side  thomas told wbtv   that s when he got into my face and said  you meant african american now  didn t you  thomas also claims that racism had nothing to do with his statement that he doesn t  cut black hair   instead  he says that he just isn t good enough to do it  however  although that may seem like a plausible excuse  wbtv says that they found eight other calls to police from the shop  in most of those cases  customers   including a latino and an asian man  all claimed they were refused service it s very obvious that thomas is a vile piece of racist trash who refuses service to people based on the color of their skin and apparently does it with a gun in his hand  so in addition to proving that racism is not dead  he is also proving that gun nuts are a bunch of wimps who need to cling to their penile extensions to solve their problems  well done  he is the embodiment of a right wing imbecile watch  https   youtu be    image via video screenshot
