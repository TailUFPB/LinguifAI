ohio state senate majority leader tom patton is a term limited senator who has decided to run for the state house of representatives to keep his political career alive  his opponent is a young woman named jennifer herold  who is the mother of  toddlers  patton  proving that he has more than enough misogyny to be a card carrying member of the republican party  has decided herold is unqualified to run against him you see  jennifer herold isn t a  year old man like patton is  as a woman under  with two children  she has no business in politics  patton said in a radio interview recently  the gal that s running against me is a  year old  you know  mom  mother of two infants  and i don t know if anybody explained to her we ve got to spend three nights a week in columbus  so  how does that work out for you  i waited until i was  and my kids were raised and at least adults before we took the opportunity to try  well then  there are so many things wrong with that statement it s hard to choose where to begin  first  don t call her  gal   it s insulting and cheapens your attack even more  if that s possible  newt  columbus isn t all that far  mrs  herold could easily make the commute if she wanted to  it s difficult to imagine a fragile little  gal  having the ability to oh  say drive a car  we know  last  have you considered  senator  that she may have a husband at home who doesn t believe it s the woman s job to take care of the kids   how old you are and your warped sense of how a modern family works is irrelevant  you insufferable douchebag it gets worse  while talking polling numbers  patton said  i want to tell her   hey sweetie  i just got  percent of the pie in just my district  which is nine times what should have been done  seriously   hey  sweetie   what is unfortunate is that his message will resonate with the sexists who populate his party  they don t like people who don t have penises representing them  because what could a woman possibly know about anything other than child rearing and pleasing her husband  patton is the perfect poster boy for the gop herold responded with pure class and dignity in a statement  we realize the sacrifice that is involved in holding such a position  however  tom patton has crossed a line by trying to turn the fact that i am a mother of two children into a negative campaign issue  it s insulting for my opponent to suggest that motherhood is a liability  in fact  my experience as a mom is perhaps my greatest strength  tom  only one man in my life is allowed to call me  sweetie   from now on  i respectfully ask you to refer to me as jen  jennifer  ms  herold  or your opponent  well said  ms  herold  patton has since apologized  calling his words  poorly chosen   what he doesn t seem to understand is that it isn t the words he chose that are disturbing  it s the way he thinks  it s the sexism and utter disrespect for herold as a woman and a human being that make him so despicable too little too late  senator  hopefully you get your ass handed to you so you ll have no choice but to stumble off into the sunset and obscurity  featured image via screen capture
