since donald trump is the presumptive gop nominee for president  and the democratic primary season isn t nearly as close to over as the republican primary season  trump ought to be spending his time trying to unite his party and gather as much support as possible  instead  he s still acting like he s in the thick of the primaries at a rally in anaheim  he attacked south carolina governor nikki haley for endorsing marco rubio  jeb bush for having low energy  what    and mitt romney for being a  choker   he also said that romney was stupid  and  choked like a dog  what month are we in now  he thinks it s still january  apparently those three haven t endorsed him yet  so obviously  in trump s dimension  the way to get their endorsements is to alienate them  house speaker paul ryan still hasn t endorsed trump either  and trump has been busy been attacking him on his favorite social media platform  twitter  one has to wonder how he thinks he ll be well positioned to win the presidency and work with congress if the speaker of the u s  house can t stand him at a rally in new mexico on tuesday  he attacked new mexico governor susana martinez because she wouldn t endorse him too  martinez is the first latina governor in u s  history  the first female governor of new mexico  and chair of the republican governors  association  he slammed martinez on tuesday night  saying  we have got to get your governor to get going  she s got to do a better job  okay  your governor has got to do a better job  she s not doing the job  hey  maybe i ll run for governor of new mexico  i ll get this place going  she s not doing the job  we ve got to get her moving  come on  let s go  governor  he went on to lie about new mexico getting flooded with syrian refugees  and basically acting like martinez is his opponent  it s sad  and also hilarious in a way  because one would think he d want to secure as many endorsements as possible now  especially those of people as important as martinez and paul ryan trump doesn t even hear the gop s calls for him to try and unite the party   they may as well not exist  he thinks unity is a nice pipe dream  but not necessary for him  and really  who cares about healing rifts that run across the entire u s   right  it s the same with the calls for him to act more presidential  he s stuck in the past  either that  or he s out for the blood of everyone who s ever wronged him  which is likely the reason he s stuck in the past soon  he s going to have to face off against either hillary clinton or bernie sanders  what will he do then  should he still have some prominent republicans who continue to refuse to endorse him  general election season will be mighty interesting if he doesn t get with the program here  more than  percent of americans already view him unfavorably  and this attitude could further alienate republicans and democrats alike  too bad for our dear mr  trump image by spencer platt getty images
