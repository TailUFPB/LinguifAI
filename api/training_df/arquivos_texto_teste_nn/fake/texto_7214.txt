alabama governor robert bentley claims to be a  family values conservative christian   but because of an affair with a woman who was not his wife he ll have to find a church that supports hypocrisy the republican governor has resisted repeated calls for him to resign his office despite a scandalous audio recording of bentley admitting to having an affair with rebekah mason  a staffer who works for him  i love you   bentley told mason in the recording   i love to talk to you  baby  let me tell you what we re going to have to start doing  we re going to have to start locking the door  if we are going to do what we did the other day  we are going to have to start locking the door  to spell it out for anyone who doesn t get it  bentley told mason they ll have to lock the door because their relationship became physical  which bentley denies even though that would be the logical reason why they have to start locking the door  so someone doesn t walk in on them and catch them in the act having heard the tape  bentley s wife filed for divorce  which is not exactly a pr dream come true if you re a lawmaker who touts  traditional  marriage and christian morality as reasons to oppose same sex marriage  i have always believed in the biblical definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman   bentley said when the supreme court handed down the decision to legalize same sex marriage across the nation last summer  apparently he meant between one man and one woman and another secret woman in a locked room  i made a mistake   bentley said during a press conference on wednesday   two years ago i made a mistake    i have apologized many times to my family  i have apologized to the family of mrs  mason  i would now like to apologize to the people of alabama  i ask them to forgive me  i ve been told about the possibility of tapes for two years  while he is still waiting for the people of alabama to forgive him  bentley s own church isn t much in the forgiving mood the first baptist church of tuscaloosa  where bentley was a deacon  has officially expelled the governor and mason senior pastor gil mckee told christian news network   while church discipline is a church family matter  both governor robert bentley and mrs  rebekah mason are no longer members of first baptist church tuscaloosa  i continue to pray for each of them  that s right  bentley s own church can t stomach having him as a member anymore because he not only cheated on his wife while waving christianity and  family values  in the faces of his constituents  he is lying about it and refusing to take responsibility by stepping down in disgrace seriously  governor  resign  that s the only right step you can take that will satisfy the people of alabama and the god you claim to worship  featured image via youtube
