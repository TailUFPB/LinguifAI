on friday  donald trump and several of his gop colleagues will speak at the national rifle association s annual institute for legislative action leadership forum  without a doubt  the event is going to be overrun with racist  right wing gun nuts   especially because bearing arms editor bob owens is co sponsoring the event owens is probably tickled pink that he s going to see trump at the event  as the two men have tons in common  one of the main similarities between them is that they re both wildly racist  when owens isn t spewing nonsense about  radical  democrats needing to be hanged for starting  a civil war  against conservatives and gun owners  he s dabbling in his other hobby   smearing the families of slain black children owens has repeatedly targeted and gone out of his way to torture the grieving families of trayvon martin  tamir rice and jordon davis with his vile hate speech  not too long after martin was killed by george zimmerman  owens called the teen  a violent  drug abusing thug who appeared to get off on hurting people  and  a semi literate violent criminal  he also trashed the musical about martin s life  saying that it was an attempt to  whitewash a thug s death   in   owens said that martin s mother had raised a  monster  and that her activism against the stand your ground laws that helped her son s murderer george zimmerman get acquitted were merely for personal enrichment  owens said  as for why fulton and her attorneys and democratic lawmakers in general want stand your ground laws repealed  that s blisteringly obvious as well  money a provision of stand your ground law in many states is that if a person is found not guilty during a criminal trial  then that defendant win  sic  civil immunity  and that keeps the families of deceased street thugs from suing the survivors for millions of dollars in civil court  owens remarked  good people   will arm themselves against violent young predators like trayvon martin  because  any society that hopes to survive simply has no choice  owens  attitude toward younger victims of senseless  racially motivated attacks didn t improve over time  when  year old tamir rice was shot by police officers who claimed they thought his toy gun was real  owens placed the blame on rice s family once again  owens said  the rice family doesn t care anymore about being responsible after tamir s death than they did about teaching him to be responsible with realistic toy guns while he was alive  owens also condemned lucy mcbath for becoming an activist against stand your ground laws after her son jordon davis was shot and killed  owens said   she has become radicalized  and now travels the nation attempting to strip law abiding citizens of their most basic natural right as a human being  the right  bear arms for self defense  owens  complete lack of human decency has been seen throughout trump s campaign  not only within the candidate himself but also in his supporters  one thing has become clear  trump really appeals to america s worst  and has gained a massive following amongst racists  just this week  white nationalists at the american freedom party said that trump had several kkk delegates that the media isn t aware of  he s gotten the support of white nationalists like david duke and william johnson  who admitted that he wants trump s divisive rhetoric to make racism more mainstream as owens has chosen to ignore the fact that racism exists and that racially motivated attacks have become a major issue in the united states  it s clear that trump s ignorant  hateful rhetoric is the perfect messaging for the nra sponsor  and just as trump never backs off from a one sided feud  owens isn t going to stop torturing these suffering families with his disgusting comments featured image via twitter
