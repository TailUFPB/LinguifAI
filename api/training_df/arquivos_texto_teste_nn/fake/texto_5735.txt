during a panel discussion on real time with bill maher that aired friday night  bill maher and his panel of guests discussed the  no bill  no break  sit in that occurred this week in the house of representatives  democrats staged a sit in on the house floor  where they demanded that a bill that would prevent persons on the no fly list from being able to purchase firearms in the united states one of maher s guests  nightly show host larry willmore  was quick to point out that the bill is actually quite  problematic   it was pointed out that despite the narrative being pushed about preventing terrorist suspects from buying handguns  it isn t actually the no fly list that the legislation addresses  the no fly list is actually a subsection of a much larger list called the  terrorist identities datamart environment   which includes more than    people s names  one of the people on the list  as wilmore points out  is actually sit in leader representative jon lewis himself it is also pointed out that the majority of people on the list are people of color who have been put on the list without ever having been convicted of a crime to land them on that list  it s actually quite hard to find out if you are on the list and there is no legal procedure to have yourself removed from the list the panel eventually came to a general consensus that it is ridiculous that a person who is considered a terror suspect should be able to purchase a gun  that being said  the watch list that is being used in the bill  that honestly never had a chance to go anywhere  has a lot of problems as well what the left needs to keep in mind is that democrats knew that the gop would do everything to obstruct this bill  despite it being legislation that republicans would have jumped on  if we were still living under a george w  bush administration  what the democrats involved in the sit in were looking for was a talking point in the general election  they got it  republicans put obstructionism above all else  they turned down a watch list that was partly created during a far right political administration  is rooted in racist mentalities  and at least in name serves to ramp up the military state  if the gop were going introduce legislation to increase gun regulations  this is what it would look like you can watch the segment below in full featured image from video screenshot
