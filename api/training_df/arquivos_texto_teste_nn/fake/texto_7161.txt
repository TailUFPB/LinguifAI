as the national museum of african american history and culture prepares to open later this year  controversy has already marred the highly anticipated addition to the national mall  the question of whether bill cosby s exhibit should include any mention of the numerous allegations of rape currently leveled against him was hotly contested and the museum has made its decision after days of questioning  the national museum of african american history and culture  which opens in washington in september  said on thursday that it would add a reference to accusations of sexual assault made against bill cosby in an exhibition that recognizes pioneering work in comedy and television while some people wanted the exhibit to ignore the lawsuits  others wanted the exhibit completely stricken  the tricky part is that cosby has not been convicted of a crime  yet    but also that he s had an enormous impact in his field  even if  when  he s convicted  does that really negate his pervasive influence in the entertainment industry  more importantly  as lonnie brunch  founding director of the museum points out  too much of black history has been disappeared and censoring cosby would only add to that unfortunate trend on the other hand  it s pretty clear that cosby is a sleaze and not mentioning that would be a true disservice to his unbelievable number of victims and deprive the public of the full context of who he was here s the museum s statement in full there have been many misconceptions and mistaken notions about the presence of bill cosby within the national museum of african american history and culture s exhibition   taking the stage   that explores the history of african american participation in film  theatre and television  this is not an exhibition that  honors or celebrates  bill cosby but one that acknowledges his role  among many others  in american entertainment  some people feel that the smithsonian should eliminate all mention of bill cosby as a result of recent revelations  we understand but respectfully disagree  for too long  aspects of african american history have been erased and undervalued  creating an incomplete interpretation of the american past  this museum seeks to tell  in the words of the eminent historian john hope franklin   the unvarnished truth  that will help our visitors to remember and better understand what has often been erased and forgotten  like all of history  our interpretation of bill cosby is a work in progress  something that will continue to evolve as new evidence and insights come to the fore  visitors will leave the exhibition knowing more about mr  cosby s impact on american entertainment  while recognizing that his legacy has been severely damaged by the recent accusations  lonnie bunch  founding director smithsonian national museum of african american history and culturefeatured image courtesy of the national museum of african american history and culture
