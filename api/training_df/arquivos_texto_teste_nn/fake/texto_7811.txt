america has a very ugly history with regards to slavery and racism  and that disgusting legacy continues today  racist white people want to gloss over all of that  though  and pretend that there s no racism  that it s all over  and they also want to tell a white washed version of history  case in point   david barton barton appeared on a recent edition of glenn beck s program  and made the appallingly racist statement that white people don t get enough credit for the things they have done for black people  he told beck  i love the fact that in these early paintings you have  there s black and white together  but  my gosh  why not teach the good  as if that weren t bad enough he went on to say  so much of the credit that blacks owed was for whites having gone to bat and doing things for them  that blacks were not able to free themselves  whites did  barton then insists that it is inaccurate portrayals of history that have  blacks against whites  now  and kept repeating so called examples of how black people should be grateful to white folks mr  barton  did you happen to forget that white people owned black people  that they actually owned other human beings  all because of the color of their skin  it s ignorant  offensive statements like this that cause division  you might not like history  how ugly it is  but that doesn t make it any less true  also  if true history is not taught  we are doomed to repeat it  get an education  mr  barton  you definitely need it watch this appallingly racist exchange below featured image via screen capture from right wing watch
