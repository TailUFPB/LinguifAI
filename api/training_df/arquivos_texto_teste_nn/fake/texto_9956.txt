 kris kobach   for years  the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it  and when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud  we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter new hampshire was a must win for hillary  watch cnn explain the significance of winning the state of new hampshire for hillary  new hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same day voter registration  the benefit of same day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day  the downside of same day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter  a volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he s a u s  citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote new hampshire is also a battleground state  unlike neighboring massachusetts and vermont  which reliably vote for the democrat in presidential elections  new hampshire can swing either way  it has long been reported  anecdotally  that out of staters take advantage of new hampshire s same day registration and head to the granite state to cast fraudulent votes now there s proof according to statistics released by the speaker of the new hampshire house of representatives  on the date of the general election in november   there were   same day registrants who registered to vote in new hampshire using an out of state driver s license to prove their identity  in and of itself  that doesn t prove that any fraud occurred   theoretically  each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the state and had not yet had time to get a new hampshire driver s license  according to new hampshire law  a new resident has  days to obtain a new hampshire driver s license so if those   voters were bona fide new hampshire residents  they would get their driver s license no later than january     however  the numbers tell a very different story  it turns out that  as of august      nearly ten months after the election   only   of the   same day registrants who registered with an out of state license had obtained a new hampshire driver s license  the other   individuals never obtained a new hampshire driver s license  and  of those    only  registered a vehicle in new hampshire so   of those voters neither obtained a new hampshire driver s license nor registered a vehicle in new hampshire  they have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver s licenses  and it appears that they are not actually residing in new hampshire  it seems that they never were bona fide residents of the state   is a big number   more than enough to swing two very important elections  the closest major election was the contest between incumbent republican u s  senator kelly ayotte and challenger maggie hassan  d   hassan won the election by a razor thin margin of   votes  those   fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election  if   percent or more of them went for hassan  then the election was stolen through voter fraud  that s likely  since the surrounding states are democrat strongholds it s also possible that new hampshire s four electoral college votes were swung to hillary clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents  clinton won new hampshire by only   votes  if   percent of the   fraudulent votes were cast for clinton  then the presidential election in new hampshire was tipped as well if the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes  then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences  regardless  in the senate contest  it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result    breitbart
