with world opinion of israel at an all time low  and with the growing movement to boycott  divest  and sanction israel  prime minister benjamin netanyahu is getting desperate  so what better way to shut down criticism of israel than to make the accusation of anti semitism this time  the accusation wasn t hurled at palestinians or so called  self hating jews  and others who criticize israel  in a sign of the times  it was directed at western leaders  historically supportive of anything israel but who are growing increasingly impatient with israel over its horrendous treatment of the palestinians  during netanyahu s official greeting on the occasion of international holocaust remembrance day  netanyahu stated  islamic extremists incorporate the most outrageous antisemitism into their murderous doctrines  we see this in gaza  we see it in raqqa  we see it in tehran  and it s not just islamic extremists in the middle east and europe  even respected western opinion leaders have become afflicted with hatred for the jewish people and the jewish state  the charge of anti semitism has traditionally been used as a tool to muzzle those who speak out against israel s nasty  policies toward the palestinians and it s worked for a long time but there has been a slow but sure change that has alarmed netanyahu and the zionist establishment both in israel and around the world  while western opinion has indeed changed  its important to differentiate between being anti semitic and anti israel  israel is a state worthy of criticism for its genocidal policies toward the palestinians and its thievery of their lands and it s not anti semitic to criticize israel but it s actually right and a just thing to do  however  when this happens  the anti semitic accusation immediately follows for example  when swedish foreign minister margot wallstrom recently called for conducting an investigation into israel s extrajudicial executions of palestinians during the latest violence  she was attacked by israeli politicians and the media through a campaign of hatred and incitement and was labeled an anti semite   one former israeli official even incited murder against her in an article  suggesting that wallstr m deserved to be executed like count folke bernadotte  a swedish un diplomat murdered by a zionist militia in   the aricle  by zvi zameret  headlined margot wallstr m s source of inspiration  was published in makor rishon  a paper owned by us zionist billionaire casino owner sheldon adelson  an unconditional supporter of israel and benjmamin netanyahu  and a guy who the republican presidential candidates grovel to for money and support although the attacks can be frighting  westerners are developing a backbone  the european union has recently approved of labeling goods made in the west bank as  made in settlements  rather than  made in israel   israel called the move  take a guess  anti semitic  however  israeli settlements are built on palestinian territory israel occupied in  and are deemed illegal under international law even the united states  a country whose politicians grovel to zionists more than any other country  it s quite embarrassing   have come out in criticism of israel  most notably under president obama s administration  us ambassador to israel david shapiro recently criticized israel s failure to prosecute jewish vigilantism against palestinians and its differing set of laws for jews and palestinians in the west bank  effectively calling israel an apartheid state  during a speech in tel aviv  shapiro  who is jewish  said  too much israeli vigilantism in the west bank goes on unchecked  there is a lack of thorough investigations   at times it seems israel has two standards of adherence to rule of law in the west bank   one for israelis and one for palestinians  the response from the zionist establishment was nasty and typical  a former netanyahu aide used a derogatory ethnic slur  calling shapiro  yehudon   the equivalent of  little jew boy  used in israel to describe jews not living in israel as not being  jewish enough  or  pro israel  the bottom line is that the world is disgusted with israel  its western supporters can no longer defend a crumbling system of apartheid and injustice that is coming to an end  the movement that calls for justice for palestinians is growing and as nelson mandela  the great leader of the south african anti aparteid movement  eloquently stated  we know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the palestinians  featured image via wikipedia commons
