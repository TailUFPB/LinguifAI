how does the saying go  fox news  not racist  but number one with racists  actually  no  they are pretty damn racist  and proof of this can be seen on fox   friends  when they decided to talk about the super bowl halftime show and beyonc s performance according to fox news and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani  beyonc  wasn t  wholesome  enough for them  and she bashed police officers  you know  because god forbid as an african american artist beyonc  speak of the ever present reality of police brutality that has become an epidemic in the nation for people of color  and instead of seeing her performance as something that can bring people together to tackle hate  giuliani saw it as a tribute to the black panthers brian kilmeade said  i couldn t really make out what beyonc  was saying  but at the end  we find out beyonc  dressed up in a tribute to the black panthers  went to a malcolm x formation  and the song  the lyrics  which i couldn t make out a syllable  were basically telling cops to stop shooting blacks  okay  first of all  here s who beyonc  seemed to be paying tribute to  after all the entire halftime show was paying tribute to past performers michael jackson  beyonce   superbowl pic twitter com   zellie   zellieimani  february    news  though  knowing they have to cater to their racist fan base  insists it s a tribute to the black panthers secondly  if she is speaking of police brutality  what better stage than one that is being watched by over  million viewers worldwide  it is a national epidemic that is obvious to anyone who isn t a raging racist giuliani chimed in with  i think it was outrageous  the halftime show i thought was ridiculous anyway  i don t know what the heck it was  a bunch of people like bouncing around and doing strange things  i actually don t even know why we have this  i thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers  who are the people who protect her  what we should be doing in the african american community and all communities is build up respect for police officers  he apparently doesn t see that  while yes  police officers should be respected  many of these officers need to also respect the citizens they are paid to serve and protect the former mayor continued  this is a political position and she s probably going to take advantage of it  you re talking to middle america when you have the super bowl  so if you re going to have entertainment  let s have decent  wholesome entertainment  and not use it as a platform to attack the people who put their lives at risk just to save us  yes  let s not ever make people think about things  let s keep things clean and under cover  like apparently this entire couch when they are wearing their white sheets at the local klan meeting  what the actual fuck  they are being racist  at this point  to just be racist  beyonc s performance was flawless and entertaining  see it for what it is  and not for what your racist brain twists it to be watch the whole exchange here  video featured image fromraw story youtube
