many republicans have a clever way of remembering history  instead of acknowledging that former president george w  bush had the terror which occurred on    happen under his watch  they skillfully say nothing happened after     completely ignoring the fact that yes  in fact  intelligence was ignored completely  and george w  bush  alongside his administration p  f cked up big time  big time  if they d own that  you could almost respect the candor  but since they can t  they just look utterly moronic and slightly evil this is what just happened  yet again  on real time with bill maher when republican bush apologist ana navarro was trying to defend george w  bush and state the case for jeb bush  not only that  she couldn t seem to acknowledge the fact that what w did to get us into a war in iraq was not only false and horrific  but should be considered a war crime  he and his administration manufactured intelligence to make their case  and with most smart minded folks out there understanding this and willfully acknowledging this fact  many would even go so far as to call him a war criminal  which is exactly what fellow real time guest margaret cho did after a discussion about how the best way to prevent veterans from needing help would be to not create veterans in the first place by unnecessarily going to war  cho chimes in  and says  i think george w  bush is a war criminal  he sent all those people to die  and as harsh as that sounds  it s true  he betrayed the trust of not only the american people  but more so of our men and women in uniform  he sent them to a war based on lies and thousands of them died  and even more came home injured both physically and mentally  it is most definitely criminal behavior and w alongside his administration should still be held accountable navarro  unwilling to accept reality  came back at cho with  let s not throw around that term so loosely  i mean  i know you are a comedian and everything  but war criminals are nazis  which is when maher chimed in and asked her not to use  comedian  in such a disparaging tone as though those who are funny for a living can t be serious  in fact  comedians  of all people  are able to dissect reality much more thoroughly than others who just view it on the surface and their insight is quite valuable  because they can often see things others can t if you find yourself defending the incompetency of george w  bush and ignoring the reality that    occurred on his watch  or defending his lies that led us into iraq  you need to take a good  long look at yourself and what you really stand for as a human being living in what s supposed to be a civilized society watch the tense moment between panelists here video featured image from youtube
