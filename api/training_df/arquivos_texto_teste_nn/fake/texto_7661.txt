mitt romney looked like a defeated man too embarrassed to admit that the rise of donald trump is partly his fault during an appearance on fox news sunday  the former republican presidential nominee  was forced to confront the reality that accepting donald trump s endorsement in  legitimized the current republican front runner among conservative voters fox host chris wallace mentioned that romney  had a very different view of him four years ago when he endorsed you   and proceeded to remind romney of that endorsement by playing video of him accepting it and touting trump as a successful businessman in the process romney responded by saying that just because someone endorsed him doesn t mean he thinks they can be president   sixty one million people voted for me    romney said   i don t think all  million ought to be president of the united states  but wallace hit romney like a ton of bricks by pointing out that romney is flip flopping  a charge that hurt romney repeatedly during the  election as romney sat and listened in defeated silence  wallace told him that most of the business failures romney listed during his anti trump speech actually occurred prior to  when romney praised trump s business experience and knowledge of how the economy works  but you were talking at the time about his extraordinary ability to create jobs  his understanding of the economy  it s not like   donald trump   everything you believe he did wrong has happened in the last four years  a lot of those business failures you talk about happened before   before   he was making the birther argument that president obama needed to show his birth certificate because he wasn t born in the united states  i guess part of the question is  by legitimizing him back then  were you part of the reason he is where he is now  rather than answer for the flip flopping  romney attacked trump and his policies  saying that they aren t good for america or the republicans party here s the video via youtube sorry  mitt  it s a little too late to come out against trump  like  four years too late featured image via screen capture
