donald trump  the republican presidential primary front runner and likely nominee  is under fire for making his supporters raise their right hands and pledge to vote for him  the pageantry of the pledge has led people to draw comparisons between trump and hitler the pledge became known to the larger public after a campaign rally in orlando  florida  the language that trump used during the event is worthy of analysis  during the campaign event  trump asks his supporters to raise their right hand  trump then tells them to pledge to  vote for donald j  trump for president   trump concludes the pledge  saying  don t forget you all raised your hand  you swore  bad things happen if you don t live up to what you just did  you can watch video footage of the event below  raise your right hand   donald trump makes fl crowd swear they ll show up to vote for him pic twitter com   michael c  bender   michaelcbender  march    once again  it appears that trump is using intimidation tactics  to crystallize support among his followers  trump has previously used similar vague threats while speaking of those who are working against his campaign after finding out that marlene ricketts had donated money to a super pac that is working against his campaign  trump went to twitter where he called the out the ricketts family  misspelling their name   where he said  they better be careful  they have a lot to hide  former federal prosecutor arthur ferguson has some thoughts on the legality of the matter which you can read here trump s campaign has prompted many think pieces on the rise of authoritarianism in the united states  while trump s campaign may be the one of the loudest examples of right winger s recent zeal for authoritarian figures and policies  it is by no means the only or even best example let s look at what has been going on in michigan under the administration of rick snyder  snyder and trump could not be farther apart in terms of how they present themselves to public  though they are both extreme authoritarian figures  the heart of the flint water crisis is michigan s emergency financial manager law  the law allows for the snyder administration to erode a local government s ability to do anything  enough voters gleefully cast their ballot in snyder s name believe in his cause elect him twice  the results of this erosion of democracy are now known internationally given the fact that trump is polling very well in michigan  trump will likely win michigan s primary in a landslide  that also means we can assume that snyder and trump have a substantial overlap in their fan base  so what we are seeing right now is the rise of a right wing that is both willing to respond positively to a presidential candidate who is happy to make vague threats towards them at a campaign rally  while willing to suspend their voice in local political affairs this should lend more credence to the idea that trump s supporters are supporting a fascist candidate  more than any endorsement from a has been hate preacher should  there are many interpretations of what a fascist and fascism are   i prefer the interpretation that a fascist society is one where the means of production have been seized and perverted into a means of destruction  or in other words  it is when a society s economy commits suicide  in flint  and elsewhere across the u s  we have seen that the right wing is willing to destroy entire populations in the name of trickle down economics while handing over their political agency to an authoritarian figure featured image from video screen capture via twitter
