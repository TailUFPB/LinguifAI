you may have seen the pocket version of the united states constitution the bundy bunch carries around  the distinctive picture of george washington on the cover is a clear giveaway that not only do these imbeciles not understand the laws of our land  they rely on the interpretations of a man whose thoughts on the hallowed document have been compared to  a warm bucket of spit  it s a convenient version for the right wing terrorist  it retains the original spelling and punctuation from the  century  leaving it completely intact and just the way they like it  read between the lines  however  and you ll find the thoughts and analysis of a man who once called president eisenhower a soviet agent  his name is w  cleon skousen  once referred to by time magazine as  an exemplar of the right wing ultras  skousen s commentary has long been mocked as an attempt to connect the constitution to religion  making it a favorite among zealots and meatheads like the oregon  patriots   it holds dear the idea that america was founded as a  christian nation  and includes such revolutionary insights as this  w  cleon skousenit s not only his own thoughts added that make skousen s pamphlet such a perversion of the actual constitution but the thoughts of some of the founders themselves  taken completely out of context and used as talking points to sell a disturbing message  for example  john adams  who said   our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people   was taken from a letter to militia intended to see them do more good deeds for the people the pamphlet  available for  cents  has zero respect in the educated world  scholars have repudiated its teachings for decades and its author ended up dying in obscurity without ever achieving his goal of convincing people who government was of the people  by the people  and for god ammon bundy  who has been photographed both at the current occupation and at the bundy  ranch  incident in   had the principles of the skousen constitution ingrained in him by his father  cliven bundy  who told the la times   it s something i ve always shared with everybody and i carry it with me all the time  that s where i get most of my information from  what we re trying to do is teach the true principles of the proper form of government  the proper form of government is apparently one discredited right wing nutjob s distorted views of a document that has been proven time and time again to have nothing to do with religion  the modern conservative just loves it  however  because it embodies everything they believe in  with the skousen atrocity of critical thought in their pockets  they are prepared to do whatever it takes to see that they can do whatever they want while denying actual constitutional rights to people who disagree with them the terrorists in oregon have decided to use one very specific portion of the pamphlet that pertains to  the enclave clause   which they believe means that the federal government cannot own land  they believe that because it says it  right there in black in white  in the one and only skousen mockery of the constitution here s bundy buffoon jon ritzheimer  making a ridiculous argument for the enclave clause  which he clearly doesn t understand  while holding his very own copy of this perverted pamphlet https   www facebook com scrappyphx rider videos  you can read about the actual meaning of the enclave clause here it s absolutely amazing that so many people have decided to be influenced by one discredited man s interpretation of a document that is over  years old  while this is america and everyone is entitled to their opinion  article  section  pretty clearly reserves the right to decide matters of law and equity arising under the constitution to the supreme court  who typically  though not always  rely on a couple of centuries of precedent  not the opinion of one asshole  to make their decisions  they sit in a really big building in washington dc that is most definitely owned by the federal government the bottom line is  these people have been seriously misguided by a strange and lonely man whose views have been circulated among extremists and laughed at by scholars since the  featured image via screen capture
