it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out one shouldn t dance at a funeral  but considering former president george w  bush is a few sandwiches short of a picnic  he never seemed to learn that lesson while at the funeral for the five slain officers in dallas  texas  bush joined president obama  first lady michelle obama  as well as vice president joe biden  dr  jill biden  and his wife laura at one point during the service  the choir began singing  the battle hymn of the republic  and with its marching beat  the former president took this as a cue to begin to pretend to march  he swayed from side to side and even seemed to try to get his wife and michelle obama to join in it was at that point that the first lady shot bush a look that could burn a thousand homes  and laura bush seemed to whisper at him that he needed to stop  common sense would allow most people to realize that sort of behavior  especially from a former president  isn t appropriate  but president bush has never been known for his common sense watch it all happen here laura bush   george  george  be reverent  we re on tv   pic twitter com   sarah burris   sarahburris  july    image via video screen capture of sarah burris twitter
