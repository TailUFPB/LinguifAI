the stephen colbert we love was in rare form wednesday night when he was asked by an audience member what one question he would ask donald trump  let s just say it s good he wasn t on air at the time  my question is  if you had donald trump on your show tonight  what would you ask him   the woman who identified herself as a college student asked wednesday  hours after the republican presidential nominee encouraged russia to hack into hillary clinton s emails source  raw storyif you recall  trump has a rather cozy relationship with the russian dictator  vladimir putin  after an apparent russian hack on the democratic national committee s email server  trump  who has exchanged praise with putin in the past  encouraged russia to hack some more  russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   mr  trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to mrs  clinton s deleted emails   i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press  source  new york timescolbert is brilliant  he could have said that he d ask trump about the legalities of colluding with a foreign leader to help sway the american election  he could have said he d ask about treason  instead  colbert chose to ask the billionaire this colbert thought about the woman s question for a moment  apparently trying to decide whether to say his answer out loud  we re not broadcasting right now  so i d say   what does vladimir putin s dick taste like   colbert asked then the band started playing before colbert laughed and said   that s a fine joke  don t tell your grandkids that joke  here s the video colbert s audience didn t seem to take offense  there was a pretty healthy round of applause  although it might have been a little reserved  just out of shock  they probably aren t used to colbert playing blue featured image via video screen capture
