florida republicans  war on women is going strong this week  on monday  republicans in the house made the first step towards violating the constitutional rights of every woman in the state by voting to allow a bill to progress that would ban nearly all abortions the house criminal justice committee voted   to pass house bill   the  florida for life act   the bill defines life as starting at conception and would require two physicians to certify that an abortion is required to save the life of the mother  chances of the bill actually making it to the house or senate floor for a vote are slim  but republicans claim they knew that when they voted on it  in fact  the only reason they proposed the bill was to appease rep  charles van zant  the lawmaker is in his final term and his filed the bill every year he has been in office rep  ross spano  r womanhaterville   who voted for the bill told the associated press that he was just wasting time by voting for it  the bill  probably  frankly  in all due respect  is never going to get a hearing in the senate  although this bill has a very small chance of making it through the other channels it needs to go through before it is brought to a full vote  there is a possibility that it may  florida s is bleeding red at the state level and republicans across the country have been chomping at the bit to destroy women s rights  the fake planned parenthood videos that were spread by alleged felons renewed the gop s determination to outlaw abortions according to the ap the bill is one of several pieces of anti abortion legislation now advancing in the florida legislature other bills that have received approval by at least one committee include measures that would prohibit medicaid payments to any clinic where abortions are performed  require doctors who perform abortions to have local hospital admitting privileges  and require abortion clinics to meet the same construction standards and other licensing requirements as walk in surgical centers  and prohibit use of fetal tissue resulting from an abortion for research in other words  they are hitting women from every possible angle and trying to wedge their unwelcome elephant firmly in our uteri  they don t care that they are wasting time and therefore  wasting money by voting on these bills because ideology always comes before the constitution and fiscal responsibility in the mind of a republican featured image  instagram
