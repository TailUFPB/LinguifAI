you just can t make this level of cronyism up  it s a blatant disregard for laws  rules and just about everything else unethical  but this is the clintons so the rules don t apply to them  they are sickeningly corrupt grifters who have been able to get away with just about everything for decades  it s time to call them out and hold them accountable for their lawlessness  the american people need to be able to trust their government will follow the rule of law  the time is now president trump tweeted out to call out the fbi s andrew mccabe on his cronyism with the clintons and misuse of fbi email president trump tweeted sunday that fbi deputy director andrew mccabe allegedly used his official agency email account to  promote  his wife s failed  attempt to win  as a democrat  a virginia state senate seat   foxnews fbi s andrew mccabe   in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m  clinton puppet   he was using  allegedly  his fbi official email account to promote her campaign  you obviously cannot do this  these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    the president has long been a critic of the fbi s cronyism with the clintons  our previous report on what went on when andrew mccabe s wife ran for virginia state senate is unbelievably corrupt our report on the clinton crony back in october spells out the corruption how much more criminal activity are american voters willing to overlook  have we  as americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by hillary or anyone attached to hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation  are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in america  the political organization of virginia gov  terry mcauliffe  an influential democrat with longstanding ties to bill and hillary clinton  gave nearly    to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the federal bureau of investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into mrs  clinton s email use campaign finance records show mr  mcauliffe s political action committee donated    to the  state senate campaign of dr  jill mccabe  who is married to andrew mccabe  now the deputy director of the fbi the virginia democratic party  over which mr  mcauliffe exerts considerable control  donated an additional    worth of support to dr  mccabe s campaign in the form of mailers  according to the records  that adds up to slightly more than    to her candidacy from entities either directly under mr  mcauliffe s control or strongly influenced by him  the figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds dr  mccabe raised in the effort mr  mcauliffe and other state party leaders recruited dr  mccabe to run  according to party officials  she lost the election to incumbent republican dick black a spokesman for the governor said he  supported jill mccabe because he believed she would be a good state senator  this is a customary practice for virginia governors  any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous  among political candidates that year  dr  mccabe was the third largest recipient of funds from common good va  the governor s pac  according to campaign finance records  dan gecker received    from the pac and    from the state party for a campaign that raised    million  according to records  and jeremy mcpike received    from the pac and    from the state party  raising more    million that year for his candidacy the governor could recall only one meeting with mr  mccabe when he and other state democrats met with the couple on march     to urge dr  mccabe to run  according to the spokesman the fbi said in a statement that during his wife s campaign mr  mccabe  played no role  attended no events  and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind  months after the completion of her campaign  then associate deputy director mccabe was promoted to deputy  where  in that position  he assumed for the first time  an oversight role in the investigation into secretary clinton s emails  fbi officials said that after that meeting with the governor in richmond on march   mr  mccabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it  avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in virginia  and avoiding any campaign activity or events mr  mccabe s supervision of the clinton email case in  wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and mr  mcauliffe wasn t part of the email probe  officials said  once i decided to run   dr  mccabe said   my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children  as a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate  mr  mccabe is a longtime fbi official who focused much of his career on terrorism  his wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern virginia  where the couple live with their children the  virginia state senate race was dr  mccabe s first run for office and her campaign spent    million  the race was part of mr  mcauliffe s failed effort to win a democratic majority in the virginia legislature  which would have given him significantly more sway in richmond  the state capital mr  mcauliffe has been a central figure in the clintons  political careers for decades  in the   he was bill clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters  mrs  clinton appeared with him in northern virginia in  as he sought to increase the number of democrats in the state legislature  for entire story  wsj
