fox news host bill o reilly and fox business host lou dobbs made a pathetically lame attempt to defend donald trump s hesitance to release his tax returns  in doing so  they made a disgraceful comparison between the presumptive republican nominee and jesus christ succeeding in making himself look even more suspicious  trump has recently broken his previous promise to release his tax returns before election day  announcing the news on wednesday  trump said his sorry excuse was that a federal audit needed to be completed before he could release them   which is an absolute lie that o reilly and dobbs failed to call him out on on o reilly s show  dobbs came to the business mogul s defense  why should he turn over his tax returns when he s being audited  e is facing a hostile national media that no matter how pristine those returns  it s going to find something to pick at and blow up  and then use it as some shiny object to distract from the issue  o reilly pointed out that releasing those documents would be a  good move  on trump s part  considering that his honesty was questioned by partisans   it would not only be a good idea   it would be standard practice  trump is now the first nominee not to disclose his tax returns since   even former president richard nixon  who was under audit  didn t hesitate to release his tax returns   a fact that makes trump s secrecy look more shady than ever dobbs pushed logic aside and said  after the first billion  i lose interest   he also failed to answer o reilly when he asked if there was anything that dobbs hadn t liked about trump s campaign  dobbs refused to give him a straight answer  because you d be just like the rest of those guys in the national media  you just focus on it  o reilly pushed back and said  i m asking you as an analyst  you are not willing to say one thing   when dobbs continued to dance around the question  o reilly yelled  if he is jesus  how can you analyze him  dobbs said  how can i analyze him  because i have a superior mind that competes at least fairly favorably with your own  o reilly giggled and replied with something truly idiotic  okay  let s just recap  according to dobbs  donald trump is jesus  and jesus never put out his tax returns  ever  dobbs completely threw all intelligence out the window when he said   that s a line that i can actually agree with  you can watch the puzzling clip below featured image via jim mcisaac   getty images
