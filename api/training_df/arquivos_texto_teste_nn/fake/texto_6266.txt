talk of impeaching our first african american president is like oxygen to republicans   if they don t mention it incessantly  their tiny little brains shrivel up and they die  this is a scientific fact that i completely made up but has a strong basis in reality  our frenemies on the right have come up with some real doozies when explaining their repeated attempts to get the black man out of the white house in   michigan rep  tim walberg wanted to impeach barack obama in an effort to get his birth certificate  in   former minnesota state rep  allen quist said that the president should be impeached because he isn t deporting brown people quickly enough  that same year  texas congressional candidate wes riddle decided the black man should be impeached for satisfying the conditions of a treaty ratified under george h w  bush  a year prior  tea party texas rep  michael burgess suggested impeachment for no better reason than to block obama s agenda  the month before that  gop rep  tim scott wanted obama impeached because he wouldn t allow the country to default on its debts  weeks after that  rep  steve king agreed with this ridiculous notion if we were to translate all of these moronic reasons to impeach the president  they all boil down to one thing   he s black   but as monumentally stupid as those are  oklahoma s state legislature has managed to come up with some new and original that dwarfs all previous reasons republicans wanted to impeach the president in the scale of their stupidity  reuters reports that oklahoma republicans have filed a measure calling for obama s impeachment because of   lawmakers say they want to get president obama out of office because he overstepped his constitution authority by protecting transgender students from being harassed by their ideological counterparts across the nation  in fact  they feel so strongly on the issue that are already taking up a measure that would allow students to claim a religious right to have  separate but equal   where have we heard that phrase before   bathrooms and changing facilities to keep them away from scary transgender people lawmakers in the socially conservative state are also expected to take up a measure as early as friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students the bill introduced on thursday night could force schools into costly construction  which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a    billion state budget shortfall the impeachment resolution also introduced on thursday night calls on the oklahoma members of the u s  house of representatives to file articles of impeachment against obama  the u s  attorney general  the u s  secretary of education and others over the letter oklahoma state rep  john bennett called president obama s tyrannical decree that transgender people deserve equal rights  biblically wrong    a phrase that should never enter politics   and a violation of state sovereignty  in a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis  our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth   troy stevenson  executive director of lgbt advocacy group freedom oklahoma  said of this ridiculous resolution this decision comes on the heels of oklahoma republicans  decision to make it a felony to perform abortions  not only would doctors face time behind bars  but they would be  prohibited from obtaining or renewing a license to practice medicine in this state  if they allow a woman to choose whether or not to carry a fetus to term  the bill passed the house   and the senate    so it seems likely that something equally asinine   like impeaching obama over something stupid   would be just as popular featured image via getty images pool
