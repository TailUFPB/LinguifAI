on friday  amy schumer released a sketch that had been cut from her comedy central show  inside amy schumer  it s a simple but incredibly dark set up  a commercial for an injury lawyer that has given up on helping the victims of mass shootings because the gun industry is almost completely protected by the law h  jon benjamin  the voice of sterling archer on fx s archer  introduces himself  have you ever been injured in a mass shooting or other gun crime  do you want justice  hi  i m toby shrak of the law firm of shrak and murphy  but don t call me  because there s nothing i can do  and it gets darker from there  we re introduced to shrak s twin brother that was killed in a mall shooting  we also meet two victims of gun violence that were   shit out of luck   one of them even had to pay for the ammo company s legal costs because the law prevents them from being sued in the first place  isn t america grand schumer  fed up with the inaction of the gop  felt it was time for this particular sketch to be seen  it highlights the cruel absurdity of american gun laws that protect an entire industry from the consequences of their actions while they rake in billions from selling death and promoting a culture of violence  it s dark satire at its finest and most necessary shrak closes out the commercial with a perfect depiction of the miserable despair the country is forced to live with because republicans have whored out their souls to the nra and gun lobby  i ll get the money you deserve  unless it s a gun tragedy  in which case  you can call me just to talk  i m here and my brother s chair is always empty  because he s dead  and i am getting old  as funny as it is  it s hard to laugh because the commercial simply cuts too close to the truth inside amy schumerfeatured image via screen capture
