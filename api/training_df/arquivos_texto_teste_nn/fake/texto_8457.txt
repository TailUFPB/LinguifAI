ben carson is having a really bad week  he s had a lot of bad weeks recently  but this one is particularly bad the last republican debate was considered carson s do or die moment and he died  unambiguously  while we all watched  the once rising star of the  election went out  not with a bang  but with a characteristic whisper  a soft  monotone word salad  his trademark  by the end of the night  carson was misquoting the preamble to the constitution and perhaps slowly realizing that this would be the last time many people would ever remember he ever had run for president at all the very next day  while carson slept off his post relevancy hangover and waited to come in  in iowa  his campaign chairman robert dees was talking to reporters  normally this would be a good thing  but dees happens to be a raging homophobe and the questions happened to be about gay soldiers speaking with radio host alan colmes  dees was insistent that gay people cannot be allowed to be open about their sexual orientation or risk destroying the entire military  well the ultimate test for military effectiveness is readiness  it s cohesion  and anything that detracts from that is important  dr  carson often says it s important for people to have rights in accordance with life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness in the u s  constitution  but no particular group ought to have extra rights  why would the right to be yourself be considered an  extra  right  dees explains  where the extra rights come in is when the gays in the military become somewhat militaristic to the detriment of unit cohesion   he said dees added that a question to be considered in determining policy toward gay people in the military was   whether they  in the military  flaunt it and disrupt cohesion  heaven forbid soldiers become too militaristic in the military  however  dees was not talking about fighting  he was worried that gay people would use their secret weapon   flaunting  their gayness what makes dees  statements so cringeworthy is that he isn t just an idiot  he s an idiot who used to be a general in the military  as such  he might have bothered to read up on the military s own research into how gay people effect a unit s cohesion  all the way back in   the pentagon was telling the president and the nation that repealing  don t ask  don t tell  and letting gay people serve openly did nothing but bring the military in line with where the country already was  the general lesson we take from   transformational experiences in history is that in matters of personnel change within the military  predictions and surveys tend to overestimate negative consequences  and underestimate the u s  military s ability to adapt and incorporate within it ranks the diversity that is reflective of american society at large   the report concluded going further this report confirms that  by every measure   from unit cohesion to recruitment and retention to family readiness   we can transition to a new policy in a responsible manner that ensures our military strength and national security   obama said in a written statement secretary of defense robert gates and the joint chiefs of staff chairman adm  mike mullen were also strongly in favor of dropping the ludicrous dadt policy  since its dissolution  the military hasn t crumbled  nobody is  flaunting  anything  the military continues to be one of the strongest and best trained fighting forces in the world dees is certainly living in a fantasy world  but it s hard to expect much who decided to ride ben carson s coat tails all the way to a massive loss in the very first primary and an inevitable campaign suspension  carson s track record on talking about gay americans isn t much better  during his brief moment in the national spotlight  he once floated the idea that prison rape turns people gay much of carson s campaign has been predicated on the idea that he is above the fray  he s consistently pleaded with his fellow candidates and the nation more generally to stop the mudslinging  it s an admirable goal   which happens to be total malarkey  carson has never had a problem with going after  liberals    gay people    muslims   or any other group he feels doesn t align with his worldview  gay people can t serve in the military  muslims can t be president  liberals can t well  do anything in the end  the only group of people who seem safe in carson s america are conservative christians like himself  how brave feature image via fox news screengrab
