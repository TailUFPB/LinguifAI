a creationist tried to debate an atheist about evolution and he got owned within seconds outside the recently opened noah s ark museum in kentucky  which took   million from taxpayers in violation of the separation of church and state  protesters gathered to counter the bullshit creation story that ken ham is trying to shove down everyone s throats noted atheist aron ra joined the protesters and was soon challenged to a debate on evolution by creationist eric hovind  a fundamentalist christian who agrees with ham that the earth is only   years old and that dinosaurs and humans existed at the same time despite all the science that proves otherwise conservative  christians  like hovind and ham reject evolution science and advocate for teaching creationism in science class in order to indoctrinate kids into christianity against their will but after the way hovind got his ass handed to him by science during this encounter on thursday  it s clear why creationism should never be taught in schools  there are hundreds of state funded museums around the world teaching the religion of evolution   hovind whined even though evolution is science  not religion one protester pointed out that those state funded museums do not discriminate against against people seeking employment the way the ark museum discriminates against anyone who isn t a christian who shares their beliefs ra responded by noting that unlike creationism  evolution is  demonstrable verifiable science  hovind s only comeback was to continue branding evolution a  religious worldview  ra made sure everyone present knew that hovind s only defense of his beliefs is to tell lies about evolution hovind then asked the question that got him owned  do you believe we came from an ape like ancestor   hovind demanded to know at this point  ra used science as a club and beat hovind over the head with it  apes don t have tails   learn taxonomy   ra said to cheers from the crowd   so yes  you are an ape  by definition  in fact  he s absolutely right  as raw story explained from a biological standpoint  apes are a classification of anthropoid primates that don t have tails  there are two different families of apes  hylobatidae and hominidae  the hominidae branch includes orangutans  gorillas  and  yes  humans with no other way to counter ra  hovind and his band of thugs resorted to accusing ra of sounding like hitler  which pretty much means hovind knows he got beat here s the video via facebook the bottom line is that earth is billions of years old and dinosaurs died out  million years ago before humans arrived on the scene  stunts like the ark park are efforts by organized religion to brainwash kids taxpayer dollars should never have been used to help build this abomination and quite frankly it should open the door for the government to finally tax the churches  because if churches can receive tax dollars to help them push their bullshit  they should have to pay taxes in return featured image via screen capture
