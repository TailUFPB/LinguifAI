bernie sanders just received a major endorsement from the legendary activist  environmentalist  economist  and  in my opinion  one of coolest people ever   winona laduke laduke s endorsement of bernie sanders came in the form of a video where she praised sanders  vision for a fossil free future  our lands   as indigenous lands   are the place where most of the oil and gas  and a good portion of the uranium and coal comes from  the easiest answer for the future generations is to keep it in the ground  and we are thankful for bernie sanders for saying  let s  keepitintheground   don t make a mess we can t clean up  laduke said here is the video https   www facebook com midwestforbernie videos   fref nffor those not familiar with laduke s history  she is an indigenous american who has worked tirelessly fighting for tribal rights and sustainable development  winona laduke is an anishinaabekwe  ojibwe  enrolled member of the mississippi band anishinaabeg  after graduating from harvard  laduke has spent her career writing about issues that hurt indigenous groups and the environment  laduke currently works as the director of honor the earth it is not surprising that laduke has decided to endorse sanders for president  sanders has an ambitious plan to completely transform the united states energy infrastructure  what s really great about sanders   keep it in the ground  strategy  is that so much of it can be accomplished without the approval of congress the president of the united states has the authority to prevent the state department from granting leases to fossil fuel companies if they want to extract dirty fuels from federal land  president obama recently used this power to put a quasi moratorium on leases for coal mines  as president  sanders would also be able to not give leases to companies who wish to build pipelines across international borders one aspect of sanders  energy plan should be of particular interest to both racial justice groups  environmentalists  and those who work in their intersection  sanders recognizes the disparity of the impact fossil fuel extraction and usage has on indigenous peoples and communities of color  that s why he supports legislation that would work to halt the devastation fossil fuels are causing while creating millions of new jobs  sanders co sponsored the  keep it in the ground act  last year  when he did he released a video explain why we need to transform our nation s energy system you can watch the video below  featured image from video screenshot via facebook
