has there ever been a us olympic athlete who  before representing the united states in the olympic games  discussed whether or not they would be  representing  our president  aren t the u s  olympic athletes made aware fairly early on  that they re representing our nation  i don t remember ever seeing any of our athletes carrying a flag with a picture of the president of the united states  or wearing apparel covered with the president s image or name  so why is lindsey vonn making a statement about how she s not going to be representing president trump  does anyone really care about lindsey vonn s opinion about president trump  fox news  olympic gold medal skier lindsey vonn says she ll represent the united states  but not president trump  when she returns to the winter games in february vonn  who won a gold medal in the women s downhill competition in  in vancouver  skipped the  sochi games because of knee injuries  i hope to represent the people of the united states  not the president   vonn said this week amid the buildup to the  games in pyeongchang  south korea  i take the olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent  what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremonies   she added  i want to represent our country well  and i don t think there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that  vonn also told cnn that she would  absolutely not  accept an invitation to the white house isn t this really more about a former olympic athlete with an over inflated ego and an overblown sense of how important her opinions are to the american people than anything else
