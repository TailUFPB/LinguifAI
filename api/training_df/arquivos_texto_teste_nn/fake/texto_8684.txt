governor greg abbott of texas recently traveled to israel to kiss the ring of bibi netanyahu  while there  he pledged that he will do what he can as texas  leader to obey israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re antagonize iran abbott  like most republicans  owes his true loyalty to netanyahu s craving for discord instead of america s effort at peace and cooperation  abbott pledged to craft laws in texas to curb the flow of any public funds to iran  he seeks to accomplish this by banning any state level investments in iran or by banning texas government from doing business with any company that does business in iran  the second part of that is particularly hypocritical  republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals  however  when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of benjamin netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted when asked for an example of how many texan public dollars flow to iran  governor abbott s office was unable to provide any figures  without some real data  the impact of abbott s new laws will be unproven at best  and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination  fiscal conservatism at its best governor abbott will obviously not be able to single handedly bring iran to its knees over new state level  sanctions   but the politics on this are clear  republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for president obama on his diplomatic victory with iran  being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus featured image via flickr
