now  some may say because senator ted cruz  r tx  was born to an american citizen  even while in canada  he is to be considered a  natural born  citizen  however  when looking at the constitution in the context of the time frame that is was written  and in regards to how certain laws were to be read  that  natural born  status actually may not apply to the senator why  because  unlike today  in   when woman are considered equals among men  for the most part   when the constitution was written by our founders it was quite a sexist time legal scholar thomas lee from fordham university believes that cruz should be disqualified  and as the washington post describes  on this straightforward  intuitive  and deeply conservative reasoning  several prominent legal scholars have argued cruz is arguably not a natural born citizen  as the founding fathers and their contemporaries probably would have understood that phrase  the argument goes  cruz is ineligible for the presidency   not because he was born in canada  but because he was born in canada to a cuban father  furthermore  under king edward iii  who reigned from  to   england expanded this definition to include the children of ambassadors and soldiers who were serving the monarch overseas  in the centuries to come  parliament modified the definition further to include the children of private english subjects who happened to be abroad in the late  century  though  that definition did not include english mothers who were traveling  if they conceived children with foreign men  it was assumed those children would not be loyal english subjects and were not considered  natural born  yikes  looks like cruz isn t a natural born citizen after all  well  at least if we go by the united states constitution as it was originally written and intended  which  strict  constitutional conservatives  like a certain sen  ted cruz claim so adamantly to be  he might as well excuse himself from the presidential race right now  unless  of course  he s not a strict constitutionalist and doesn t want to abide by the founding fathers original intent how  dare  he  truth be told  we really don t know the founding fathers true intention  and can only go by how  natural born  was defined in the era that the phrase was first prescribed  everything else is hearsay and interpreted to fit specific agendas  such as  wanting to allow a canadian born to a cuban dissident to be president of the united states   sure  his mother was an american citizen  but if we are to abide by the law as originally intended  this surely may disqualify cruz  all because the founding fathers were harshly sexist how much do you want to bet ted cruz wishes he was a women s rights activist now  oops featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
