this week marked a particularly shameful level of the kind of republican obstruction that has now become the norm  as reports came in that zika had hit the united states with a vengeance  a crucial spending bill that would have allocated funds to fight the devastating illness was derailed  having ignored the request by president obama at the advice of disease scientists for    billion for research and prevention  republicans offered first just half of that  then just a third the sheer heartlessness astounded even some among the republican party  senator marco rubio  whose state of florida is ground zero for the zika virus  gave a strongly worded condemnation of his colleagues  actions on capitol hill  the rest of the country merely braced for what is going to be a very scary summer but while republicans once again proved they have absolutely no interest in fulfilling even basic levels of governance  they were busy wasting everyone s time on something else  given the stakes of the spending bill they didn t pass  what they did do is especially offensive just as the house was derailing the zika funding  and an energy and water bill for that matter   they were drafting up a petition to demand the library of congress go back to using the degrading term  illegal alien  to refer to undocumented immigrants  that s how they spent their work week republicans on a powerful house panel tuesday narrowly defended a tea party fueled move to tell the library of congress how to label immigrants living in the country illegally the gop move is designed to force the library of congress to retain the term  illegal alien  for cataloging and search purposes  reversing the library s plan to replace  illegal alien  with less prejudicial terms like  noncitizens  or  unauthorized immigration  the library of congress has previously explained to republicans that using the term  illegal alien  in its records is both offensive and confusing  for one thing  library employees pointed out  the term  alien  could mean a space alien  nobody is going to confuse an  unauthorized immigrant  with et this year  congress scheduled itself for the least amount of workdays of any congressional term in modern history  just  days will be spent  legislating   and let s use that term loosely here   this is partly because republicans have come to the conclusion that the best way to reduce government is to make it dysfunctional  but the other reason is that republican leaders have realized that with an election coming up  their fanatical anti government base will abandon them if they even so much as think about reaching across the aisle  even for something as important as funding the fight against a virus that causes severe birth defects  so instead they ve taken to sitting on their hands  cowardly  craven  cynical  all of the above it s comforting to know that in the short time that they do spend on lawmaking  republicans have their priorities in order  zika funding  no  supreme court confirmation hearings  nah  changing the semantics of the cataloging and search functions in the library of congress so as to be intentionally derogatory  you better believe it featured image via win mcnamee getty images
