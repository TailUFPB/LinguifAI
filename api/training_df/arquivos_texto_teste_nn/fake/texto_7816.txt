thankfully  chris christie proved he was beyond shame when he endorsed donald trump for president  but this moment had to sting a little bit in a humiliating moment for the one time republican presidential candidate  a hot mic captured the way donald trump treats his new lap dog   and it isn t pretty at a rally  christie seemed to think he would share the stage with trump during trump s portion of the event  but apparently the idea of sharing a spotlight with a former rival wasn t something trump was about to let happen  shaking christie s hand  trump leans in and whispers   get on the plane and go home  it s over there  go home   christie at first continues waving  then simply says  okay  and walks towards the exit here s the video whether trump was trying to be nice by sparing christie yet another stump speech is not clear  but what is clear is that trump would much prefer it if his  friends  avoided trying to take too much of the attention away from him it s probably a tough pill to swallow  but christie must surely realize by now that by endorsing trump  he doesn t get to share in the republican front runners spotlight  viciously jealous  astoundingly egotistical  trump has always been a one man operation  he will share his fame with no one christie  of course  knows all of this  months ago he was loudly suggesting that trump was not presidential material  and just  days before saying this there is no one who is better prepared to provide america with the strong leadership that it needs both at home and around the world than donald trump   christie said   he is looking at the five people on that stage last night the clear standout and the person who will do exactly what needs to be done to make america a leader around the world again  christie was saying this bravado  by itself  is not a plan   he said   i like him  he s a good person  he s just not the right person to be president of the united states and not the person that we d want representing our country  now that christie needs to take orders from trump  mockery was quick on social media trump to christie  https   t co   deray mckesson   deray  february    good  https   t co   michael moore   mmflint  february    now trump appears to tell christie to go home https   t co   zeke miller   zekejmiller  february    s face when trump tells him to go home  crestfallen  https   t co   peter hasson   peterjhasson  february    christie be relieved to go back home to new jersey  it doesn t seem likely  having been on the road for the last few months  christie has gotten the luxury of forgetting the mess that he left behind in the state he is supposed to be governing  but now it appears he doesn t have much choice  get on the plane and go home  christie featured image via abc news screengrab
