 it has nothing to do with russia  that s the story the trump campaign is sticking to  paul manafort  trump s dictator protecting campaign manager  has doubled down  we are not releasing his tax returns  the reason  his taxes are under audit  so they can t  even though the head of the irs completely debunked that claim on live national television  for months democrats and even republicans have been hounding the  billionaire  mogul to release his tax returns  a standard that every presidential hopeful has met over the last several decades  but trump seems to be the only one who will not do it  even romney  after enough prodding  did it there s several theories as to why he won t release them  the first is that they will show he s not actually a billionaire  another is that it will show he has overvalued his properties  which has already been shown he has  and his businesses  the third option is that it will show he paid virtually nothing in taxes  certainly not his fair share and the fourth  and now most plausible theory   he has ties to russian interests oligarchs  that s the theory of conservative columnist george will  given that the fbi has a strong case linking russia to the dnc email hack  and trump s campaign manager has close ties to russia  and that trump has business dealings with the authoritarian country  that theory seems to stick in people s mind  and it should trump has been a serial liar throughout this campaign  he s had the audacity to say hillary clinton has  taken money  from countries that kill gays and women  but the evidence is starting to show it is trump who has taken not only taken money  but has offered his soul to a country that also kills gays  women  and anyone who dares to dissent  remember the winter olympics controversy  for a man who claims he wants american sovereignty and autonomy  he certainly has no problem letting his buddies at the kremlin determine our political discourse of course will s speculation is just that   speculation  but it does raise the question that trump s refusal to release his tax returns and his love and shady dealings with russia and putin may be more than what meets the eye like trump university  this story won t be going away anytime soon  and the democrats certainly won t be letting it go this election  it s trump putin  featured image via sara d  davis getty images
