if you missed it in all the kerfluffle over the moron militia surrendering without a fight in oregon  cliven bundy  the moron militia s inspiration to break the law and threaten to kill people  was arrested as he attempted to join the  remaining imbeciles holed up in a wildlife refuge  but he wasn t arrested for trying to join domestic terrorists  he was arrested for his role as ringleader in the  nevada stand off in which a group of armed assholes pointed guns at federal agents and threatened to shoot them on wednesday  bundy  along with his idiot sons  was indicted and now faces life in prison all were charged with conspiracy  carrying a firearm in relation to a violent crime  obstruction of justice  extortion  and assault and threats against federal law enforcement the charge of assault on a federal law enforcement officer carries a maximum sentence of  years in prison and a    fine  if convicted  the defendants would also have to forfeit at least   million worth of property secured through the crimes  the statement said the most delicious part about this is that the bundys were so intent on making a media spectacle of their  brave  stance against the federal government that there is hours and hours of footage of them threatening to murder law enforcement and pointing their guns at agents  if they hadn t been so arrogant  they might have been able to plant the seeds of doubt in the minds of the jury  as it is  their eagerness to rally  murika to a second civil war has all but guaranteed that cliven will die in jail and his two sons will be in their  and possibly broke by the time they get out while bundy rotting in jail will put a smile on many of our faces  it does little to erase the fact that bundy and his fellow domestic terrorists walked free for over a year for a crime that would have left anyone less white or conservative riddled with bullets  white right wing privilege in this country is out of control  the only reason the moron militia thought they could get away with violently seizing a federal building is because of the fbi s lack of action in nevada  they truly and honestly thought that they could throw their temper tantrum  play freedom fighter for a few weeks and then just go home like nothing ever happened  listening to their press conferences  press conferences   and podcasts  they were shocked to their core that they would have to pay for their crimes  honestly  i m surprised none of them blurted out   but i m a white conservative  you can t arrest me  this is my country  hopefully  cliven and his followers going to prison will send a clear signal to the rest of the militia movement that their reckless disregard for the rule of law won t be tolerated in america  we should only be so lucky featured image via ai archives
