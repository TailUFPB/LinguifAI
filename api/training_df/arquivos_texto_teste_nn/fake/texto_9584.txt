the fire i can appreciate ppl being candid  don t apologize  you meant what you said  showing true colors allows ppl to see you for who you are   richard sherman     october    isn t shy about his hate for cops  his big mouth and unnecessary disrespect for a law enforcement officer didn t end up well for him  as he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct towards a police officer in  empire sports   sherman is known for his cockiness on the field and a vocabulary that can only be described as  trash talk   his passion on the field often carries over to the after game interviews  and he is the type of player seahawks fans either love or love to hate despite his reputation for attitude within the nfl  witnesses to sherman s altercation with a seattle police officer were shocked by his behavior  it was like he just picked off peyton in the super bowl  and ran it back for a touchdown or something  his cockiness was at an all time high   said curt johnson  a bystander to the incident sherman s problems arose when a police officer witnessed him jaywalking  and gave him a warning not to do it again  the officer later admitted that he wasn t so much worried about the jaywalking law in seattle  but the fact that it was a busy street and sherman could have been hurt  as several pedestrians have been hit by cars in the same area over the last few months  he asked me if i knew who he was  and i said  of course  i m a huge fan   said patrolman mike stephens    then continued to say   then you know that i own  seattle  and any  street i want to cross i can  no matter where i decide to  cross it  stephens apparently tried to apologize  and explain to sherman that he was just doing his job and that sherman s celebrity status in the city did not give him the right to curse anyone  he told me that i was a terrible police officer  and said i should just go eat some  donuts   said officer stephens   he went off on me about how he was doing better in life than i was  and said that i shouldn t even watch a seattle game again because i didn t deserve to witness the  greatness  that was him on a football field  sherman was arrested and charged with jaywalking and disorderly conduct towards a police officer in the course of his duty
