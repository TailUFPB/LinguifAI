alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore is so pissed right now ever since the u s  supreme court legalized same sex marriage in their obergefell v  hodges ruling last summer  alabama has resisted following it almost immediately  moore ordered county clerks and judges to refuse to help same sex couples get married  claiming that the nation s high court has no power to overturn a state ban on same sex marriage despite moore s efforts to keep defying the supreme court  his colleagues on the state bench made the opposite decision on friday in a single sentence  the alabama supreme court chose to not defy the high court by rejecting an anti same sex marriage case brought by the alabama citizens action program and the alabama policy institute  it is ordered that all pending motions and petitions are dismissed   the majority of the court ruled  thus ending the fight against federal authorities that moore wanted so badly according to the associated press in one of several written opinions accompanying the order  justice greg shaw called the decision a  clear refusal  to ignore the supreme court ruling last june several other state justices railed against the high court s ruling while noting they can t overturn it chief justice roy moore wrote that previous state orders barring gay marriage in alabama remain  most probate judges already are ignoring that directive  however  and hundreds of same sex couples already have wed in alabama nbc news had more about what moore wrote in his dissenting opinion quoting everything from past court rulings to the bible and the  song  feelings   the chief justice called the court s ruling  immoral  unconstitutional and tyrannical   he referred to homosexuality as a  disgrace to human nature  which can t be compared to opposite sex intimacy  sodomy has never been and never will be an act by which a marriage can be consummated   moore wrote this is a victory for the lgbt community and a victory for sanity in general  even moore s fellow judges acknowledged that the u s  supreme court has the final say and federal law trumps state law no matter how they may feel about same sex marriage personally it s definitely a significant setback for conservative  christians  in the state who were hoping to keep bigotry  hate  and their ability to discriminate at will enshrined under state law featured image via flickr
