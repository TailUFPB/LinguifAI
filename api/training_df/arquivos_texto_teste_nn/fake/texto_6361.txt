during his radio show on friday  rush limbaugh suggested that legalizing rape would be easy as long as you frame it as a civil rights issue like same sex marriage and transgender protections  the media is not covering this transgender thing the way normal people  or sane people like myself   a caller told limbaugh before launching into the myth of predators using transgender protections as a shield to sexually assault women and children in bathrooms  i don t have any daughters  but i have nieces  i have teenage nieces  i have older nieces  i have a wife  this is a safety issue  this is about a predator  like the story you just read  going into these bathrooms and taking advantage of it  and it s happening  but they re not covering it  and it s really interesting how they took gun control and turned it into gun safety  but they re not treating this as a safety issue  and the sick mind of limbaugh immediately thought of rape and how to legalize it  no  that s actually a good point  civil rights   you could legalize rape if you called it the civil rights act of   limbaugh continued  however  by whining about how much civil rights have been extended over the last few decades  especially lamenting that it now covers race  gender  and sexual orientation because he apparently believes only white straight men deserve civil rights  he also claimed it was only  a joke  so they always attach people  the reading public  the news consuming public  has been conditioned to attach the words  civil rights  to race  now it s being expanded  civil rights  gay marriage  civil rights  transgender bathroom rights  civil rights  whatever the left wants  except over here  rape has become a safety issue  but over here this stuff is a civil rights   if  when you hear the left equate anything with civil rights  what you should learn is this is how they are attempting to corrupt the culture  and they re doing it under the banner of civil rights  which is supposed to shut you up  it is supposed to silence opposition  because nobody with a brain is ever supposed to violate civil rights  never  anybody with a brain would know never to oppose anything that says  civil rights  attached to it  which is why the joke  you could legalize whatever you want by calling it the civil rights act of   because nobody would have the guts to vote against it  because if they did you d have the media  democrats running around  saying so and so voted against the civil rights act of  denying all of our citizens equal rights  blah blah blah blah blah  here s the audio via media matters in his effort to slander democrats  limbaugh also claimed that  rape has become a safety issue  for conservatives  first of all  limbaugh seems to be admitting that conservatives never cared about rape before  and second  if conservatives really believe rape is a safety issue  perhaps they should stop aiding and rewarding rapists by not forcing rape victims to carry rape pregnancies to term  furthermore  they can repeal laws that allow rapists to seek custody and visitation rights  or how about believing women when they say they were raped instead of saying they were asking for it the fact is that there have been zero instances of a transgender person doing anything but using the restroom like a normal person  they certainly haven t sexually assaulted anyone  and that s throughout the  states and over  cities that have transgender protection in place  in fact  the only men who have gone into a restroom to scare women and children are the ones being purposely sent in there by the family research council  a right wing group trying to instill fear of transgender people by pretending there is a problem with them using the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity but get ready  folks  it won t be long before a conservative lawmaker takes limbaugh seriously like usual and literally writes a bill to legalize rape by excusing it as a civil rights issue  and the way republicans have treated rape victims over the years  you know they are considering it featured image via  screenshot
