donald trump is literally scaring holocaust survivors who are watching history repeat itself there s a reason why the bellamy salute was abandoned by americans in the   fifty years after the salute was first used to pledge allegiance to the flag  congress changed it because it had been adopted by the nazis as a salute of allegiance to adolf hitler as we all know  hitler tried to exterminate the jews by placing them in concentration camps such as auschwitz  resulting in the mass murder of six million jews during what became known as the holocaust if anyone knows what nazi germany and hitler was like  it s holocaust survivors  of which there only only a few hundred left abraham foxman is one of those survivors  though only a child at the time  foxman was saved by his catholic nanny  his parents  however  were forced to live in a ghetto  after being returned to his parents in   foxman and his parents came to the united states in  to start fresh far away from war torn europe but foxman fears the united states is beginning to look a lot like nazi germany and it s mainly because of donald trump after witnessing trump call for thousands of supporters to raise their right hands to pledge allegiance to him during a recent rally in florida  foxman  the former head of the anti defamation league  told the times of israel that the event disturbed him because it eerily reminded him of the third reich  as a jew who survived the holocaust  to see an audience of thousands of people raising their hands in what looks like the  heil hitler  salute is about as offensive  obnoxious and disgusting as anything i thought i would ever witness in the united states of america  we ve seen this sort of thing at rallies of neo nazis  we ve seen it at rallies of white supremacists  but to see it at a rally for a legitimate candidate for the presidency of the united states is outrageous  foxman then discussed what trump said after asking his audience to raise their hands  don t forget you all raised your hands   trump said   you swore  bad things happen if you don t live up to what you just did  it is a fascist gesture   foxman said  he is smart enough   he always tells us how smart he is   to know the images that this evokes  instead of asking his audience to pledge allegiance to the united states of america  which in itself would be a little bizarre  he s asking them to swear allegiance to him  he even threatens that if they don t  they will suffer and be punished  this is so over the top for a man who really doesn t come out of the underground  he is a man of the world  even though he proclaims he doesn t know who david duke was  or the other white supremacists  we know very well that he knows  so he s playing to an image  but despite his obscene extremism  which would have immediately disqualified candidates in the past  trump is riding this wave of hate all the way to the republican nomination  and the gop establishment is so afraid of him actually being their nominee that there is talk of replacing trump with someone else during the convention in july as for foxman  he is genuinely frightened of the possibility that right wing extremism will keep growing and carry trump to the white house  you can find some authoritarian  semi fascist tinges in southern politics during the segregationist era  but there s never been anything like this  and nothing on this scale  i am a holocaust survivor and this made me quiver  what scares me is he s broken all these taboos and it s helped him  that frightens me  it frightens me that there are all these things that we ve worked so hard on  but one after another he breaks these taboos and the people applaud him and come back for more  americans need to start taking this election seriously  because if holocaust survivors are being reminded of one of the greatest evils this world has ever witnessed because of trump s campaign to be the most powerful person on this earth  we should be scared of him  too  it s time to wake up and end this nightmare featured image  twitter
