the morning after getting pounded for several racial outbursts he made on friday  donald trump retweeted an image of a black family with the caption  american families for trump  the problem is  the photo of the family is not from a pro trump event or gathering  the picture is actually from a news story about a black family reunion in  the photo fakery was pointed out by mark czerniec the episode is part of a pattern with trump  who often retweets images created by his supporters that more often than not are either conspiracy theories  complete fakes  racist or some combination of the three  they reflect a lot of the values the presumptive republican presidential nominee has mainstreamed in his short political career trump has expressed strong belief in the conspiracy theory that president obama was not born in the united states  that climate change is a hoax created by the chinese  and in the idea that immigrants are mostly criminals and rapists pushing the photo of fake black supporters comes after a day in which trump pointed to a black man at a campaign rally in california and referred to him as  my african american  in the same rally  trump tripled down on his racist assertion that the judge overseeing his trump university case cannot be fair or impartial because he has  mexican heritage  and at the same time trump is  building a wall  in response to his racial outburst  hillary clinton noted   it makes no sense to me  the judge was born in indiana  yes  he s of mexican heritage  donald trump is apparently of german heritage  what does that mean  we are all americans  the most senior republican in the country  speaker of the house paul ryan  also condemned trump s racist attack on the judge   but trump has been making the allegation for months already  and ryan endorsed trump for the presidency featured image via flickr
