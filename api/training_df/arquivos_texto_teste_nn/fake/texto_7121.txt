bernie sanders is not one to mince words when it comes to donald trump  he has consistently denounced trump s rhetoric and has warned of the ramifications of both trump s statements and actions  sanders was recently asked about trump s disturbing ideas about muslims at a campaign rally and this time  he responded by invoking the holocaust  sanders said  you know i m jewish  my father came to this country at the age of  from poland  he came over  other people in his family did not come over  those people died  children died  relatives of my father  that is in my heart to see what a lunatic can do bringing up racial hatred and we re not going to allow that to take place in this country  sanders made the statement during the rally after a muslim american woman echoed fears about the growing islamophobia in this country  the woman talked about how scared her young son is in today s anti muslim environment  sanders said  i m going to do everything that i can to stop those islamophobic attacks so that kids in this country who happen to be muslim aren t afraid  unfortunately  it s not just donald trump who has raised the specter of racism and fear  ted cruz has also called for  police patrols  of muslim american neighborhoods after the attacks in belgium so the rampant racism isn t exclusive to the demagogue donald trump  but it s infested the republican party  which is need of some serious reforms if it is going to stay relevant  although it s been quite joyous to watch the party implode sanders  who has ignited an enthusiasm on the part of voters not seen in decades  continues to do do very well in his bid for the democratic nomination for the presidency watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
