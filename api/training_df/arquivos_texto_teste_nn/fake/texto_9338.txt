notice in the exchange below that the reporters have a cohesive message saying president trump calling senator warren pocahontas is a  racial slur   they think we ll buy into their effort to make this is a  slur  if they say it often enough they re trying to hijack the narrative by repeating an untruth as fact nice alynsky tactic by the press watch how sarah sanders turns it all around and asks why no one is asking why warren lied about being native american another great job by sarah sarah huckabee sanders said on monday it is  ridiculous  for senator warren to consider  pocahontas  to be a racial slur sanders was responding to a question about whether it was offensive for president donald trump to use the nickname during a white house event honoring world war ii code talkers  a reporter said the comment was  offensive to many   but sanders turned the issue back to warren s unsubstantiated claim to native american heritage  i think what most people find offensive is senator warren lying about her heritage to advance her career     boom another reporter brought up warren saying on msnbc  just before the press conference began  that trump s nickname constitutes a racial slur   i think that is a ridiculous response   sanders answered  i think the president certainly finds an extreme amount of value and respect for these individuals  which is why he invited them to come to the white house and spent time with them in recognizing and honoring them today   sanders replied  he invited them here at the white house today to meet with them and to also remind everybody about what a historic role that they played many years ago
