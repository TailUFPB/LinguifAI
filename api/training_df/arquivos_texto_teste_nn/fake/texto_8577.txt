donald trump thinks conservative icon william f  buckley would oppose the national review s attack against him  william f  buckley disagreed  years ago earlier this week  the national review launched an all out assault against donald trump  branding him a  charlatan  who isn t a real conservative  virtually every republican presenting himself to voters swears so help me god that he is a conservative   wrote brent bozell among multiple other writers for the publication  enter donald trump  not just with policy prescriptions that challenge the cynical gop leadership but with an attitude of disdain for that leadership precisely in line with the sentiment of the base  many conservatives are relishing this  but ah  the rub  trump might be the greatest charlatan of them all  in response  the billionaire republican presidential wannabe took to twitter to blast the national review and he invoked its founder william f  buckley  claiming that buckley would be disappointed in his creation national review is a failing publication that has lost it s way  it s circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low  sad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    few people read the national review because it only knows how to criticize  but not how to lead    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    late  great  william f  buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize  the dying national review   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    only problem with trump s use of william f  buckley as a defense is that buckley actually wrote down what he thinks of trump and the prospect of him running for office as a conservative candidate  as it turns out  buckley slammed trump  years ago and predicted this very scenario that trump is playing out today  look for the narcissist   buckley wrote in  the most obvious target in today s lineup is  of course  donald trump  when he looks at a glass  he is mesmerized by its reflection  if donald trump were shaped a little differently  he would compete for miss america  but whatever the depths of self enchantment  the demagogue has to say something  so what does trump say  that he is a successful businessman and that that is what america needs in the oval office  there is some plausibility in this  though not much  the greatest deeds of american presidents   midwifing the new republic  freeing the slaves  harnessing the energies and vision needed to win the cold war   had little to do with a bottom line  in the final analysis  just as the king might look down with terminal disdain upon a courtier whose hypocrisy repelled him  so we have no substitute for relying on the voter to exercise a quiet veto when it becomes more necessary to discourage cynical demagogy  than to advance free health for the kids  that can come later  in another venue  the resistance to a corrupting demagogy should take first priority in short  william f  buckley would be horrified that trump is so far ahead in the republican primary polls and would be disappointed that the conservative movement has become an anti intellectualism and anti science base of stupid people  and with sarah palin endorsing donald trump  it stands to reason that if buckley were still alive  he d die of embarrassment  but not before using his command of language to tell the new conservative base to go f ck themselves featured image  youtube
