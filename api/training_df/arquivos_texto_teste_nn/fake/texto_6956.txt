 new york city s inner circle dinner is typically an event where politicians and journalists rub elbows to raise money for charity by participating in parody skits for the enjoyment of donors  people who go expect to see some famous faces  have some laughs and do some good for their city  what they don t expect is for things to turn racist  which is  sadly  what happened when mayor bill blasio and hillary clinton took the stage to perform a skit about blasio s endorsement of the former secretary of state taking a little too long for her liking that s when the unfortunate happened  like most public appearances by politicians  these things are typically scripted by a speech writing team  how this one slipped past the goalie without anyone realizing how incredibly derogatory it is is baffling  it s unclear which of the pair s team came up with the  joke   but what is clear is that it was not funny  clinton starts by razzing blasio for taking too long to endorse her  to which blasio responds   i was on c p  time   clinton jumps in and adds that it means  cautious politician time  c p  time  is actually a slang term for  colored people time   intended to make fun of black people for being late  it s a horrible stereotype by itself  but when you add the insult of  colored people   you have a joke that was destined to fail from the get go blasio  whose wife is black and whose children are mixed race  has been known to make racially charged comments in the past  perhaps believing that his own family demographics give him a pass  but secretary clinton  who isn t known as a racist  most certainly should have known better than to take part in that skit  she will certainly struggle to explain it and the apology machine will have to move swiftly to make this right  with the democratic primaries already devolving into a mudslinging match  the last thing clinton   or the party   needs is to fuel the fires of bernie supporters who already classify her as a republican it would be extremely hypocritical for us as democrats and liberals to overlook the incident completely and attempt to brush it off as  merely a joke   considering what we would do and say if it were ted cruz or donald trump on that stage  this was a massive gaffe that shows that no matter how progressive our leaders are  even they can be insensitive to the racial tensions we face as a nation here s the scene  courtesy of the new york post featured image from screen capture
