cnn hammered trump for retweeting white supremacists while claiming that he ll get a  tremendous amount  of support from african americans donald trump won the south carolina primary on saturday propelled partly by incredibly racist rhetoric about muslims  and he has been criticized in the past for repeatedly retweeting posts made by white supremacists even while insisting that black voters are going to support him but cnn host jake tapper called out trump on sunday for what smells like very strong bullshit  a lot of republican leaders in d c  struggle to envision you accomplishing this   tapper began after referring to trump s plan to attract the support of black voters   especially given the fact that there are white supremacist groups and individuals like that who support you  some of whom you ve even retweeted  of course  trump responded by claiming that he has no idea what tapper is talking about and went on to claim in classic trump form that african americans are going to come around and start flocking to his campaign  well  that  i know nothing about  i don t now about retweeting  you retweet somebody and they turn out to be white supremacists  i know nothing about these groups that are supporting me the other thing is african american voters  i think i m going to get a tremendous amount   trump opined   and you ve seen the stories where african american leaders are saying   you know  my people really like trump   because i m going to bring jobs back from china and mexico and japan and vietnam and india and all these places   he added   i m going to do great with the african americans  here s the video via youtube according to data published in january   percent of the accounts trump has been retweeting are connected to white supremacists so it s hard to believe that trump doesn t know what he s doing in fact  trump is the candidate who is single handedly responsible for the sharp rise in the number of kkk chapters across the country so  it s not only difficult to believe that donald trump knows nothings about his twitter shares  it s impossible to believe that african americans will flock to his campaign knowing that he is mostly supported by racist group that hate them  feigning ignorance does not absolve him from responsibility featured image via video screen capture
