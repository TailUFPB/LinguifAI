in an announcement that can put a lot of minds at ease  former mayor of new york city michael bloomberg has decided that he will not be running for president  if he had decided to run  it would have undoubtedly split the vote  and could have in turn resulted in donald trump being president in an editorial on bloomberg view  the former mayor wrote  over the last several months  many americans have urged me to run for president as an independent  and some who don t like the current candidates have said it is my patriotic duty to do so  i appreciate their appeals  and i have given the question serious consideration  the deadline to answer it is now  because of ballot access requirements  but when i look at the data  it s clear to me that if i entered the race  i could not win  i believe i could win a number of diverse states   but not enough to win the  electoral college votes necessary to win the presidency  bloomberg politics pointed out  in order to win  bloomberg would have had to win pluralities in enough states to capture  electoral votes  the constitution also provides for the election to be thrown into the house of representatives to decide if no candidate can secure those votes  though that method has been used only twice  after the elections in  and   that body is controlled by a republican majority  it would be almost certain the republican nominated would ve won the presidency by any way the votes tallied this was a very smart move on behalf of bloomberg  putting country before his personal want to be the next commander in chief  it s looking more and more like trump will be the republican nominee and clinton the democratic  bloomberg seems to realize that in order for the democratic candidate to win in the general election they are going to need all the votes they can get  good on bloomberg for this move featured image via flickr
