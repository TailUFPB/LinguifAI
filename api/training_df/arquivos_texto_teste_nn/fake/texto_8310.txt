jeb bush is campaigning against marco rubio   we all get that  when a person becomes your rival in a presidential contest  all the gloves come off  yet   you d think the arguments presented would be somewhat in line with what that candidate s own thoughts were in the past  not so in this case jeb bush is trying to say marco rubio is  inexperienced   but when confronted on why he recommended senator rubio to be romney s vice presidential choice back in   bush became visibly flabbergasted here was the exchange between him and fox news bret baier bret  well   rubio  had enough experience that you recommended him for vice president when mitt romney was looking jeb  yeah  except he doesn t have the experience to make a tough decision bret  but  why recommend him for vice president then if he didn t have the experience back then jeb  because he would have earned it what does that even mean  look   it s obvious jeb is trying to wiggle his way out of this one  and on that front he failed  big time for some more context on this  here was what jeb said back when romney was still mulling over his options for vp  look   he has more experience than barack obama had when he ran  and the practical experience   he s certainly got the intelligent acumen and fortitude to be a good president and i have a special place in my heart for him  it s hard to describe the pride i have for his incredible success and how he has moved in to the job of being a u s  senator with humility  not trying to be an arrogant guy  to learn the trade if you will  and people in washington really admire him  those are some very kind words  not only that  but bush even went further in another interview with newsmax in april of   when he said rubio was  probably the best choice  out of every potential candidate  for bush to now try to play the experience card is just absurd  he picked the wrong battle to fight on this one  this is just another reason people don t trust anything politicians say featured image from video screen capture
