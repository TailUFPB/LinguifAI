all over the world you ll see unlikely pairings  an elephant that is best friends with a dog  or a horse that befriends a duck  or a tiger that loves his monkey  and then there s justice ruth bader ginsburg and the recently departed justice antonin scalia  two people who on paper should loathe one another  because quite frankly  they couldn t be more opposite in political viewpoints  ginsburg the liberal and scalia the staunch conservative  yet  they were close friends during their tenure together on the united states supreme court  and even before that as well as every justice wrote a statement after the passing of scalia  all very moving and paying tribute to the conservative  one stood out among all the others   justice ginsburg s  as you read it  you can tell she was thinking back on memories of times they spent together and it is actually quite touching  she refers to their friendship as  best buddies  toward the end of the opera scalia ginsburg  tenor scalia and soprano ginsburg sing a duet   we are different  we are one   different in our interpretation of written texts  one in our reverence for the constitution and the institution we serve  from our years together at the d c  circuit  we were best buddies  we disagreed now and then  but when i wrote for the court and received a scalia dissent  the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation  justice scalia nailed all the weak spots the  applesauce  and  argle bargle and gave me just what i needed to strengthen the majority opinion  he was a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit  with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh  the press referred to his  energetic fervor    astringent intellect    peppery prose    acumen   and  affability   all apt descriptions  he was eminently quotable  his pungent opinions so clearly stated that his words never slipped from the reader s grasp justice scalia once described as the peak of his days on the bench an evening at the opera ball when he joined two washington national opera tenors at the piano for a medley of songs  he called it the famous three tenors performance  he was  indeed  a magnificent performer  it was my great good fortune to have known him as working colleague and treasured friend  the opera she s referring to  scalia ginsburg  noted their relationship  and in the song  we are different  we are one  it shows that despite their differences in almost every way opinion wise  they were still there together on the supreme court  respecting one another s opinions  albeit perhaps not agreeing  they were friends what ginsburg s statement shows is that despite all that may divide us  there is far more that can bring us together  we need to acknowledge these otherwise unlikely  best buddies  and respect their bond  she is undoubtedly very sad after his passing  and after reading her statement  you can t help but look at scalia in a different light than one may have originally perceived  this is a note from a friend to another friend after their passing  and it has to be appreciated featured image  flickr wikimedia
