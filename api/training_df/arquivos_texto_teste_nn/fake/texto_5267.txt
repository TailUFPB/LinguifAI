america s intelligence community doesn t trust donald trump  at all  period  while both hillary and trump are slated to start getting intelligence briefings now that they ve formally accepted their parties  nominations  many intelligence officials are very wary of briefing trump  in fact  one senior official had nothing good to say about trump when it comes to giving him those briefings the official spoke to the washington post on the condition of anonymity  but didn t mince words at all  i would refuse  he s been so uninterested in the truth and so reckless with it when he sees it  boom  that s an indictment of trump s trustworthiness if there ever was one the official is understandably concerned with trump s comments about vladimir putin  but in addition to that  he s noticed that trump doesn t want to actually learn anything about  well  anything  he s absurdly stuck on what he thinks are his own merits  and nobody s going to dissuade him from his preconceived notions not even intelligence officials the issue is so volatile and so controversial that the reason these officials talked to the post on the condition of anonymity was just so they could comment on this  they re that upset with his plea to russia to hack hillary s emails  which trump and his campaign later dismissed as sarcasm and as a call to russia to turn over any emails they already had  it s clear the intelligence community isn t buying either of those sorry excuses some in the intelligence community are also a little wary of hillary  but trump is the one who is the loose cannon he claims hillary is  at least hillary has extensive experience with intelligence briefings that are far more specific than she ll get as a presidential candidate  trump has none  and there s absolutely no way  whatsoever  to know how he d handle such information  it s particularly frightening if he thinks that information is juicy  he d probably put it on twitter for all to see the official that won t brief trump said that it s entirely possible trump will refuse those briefings  because he  already knows all that   given that trump s ego is the size of russia and growing big enough to make his tiny hands microscopic by comparison  it s not likely he ll refuse them because those briefings will make him feel important and nothing is more important to trump than feeling important members of the intelligence community aren t the only people worried about trump getting intelligence briefings  senate minority leader harry reid flat out said he hopes that they ll give trump fake briefings because he s so untrustworthy  rep  david cicilline  d ri  called on president obama to deny those briefings to trump altogether considering those briefings happen at the discretion of the sitting president  obama could very well do it  trump is a national security disaster waiting to happen  it s really no wonder that officials are nervous about giving him even the broadest of briefings featured image by joshua lott getty images
