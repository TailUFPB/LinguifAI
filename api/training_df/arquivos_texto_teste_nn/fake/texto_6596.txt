if case you have not heard  malia obama is once again proving herself to be a smart young woman  recently  malia made headlines when she translated for her father during a trip to cuba   something that earned her a lot of irrational hatred from conservatives  now  she is in the news again for accomplishing something many parents wish for their kids  she got herself accepted to harvard while is is certainly good news   that the oldest of the first daughters is following in her father s footsteps and becoming a successful human being  that still isn t enough for fox news  racist fans  after the right wing propaganda network masquerading as a news agency reported that malia  who can t so much as look at a school or even wear a t shirt without becoming the target of insane right wing harassment   will be going to a good school  conservatives lost their minds and responded with such vitriol that fox had to shut down the comments section on the article the white house announced the good news on sunday  fox reported malia is the eldest of the obamas  two daughters  she s  and a senior at the exclusive sidwell friends school in the district of columbia she s set to graduate high school in june  then celebrate her  birthday on the fourth of july obama recently said he turned down an invitation to speak at malia s high school graduation because his emotions would get the best of him malia decided on harvard after visiting at least a dozen colleges  ultimately deciding to attend the school where her father earned his degree  before she does this  she will take a year off school like many young people choose to do before going to college there s nothing controversial about this at all  she did nothing wrong  but if you were to judge from the comments that flooded the website soon after the article went up  you would think she performed an abortion while marrying two undocumented immigrants inside a church while taking the congregants  guns and stomping on a flag  readers called her a  n gger   a  monkey   an  ape   and made it very clear that her skin color is something they consider important in determining her worth as a human being already  the stupid part of america suspects that she was granted special favors  that her blackness prevents her from getting grades good enough to earn her a spot at the prestigious school              this is just one example of the right attacking president obama s children  malia became the subject of assaults after it was rumored that she had a couple drinks at a party while visiting brown university  whether or not she did is unknown  but conservatives decided that a   she s guilty and b   for doing what many teenagers do  she is literally the devil  another time  a photograph of her wearing a t shirt featuring the words   pro era   the name of a rap label  when she was younger  conservatives even photoshopped an image of the president touching sasha inappropriately  then presented it as fact  sadly  it was well received by the right  malia can t even get a job without being smeared as an  affirmative action loser  malia obama is a classy lady  no matter what these inbred taint barnacles say  it s disgusting that obama s more hateful critics can t so much as have the decency to avoid attacking his children  the obamas have faced more irrational bigotry than have any other presidential family in history   and this is certainly not ok featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla  modified
