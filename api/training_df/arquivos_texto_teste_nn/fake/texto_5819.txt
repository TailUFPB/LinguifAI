for months  republican presidential nominee donald trump has claimed that his innovative use of social media and his vast personal fortune will allow him to dominate hillary clinton and the democrats in the fall  but in reality  as the key fight in the battleground states that will likely determine the next president begins  trump is getting destroyed by secretary clinton s campaign and allies democrats have   million worth of advertising on the air  trump has none every single  presidential tv ad currently airing in a battleground state is either from hillary clinton s campaign or the democratic outside groups supporting her the opposition  by contrast  hasn t spent a dime in these same battlegrounds   whether it s donald trump s campaign or republican leaning super pacs so far in june  clinton and the outside groups backing her have spent a total of    million on ads in the battleground states of colorado  florida  iowa  nevada new hampshire  north carolina  ohio and virginia  according to ad spending data from smg delta by comparison in   the advertising in battleground states at this point was     in favor of president obama against mitt romney  even with that single digit edge  obama went on to win every battleground state and secured a landslide in the electoral college for his second term despite having the same amount of time to plan for the election and a primary that wrapped up about a month before the democrats were done  republicans have still lagged behind  they don t have as many campaign staff on the ground in key swing states  as trump often didn t set up staff there and has dismantled much of what he had trump has also had issues with raising money  as reports indicate he has been too lazy to make the critical calls to the financiers that finance party activities and advertising  despite his claim to be a  billionaire   there has been little sign that trump is actually willing to put his own money where his mouth is and finance his presidential campaign behind the scenes reporting has shown republican insiders worried about their inability to compete this fall  while major republican donors like the koch brothers are reluctant about donating to a campaign that could lose in a major landslide featured image via youtube
