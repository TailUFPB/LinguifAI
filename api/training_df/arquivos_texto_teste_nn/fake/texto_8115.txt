the gop has obstructed president obama at every turn since he set foot in the oval office  they hate the man with a passion  and will stop at nothing   including the destruction of the country   in order to ensure anything obama might do fails  that fact is why it comes as no surprise that  in the wake of supreme court justice antonin scalia s death  the gop is busily and openly vowing to make sure no obama appointee gets onto the court the thing is  though  it is entirely possible for the republicans to have their way on this one  the nominee would have to be confirmed by the senate  which is controlled by the gop  therefore  majority leader mitch mcconnell can delay the confirmation until president obama is out of office  hell  he can delay as along he likes  actually  as long as the gop controls the senate  ted cruz  for his part  has vowed to block anyone obama might put up for the position  and he is sure to have the full backing of his fellow republican senators there is a catch here  though  for the democrats  senator chuck schumer  who is set to succeed senate minority leader harry reid in   is furious with cruz and mcconnell for their plans of blatant obstruction  and he said so on live television sunday morning  that s not all  either  if schumer wants  he can go ahead and remove the option of filibusters for presidential appointments to the supreme court  filibusters have already been removed as an option for other appointments made by sitting presidents  but not for scotus appointments  this would be disastrous for the gop  because it means they would be powerless to stop any appointments made to the court by the next  hopefully democratic  president think about that   people stay on the supreme court for decades  literally  if schumer does this  the gop is doomed for at least two generations  now  this tactic is extreme  democrats are not extremists  and we don t like to threaten our right wing counterparts  however  they are forcing our hands on this one  if this happens  it will be no one but the obstructionist republicans  faults  the sitting president has the constitutional right to make supreme court appointments they are willing to let a supreme court seat sit empty and block all obama appointees   no matter who they might be   for a full   days  all for spite  the cost to the nation be damned  that right there is an extreme measure  and it pretty much forces an extreme response likely  schumer doesn t want to go to extremes  but since the gop seems unwilling to budge on this one  he most likely should featured image from video screen capture
