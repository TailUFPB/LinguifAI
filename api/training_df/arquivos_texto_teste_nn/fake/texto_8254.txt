if west virginia republicans have their way  conservative christians will be able to break any law they don t like and use  religious freedom  as a defense outrageous legislation known as senate bill  would create anarchy across the state by giving conservative christians the ability to ignore any law they think doesn t have a  governmental interest of the highest magnitude that cannot otherwise be achieved without burdening the exercise of religion  for instance  bigoted christians could argue that they can ignore anti discrimination laws that protect racial and religious minorities as well as gay people  they could also argue that they can ignore sexual harassment laws  traffic laws  gun control laws  environmental laws  or any other law they don t like and all they have to do is claim that such laws impede their  sincerely held  religious beliefs sb  states  exercise of religion  means the sincere practice or observance of religion or religious conscience  it includes  but is not limited to  the ability to act or refuse to act in a manner substantially motivated by one s sincerely held religious beliefs or religious conscience  whether or not the exercise is compulsory or central to a larger system of religious belief this is perhaps the most dangerous piece of legislation republicans have ever dreamed up it s basically a get out of jail free card for christians who think they should be able to hide behind their bibles to get away with disobeying the law according to civil rights advocate tim peacock sb  would literally create a new class of rights superior to all other protections afforded at the local  state or federal level  it would create a special class of rights wherein one civil right comes into conflict with another  religious belief would always prevail as peacock further explains  it would fall to government to  offer a compelling state interest in violating the person s beliefs  in short  west virginia would be turned into an anarchy as conservatives use their  christian  beliefs as an excuse to violate the laws while everyone else has to follow the law to the letter since they wouldn t have these new special rights and you can bet that conservative lawmakers across the country are looking at passing the same legislation in their own states as they continue to desperately try anything to replace civil law with biblical law  this is what religious tyranny looks like  featured image  wikimedia
