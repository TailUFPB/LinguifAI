conspiracy theories aren t something i take seriously very often  the type of people who engage in conspiracy theories spend their time on alex jones  site talking about false flags and how mass shootings are a hoax  fourteen years later  and they just can t admit that steel does in fact bend and melt and buildings fall down when you crash big planes into them to be grouped with the crazies is inconceivable  but every so often something comes along that seems far fetched   until you look closely  this particular theory is brought to you by the blogspot right wing crooks  who seem to have figured out how and why bristol palin s baby was born in november and not december like she claims the entire story goes into great detail about individual instagram  facebook and twitter posts  friends of the family and the supposed father and former fiance brought in to make it all neat and clean  in a nutshell  the theory is that bristol palin was impregnated in or around the time she was in las vegas last year complaining about  the night that ruined her life  a month before a medal of honor winner mysteriously appears to sweep her off her feet  propose and become an immediate fixture in all aspects of her public  private and online life the timeline begins on palin s instagram on valentines day   a selfie of her and an alaskan prostitute adult industry worker dressed to impress for a night on the town appears with the caption  the night before the worst mistake of my life   the picture is still there  but the caption  as reported by right wing crooks  has been changed to  vegas if that was the night bristol palin was impregnated  a typical gestation period would bring her into early to mid november for a due date  the fist picture of bristol with her new daughter  sailor  appeared on christmas eve the palins are notorious attention seekers  up to this point  there was no mention of babies or deliveries or hospitals  all of a sudden  bam  there s bristol  looking content with her daughter sarah hadn t posted at all either  but when she did there was a bit of a problem  when you post to facebook your location is logged  sarah palin was somehow holding and loving on her brand new granddaughter in a hospital in parker  alaska but posting to facebook from new orleans  here is the actual post https   www facebook com sarahpalin posts  got really fishy when a picture of bristol and her little girl showed a piece of tape with an iv date on it  after enhancing  both right wing crooks and winning democrats are convinced that the date most likely reads     november   which by the vegas pregnancy theory puts sailor at exactly where she s supposed to be gestation wise here are the pictures with enhancements right wing crooksthe theory is simple  to keep bristol from looking like she got knocked up during a one night stand  a plan was formulated to move the birth  bristol took pictures along the way  posting them a month or two in advance  if yopu check out her instagram account  you ll see that at  weeks  according to her  pregnant she looked pretty along  weeks with my babe girl     a photo posted by bristol palin     on oct    at   pdtthat from october  to this on thanksgiving  an entire month later  and what s with the christmas tree  it s almost like the whole thing is just staged happy thanksgiving      thankful for my babies  a photo posted by bristol palin     on nov    at   psthow far fetched is it really  you would simply have to consider what sarah and the palins would do to keep bristol safe from the career  doing whatever it is she does  ending publicity of a one night stand vegas baby  already her position as an abstinence counselor makes absolutely no sense  so that s kind of a wash  but with the duggaresque hypocrisy of bristol being a faith blogger on patheos and possibly a future  where are they now  dancing with the stars special guest  the concept of changing a couple of months for a clean er  slate may have been just that appealing did she fake the birth of her daughter nearly two months after it happened  according to right wing crooks there are a slew of other tidbits that add to their theory that is all admittedly very compelling stuff  it is also very circumstantial  if it turns out to be true it will go down as a not so well planned scandal from america s first family of fools  if it s not true  well shame on the palins for having an existence that makes it seem plausible featured image via instagram
