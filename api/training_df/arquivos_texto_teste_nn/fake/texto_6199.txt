almost a year ago  a deranged white supremacist went into an historic black church in charleston  south carolina and killed nine people  including the pastor who was also a state senator  to make things worse  the gunman  dylann roof  sat with the parishioners at their wednesday night bible study and worshipped with them after they welcomed him into their midst  then  he went on a bloody massacre after expressing that racist hatred was the reason for his carrying out the crime now  nearly a year later  federal prosecutors are looking to seek the death penalty against roof for his deadly rampage  attorney general loretta lynch said that her review of roof s crimes was  rigorous  before she made the decision to attempt to have him executed  lynch went on to say that  the nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision  authorities say that the following factors make the case eligible for the ultimate punishment the victims  families were informed of the decision to move forward with the death penalty on the federal charges via a conference call  steve schmutz  who is the legal representative of three of those families  says of the decision  the families will support this decision  really  i think the families have mixed emotions about the death penalty  but if it s ever going to be given  this case certainly calls for it  he is right  of course  prior to going on his killing spree  roof wrote a long  hate filled  rambling manifesto that is arguably one of the most hateful documents ever posted on the internet  there s no doubt in anyone s mind as to what he did and why now  personally  i am usually   against the death penalty  state sanctioned killing is barbaric  and there have been too many botched executions to truly support it here  murdering a murderer makes us no better than he is  especially if it is done in an inhumane and torturous way  however  if anyone deserves it  it is this piece of shit  this guy literally murdered people due to the color of their skin  and no other reason  further  he picked the historic emanuel ame church so that he could  magnify the societal impact  of his horrific crime  he knew the history of charleston with regards to the freeing of slaves and the liberation of black people  and he knew the history of that church this one is difficult for me  as a liberal  i don t support the death penalty  but  as a black woman living in south carolina  i know the level of racism present here  this is one time i really can t say that loretta lynch or anyone else is wrong rot in hell  dylann roof  it s definitely where you belong featured image via screen capture from twitter
