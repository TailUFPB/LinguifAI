if donald trump had been at madison square garden during this marc anthony concert  he would have been booed out of the building during the concert  the popular latino singer took aim at the republican billionaire by shouting at the top of his lungs about his pride at being a latino before telling trump to go f ck himself  which drew a loud cheer from the thousands in attendance  i m proud to be a latino   anthony told his fans  i just want to say  we re proud of our country  we speak a little differently  we have our own food  we have our own way of being  but here  no matter where you come from  we re latinos  and we have to take care of each other  no matter where we come from  there s only one f cking box to check when you come to this country  and it says  latino   there s some crazy movement coming from some  anthony began to say while motioning with his hands  he then wanted to say two things  first   f ck donald trump   anthony then told the crowd that he wants trump to hear it from his house   wake that motherf cker up   and then the concert resumed here s the video via youtube it s understandable why anthony has a problem with donald trump  throughout his run for the presidency  trump has repeatedly launched unfair attacks on latinos  during his official campaign announcement trump characterized all mexicans as rapists  and promised to build a wall along the mexican border to keep latino immigrants from entering the country  ever since  he has blamed latinos for the crime and violence in the united states and called for a renewal of  operation wetback   a deportation initiative under the eisenhower administration  a consequence of which resulted in the use of  wetback  as a derogatory term against latinos and the displacement of thousands of men  women  and children the fact is that  like donald trump  marc anthony is an american citizen and a native new yorker  but while trump clings to a racist version of america  anthony believes in the historical diversity that has made america great over countless generations that being said  republicans should tread carefully if they really want latinos to vote for their candidate in november  after all   percent of latinos voted for president obama in   if the gop doesn t stop being racist  they can expect even more latinos to vote against them this time around  featured image from facebook
