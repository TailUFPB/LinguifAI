this is not how ted cruz must have envisioned his campaign would end up heading into the nation s very first caucus in iowa on monday  his  cruzin to victory  tour bus wasn t exactly the epitome of its name  either  while he visited the johnson county fairgrounds earlier  it needed to be towed after getting stuck in the mud this is very ironic  indeed  just a bit over a week ago ted cruz was quoted as saying   i m not going into the mud with personal insults and attacks  on donald trump   well  senator  you just went into the mud  quite literally pic via instagramaccording to a report by phillip elliott from time magazine  cruz had to hitch a ride with aides to his next tour stop while his bus was towed  that s not the kind of image you want to project just before the voters of iowa nominate the next future president of the united states  it certainly can t be good public relations  draw as many analogies as you must pic via twitter cruz needs every bit of good press he can get right now  virtually every poll shows donald trump having a huge lead on him  and   cruz can t afford that  whoever wins iowa would get a must needed head start in the race  with trump up in practically every state  iowa is the momentum cruz has been desperately seeking  unfortunately  the only momentum cruz is getting right now is coming from the back of tow truck you d think the cruz campaign would  at least  try to play damage control and be the first to report it  instead of being outed by the media  it s possible they could have made a joke out of it   but they didn t  they didn t even mention it  that s no way to run a campaign  featured image from facebook
