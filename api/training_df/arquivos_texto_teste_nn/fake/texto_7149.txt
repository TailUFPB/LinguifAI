 in an effort to meet his weekly requirements of hypocrisy  ted cruz embraced the idea of a draconian federal law that would make it next to impossible for labor unions to function within america  cruz called for a national  right to work  law  which would prevent unions from automatically collecting dues from employees that they cover  this would cause the labor unions to go bankrupt and make workers lose practically all of their collective bargaining power resulting in lower wages  worse working environments  and a reduction or loss of benefits hearing someone like cruz  who completely embraces the idea of states  rights when it suits them  calling for a federal law to override all state based labor union protections is a joke  hypocrisy is not new to cruz or republicans  though  cruz called for the law to protect the  fundamental rights  of employees  common spin on legislation like this is that somehow the mandatory dues deducted from your paycheck to fund union representation are a violation of your rights as a worker apparently  the rights to collective bargaining and the fact you lose about  dollars a year if you are non union are completely lost to your average republican legislator and voter  this is why these laws are regularly called  right to work for less  the sudden obsession with labor law is a strange diversion for cruz  who worries more about finding ways to legalize discrimination and repeal obamacare  the reason for it likely has less to do with allowing employers to steal money from their workers  and more with the fact he is trying to win the wisconsin republican primary cruz is echoing the only noteworthy thing koch puppet governor scott walker managed to do during his time as governor of wisconsin  walker s entire claim to fame was being the corporate goon boy for attacks on labor unions  despite his reasonable success in ruining labor unions in the state  wisconsin still has some of the worst job prospects in america and shows no signs of serious improvement anytime soon  how advocating for a nationwide roll out of a huge republican policy failure will help cruz is anyone s guess  republicans have voted for stupider things  though  so it could prove to be just the nudge cruz needs to secure a win in wisconsin featured image via  photo by spencer platt  getty images
