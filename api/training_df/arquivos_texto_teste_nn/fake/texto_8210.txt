ted cruz s latest ad just manipulated children to send a political message to voters the latest campaign move for the texas senator is a big jab at his biggest gop rival  republican front runner donald trump  who is portrayed in the ad as an action figure who  pretends to be a republican  in the  second spot  young boys are shown playing with a trump doll  while stating that this action figure likes  bailouts for the banks  and donates to democrats  the ad also features a hillary clinton doll  who gets paid by trump to befriend him   a reference to trump s claim that clinton attended his wedding because he donated to her foundation toward the end of the ad  a large dollhouse gets ruined by the trump doll  who says   i m going to take your house with eminent domain and park my limos there   right before destroying it  this particular part of the ad is a reminder that trump once tried to level an elderly woman s atlantic city home so he could turn it into a parking lot for limos at the end of the ad  concerned parents see their children playing destructively with the trump doll and the narrator asks viewers  we wouldn t tolerate these values in our children  why would we want them in a president  you can watch the ad below cruz s latest ad might just be the candidate s rebuttal to trump indirectly calling him a  p ssy  at a recent rally  but this ad doesn t communicate anything that hasn t been said about trump before  although the use of children in a political ad was not a tasteful decision  the gop has often criticized trump for being a phony republican   and this ad just points his inconsistencies out in easier terms  trump has a history of flip flopping and holding more liberal values last week  cruz beat trump in the iowa caucuses  but trump took the new hampshire primary  this attack ad might be the first of many as the two will face off again on february  for the south carolina primary featured image is a screenshot
