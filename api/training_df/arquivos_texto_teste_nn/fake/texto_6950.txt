an official investigation into a tennessee republican found him to be more dangerous to the personal safety of women than the lgbt people he wants to ban from using public restrooms tennessee state rep  jeremy durham has sponsored a bill similar to anti lgbt laws passed in north carolina and mississippi  which republicans claim are necessary for the security of women but according to an assessment by tennessee attorney general herbert slatery  durham himself represents the true threat to women during an investigation that is still ongoing  slatery felt that he should warn tennessee house speaker beth harwell that durham has engaged in inappropriate contact with female employees of the legislature and is threat to their safety  based upon the information gathered thus far  representative durham s alleged behavior may pose a continuing risk to unsuspecting women who are employed by or interact with the legislature   slatery reported slatery went on to list the information gathered from interviews with  women durham has interacted with  including that he held  a superior position of power to the women   obtained their contact information under false pretenses  tried to meet with the women alone and contacted them  about non legislative matters   tried to serve them alcohol  and made inappropriate comments and  engaged in inappropriate physical contact with some women  durham s bill would ban transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity because he thinks they pose a danger to women of course  there is not one example throughout the  states and over  cities that have protections in place for transgender people of a trans person doing anything in a women s bathroom other than using the facilities durham  however  has been labelled a real danger to women and his own access to entire buildings has been restricted  these proactive steps include reassigning rep  durham s office from the war memorial building to the ground floor of the rachel jackson building  and limiting his access to the legislative plaza  war memorial building  rachel jackson building  and  floor of the state capitol for official legislative business only  these actions will be taken immediately   speaker harwell announced via email to the tennessean in short  republicans are hypocrites and perhaps there should be laws to protect women from them featured image via facebook
