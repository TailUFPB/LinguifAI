if there s one couple that republicans love to attack  it s the clintons  for decades  they have been under constant dubious scrutiny  more so than almost any other politician  why  because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done  stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed  and work they would rather not see being accomplished  if republicans can successfully make a scandal of the clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments  that will help republicans beat hillary in   it s political theater at its best and worst appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in nashua  new hampshire  was former president bill clinton  if anyone can explain the exemplary work hillary has done throughout her long career  it s bill  and while many like to say hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea  or copies other candidates  they clearly don t know the work she s done  and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done  but getting it done  this pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office the former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at yale  and while she really could have done anything with her career  she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the children s defense fund  he said  there she was at yale law school  she could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  she hadn t been elected to anything  but everything she touched became better  as time so perfectly summed up clinton s remarks  he remembered that hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of african american children in adult prisons in south carolina in another anecdote  bill said that hillary as first lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late  with tom delay  then a leading republican in the house of representatives  this is all in addition to her later political work  like in helping get the iran deal passed  or her part in capturing and killing osama bin laden  or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe  all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation clinton stated  i do not believe in my lifetime  anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge  experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now  her experience speaks volumes  her calm under pressure is unmatched  and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished it s clear bill is in this to win it for hillary  and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition it will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer  video  youtube featured image  flickr
