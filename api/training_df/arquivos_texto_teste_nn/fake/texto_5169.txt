donald trump has had a terrible week  so seth meyers piled on with a load of humiliation and mockery republicans are starting to back away from donald trump  but not because he s a racist and a misogynist  they re okay with that  republicans are mad because their nominee has refused to endorse house speaker paul ryan in the tough primary race he faces in wisconsin during his show on thursday night  seth meyers had a field day with trump s disastrous week  this is the final straw   meyers asked   not the racism or the misogyny or the wall  yep  that s certainly what it looks like  and even some of trump s most ardent supporters are starting to criticize him newt gingrich was on trump s shortlist to be the vice presidential nominee and he compared trump to a great quarterback who throws a bunch of interceptions in a game but meyers corrected him  actually  it s more like watching a quarterback throw an interception  blame the interception on mexicans  insult the coach s mother and then storm off the field bitching that the game is rigged  mike huckabee  who had no problem setting aside his  christian  morals to defend trump  a man who has none  defended trump s meltdown by insisting that he will be surrounded by the best people if he is put the white house even though trump hasn t exactly done that during his campaign or at the convention  where most republican shunned trump and he ended up bringing has beens like scott baio to cleveland well  seth myers had a response to that as well  dudes  chill out   he ll be way cooler and more reasonable just as soon as we give him more power   meyers sarcastically said  you know  the same way drunk people always calm down once you give them back their car keys  and i m not sure it s all that comforting when the biggest promise you can make about your candidate is  he ll have adults around him and we ll lock him out of his twitter account  that s how it works with justin bieber  and it barely works with him  but perhaps the biggest gaffe trump made this week is when he kicked a mother and her baby out of a rally because the baby was crying trump appeared to show compassion and understanding at first  but then he quickly demonstrated his dislike of babies by asking for the mother and baby to be removed  that is a huge gaffe for a republican  because the gop platform does not allow you to change your mind about a baby   meyers quipped meyers then went on to mock trump for being obsessed with starting a nuclear apocalypse and for already whining about how the election is allegedly already rigged against him here s the video via youtube donald trump is not fit to be president of the most powerful nation on the planet  he is joke and would be seen as a joke by the rest of the world  republicans should be embarrassed and ashamed that they made trump their nominee  the only way they can redeem themselves is by making sure trump loses by a landslide on election day featured image via screen capture
