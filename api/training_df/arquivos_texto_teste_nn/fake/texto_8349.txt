many women have had enough of men in power telling them what they should or should not do with  their bodies  one would think that in   it would be understood by presidential candidates that a woman simply has a right to her own body and the choices she makes are hers and hers alone not so with the current republican clowns running for president  for some irrational reason  all the  candidates seem to believe that they have a right to tell women what to do with their bodies  a group of women decided to get together and teach the candidates a lesson by posing the following question  what would it be like for men in power to get schooled on what they should or shouldn t do with their bodies  the results in the video are effective as well as hilarious the results in the video are effective as well as hilarious one woman speaks directly to the camera and says  guys  republicans  picture this  once a month  lots of blood just comes out of you d  k hole and if you want to prevent it  you just shove a tampon in your d  k hole  now picture my trying to regulate your d  k hole  another woman on screen continues with some advice for donald trump  she says   take as many selfies as possible  you ve got the duck lips that teen girls dream of  and there were some suggestions for lowly jeb bush  you basically want women to wear a chastity belt  we just want you to use your actual belt and wear your pants below your nipple line  by subverting power and reversing it  these women teach these candidates an important lesson  although it s doubtful that someone like donald trump  who has said terrible and sexist things about women will heed the message and reverse course  it s also doubtful that someone like ben carson  who believes that abortion should be outlawed  even in cases of rape and incest  will heed the message as well  however  the hope is that americans will be rational enough not to vote for a republican for the presidency when the time comes featured image via video screenshot
