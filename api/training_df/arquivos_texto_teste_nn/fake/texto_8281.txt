ted cruz is a guy who s easy to make fun of and snl had a field day with him and his campaign last night  taran killam  who played the republican presidential candidate  delivered a hilarious performance  kallam as cruz said   some of you may have seen me in tonight s republican debates in new hampshire  and if you missed it  here s a quick recap  i won  i also won the iowa caucuses thanks to endorsements from strong conservatives like glenn beck and god almighty  cruz s  win   of course  had nothing to do with god but more to do with some nasty trickery  for example  there was cruz s campaign telling voters that ben carson had dropped out of the race  then of course  there were the mailers sent by the cruz campaign which tried to manipulate voters into voting for him killam as cruz said he was an  unconventional candidate   i didn t get where i am today because i was born wealthy or handsome or charismatic or nice  i am not cool or likable or even fine  cruz shouldn t be blamed for his looks  being born without wealth  or even his lack of charisma  however  there are certainly some things he can do to make him more likable to folks  people don t like being lied to  nor do they like to be manipulated and it looks like ted cruz is a master at that  it s quite crazy to think that people actually vote for this guy killam concluded  isn t it time for a president who s just a nasty  little weasel   the answer is absolutely not  ted feature image via youtube screenshot
