this is outrageous and someone needs to put this right wing nut job in her place rather than applaud khizr khan for standing up to hate and bigotry as he celebrated the constitution and america  right wing radio host sandy rios did something even worse than ann coulter in response  you know what this convention really needed  an angry muslim with a thick accent like fareed zacaria   coulter wrote on twitter  of course  even conservatives slammed coulter for her shameful words but rios  who works for the american family association hate organization  went further than coulter by questioning khan s loyalty to america and even had the gall to question the loyalty of his son  who died for this country to save the american soldiers under his command in iraq  if you are so concerned  mr  khan  if you re an american first  then distinguish yourself and condemn islamists  condemn the muslim brotherhood  then we will listen to you  and stop waving the constitution   rios said before claiming that muslims cannot truly practice islam and live under the constitution and accusing khan of lying  as far as i can tell  islam  truly  supporters of islam and the quran  cannot embrace the constitution  now  if you have a different view  then explain that to us and then maybe we can be persuaded  but don t shame america for having genuine and rightful concerns about muslims in our midst when we have no idea who they are or what they really believe  and we re not even sure about you  sir  because we know about taqiyya  which is the practice of lying to the infidel in order to advance the muslim cause  first of all  this man lost his son in iraq so it s safe to say he condemns terrorists  what rios is employing is the trump and republican claim that simply saying the words  radical islam  will magically make isis disappear and they are claiming that anyone who doesn t say it isn t a real patriot donald trump made that same claim when he questioned president obama s loyalty to america back in june in the wake of the orlando mass shooting  look  we re led by a man that either is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind   trump told fox news   there s something going on  it s inconceivable  there s something going on  he doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands   it s one or the other and either one is unacceptable  but rios didn t stop there  she also questioned the loyalty of khan s son humayun  who proudly wore the uniform and flag of this country and posthumously received the purple heart and bronze star for his heroic actions on the day he was killed  so i m sorry  we ll not be shamed  i m sorry for the loss of their son and i hope he is a loyal american  but i think a loyal american muslim would be more like zuhdi jasser  who is very clear about where he stands  who was very patriotic and loyal and totally distances himself from islamism  so if that s the case for this gentleman  then he should ve said that on the platform rather than shaming us for having concerns about muslim immigration  here s the audio via right wing watch i would say that this is a new low for conservatives but they have already hit rock bottom  the fact is that members of isis want us to refer to them as followers of islam because they want legitimacy  but they are not real followers of islam  they have simply co opted the religion in an effort to justify their violent cause and they do not represent the over one billion peaceful muslims in the world  basically  rios expects every muslim to take a loyalty oath  which is exactly what donald trump wants to do to any muslim seeking refuge within our shores this is pure hate and bigotry and it has no place in our society  if anyone is violating the constitution it is the likes of rios and trump who think that only christianity is protected by it  but the constitution protects freedom of religion  that means all religions  even islam and rios should be removed from the airwaves for even suggesting that khan and his son are not loyal to this country  he and his son have sacrificed more for this country than she ever has or ever will featured image  screenshot
