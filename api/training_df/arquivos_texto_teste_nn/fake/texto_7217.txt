on tuesday  the trump campaign took a huge blow when campaign manager corey lewandowski was finally charged for an assault on a breitbart  reporter  earlier this year  lewandowski faces a battery charge after he left bruises on michelle fields when he mistook her for a member of the hostile and evil lamestream media  despite the existence of a mountain of evidence   including pictures of the bruises  numerous eyewitness accounts  and even newly released video that clearly shows the attack  the trump campaign has repeatedly continued its tradition of ignoring reality after lewandowski was charged  trump assured the world that his campaign will continue to stand behind its campaign manager the same way that the donald stands behind members of the  make america great again  crowd who attack black people at his rallies  following his campaign manager s legal issues  trump jumped on twitter to claim that the tapes   which  once again  clearly show the assault  demonstrate absolutely nothing  wow  corey lewandowski  my campaign manager and a very decent man  was just charged with assaulting a reporter  look at tapes nothing there  yes  that s horrible  and grabbing a reporter so hard that it leaves bruises  no matter how disreputable she is  is pretty goddamn bad  but at least she didn t encounter former u s  attorney kendall coffey  an attorney representing lewandowski  she might have spent a few weeks nursing bite marks coffee  who served with as much dignity as can be expected from someone associated with trump from    resigned after he racked up a   bill at a miami dade county strip club and allegedly settled the dispute by biting a dancer known only as  tiffany   and  ultimately  paying the tab with his credit card   the decision to leave is the most painful and difficult choice of my life   coffey told staffers as he resigned  but leave i must  because my family has already paid too great a price for the sacrifices that accompany public service  with the allegations recently raised and pending  i now have concerns about the possible impact on the important work of my office   he said  apparently viewing dealing with the repercussions of biting a f cking exotic dancer to be a run of the mill  sacrifices  dealt with by public servants the sun sentinel reported at the time that coffee s father bought back the credit card receipt for    in an effort to protect his son s actions from being discovered the dancer and her husband at the time said that coffee bit hard enough to  break the skin   but that they did not want to end his political career men and women visit strip clubs on a regular basis  but not often does someone bite one of the dancers   that takes a special kind of animal   the sort that would accept work defending a man who attacked someone because he thought she was part of an adversarial media  the sort who would actually have done worse watch the pretty much indisputable security camera footage of the attack below
