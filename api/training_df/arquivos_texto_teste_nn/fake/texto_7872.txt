at some point  far in the future  former minnesota congresswoman michele bachmann will learn that she probably should stop expressing her opinion on any matter more complex than  which hole does the square peg fit in   the tea party superstar s relevance has fizzled out over the years  with her base either dying off or ending up in prison for one gun related crime or another   but this relic from the hoveround revolution still occasionally attempts to cling to her former stardom among the uneducated masses of the nation  question  if   of americans pay no federal income taxes  should they be allowed to vote   she asked naturally  anyone whose intelligence is above the level required to operate a toaster without adult supervision mocked her relentlessly      why don t   percent of americans pay federal income tax  they can t afford it  of course  americans are underpaid and undervalued as the upper class continues to find every excuse possible to cut wages and profit off of the backs of those they exploit  this  of course  doesn t mean that they pay no taxes  everyone  including the poor  pays sales tax and a number of others bachmann and her tea party cohorts view themselves as champions of the constitution   a document none of them  including bachmann  have apparently read  not only does the constitution guarantee the right to vote  but it is the right mentioned most in the text of the constitution   as total of five times   the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged   is very clear  u s  citizens get to vote  period i know  i know  it seems crazy that people like bachmann are able to grasp the meaning of  shall not be infringed  as the half of the second amendment with which they are familiar is worded  yet are incapable of grasping  shall not be denied or abridged  but there you have it featured image via pinterest
