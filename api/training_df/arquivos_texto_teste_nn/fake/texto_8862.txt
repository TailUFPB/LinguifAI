kentucky republicans have decided to put the profits of a creationist museum ahead of the education of their state s children  and that just about says it all at the very start of  s legislative year  kentucky conservatives introduced a bill  sb   that would keep schools closed until the end of august in order to allow the state s brand new  noah s ark  museum to eke out a few more weeks of the tourist season  priorities writer dan arel has been following the situation  in all its mind numbing stupidity  for the better part of a year  he writes as i reported back in august of   kentucky sen  damon thayer  r georgetown  and sen  chris girdler  r somerset had proposed such a bill to help extend the vacation season to bring more attention to the forthcoming ark encounter  grant county is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the ark   thayer said   but there won t be many families from kentucky visiting in august if we continue with the current calendar  and while other states have set their school schedule around economic issues  you d be hard pressed to find a state do that to satisfy the bottom line of a single man meet ken ham  the right wing creationist famous for his creation museum and infamous for getting absolutely demolished in a debate with bill nye  he and his giant ark have kentucky s republican led legislature wrapped around his finger lately  ham has been so busy hurling hatred at gay people that one might forget that he makes most of his money by running a religious based creation museum and associated ministry in kentucky  in the past few years  ham has set his sights on expanding his museum to feature a  life sized  mock up of noah s ark  after a ton of fundraising   and a few charges of tax fraud   ham opened his ark in november   to give you an idea of how obnoxious ham can be  this is how he chose to announce his big grand opening ceremony set to begin this summer  we are so excited that the construction progress and schedule landed on this   date  genesis   states that noah and his family entered the ark  so it s fitting we allow the public to enter the life size ark on    ham s enablers in kentucky want to extend the park s  vacation season  to september  they hope this will bring in more money  but what they don t mention is that almost none of it would be coming back to the state  ham  for all of his religious speak  is primarily a huckster  he continues to label his for profit  ministry  a tax exempt church  and therefore pays little to no taxes  keeping kids out of school so their parents can buy tickets for ham s park does nothing but make students in the state more ignorant  residents poorer  and ham richer schools  obviously  are not happy  either  as ham continues to count his dollars  teachers and principals are left scrambling for a way to salvage the potentially lost time  one principal was hopeful that the bill wouldn t pass  but conceded if it did  it would be a disaster   it may help tourism  however  i think it could potentially hurt many kentucky children  given the fundamentalism promoted by ham s anti intellectual  museums   it s safe to say the principal is being too generous  this has all the makings of an educational disaster feature image via christian post screengrab
