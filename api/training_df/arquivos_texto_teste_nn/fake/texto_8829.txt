being a resident of the beautiful state of maine myself  i have a special place in my heart for stephen king  his vocal opposition   or rather downright hatred   for republican governor paul lepage has made him even more likable to those of us who have witnessed the second term antics and complete disintegration of what little integrity  governor lerampage  had left his first term was a nightmare  his re election was made possible by a third party run from a rich buddy pretending to be a democrat  watching him campaign on a platform of hatred for the poor and fear of the few thousand somali refugees living in the portland area was terrifying  especially when it became apparent that he would win a second term in that second term  lerampage has amped up his fight for the wealthy  essentially destroying the food stamp program and creating a quagmire of restrictions and red tape to sort through for any other kind of assistance that people have stopped bothering to try  opting instead to reverse lepage s one victory as governor by increasing the crime rate that was at a  year low people gotta eat  when the governor takes away their means without providing an environment that creates sufficient jobs  they do whatever they can to feed themselves and their families  they aren t running to the supermarket with the promise of lower property taxes for oceanfront millionaires after lepage s latest racist rant sparked outrage around the country  stephen king  whose tweets at lerampage have earned him quite a few hearts and arrows on twitter  sent this out on sunday  tearing down what little dignity the governor may have had left one must admit lepage has elevated assholery to a level far past the extraordinary and into a rarified sphere that might be termed divine   stephen king   stephenking  january    the beauty of a stephen king passage that will stand the test of time  the man just has a way with words  by taking everything the failed governor has ever done and reducing it to a single act of  divine  a  holery  king has summed up the feelings and frustrations of hundreds of thousands of mainers who lament that they allowed this man to be elected  never mind re elected thank you  stephen king  for this wonderful tweet  and for pet semetary  still one of my favorites featured image via twitter
