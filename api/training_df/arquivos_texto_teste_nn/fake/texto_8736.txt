one really has to wonder why carly fiorina is still running for president  she s a failed ceo  a failed senate candidate  and seemingly just an awful human being  people haven t been drawn to her as a candidate  so much so  in fact  that s she s been booted down to the undercard junior debate  which is basically just a pity party for people who haven t realized no one likes them yet  all the candidates in the junior debate really should realize they  in no way  have a shot at winning  do themselves and the rest of the nation a favor  and drop out however  there they still are  they re still there saying the stupid things that have made them unpopular in the first place  and clearly showing america why they shouldn t be in any sort of leadership role during the most recent junior debate  carly fiorina decided that she would attack hillary clinton s marriage with former president bill clinton  she said  unlike another woman in this race  i actually love spending time with my husband  that s a pretty awful and unnecessary thing to say about another candidate  and just seems like a pathetic  weird attempt at trying to diminish hillary noticing this bizarre statement by fiorina was msnbc s chris matthews  and he held fiorina to task asking her to explain herself  matthews asked fiorina if she thinks the clintons have a  real marriage   and every time matthews tried to get her to answer  the failed hp head would reply  and awkwardly repeat  they ve been married for a really long time  then  fiorina lost her damn mind and launched a verbal assault on the msnbc host  there are so many other things we could talk about like the fact that mrs  clinton wants to go to the white house   she s qualified for the big house  she should be prosecuted  she has not been prosecuted for things that took a great warrior out of office  david petraeus so let s talk about that  chris  let s talk about how amazing it is that this woman  that cannot be trusted  who should have been prosecuted by now  has just raked in more money than any single candidate  wow  bitter  party of one actually  carly  if you re going to talk about a woman who has done horrible things in her past  let s talk about all the jobs you shipped overseas  let s talk about how you took a once thriving company and lead it down the sh tter  how about that  let s not hyperbolize and make false accusations against hillary clinton  all while throwing some backhanded jab at her marriage  that makes you look no better than the mean girl in middle school who is pissed she got picked last for dodgeball  grow up  and while you re at it  drop out    carlyfiorina and  hardballchris get into a testy exchange over  hillaryclinton  https   t co nsohreczli  msnbc   msnbc  january    video featured image  twitter
