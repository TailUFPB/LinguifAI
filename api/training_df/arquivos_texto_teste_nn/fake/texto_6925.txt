now  typically no one should be mocking a teenager in their place of education  but since it is a place of education  perhaps this can be seen as the child learning something valuable  and while it s never okay to bully  pointing out to someone that they re wearing the hat of a bigoted bully should be mandatory that being said  one high school sophomore in portland  maine  is catching a lot of criticism for wearing his donald trump  make america great again  hat  and rightly so conner mullen says that everyone is wearing their  bernie pins   so he should be able to wear his donald trump hat  however  his fellow classmates are apparently relentless in their taunting  and even a teacher called him out  allegedly saying   thank god you can t vote   when mullen took his grievance to the assistant principal s office  the solution offered was simply to leave the hat at home mullen said  i knew kids would pick on me about it  that s just kids being kids  but when the adults started doing it i thought that s problematic  this is a school that preaches equality  oh dear  yes  he actually said that  he just equated himself to the plight for equality because he s being teased for wearing a bigot s hat  the irony is palpable according to mullen  the reason he wants trump to be president is  i want a job  where you can help people  and i ve heard trump say how important he thinks veterans and  people in law enforcement  are  oh  dear boy  please  oh please don t believe the pandering nonsense that comes out of trump s mouth  and as far as his love for veterans  how much he s been supposedly giving veteran groups is highly questionable here s the thing  the school isn t telling him he shouldn t wear the hat  but they are suggesting if he d like to stop being relentlessly mocked for such a poor fashion decision  that he should probably just leave the hat at home  trump is a bigot and probably the worst choice this country could ever have for the role of commander in chief the bigger concern here is  what is this student being taught that he believes trump is a good option  maybe that should be the real story watch the story via wcsh out of portland  maine featured image via video screen capture
