donald trump has a pattern of business behavior that he has repeated several times over his career when he isn t on a reality show pretending to be a billionaire genius  a loud  splashy launch of a project followed by a high pressure sales job that dazzles prospective customers  followed by mismanagement and poor business decisions that result in a failed business but somehow trump makes money for himself the pattern has repeated itself with trump university  trump steaks  trump magazine  and now the los angeles times has revealed the seedy underbelly of trump ocean resort  a condo community that was supposed to be built in baja with homes overlooking the pacific ocean guess what happened next in the end  nothing at all was built at trump ocean resort  and simms lost her money  as did about  other buyers  most of them from southern california all told  two years of aggressive marketing yielded    million in buyer deposits  every bit of it spent by the time trump and his partners abandoned the project in early  as the global economy was reeling  most of the buyers sued them for fraud in this case  trump did what he has often done in real estate deals   licensed his name to a third party developer  but not actually do the building himself  trump has often portrayed these properties he really had nothing to do with as part of his real estate  empire   and the media has gone along with the fairy tale the people who lost money in these condos say that is what happened here  and that trump s children   donald jr  and ivanka   were part of a ruse to make it seem as if trump was one of the main developers instead of just a name attached like a cheap sticker  we are developing a world class resort befitting of the trump brand   ivanka trump said in a video on the trump baja website   i m very excited about it  i actually chose to buy a unit in the first tower  her father appeared in the same video saying he was proud  that when i build  i have investors that follow me all over  the sales team even told prospective buyers that trump himself had purchased a condo in the development  but he actually never did  trump even signed a letter given to prospective customers identifying himself as one of the builders   but he wasn t the company doing the actual building  after months of inactivity on the construction site  eventually sent a letter to people who had bought in telling them that they would not be able to proceed with construction due to a lack of money and the economic turndown in    they also said they wouldn t be providing refunds of the millions of dollars they had taken the trumps did get    in licensing fees for their involvement in the scheme  another pump and dump trump mission completed featured image via screen capture
