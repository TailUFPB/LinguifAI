republicans always talk a big game about being  pro life   one of the ways they lead their clueless voters into thinking that they really care about abortions is by attacking healthcare organizations that provide the services  that s exactly what happened in wisconsin on thursday when governor scott walker signed two bills that will block millions of dollars in federal funding from reaching planned parenthood according to yahoo news one of the new wisconsin rules requires the state to apply for federal  title x  family planning grant money and to give those monies to  less controversial public entities  such as state  county and local health departments and clinics  a statement from walker s office said planned parenthood is currently the only entity in wisconsin receiving this federal money and the funds will not be sent to the organization  the statement said  less controversial   the only reason planned parenthood is  controversial  is because the gop has made it so  they attack the group because it is an easy target as the country s largest abortion provider  but they actively ignore the fact that only roughly three percent of the organization s services are abortion related and that federal funding does not pay for that three percent   it is illegal and has been since  the other bill that walker signed into law will restrict the amount of money planned parenthood gets back for birth control  and other prescriptions  reimbursements the bill singles out planned parenthood by referring to  a covered entity that is an abortion provider   of the  planned parenthood clinics in the state  only three perform abortions  planned parenthood affiliates in wisconsin serve more than   patients annually this is really important because in order to truly be  pro life  one must actively reduce the need for pregnancy terminations  one of the easiest ways of doing that is by providing women and girls with free birth control  now  twenty two clinics are going to have a very hard time doing this because of walker  if these women do not have access to birth control  then this could result in a boom of pregnancies   walker should have taken a look at texas together the two laws could block more than   million of federal funding from reaching the clinics   all of this proves that gop cares less about preventing abortions and much more about punishing women and planned parenthood  featured image via gage skidmore flickr
