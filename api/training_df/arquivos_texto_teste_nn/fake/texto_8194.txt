the department of justice laid down the law on wednesday and announced that they have had enough and they are suing ferguson for police misconduct  the decision to sue came after the ferguson city council voted on tuesday to change the terms of a deal that had been negotiated over seven months the doj began investigating ferguson police after  year old michael brown was killed by former police officer darren wilson  although wilson was cleared of any wrongdoing  federal authorities found a pattern of abuse and systematic racism within the department for seven months federal authorities and the city hashed out a deal to fix the problems within the police department  in a tentative agreement the city agreed to hire consultants to train officials  require every officer to have a dash or body cam  abide by specific guidelines for when officers can stop and question people on the streets  along with a number of other things  on tuesday  though  the city suddenly decided that they wanted to alter the agreement  shortly after the vote  the feds released a statement  the ferguson city council has attempted to unilaterally amend the negotiated agreement   vanita gupta  head of the agency s civil rights division  said in a statement   their vote to do so creates an unnecessary delay in the essential work to bring constitutional policing to the city  and marks an unfortunate outcome for concerned community members and ferguson police officers  on wednesday  attorney general loretta lynch dropped the lawsuit on the brilliant city council  she told reporters  we intend to aggressively prosecute this case and we intend to prevail   she continued  the residents of ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional rights  the rights guaranteed to all americans  for decades  they have waited decades for justice  they should not be forced to wait any longer these violations were not only egregious  they were routine  they were encouraged by the city in the interest of raising revenue  they were driven  at least in part  by racial bias and they occurred disproportionately against african american residents of ferguson  the fact is  the city has failed the people of ferguson on so many levels and now they are going to waste millions of dollars trying to fight the federal government because they tried to play fast and loose with the doj  they knew that their actions on tuesday would result in litigation  but they took it as seriously as they take protecting people in their city hopefully  the citizens of ferguson are able to get rid of each and every one of the council members who played a role in this vote  featured image from wikipedia
