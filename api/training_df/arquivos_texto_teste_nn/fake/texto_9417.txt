sending love   hilarie burton   hilarieburton  october    affleck was also accused by one of harvey weinstein s victims of covering up sexual assault  after he made a comment about how  saddened  and  angry  he was at his bestie harvey weinstein for his actions you want to play let s play  rosearmy pic twitter com   rose mcgowan   rosemcgowan  october    s the justice league star in another disgusting video where he s clearly objectifying the female reporter  ben affleck objectifies female reporter  comments on her breasts  then makes fun of  retarded  people with cerebral palsy   cringe pic twitter com   austen fletcher   fleccas  october    add insult to injury  only days ago  affleck appeared on mtv  where he gave a cringeworthy  and very arrogant interview about the new justice league movie  along with his co stars  the mercury news published a story following his interview where they asked   does ben affleck really want to stop people from writing him off as an arrogant male movie star who lacks the character or good sense to move past his difficult associations with sexual harassment  does he really want people to believe he can  be part of the solution  to ending a hollywood culture that long allowed rich and powerful men like harvey weinstein to sexually mistreat women does he at least want to save his new movie  justice league  from more bad press  after critics gave it generally negative reviews then affleck better shut up  especially after his latest cringe worthy comments surfaced for an mtv  justice league  cast interview last week  the batman actor jauntily chomped his way through a big wad a gum while cracking a couple jokes that appeared to reference the sexual misconduct engulfing his industry  the huffington post reported  we could use more women   affleck said  perhaps trying to sound like he wanted to correct hollywood s notorious gender disparity in movie narratives but when his co star ray fisher  who plays cyborg in the film  was asked what would happen if supergirl teamed up with the  justice league   the younger actor said in a very pr friendly way   i think it would create a different dynamic  that s when affleck  failing to read the room or to grasp his own lack of charm in this situation  blurted out   you following the news at all  he broke into a smile  chomping his gum some more  apparently thinking he was being very clever in referencing the sexual misconduct crisis that has engulfed his industry here s the arrogant and not funny interview  pic twitter com       stormpiiott  november    the hard core leftist publication slate  gives their readers a list of movies they beleive will be affected by the weinstein scandal and those who were close to the accused rapist  who are also facing sexual misconduct charges  the new york times  however  has chosen to ignore affleck s bad behavior in their review  however  we re pretty sure that given their history of bashing conservatives  if affleck wasn t a mega democrat donor  his name would ve been the focus of the new york times headline from slate   justice league  debut  november    the justice league press tour was going to be plenty difficult even before the weinstein scandal went wide  as the movie underwent a director switch and major reshoots  rumors flew that warner bros  might be looking to bump an erratic ben affleck from his perch as batman  now  affleck has been implicated in the weinstein scandal by actress rose mcgowan  who claims the actor knew that weinstein had assaulted her two decades ago  even though his recent statement on the matter pled na vet   mcgowan s tweet  ben affleck fuck off  went viral and prompted renewed scrutiny of the actor s own behavior  affleck has since apologized to actress hilarie burton for groping her during a long ago trl appearance nyt s    justice league   the newest dc comics superhero jam directed by zack snyder  is looser  goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one  the bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie   batman v superman  dawn of justice   was such an interminable slog  the superhero and villain dynamic is much the same  slayers going to slay  etc    but there are a few fresh faces now and wonder woman has more to do than play backup  the story is a confusion of noise  visual clutter and murderous digital gnats  but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through the last time he fronted a movie  superman  henry cavill  seemed to die  a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy  so  of course he s back in this one  eventually  although first the band needs to get together  having seen trouble on the horizon  batman  a k a  bruce wayne   played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by ben affleck   takes the lead on this enterprise  he s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host  the guy with the cool digs  smooth rides with blinking screens   critical damage  reads one with great comic book sincerity  and suave butler  jeremy irons as alfred   he s also pretty much of a yawn the pumped up mr  affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern  but his costume remains grievously larger than batman s  or bruce s  personality  bat bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for wonder woman  a k a  diana prince  gal gadot  a charming super presence   which leads him to stammer like a teenager   she s got other things on her mind   he has money and a modest sense of humor  including about his wealth  which inspires one of the movie s few decent laughs  mr  affleck  a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed   gone girl    needs something more substantial  or just more jokes  if his batman is ever going to work cyborg isn t as buoyant a presence  which makes sense for a character who s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that mr  fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness  the hoodie he sometimes wears  which can t help but evoke trayvon martin  imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn t or can t explore  like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications  the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it
