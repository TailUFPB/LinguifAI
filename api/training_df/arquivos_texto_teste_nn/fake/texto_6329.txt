since the beginning of donald trump s terrible offensive and divisive campaign  elizabeth warren has been one of the only politicians with enough balls to stand up to the presumptive republican nominee and call him out on his bullsh t  she s proven that trump basically crumbles whenever a strong woman goes up against him  and her most recent anti trump comments show just how capable she is in taking the donald on in a commencement address at bridgewater state university  warren hilariously mocked trump once again  clearly following in president obama s footsteps after he blasted trump in a recent graduation speech at rutgers university  after telling the graduating class to  sing like no one is listening and dance like no one is watching   the massachusetts senator gave them some more applicable advice   be ready for anything  because you never know what life has in store for you  poking fun at the orange skinned business mogul  warren said  heck  on my day of graduation  i never imagined i would visit foreign countries  i never imagined i would be a commencement speaker  i never imagined i would get into a twitter war with donald trump  but here i am  living the life  you can watch that hilarious moment in warren s speech below the crowd couldn t get enough and gave warren a deafening applause for her efforts in being one of the few people tough enough to try and bring the disgraced candidate down  warren also gave the graduating class some advice about dealing with  naysayers  who  these days  say it in nastier and nastier ways   pulling from some amazing pop culture references  warren said  as one of the great philosophers of our time has said   haters going to hate  hate  hate hate  hate   knowing who you are helps you  shake it off    applause  okay  i promised i wouldn t sing  and i definitely can t dance like britney spears  it was an amazing speech  and the fact that it came at trump s expense made it so much better  after the commencement  warren continued to insult trump as she spoke to reporters  she said  i think that donald trump is a truly dangerous man and there is some risk that he could be president of the united states  i think it s time for all of us to pay careful attention to him and to the issues that he has raised and to start fighting back  warren also continued to tease us with the idea of ticketing up with the chosen democratic nominee  she wouldn t give a straight answer on whether or not she would run for vice president if offered the job  but said  i have a job i love and i wake up every morning eager to do that  it s uncertain if warren will end up on the ticket  but she s definitely proven time and time again that she can handle trump s nonsense with ease  and that makes her an even greater asset to the democratic nominee featured image is a screenshot
