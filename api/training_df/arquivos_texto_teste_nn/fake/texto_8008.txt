martin sheen channeled his president jed bartlett character from the west wing to call upon voters to tell senate republicans to obey the constitution as conservative groups mobilize and begin spending massive amounts of money to keep republicans to their word that they will refuse to even hold hearings on any of president obama s supreme court nominees to fill the vacant seat antonin scalia leaves behind  people for the american way is fighting back with a campaign of their own  the strategy is to use sheen in a series of robocalls designed to urge voters to shame republican senators from wisconsin and pennsylvania into doing their jobs specifically  the calls target senator ron johnson in wisconsin and senator pat toomey in pennsylvania  our constitution is very clear about what happens when a vacancy occurs of the supreme court   sheen says in the call  it says the president shall nominate a new judge and that the senate will give that nominee a fair consideration  but as you may have heard  republicans are playing politics with out constitution and with the supreme court  sheen then goes after johnson for saying that he doesn t think senate republicans should even give a hearing to any nominee   that s clearly irresponsible and it puts partisanship above the law   sheen says before asking voters to call johnson and tell him to put his  constitutional duties first and give fair consideration to president obama s nominee  here s the audio of the wisconsin robocall via talking points memo this isn t the first time martin sheen has urged voters to stand up for american values  in   he appeared in an ad asking kentucky voters to elect alison lundergan grimes over mitch mcconnell so that social security and medicare will continue to be safe and made stronger as we all know  mcconnell ended up winning another term in the senate  which he is now using disgracefully to disobey the constitution and politicize the supreme court instead of doing his job responsibly by holding confirmation hearings for whoever president obama nominates to fill scalia s seat hopefully  voters won t ignore sheen s call this time around  featured image from youtube
