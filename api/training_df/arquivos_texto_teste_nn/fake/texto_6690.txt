on monday  it seemed that donald trump has given up on his recent effort to act  presidential  and went back to his normal  fear mongering  bigotry fueled program at a rally in rhode island  sensing that far too much time had gone by without an anti muslim rant  the republican frontrunner urged his fans to  lock their doors  to stay safe from syrian refugees that were resettled in the state suggesting that these refugees were affiliated with isis  trump warned  now here s one i don t like  syrian refugees are now being resettled in rhode island  the crowd ate it up and booed the news trump had just shared as he read off a piece of paper  he continued  we don t know who these people are  we don t know where they re from  we don t know where they re from  they have no documentation  we all have hearts and we can build safe zones in syria and we ll get the gulf states to put up the money  we re not putting up the money  but i ll get that done  but you know what  we can t let this happen  but you have a lot of them resettling in rhode island  just enjoy your   lock your doors  folks  it seemed like the crowd didn t really know what to do with this information  some people laughed  others yelled  trump shouted  no  it s a big problem  we don t know anything about them  we don t know where they come from  who they are  there s no documentation  we have our incompetent government people letting  em in by the thousands  and who knows  who knows  maybe it s isis  referencing the terrorist attack that happened in san bernardino  california last december  where it is believed that the two muslim suspects were inspired by isis  trump added  you see what happens with two people that became radicalized in california where they shot and killed all their coworkers  ok  not with me  folks  it s not happening with me  you can watch trump s rant below  trump is correct that syrian refugees have been resettled in rhode island  but that s the only truth to this horrific rant  many of these refugees have spent years getting all of their documents together and have endured in depth interviews and near flawless background checks before being allowed to enter america this is just another line on the ever growing list of disgusting anti muslim things trump has said after he proposed that all muslims should be banned from entering the united states  fully aware of the consequences of such hateful rhetoric  president barack obama recently called trump s attitude toward muslims  dangerous  featured image via spencer platt getty images
