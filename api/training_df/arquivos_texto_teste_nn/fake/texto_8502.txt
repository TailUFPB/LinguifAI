as much as many conservatives would like to believe that the bundy militia were merely innocent victims of the government  a picture is emerging that makes it clear the now deceased lavoy finicum intentionally provoked a reaction from the law enforcement officers after trying to flee arrest finicum was part of a large group of the bundy militants who were stopped by the fbi en route to yet another propaganda appearance in a nearby town  rather than simply let the group go unimpeded  the authorities finally decided to act  it was a long time coming  the group had occupied a federal wildlife refuge for over a month  and with no end in sight and violent  paranoid extremists flooding into the region the situation was getting more out of hand by the moment sadly  it was not entirely surprising to learn that it was finicum who resisted arrest  he had frequently claimed that he would rather die in a shootout than be arrested  whether that was his intention on the night of his death is unclear  but his hostility towards law enforcement and his paranoia certainly contributed not everyone is convinced  however  almost immediately after finicum s death was announced  right wing sympathizers began spinning a conspiracy that he had been executed with his hands up while his fellow  patriots  watched  the myth wasn t relegated to the backwaters of the internet  either  soon  even sitting republican politicians and bundy s own facebook page were repeating the tale michele fiore  an anti government conservative who   hypocritically  happens to work as a state representative in nevada  repeated the lie to her twitter followers my heart   prays go out to lavoy finicum s family he was just murdered with his hands up in burns or ryan bundy has been shot in the arm  michele fiore   votefiore  january    hoft  a conservative blogger who has been labeled the stupidest man on the internet for consistently posting misinformation  ran with the story  repeating cliven bundy s baseless claim  lavoy finicum was murdered  cold blooded murder  they shot him with his hands up  unfortunately for this convenient narrative  witnesses of the arrest say finicum was the provoker  melvin lee was behind the bundy convoy during the arrest  he recounts how finicum tried to flee  and the wound up charging the officers  there happened to be some arguments between the guys in the truck  somehow they got ryan payne pulled out of the truck  apparently  lavoy had took off   he ended up hitting a snowbank  i guess  trying to get around the blockade  after he hit that snowbank  he came out of that truck and he charged at the law enforcement  as i understand it  a bodyguard of ammon s said that finicum crashed his car  then jumped out and began charging at the agents  he also concluded that this was entirely in finicum s character  he was not on his knees  none of that  he was none of that nonsense  you know  that was a miscommunication on somebody else s part  but he went after them  he charged them  you know  lavoy was very passionate about what he was doing up here  finicum is said to have been radicalized by the bundy s during the nevada ranch showdown  in an interview  he once said that cliven asked him to be the first  cowboy  to show up to what would become the standoff  i said cliven  don t let them take your cows   finicum recalled in an interview with opb   he says saddle up your horse and be here early in the morning  i was the first cowboy to show up in the dark  in fall   finicum followed in bundy s footsteps and chose to stop complying with his lease contract with the bureau of land management  in spite of a long positive relationship with the agency his death was the culmination of years of right wing paranoia being relentlessly hurled at him from conservative politicians and media figures  they exploited his anxieties and played on his fears until eventually he decided to take action  there s no question that finicum died believing he was in a struggle with a tyrannical government  his charge at authorities confirms that  perhaps that is why the right wing so desperately wants to prove that his hands were up  if he was innocent  than so are they but he wasn t featured image via screen capture
