donald trump sure knows how to pick his surrogates  they seem to be just as deluded and self centered as he is  in the midst of the world economy facing catastrophic consequences as the united kingdom votes to exit the european union  one of trump s supporters  wayne allyn root  went on television and took credit for the economic crisis now most people would not want to take credit for such a thing  but this is a trump supporter we are talking about here  appearing on fox news on sunday  root said to the hosts of fox and friends  i wouldn t be surprised if in the last week they ve lost some business  and i m sure it s going to build as the word gets out as we get to the convention and people hear about this terrible  terrible business decision   biased business decision  i think a reckless business decision  and i know that after the brexit on friday  apple stock is very close to their  week low  so whether it was me or whether it was word getting out from others or whether it was the brexit  i know apple stock isn t doing to good either have some patience  i think apple is going to feel it in the pocketbook eventually  this all comes with apple s decision to pull out of donating technical supplies and money to the republican national convention  all because of controversial presumptive gop nominee donald trump  yes  you read that right  wayne allyn root believes that his feeble campaign against apple has the power to have this kind of effect on the global economy  good luck with that  sir even one of the hosts on fox  clayton morris  reminded root that the folks at apple likely saw the disassociation from the rnc in the wake of trump s nomination as a  good business decision   root was undeterred  though  and pressed on  as the ceo you can make a personal decision  but you have no right to make a business decision and offend half your customers  morris also pointed to the fact that apple has made no comments on the democratic national convention  either  we have no word from apple if they are not going to donate stuff to the dnc also  so  we still don t know the other half of this story  but as you can tell  we have a lot to say about it the only thing that i know is that this brexit was all tied into what we re talking about  i think that people all over the world are getting sick of big companies  big corporations and big media and big government all being tied together and making decisions that hurt the people i think apple s tied to it  i think the united states government  obama  tied to it  i think brexit s tied to it  i think it s time for trexit  which is donald trump  so  in other words  this trump supporting loon s rants were too much even for fox and friends  which is definitely saying something  time for your medication  mr  root  if you think you re more powerful than brexit and that your sorry boycott of apple along with nationally televised rants like this are actually helping your candidate  you are sorely mistaken  sane people don t listen to crazy people and take them seriously watch the lunacy unfold below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
