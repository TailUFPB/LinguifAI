the topic of climate change is somehow still being debated even though it s fact vs  fiction  climate change is very real  and when  percent of scientists agree  we should probably believe them  yet  there are still people who like to push the narrative that it is a myth  people like former half term alaskan governor sarah palin well  on monday s broadcast of jimmy kimmel live  kimmel tore apart her denial in an absolutely brilliant way  he showed a clip of her denying climate change where she said  oh  well  if  percent of all scientists believe that man s activities are creating changes in the weather  who am i to question that  this is when kimmel was blunt and to the point  exactly  who are you to question that  over the past few weeks palin has been trying really hard to be relevant again and pushing the narrative that she knows better than scientists  however  kimmel shuts her down in one sentence kimmel stated  we ve had  of the  hottest years ever since   that s not an opinion  it s a fact  adding  for some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue  the politicians debate it  our scientists don t  a huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening  they say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us  there s no debate about the greenhouse effect  just like there s no debate about gravity  it someone throws a piano off the roof  i don t care what sarah palin tells you  get out of the way  it s coming down on your head  he then shows a video of actual climate scientists telling us that climate change is  in fact  very real  and why would they make something like this up  because seriously  what benefit does that do besides change human activity to respect the planet better  those telling us it s not real are the ones who have more to lose  because big polluters derive profit from destroying the earth  they don t want us to believe climate change is actually happening  and they ve been paying big money to spread their false narrative so they can keep polluting kimmel means business  and simply states either you believe science or you don t  he also knows that he s going to get a massive amount of negative feedback by those who insist climate change isn t real because they re either paying to get that message out there or they re dumb enough to believe it climate change shouldn t be a left or right issue  the earth and its climate are not up for debate   it s science  denying it exists only makes one look like a fool  good on kimmel for getting serious and getting real about this very real problem that we need to combat sooner rather than later before it s too late watch the clip here featured image via video screen capture
