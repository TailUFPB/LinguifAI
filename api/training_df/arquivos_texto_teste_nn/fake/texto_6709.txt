beyonc  is already a favorite target of hate for the right wing because she s  a  black b  a woman c  rich d  powerful e  not ashamed of being black and f  did i mention she s black  but the so racist it might as well be stormfront drudge report took beyonc  hating to a new low because of the  hold up  music video released over the weekend off of the album  lemonade   hold up is a suuuuuper angry song and video dealing with beyonc s very justifiable rage at her husband jay z for cheating on her  in the video  she takes a bat and smashes the crap out of stuff  it s not entirely clear why this is controversial in the slightest  anyone who s been cheated on wants to smash everything around them  it s a perfectly natural reaction to that kind of hurt and betrayal  so  of course  drudge report responded to it like this  urban   of course  is a right wing dog whistle for  ni  er  but why a  terrorist   oh  right  because beyonc  supports black lives matter and had the nerve to recognize black history during the super bowl so anything she does these days is scary to the poor  persecuted white minority of america the article drudge links to is just as tasteless  shoehorning in president obama and soon to be president hillary clinton by lamenting that obama  previously a fan   may be changing his policy on beyonc    because only white people are allowed to be angry or something  when black people do it  they re out of control and savages  didn t you know that already later  the article comments on beyonc s album about being cheated on and forgiving her husband by saying indeed  all of  lemonade  appears to be beyonc  saying she s made lemonade from lemons  meaning she s somehow stuck it out in a bad marriage despite lying and infidelity  that sounds more like the clintons  story than the obamas  hahahahahahah  that didn t feel forced at all  even a little now  if beyonc had gone out and actually smashed people s cars in a rage instead of channeling her anger into a creatively destructive music video  ok  fine  call her names  but for the love of all that s holy  it s a music video  i know drudge makes money by feeding the hate and rage of the right wing but this is a stretch  even for them by the way  if you want to see beyonce get righteous with a bat  you ll have to go to tidal and sign up for a free trial featured image via getty
