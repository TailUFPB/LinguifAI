by now  everybody knows that the two ranchers who inspired the bundy militia standoff fiasco in oregon are no innocent victims of the big bad federal government  however  new details were given by current and former malheur wildlife refuge employees about the family which reveal a long and very serious criminal history dwight and steve hammond have had friction between the federal government and themselves for decades  forrest cameron  who served as fish and wildlife service manager from  to  described how the conflict with the hammonds goes all the way back to the  when they made death threats against refuge employees  cameron explained that  one way or another the hammonds were violating their permit  for grazing on refuge lands  to where there was never a time when there was not some problem occurring  cameron went on to say   they ve done so many illegal activities that never got to a courtroom  some violations were not significant  and we figured we could correct it by talking to them  a biologist employed at the refuge reported that the hammonds engaged in aerial hunting of coyotes on the refuge  which is illegal  cameron said that the hammonds had an airplane at the time   they were flying to shoot coyotes on their land  and we didn t have a problem with that   however  the biologist allegedly saw the hammond s plane flying over refuge property  which the hammonds denied in august   the fish and wildlife service was trying to fence a waterhole used by waterfowl  because the hammonds were also using it for their cattle  fish and wildlife wanted to protect it solely for waterfowl use  as the fence was being constructed  the hammonds disabled a caterpillar vehicle  sabotaging the construction of the fence  dwight and steve hammond were arrested and charged with felonies for impeding  intimidating  and interfering with federal officers before the  fiasco with the waterhole  cameron said that there were death threats being made against his family  as well as other staff members and their families as well  my wife would take these phone calls  it was terribly vulgar language  they said they were going to wrap my son in barbed wire and throw him down a well  they said they knew exactly which rooms my kids slept in  in burns  there were death threats to my wife and two other staff members and their wives  my family went to bend rather than be in the community because it was so volatile at the time  the families of my biologist and my deputy manager family had to relocate as well for a short time  at the refuge headquarters  one of the hammonds said they would tear my head off and shit down the hole  one of the hammonds told my deputy manager  dan walsworth  they were going to  put a chain around his neck and drag him behind a pickup  source  rawstorythese are the people that right wing america are holding up as both heroes and victims  they are neither  personally  i will admit that at first the idea of five years for burning grassland sounded like an excessive sentence  perhaps all alone it would arguably still be one  although the details of the case appear much worse   however  these people have been engaging in bad behavior   to put it extremely mildly   for decades now  they earned what they got  and to defend them is to defend nothing short of good old home grown domestic terrorism  period
