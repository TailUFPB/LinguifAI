documentary filmmaker ken burns knows a thing or two about presidential decorum  he has made documentaries on thomas jefferson  theodore roosevelt and franklin roosevelt  he s also an accomplished student of history  which means that when he says donald trump isn t presidential  americans should stand up and take notice burns appeared on morning joe on monday morning  he was asked if trump was the least qualified major party candidate since  burns answered that there s never been anyone less qualified than trump  he cites a facebook page called  historians on donald trump   by saying all the historians on the page agree that trump is completely unprecedented in having zero credentials for the presidency  and they are looking back throughout our history when asked why trump has so much support  burns responded that it was essentially xenophobia and overall fear  i think we are susceptible because of these changing times to a message of fear and easy solutions  there are no easy solutions  but he denigrates the much maligned but very subtle art of governance  burns continued that politics are messy but that politicians need to know how to get stuff done  that s when he delivered his most brutal blow to trump  you need somebody who actually knows how to get it done and who doesn t just lie  or  times a day  here s the video   kenburns on trump  you need somebody who actually knows how to get it done and doesn t just lie   a day https   t co cybrqlztwa  morning joe   morningjoe  august     burns is far from the only person saying that trump is wildly unfit for the job as leader of the free world  in fact  if i were on one of trump s boards of directors  i d wonder if he was fit to run a lemonade stand  but burns  words matter because he is a student of history  and he is not one to talk just to hear the sound of his own voice  he might have been slightly exaggerating when he said trump lied     times a day  but according to politifact  when trump moves his lips  it s generally to lie
