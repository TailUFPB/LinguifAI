okay  we all probably get it  independence day weekend can be annoying as all hell because it seems like there s always someone shooting off pyrotechnics  having a loud party or barbecue  or otherwise making a major nuisance of themselves  that s no reason to fire a gun at someone  though  especially when that someone is a child unfortunately  that s what a wisconsin man did when he got fed up with a  year old child shooting off fireworks in his neighborhood  because  you know  when someone pisses you off that s what you do these days  solve it with a gun it was the child himself who called the police  and  of course  the man tried to lie his way out of it by saying he was merely shooting off fireworks  too  that lie didn t last very long  and he eventually admitted that he d fired his   caliber pistol in the child s direction  what a clusterfuck of a human being it s not clear whether the child s parents were home  but what happened to going over to the neighbor s house to politely ask them to stop with the noise  or working something out that would be mutually agreeable  alas  to many so called  responsible  gun owners  it s not  and they d rather threaten  or even harm  people who piss them off this guy may even be part of the  in  here who are pathologically angry and have access to a firearm  nobody who isn t  at minimum  full of rage would consider pointing a loaded gun at a child and pulling the trigger for any reason  nobody in their right mind would consider anybody who does that a  responsible gun owner   yet even gun owners who pull this kind of nonsense seem to think they re  responsible  instead of spending money on guns  these people need to go buy a clue the child is unharmed  and the man has been arrested  he currently faces charges of recklessly endangering safety  as well he should  he should also undergo a psych evaluation geared at finding out just how deep his anger runs that he thought firing a gun at a kid because he was annoyed was okay featured image by george frey getty images
