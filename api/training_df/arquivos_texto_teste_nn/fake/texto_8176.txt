thanks to a bunch of parents who cannot handle the truth  a virginia school district was forced to nix an educational video about racism and inequality from its curriculum after receiving complaints that its message was racially divisive using the metaphor of a race track  the video expertly addresses racial disparity in america throughout history in which individual runners encounter various obstacles depending on their race  created by the african american policy forum  the short video has been used hundreds of thousands of times all over america without any issues   up until now unfortunately  a few parents in glen allen felt it was a  white guilt video  and although officials of henrico county public schools originally stood by the film s much needed message  those ignorant parents got their way  two days after saying the video was one component of a thoughtful discussion in which all viewpoints were encouraged   officials had banned the video  labeling it racially divisive   they even issued an apology for trying to bring cultural awareness to students school board chair micky ogburn said  the henrico school board and administration consider this to be a matter of grave concern  we are making every effort to respond to our community  it is our goal to prevent the recurrence of this type of event  school leaders have been instructed not to use the video in our schools  in addition  steps are being taken to prevent the use of racially divisive materials in the future  we do apologize to those who were offended and for the unintended impact on our community  luke harris  co founder of the african american policy forum  felt the video was completely appropriate  he said  the video is designed for the general public  we produced something you could show in elementary and secondary schools or in college studies courses  we found that the video has a huge impact on the people that we re showing it to  most of us know very little about the social history of the united states and its contemporary impact  it was designed as a tool to throw light on american history  it s already a shame that black history is only celebrated one month   the shortest month   out of the entire year  and this proves that even educational videos about the real life struggles of african americans don t stand a chance against white privilege  this was a great cartoon that made the obstacles of racism  many of which still exist to this day  easy to understand  out of the four hundred years of slavery and oppression that black people have had to endure  you would think that the least we could do is watch a four minute cartoon about it  feature image via screenshot
