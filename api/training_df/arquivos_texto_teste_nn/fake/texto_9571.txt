continued with his now widely reported corrupt and criminal activities last night by leaking information sealed by the courts to cnn  this is just another corrupt and criminal act in mueller s corrupt and criminal career last night we found out from information leaked to cnn that the mueller investigation has filed charges in the ongoing superfluous investigation into president trump and the far out possibility that he colluded with russia in the  election  cnn reported that a federal grand jury in washington  dc  on friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel robert mueller  according to sources briefed on the matter  the charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge in typical bad cop form  former fbi head and current special counsel mueller proved again that he is as dirty as it gets trump came out today after the crooked deep state with these series of tweets never seen such republican anger   unity as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton made fake dossier  now           donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    the uranium to russia deal  the   plus deleted emails  the comey fix and so much more  instead they look at phony trump russia     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     collusion   which doesn t exist  the dems are using this terrible  and bad for our country  witch hunt for evil politics  but the r s  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    are now fighting back like never before  there is so much guilt by democrats clinton  and now the facts are pouring out  do something   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     president trump insinuates that this phony russian collusion talk is coming out as a distraction   when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts and reform  is this coincidental  not  all of this  russia  talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts   reform  is this coincidental  not   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    s career is littered with numerous investigations of major scandals and likely crimes that he did not meaningfully investigate as fbi director resulting in no arrests and no consequences  all of these resulted in the clintons and or obama administration getting away with criminal activities irs targeting      the irs intentionally selected and then delayed or denied tax exempt  c    applications from conservative groups to prevent them from participating in the  election  followed by irs agent lois lerner invoking her fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination   no charges have been filed of any wrong doing by any government officials in this case  fast and furious     this atf program  which seems to have served no rational purpose  allowed over   guns to be purchased illegally inside the united states and then  walked  into mexico for use by criminals  one of which was later used in the  murder of border agent brian terry by the member of a mexican cartelassociated press spying     the department of justice illegally seized the communications of ap reporters made during april and may   allowing the doj to unmask journalists  confidential sourcesclinton foundation pay for play      during the period in which hillary clinton held the office of secretary of state  the clinton foundation and bill clinton received millions of dollars in paid speaking fees and a million dollar  gift from countries involved in matters with the state department  many of which had ties to terrorism and human rights abuses  some of these funds were apparently diverted from charitable causes to personal expenses  such as chelsea clinton s  wedding russian uranium deal      hillary clinton s state department approved a deal allowing a russian company to control   of the uranium mining production capacity inside the united states  which was followed by millions of dollars in donations to the clinton foundation from people associated with the transaction  this past week information was reported that prior to the obama administration approving the very controversial deal in  giving russia   of america s uranium through the approved sale of uranium one  the fbi had evidence that russian nuclear industry officials were involved in bribery  kickbacks  extortion and money laundering in order to benefit vladimir putin  says a report by the hill  mueller was the head of the fbi at this time  he was even hand picked by hillary clinton to hand over uranium to russia on an airport tarmac at this time clinton private email server      during her entire tenure as secretary of state  hillary clinton dodged freedom of information act requirements by using a private email server to conduct official government business  as well as sent and received classified information that was top secret over an unsecured system an  extremely reckless   and obviously illegal  act  mueller s acceptance of the lead role in the investigation into russia is another obvious example of his corrupt and criminal tendencies  based on numerous accounts he has obvious conflicts of interest and even liberal publications like the usa today have called for mueller to step down as special prosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is carrying on  now we know he took over the investigation in spite of his criminal activities in covering up the fbi investigation into uranium one  a person of integrity would easily have seen his conflicts of interest and would recuse himself independent uk   donald trump s former campaign paul manafort has said he has not been informed of any possible criminal charges against him  after it was reported the first indictments had been filed by the team investigating russia s alleged meddling in the  election reports said a grand jury working with special prosecutor robert mueller  had approved the first charges to result from the ongoing probe that is looking at possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia  the reports  which have not specified what the charges are or who they were filed against  said a suspect could be taken into custody as soon as monday cnn  which broke the news  said the charges were filed on friday and placed under a seal by a federal judge  yet  that has not stopped a flurry of speculation as to who may be the focus of mr mueller s charges and the nature of them
