recently  an anti animal abuse bill passed the michigan state senate  that s the good news  everyone likes to protect animals  right  unfortunately  the sneaky little bastards in the gop  decided the bill just wasn t human enough  keeping in line with their long tradition of ruining every single thing they touch  republicans inserted language into the bill that would make human on human oral and anal sex a felony punishable by up to  years in prison one might assume that  senate bill  sb    sponsored by state senator  r ick jones  would at least be further amended to remove language penalizing  sodomy   oral and anal sex  with a stiff sentence of up to  years behind bars  unfortunately  we apparently live in some bizarre dimension where this sort of backward thinking idiocy is somehow acceptable the legislation states that it is a felony to engage in  the abominable and detestable crime against nature with mankind or with any animal   while most would agree that it s probably not appropriate to finger bang a horse  and that someone who does that sort of thing should probably spend some time away from the rest of society  most americans also agree that we must not police what goes on in private citizens  bedrooms law newz reports that jones remains steadfast that the language he personally inserted in the bill is not intended to in any way target the gay community  but also maintains that removing the  with mankind  portion will poison the bill sb  was designed to be part of a larger package of bills known as logan s law  the law is designed to prevent individuals convicted of animal abuse  animal torture or bestiality from possessing an animal for five years  and during probation  in the hopes the individual will seek mental health treatment  people wanted an animal abuse registry similar to a sex abuse registry   jones continued so why does this latest bill include language that equates anal sex with crimes against nature  senator jones maintains it s just part of the legislative process  he claims that the anti sodomy language is preexisting michigan law and has no practical effect the  existing law  was deemed unconstitutional thanks to a  supreme court ruling  yet he included it anyway the law blog continues in defiance of stark criticism  jones claims removing the anti sodomy language would effectively poison the bill  though it was senator jones who included the language in the first place  when asked why he would include the phrase  crime against nature with mankind   jones said   in order to write that law  we had to go into a section of law  the bestiality section  which has sodomy in it and has been there forever  it has nothing to do with it  oddly  these lawmakers seem completely unaware that the water in flint is literally poison   or  they simply don t care conservatives  obsession with gay sex is creepy at best  criminal at worst  hopefully  on election day  voters remember this blatant attempt to pass legislation criminalizing homosexuality   because republicans get scarier by the day hopefully  lawmakers in the michigan state house have a little more sense than their counterparts in the senate featured image via lawnewz
