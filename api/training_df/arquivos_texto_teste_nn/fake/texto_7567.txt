tropical liqueurs  otherwise known as  trops   a popular night spot that originated in columbia  missouri  thought they had struck gold when a beautiful building became available in the soulard neighborhood of st  louis  specializing in frozen drinks and younger clientele  the new bar was immediate success   unless you poll the neighbors  trops doesn t just attract younger people  it tends to attract a diverse younger crowd that includes a hearty percentage of african americans the neighbors  used to the noise and traffic of bars in this party rich neighborhood  were happy to have the white college crowd for years  but for some reason just couldn t handle trops  the bar came under immediate attack from local code officials who complained about everything from loud music to trash on the streets to parking   all things associated with a bar trops immediately complied with every single one of the city s demands and  in fact  went far beyond what was expected of them  they hired extra help and off duty police officers to pick up trash outside and direct traffic  they shut down their patio music at  when other bars nearby raged on  they closed their doors voluntarily at midnight even though their license allowed them to stay open until    they even stopped serving to go drinks in vacuum sealed  perfectly legal cups to owner billy thompson  there was nothing left to do  not only had he complied with the city s demands  he even instituted a dress code that disallowed baggy pants and hoodies  after all was said and done  the ruling came down  trops will lose its liquor license on april   bigotry wins  the bar s facebook page announced the closure  which came as no surprise to some fans  those are just a couple of the comments from patrons of the bar  some have tried to take race out of the equation  blaming the closure on the bar breaking open carry laws and serving drinks out of a drive through window  but those claims are hyperbole considering the cups the bar used before they stopped serving to go drinks were legal by the standards of the city commissioner and the drive through was an urban legend from the original location in columbia  local news has also pointed out that there seems to be little other than race keeping trops from prospering in the vast community of bars in the area this is just another case of a business that caters to everyone trying to succeed in a neighborhood where  everyone  means  all shapes and sizes of white people  featured image from stlmag com
