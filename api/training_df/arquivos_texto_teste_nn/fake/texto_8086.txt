senator bernie sanders had the crowd roaring with laughter during a campaign rally in nevada on sunday as he mocked a certain goper mercilessly the victim of sanders  flawless sense of humor was none other than republican front runner donald trump  who has been known to boast about how great he is at every endeavor he s ever tried his hand at  not a day goes by that trump isn t shoving his ego down the throats of americans  with ridiculous claims that he will be the  greatest jobs president  or  the best thing that ever happened to women  sanders used trump s inflated sense of self against him  turning the business mogul into some comic relief for his supporters as soon as sanders mentioned trump s name  the audience was booing the gop candidate despite sanders  attempts to calm them down  but he knows just how to lift the mood and the entire audience was soon laughing as sanders said  we know that donald trump is the greatest everything in the world  there is nothing that this man is not  the greatest  at  and one of his major scientific contributions in recent years has been to proclaim that climate change is a hoax  now  for republican candidates  this is not an unusual idea  but  added something to it  being the brilliant scientist that he is  that this hoax was created by the chinese  this made sanders  supporters giggle  as he noted how strange it was that trump didn t blame climate change on immigrants or muslims   two minorities that trump loves to blame for basically anything  you can watch sanders  hilarious takedown of the goper below obviously  trump is nothing close to a scientist  but that doesn t stop him from blabbering on about his extensive  knowledge  of the subject  even though trump later tried to distance himself from the tweets where he d said china was responsible for climate change  there are plenty other examples that show trump doesn t know a damn thing about the subject   after all  he d once said that climate change was a hoax because of extreme winter weather trump is a complete idiot  and perhaps one of the things he s really the greatest at is showing just how ridiculous he and his fellow conservatives are  featured image from video screen capture
