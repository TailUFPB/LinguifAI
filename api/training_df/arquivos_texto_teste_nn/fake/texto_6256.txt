mark cuban is not a fan on donald trump  and he made that perfectly clear in an interview with nbc news  chuck todd on friday todd brought up a hilarious comment that the nba owner and shark tank star had previously made when cuban was asked if he would consider being hillary clinton s running mate  because she needs someone like me who could just throw bombs at donald trump   todd asked cuban  you joke that you would love to be clinton s running mate  as long as you were allowed to throw bombs at trump  if she really did come to you  would you listen  having gotten his hatred for trump out of the way  cuban took on a more serious tone and revealed that he would love to be clinton s vp pick  but she would have to meet one condition  cuban told todd  absolutely  the key would be that she d have to go more to center  i like the fact that senator clinton has thought out proposals  that s a good thing  at least we get to see exactly where she stands  cuban s skepticism is because he feels that her democratic rival  vermont senator bernie sanders   has dragged her a little bit too far to the left   he explained  things like college tuition and  you know  other business elements that really  i think  could hurt the economy  if she s willing to listen  if she s willing to  you know  hear other sides of things  then i m wide open to discussing it  you can watch cuban s interview with todd below cuban s comments come just a week after several anti trump republicans tried to encourage cuban to run for president in a third party bid  cuban said there wasn t enough time to launch a third party bid  and that the gop was courting him for his bluster and volume  combined with substance and the ability to connect with voters on a more personal basis   basically  they were looking for another wealthy businessman  but one much more reasonable than trump  last week  the washington post reported that because the republican party didn t want to stand behind trump  they would try to get an independent candidate to take him out of the race  the piece read  the recruiters also delved into the world of reality television for someone who might out trump trump  mark cuban  the brash billionaire businessman and owner of the dallas mavericks basketball team  cuban simply replied  i don t see it happening  featured image via steve jennings   getty images
