ibtihaj muhammad is on the olympic fencing team for the united states  she s also a muslim and before even competing  has one olympic record   she is the first american to compete while wearing a hijab muhammad is also an advocate for acceptance of muslims in america  so of course  she s no fan of donald trump  who wants to ban all muslims from the united states  there s just one  okay  several  problem  muhammad is native to her new jersey home  she has no other country to go back to  naturally  in a cnn interview  she had some harsh words for the republican nominee  i think his words are very dangerous   muhammad  who is competing in team sabre competition monday morning  told cnn last week   when these types of comments are made  no one thinks about how they really affect people  i m african american  i don t have another home to go to  my family was born here  i was born here  i ve grown up in jersey  all my family s from jersey  it s like  well  where do we go  source  washington posther goal is more than about seeing that trump is never elected  though  she wants to change the public s view of muslims  i m hopeful that  in my efforts to represent our country well as an athlete   that they change the rhetoric around how people think and perceive the muslim community   she told cnn here s the video not surprisingly  she has long been a critic of trump  beginning with this tweet last december friends don t let friends like trump  ibtihaj muhammad   ibtihajmuhammad  december    another interview  muhammad was asked about trump by a new jersey com reporter  her sarcastic answer was   who  she did say this  though  that s the gift and the curse of social media  you hear from young women all the time  but you also hear from the haters   muhammad said   but i want people to know that as hard as they ve been on me  they don t even come close to what we saw in the shooting in north carolina or the rhetoric around the khan family at the  democratic national convention   it s ridiculous  we  as a country  have to change  and i feel like this is a moment  unfortunately for muhammad  after winning her first round  the eighth ranked fencer lost to her ninth ranked opponent from france featured image via dylan buell at getty images
