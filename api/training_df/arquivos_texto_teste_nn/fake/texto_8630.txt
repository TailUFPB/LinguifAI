republican rep  ted poe  r texas  spoke with family research council president tony perkins yesterday  on the radio show  washington watch   where they discussed obama s diplomatic victory in the peaceful release of iranian prisoners perkins was very upset over the idea that we got americans returned home by talking to iran and using diplomacy  he suggested that america has hit a dangerously slippery slope in regards to americans being held abroad in prisons  because the fact we did something to get our people home would only invite more and more demands in future incidents poe agreed that it was a very sad state of affairs for the nation  the  price  as he put it  that america had paid was simply too high  what price is acceptable  he didn t say  he only continued on to lament the fact that the days of ronald reagan and not negotiating with terrorists were gone from the country since he brought up ronald reagan and his policy of not negotiating with terrorists  let s take a closer look at that during reagan s second term  officials of his administration and very likely reagan himself secretly and illegally sold weapons to iran  iran was under an arms embargo at the time because they were considered a terrorist state  the sale was done in order to bribe iran to help facilitate the release of american hostages in lebanon the republican revisionism and selective memory  when it comes to the legacy of ronald reagan is nothing short of amazing  the iran contra scandal happened when practically every establishment republican was alive and old enough to be able to watch the news or read the newspaper  it s like germany insisting world war  never happened  and instead the entire nation was on vacation for  years president obama did everything right  getting our people home  not firing one bullet to do it  while not sending more weapons into the hands of those who can do us harm  and the first reaction from the right is to attack him for it i m sure republicans wish the prisoners were still being held so they had a political football  but can t they just try to repeal obamacare again featured image via youtube screen capture
