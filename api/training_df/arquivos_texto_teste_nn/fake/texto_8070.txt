the dramatic opening of marco rubio s new ad  which is titled  it s morning again in america   features a city that isn t even in america  it s in canada it didn t take long for the canadian based vancouver sun to spot footage of the vancouver skyline  which is clearly featured in the opening footage of rubio s new ad as the narrator proclaims  it s morning again in america   we are treated to a scene that highlights some of vancouver  canada s most recognizable landmarks  which includes harbour centre  one wall centre and the port metro vancouver cranes the footage is not only of canada  instead of the united states  but it also features a canadian seaspan tugboat  the tugboat appears to be flying the canadian flag watch the video  which was uploaded to youtube by marco rubio  february  marco rubio wants to be president of the united states  but he can t even find footage of the united states to use in his  it s morning again in america  campaign ad as bad as it seems  it shouldn t really be a surprise what else would you expect from a presidential candidate who has been dubbed  the biggest idiot running for president  that s quite a distinction  considering the sheer number of idiots hoping to win the gop nomination this year rubio became a household name in   after delivering the gop s annual response to the president s state of the union address while no one remembers a word then senator rubio said during the speech  the image of him guzzling water from a plastic bottle will never fade from our collective memory since then rubio has won the hearts of republican voters  who appear to love him not just because he is rabidly anti gay  but also because he repeatedly brags that he is  not a scientist  with the release of his latest campaign ad  i think it is safe to assume that marco rubio is also not a geographer featured image from video screen capture  via marco rubio on youtube
