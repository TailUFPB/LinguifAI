the last couple of years have been rampant with what seems like premature deaths  would we have ever been able to prepare ourselves for the deaths of robin williams  david bowie  prince and so many  many more people  unfortunately  we have another name to add to what seems like a particularly grim year  muhammad ali   and the obamas  in a statement to america   mourned the loss as deeply as any of us to the obamas  ali   who was resoundingly loved and admired  and was actually  unlike president obama  a black muslim   was  the greatest  period  like everyone else on the planet  michelle and i mourn his passing  but we re also grateful to god for how fortunate we are to have known him  if just for a while  for how fortunate we all are that the greatest chose to grace our time  muhammad ali was the greatest  period  if you just asked him  he d tell you  he d tell you he was the double greatest  that he d  handcuffed lightning  thrown thunder into jail   obama wrote   but what made the champ the greatest   what truly separated him from everyone else   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing  the president also tweeted  showing himself working with a picture of the champ behind him he shook up the world  and the world s better for it  rest in peace  champ  pic twitter com   president obama   potus  june    also noted that he has a pair of ali s boxing gloves in his private study obama continued   i am america   he once declared   i am the part you won t recognize  but get used to me   black  confident  cocky  my name  not yours  my religion  not yours  my goals  my own  get used to me   that s the ali i came to know as i came of age   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring  but a man who fought for what was right  a man who fought for us  he stood with king and mandela  stood up when it was hard  spoke out when others wouldn t  his fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing  it would earn him enemies on the left and the right  make him reviled  and nearly send him to jail  but ali stood his ground  and his victory helped us get used to the america we recognize today  muhammad ali shook up the world   obama concluded in his tribute to ali   and the world is better for it  we are all better for it  michelle and i send our deepest condolences to his family  and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace  source  rolling stonehere s a video while obama was born during the height of the civil rights movement  he came of age watching ali  to obama  martin luther king and even malcolm x were parts of history books  but ali was brash  confident  smart  socially aware and a force to be reckoned with in the  and   while so many civil rights leaders were working behind the scenes  or perhaps in front  but more quietly  ali told the world that he could do anything  no matter his skin color  perhaps there would have never been a president barack obama if it weren t for the example put forth by muhammad ali featured image via kent gavin at getty images
