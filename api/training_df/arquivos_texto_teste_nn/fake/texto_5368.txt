republicans continue to jump the sinking ship that chose donald trump to be their captain chris ladd has been a republican for  years now  he is so hardcore that he s even a friend of former texas governor rick perry and thought the world of ronald reagan but now that the party has chosen donald trump as their  nominee  ladd wants nothing more to do with the gop any longer  and he tore republicans a new one in a letter he wrote announcing his resignation from the york township republican committeemen s organization and it is an epic read  at the national level  the delusions necessary to sustain our cold war coalition were becoming dangerous long before donald trump arrived   ladd pointed out   from tax policy to climate change  we have found ourselves less at odds with philosophical rivals than with the fundamentals of math  science and objective reality  and then donald trump came along and made the party even worse  from his fairy tale wall to his schoolyard bullying and his flirtation with violent racists  donald trump offers america a singular narrative   a tale of cowards  fearful people  convinced of our inadequacy  trembling before a world alight with imaginary threats  crave a demagogue  neither party has ever elevated to this level a more toxic figure  one that calls forth the darkest elements of our national character with three decades invested in the republican party  there is a powerful temptation to shrug and soldier on  despite the bold rhetoric  we all know trump will lose  why throw away a great personal investment over one bad nominee  trump is not merely a poor candidate  but an indictment of our character  preserving a party is not a morally defensible goal if that party has lost its legitimacy  ladd goes on to reminisce about reagan s positive message and then sharply rebukes republicans for abandoning their morality to pledge their allegiance to a fascist who has none  fast forward to our present leadership and the nature of our dilemma is clear  i watched paul ryan speak at donald trump s convention the way a young child watches his father march off to prison  thousands of republican figures that loathe donald trump  understand the danger he represents  and privately hope he loses  are publicly declaring their support for him  in illinois our local and state gop organizations  faced with a choice  have decided on complicity our leaders  compromise preserves their personal capital at our collective cost  their refusal to dissent robs all republicans of moral cover  evasion and cowardice has prevailed over conscience  we are now  and shall indefinitely remain  the party of donald trump i will not contribute my name  my work  or my character to an utterly indefensible cause  no sensible adult demands moral purity from a political party  but conscience is meaningless without constraints  a party willing to lend its collective capital to donald trump has entered a compromise beyond any credible threshold of legitimacy  there is no redemption in being one of the  good nazis  i hereby resign my position as a york township republican committeeman  my thirty year tenure as a republican is over  ladd is absolutely right  the republican party has shattered any claim they had of being the morally superior party precisely because they are supporting a man who does not share their values  furthermore  they are supporting a man who uses fear as a political tool and has a pessimistic view of america this is not a sign of good news for the republican party or donald trump  trump has seriously created a rift in the party between moderate republicans and conservatives that could cost the gop dearly on election day  the republican party needs more than just their base to win a general election and that means they need moderate voters like ladd in order to have a chance at winning if more people like ladd continue to leave the republican party because of donald trump  the gop is finished featured image  drew angerer getty images
