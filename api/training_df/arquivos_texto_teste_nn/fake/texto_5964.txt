fearing that the  presidential election will be a disaster   with hillary clinton and senate democrats looking pretty favorable   republicans have  of course  have been working overtime to suppress the vote in a key battleground state  ohio as everyone knows  no person elected president has ever won without winning ohio  even though clinton wouldn t need ohio  as long as she nabs virginia  north carolina and florida  to win  that hasn t stopped republicans from already attempting to rig the election however  their hopes of doing just that were destroyed in court  when a federal judge issued a ruling that the state s new laws restricting the collection and counting of absentee ballots and poll workers aiding voters were unconstitutional on racial grounds  judge algenon marble wrote in his decision voter suppression tactics have not disappeared but are now merely cloaked in ostensibly race neutral language judge marble also noted that the state s decision to bar poll workers from helping minorities fill out ballots unless the voter affirmed that he or she was disabled or illiterate was in violation of the constitution  for it established a  literacy test  on those seeking to vote the court agrees with dr  timberlake that these inequalities  rooted in historical discrimination against african americans  have  significant and far reaching  effects with specific and direct consequences for voting  because low literacy levels are also correlated with substandard education and the court has credited dr  timberlake s findings that african americans suffer from lower educational attainment than whites in ohio  the court concludes that african americans would also suffer from higher costs associated with the five field requirement and the prohibition on poll worker assistance because they would face disproportionately more challenges filling out the forms   because african americans move more frequently than whites  they may be more likely to be forced to vote provisionally  they are also more likely to be homeless   and because they are more likely to have inflexible schedules or lack access in other words  the state of ohio  which is run by republicans  attempted to circumvent black voters by instilling on them an option  know how to spell or your vote doesn t matter republicans literally just tried to turn black people away from voting   in  this is what republicans do  they disenfranchise black voters because they know their days of white rule are coming to and end featured image via andrew burton getty images
