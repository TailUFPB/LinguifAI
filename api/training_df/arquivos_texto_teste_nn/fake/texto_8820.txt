modern day culture is far from what it used to be  technology has taken over human contact and conversation  and people are seemingly forgetting what it s like the actually speak with a person who is directly in front of them  this forgetfulness can also be seen in the depths of twitter as trolls seem to feel they can say anything to anyone at any time with no remorse for their actions or words because there is no human face attached to who they are attacking a great example of this lack of human interaction experience occurred after jennifer lawrence won her golden globe for her performance in joy  in what some people are calling rude  the actress was just being brutally honest and some people forget what it s like to point something out to someone s face  in actuality  the person who was being rude was a particular reporter who was asking lawrence a question surrounding her win the reporter begins to ask lawrence a question  but the oscar winner quickly cuts him off and says  you can t live your whole life behind your phone  bro  you can t do that  you ve got to live in the now  you know  the reporter continuing on  mentioned the oscars  so lawrence  being the quit witted person that she is  drove home her point  we re at the golden globes  if you put your phone down  you d know that  now  to the people calling lawrence rude   really  she was clearly giving that reporter her undivided attention and was making herself available to answer his question  and he was still staring at his phone  so  who was rude  it certainly wasn t lawrence for pointing it out if you go back and watch the golden globes during the part when amy schumer and jennifer lawrence were announcing each other s films  you can see that there was a jab at people using their phones then  too we ve become a culture all too reliant on our cell phones and technology that we ve forgotten basic human interaction skills  better known as social skills  don t call someone rude for pointing out rude behavior  take what they are saying to heart  understand why it may offend you  because you may be just as guilty  and remember that human beings should  in fact  have human interaction without technology getting in the way lawrence perfectly points out what s wrong with modern day life  and kudos to her for doing so  we all need to live in the now  life is happening before our very eyes if we make the decision to look up from our mobile devices  jennifer lawrence calls out a reporter for not looking up from his phone   goldenglobes  backstage https   t co   variety   variety  january    video featured image  twitter
