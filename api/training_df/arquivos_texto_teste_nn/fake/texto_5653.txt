can you put a price on bigotry  north carolina republicans just did  it s    north carolina is a state precariously placed in the danger zones of both hurricanes and tornadoes  it s suffered its fair share of disastrous floods  it s warm enough to be a fertile ground for the mosquitoes experts warn could be spreading the devastating zika virus  so it s more than just a little crazy that republican governor pat mccrory announced that he would be robbing his state s own disaster relief fund to pay for the defense of his illegal trans bathroom bill led by mccrory  state republicans have diverted half a million dollars from the state s  emergency response and disaster relief  fund and say they will use it to hire lawyers to fight tooth and nail against the federal government which has deemed the anti trans bill known as  unconstitutional  considering how obvious it is that this violates the civil rights act  the money will serve only to delay the inevitable for as long as possible the law has already cost the state tens of millions of dollars in lost business  boycotts  and bad press  adding the    is only going to make things worse  this is particularly dire because the fight against the zika virus continues to go unfunded at the federal level  a recent bill proposed by republicans to give some of the funds was shot down by democrats after they insisted on including an amendment to defund obamacare  the premise  to take away millions of americans health insurance during the outbreak of a potential health epidemic was  to put it lightly  repugnant on every level so rather than get serious at a state level  north carolina decided to defund itself  it will now head into the eye of the zika storm with a pitiable amount of money to combat it  instead  they will pay for a few lawyers to ensure trans people are victimized for just a few months longer  if that doesn t say it all  i don t know what does featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
