 it s a trap   that s the messaging that the trump campaign has decided to go with when asked about trump s response to the father of a muslim man who died while serving as an american army captain overseas  it s a narrative that the trump campaign uses often   if trump says something horrible on camera it s because the media twisted his words  one of trump s surrogates  scottie nell hughes  tried to use this tactic during a segment on cnn s new day on sunday morning the father  khizr khan  spoke at the democratic national convention  where he called out trump for his proposal to ban muslims from entering the united states  khan said during his speech that trump has sacrificed nothing or no one in his life trump  a billionaire  responded by saying  i think i ve made a lot of sacrifices  i work very  very hard  i ve created thousands and thousands of jobs  tens of thousands of jobs  built great structures  i ve had tremendous success  i think i ve done a lot  this response came out during an interview with george stephanopoulos hughes says that she was initially disappointed with trump s comments about khan  however  once she realized that the interview was a part of the media s agenda to make trump look bad  which is apparently something he could never do on his own in the mind of a trump supporter  she has to tell people the truth   it s all a giant media conspiracy  now that i ve read the questions and the trump campaign and others have released the full transcript  you can see what a setup this is  which was nothing but to trap mr  trump going forward  the truth is that trump is trapped  he is trapped by the vile rhetoric that he has spewed throughout the primary election  he went full fascist and it is preventing him from being able to effectively pivot more to the middle in order to win the votes he needs to win a general election hughes  like many other trump supporters  are in for a rude awakening when if they are capable of doing so   they realize that they backed a losing candidate you can watch hughes desperately try to rationalize trump s horrendous comments below  trump to  khizrkhan  i ve made a lot of sacrifices   victorblackwell gets reax from  scottienhughes  asbthelawhttps   t co   new day   newday  july    image via video screen capture
