a muslim high school student in rancho cucamonga  california  received an apology from officials at her school after she was misidentified as  isis phillips  in her yearbook  the council on american islamic relations is slamming the school  is calling for an investigation of the incident  and plans to send a legal team to meet with the school district the incident fits in with a pattern of recent events in america bayan zehlif  a junior at los osos  was photographed for the yearbook wearing a hijab  she posted the photo from the yearbook with the incorrect caption on facebook and twitter  according to the los angeles times  i am extremely saddened  disgusted  hurt and embarrassed that the los osos high school yearbook was able to get away with this   zehlif wrote on facebook   apparently  i am  isis  in the yearbook  the school reached out to me and had the audacity to say that this was a typo  i beg to differ  let s be real  one of her fellow students told the ny daily news that zehlif was overreacting  and that it was simply an innocent mistake  but it is quite a coincidence for that name to be attached to a muslim student in recent years conservatives have led efforts to attack muslims across america  to the point where leading officials like president obama have had to intervene to make it clear that muslims have and will continue to be part of the fabric of america in a similar case  a muslim student who made a clock and brought it to school was accused of making a bomb  president obama invited him to the white house  pointing out that children should be encouraged to be interested in fields like engineering  not demonized at the same time  presumptive republican presidential candidate donald trump has opposed allowing syrian war refugees into the united states  and favors a ban on muslim immigration to the country   a proposal supported by a majority of republican voters recent attacks on immigrants have also traced their inspiration to speeches and comments from trump  including high school students who yelled racial epithets at latino students  that is the sort of atmosphere bayan zehlif is growing up in  so it might be hard for her to believe this isis incident was just a mistake featured image via flickr
