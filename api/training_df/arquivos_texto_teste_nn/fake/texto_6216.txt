bill o reilly is a real piece of work  on his show  he often passes judgment on those he believes aren t upholding what he considers  family values   while when not in front of a fox news camera  his home life disintegrates around him recently  the host  who once accused beyonce of singing  gangsta rap  that encouraged young girls to get pregnant  suffered a civil court deathblow when a panel of judges granted his ex wife maureen mcphilmy sole custody of the pair s two children   based partly on some of the disturbing statements from the children themselves  o reilly s daughter once told investigators that fights between her parents could reach the point of violence thanks to o reilly s legendary temper  court appointed forensic examiner testified at a closed hearing that o reilly s daughter claimed to have witnessed her father dragging mcphilmy down a staircase by her neck  apparently unaware that the daughter was watching  the precise date of the alleged incident is unclear  but appears to have occurred before the couple separated in   the same source indicated that the daughter  who is  years old  told the forensic examiner about the incident within the past year o reilly ongoing ugly separation with his former wife took another twist this week when o reilly s lawyers announced that they would be pursuing a lawsuit against mcphilmy  her  crime  was that she went on to have another relationship after she left o reilly  but prior to their legal divorce   or as o reilly calls that  fraud gawker notes according to court documents filed late last month  however  o reilly intends to sue mcphilmy for   million on charges of misleading him about the terms of their separation agreement  in the same papers  the fox news host accuses mcphilmy of using the proceeds of their separation to underwrite an affair with another man  and he wants the entire lawsuit to proceed in secret o reilly claims that his separation agreement  which included financial compensation to mcphilmy should be invalid because she was in a relationship with another man  it s not entirely clear  why   one theory is that this is really about control  o reilly doesn t like the idea that his ex wife gets to live her life out from under his thumb  especially if she got to keep some of his money in the divorce that would fall in line with o reilly s deeply troubling actions in the wake of his marriage woes  when he suspected his wife of having an affair in the first place  he used his political and financial power to try to persuade his local police department to harass the suspected interloper  who was a police detective on long island   the police department appears to have done o reilly s bidding  ordering a bewildered internal affairs officer to mess with the detective in order to get him to stop dating o reilly estranged wife  the police ordered  harasym to meet with two private detectives working on behalf of bill o reilly  they had information about an ncpd officer they believed to be carrying on with o reilly s wife  delargy told harasym to launch an investigation into the man and to tell him to end the relationship instead o reilly lost his wife  his kids  and any claim he ever had to get to be sanctimonious in front of a camera  with nothing left to lose  o reilly appears to want vengeance instead  it s hard to imagine a court will side with him  but it does present o reilly the opportunity to once again make his ex wife s life miserable  it may not be family values  but it s certainly o reilly s values featured image via the blaze
