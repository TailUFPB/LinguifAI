after a very public falling out  megyn kelly finally got her chance to sit down for an interview with donald trump  rather than make nice  kelly seized the opportunity to call out trump to his face on some of the disgusting things he s said about women  including kelly  over the years  his reaction was  unexpected in the midst of trump s lengthy interview with kelly  he was asked about the way he disparagingly called women  bimbos   for once  trump  whose face went from orange to deep red  was tongue tied  awkward and  low energy   he was extremely off his game   and it was cringe worthy to watch kelly brought up trump s twitter activity  which often features the candidate for   and it s important to keep this in mind  president of the united states passing along messages from his fans that include sexist  racist  or violent remarks  trump s defense was lame   you would be surprised at the ones i don t retweet  kelly persisted   bimbo  uncharacteristically  trump could only meekly sputter mindlessly  no come back  no counterattack  just awkward half formed sentences punctuated by painfully long moments of silence watch the moment megyn kelly confronted donald trump over the  bimbo  retweets  pic twitter com   breaking news feed   pzf  may     trump seemed to regain some of his more recognizable awfulness  he claimed kelly must have been called a lot worse than  bimbo  over her lifetime  so she shouldn t be upset when he does it kelly s response was pitch perfect   it s not about me  it s about the messaging   to young girls and to other women  trump had no response  his message to young girls and to other women is one backed by sexism and objectification  kelly may have been called worse than  bimbo  over her lifetime  but trump has certainly said worse  too featured image via twitter
