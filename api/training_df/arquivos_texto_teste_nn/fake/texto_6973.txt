at a wisconsin high school soccer game  players from the visiting team walked off the field as the home team crowd disgraced themselves with racist chants of  donald trump  build that wall   beloit  wis   officials from the elkhorn area school district are investigating racist taunts directed at beloit memorial high school soccer players by a group of its students attending a game the incident happened thursday night as the beloit memorial girls varsity soccer team visited elkhorn beloit memorial girls soccer coach brian denu said the elkhorn students taunted black and latina girls soccer players with racial slurs and chants like  donald trump  build that wall  considering the young age of the students doing the chanting  it s hard to say if they actually meant what they were saying or if they just thought it would be a clever way to distract the opposing team  either way  the effect was devastating  they came off the field and weren t able to finish the game because they were too upset and distraught over what happened to them   denu said  one of the girls was cradled in the arms of one of our assistant coaches for a good  to  minutes  denu said even though the chants came from a small group of elkhorn students  their words had a big impact on his players  i could just see the hurt and pain on their face and know that this was obviously something that they hadn t seen before   denu said i want to give the benefit of the doubt but in all likelihood  this is the trump effect spilling down  it s not difficult to imagine that the parents of these students are ardent trump supporters that have been gleefully teaching their children that it s ok to hate if the other person has dark skin  that is  after all  the core of trump s popularity  it s not just that he s openly racist  he s telling his followers that it s permissible  encouraged even  for them to openly hate as well school officials are looking into the incident but it s unclear if they will be able to do anything about it  at the very least  it would be nice if the other students from elkhorn publicly shunned their fellow classmates for their racism featured image via ai archives
