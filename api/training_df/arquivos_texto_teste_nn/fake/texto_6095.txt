ted cruz thinks he could be an asset to the campaigns of his fellow republican senators  there s just one problem  though  most of them don t like him republicans currently face an uphill climb this year  especially with donald trump at the top of the  ballot  the nomination of trump presents a major problem for republicans who hope to keep their seats or take seats away from democrats indeed  instead of riding trump s coattails to victory  republicans are looking at down ballot rejection as people associate them with the republican nominee and his vile campaign despite being destroyed by trump  texas senator ted cruz wants to lend a hand to his colleagues  that can go a long way toward establishing good relationships   one cruz adviser told the hill   at the same time  though  i d be wildly surprised if he suddenly started moderating his principles just to get along  establishing good rapport with colleagues is incredibly crucial to running for higher office  but ted cruz has alienated and pissed off most of his senate colleagues because of his aggressive losing strategies in recent years  the biggest of which is undoubtedly the government shutdown in  cruz incited the shutdown because he thought it would force president obama to dismantle obamacare  in the end  it was a pr nightmare for republicans as the american people rightfully blamed them for shutting the government down but the cruz adviser thinks his colleagues will be interested in taking cruz s help  i think politicians are practical people   he said   they re going to be pretty interested in the kind of support he can give them i think fewer people would say they don t want him now  unfortunately for cruz  he seriously underestimates just how much his colleagues loathe him as it stands  incumbent republicans facing tough re election battles don t want ted cruz making their lives more difficult when asked by the hill if she would accept help from ted cruz  new hampshire senator kelly ayotte said   uh  no  i don t think i d ask anyone to come up  generally  other than i had  joni  and shelley  up   she continued   this is about me campaigning for new hampshire  i m going to be focusing on my campaign for me  it s not a reflection on him  or anyone else he hasn t contacted me  but i m sure there s a lot of different races out there  in other words  please don t come to new hampshire  ted in pennsylvania  senator pat toomey also faces a tough campaign  but that doesn t mean he wants cruz there to make it worse  not going to  into what my campaign is doing   toomey insisted and then there is arizona senator john mccain  who has famously referred to cruz as a  whacko bird   yeah  he definitely does not want cruz stumping for him in his home state mccain said he only seeks help from people he is close to   i m not close to sen  cruz   mccain declared so it looks like many republicans would rather not have cruz s support  which isn t surprising considering how extreme he is on several issues frankly  if cruz wanted his colleagues to be more enthusiastic  perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the most annoying voice in the senate featured image  spencer platt getty images
