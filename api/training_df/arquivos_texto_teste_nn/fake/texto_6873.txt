it s quite hard to laugh at what donald trump plans to do if he becomes president  especially since he s been winning in the polls for the republican nomination for president  however  when kids actually say some of the crazy things trump has said he plans to do  it all becomes hilarious  in fact  these kids actually show us how ridiculous donald trump actually is jimmy fallon compiled videos of kids imitating some of the silliest statements trump has made during his nightmarish run for the gop nomination and then perfectly mocks him  in one example  a girl in a new york accent hilariously said  if you don t want to build a wall  you re a loser  vote for trump and make america great again  or  you re gonna be a loser  in another skit  a trump impersonator brags about his performance in the polls  saying  i m doing so good and i m going to win and once i win  we will win so much that everyone will be sick of winning  the funny skits genuinely prove just how ridiculous trump s statements are when put in the context of kids saying them  the hope is that donald trump  along with ted cruz  will just be a funny memory come november watch video here  featured image via video screenshot
