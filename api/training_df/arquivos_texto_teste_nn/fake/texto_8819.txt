instead of respectfully attending president obama s final state of the union address like other republican nominees  ted cruz is skipping it the texas tea party senator made the decision to campaign in new hampshire on january  rather than spending a couple hours respectfully listening to what our current commander in chief has to say during one of his last major speeches as president of course  it s not like cruz couldn t fly in and fly back out after the speech is over  which is why this definitely feels like a snub of president obama  especially when you consider that senators rand paul  marco rubio  and bernie sanders are all putting their campaigns on pause for the evening to hear what president obama has to say but cruz campaign spokesman rick tyler insists that this isn t a snub at all  cruz is simply working hard to win new hampshire  he says  even though cruz is in third place in the granite state  points behind leader donald trump  it s not a snub  he s going to be in new hampshire  working hard to win new hampshire  no disrespect  it just is going to work out this way  tyler also added that cruz will be be  disappointed  with the speech no matter where he is at the time it is delivered   it won t matter because he ll be just as disappointed in new hampshire as he will be in the chamber   he said adding further insult and disrespect toward president obama  cruz intends to hold his own state of the union hours before the real one in what the dallas morning news reports is being billed as the  state of our union town hall meeting with senator ted cruz  basically  cruz is snubbing the state of the union address to run off and pretend he is already president and his disrespectful actions could come back to haunt him come election day in november james madison university professor of media and politics dan schill told the hill that while cruz s stunt won t necessarily harm him among republican primary voters who already cheer anybody who disrespects president obama  it may cost him voters who see this as being disrespectful  i don t think it will necessarily turn off too many primary voters in new hampshire and iowa  but there is that risk   he said   the choice to stiff the speech can send a message it s time for change  it may also backfire for people who see it as not respecting office of the presidency  in short  ted cruz is being a disrespectful little prick who believes he can fire up new hampshire republicans to vote for him if he snubs president obama it s one thing to dislike the man who is president  but disrespecting the office is totally unacceptable and proves once again that ted cruz isn t qualified to be president  whether he is a natural born citizen or not featured image  wikimedia
