after donald trump won the indiana primary on tuesday and ted cruz dropped out  trump became the presumptive republican nominee  this means  that a reality television star and real estate mogul who puts down women and minorities  as well as also being endorsed by the kkk  is going to represent the gop this november at the ballot box for president of the united states this is a moment when satire becomes reality  and all you can really do is hold up hope that the democrats will win trump as president is a horrifying prospect  he has zero public policy experience  no foreign policy experience  and is pretty much hated worldwide  the world is looking at the united states right now as if we have lost our ever loving minds  how could such a vile person be a legitimate choice for leader of the free world if you don t believe he is hated  because maybe you re a bigot yourself  or maybe you hate yourself enough to like him  or you are absolutely ignorant to reality  take a glimpse at what cnn just accidentally aired behind the cnn reporter speaking about trump supposedly wanting to help the gop raise money  there is a woman who is speaking for all of us in one united voice as she give trump tower the middle finger  thus  flipping off donald trump here s the image that was captured as it happened via cnnsome may think this is crude  but so is donald trump  if he can dish out insult after insult  and vile comment after vile comment  then he deserves to get a middle finger pointed in his general direction donald trump should not and cannot be our next president  no matter where you are on the political spectrum  have enough wherewithal to do not only what is best for the nation  but also the world no matter who   vote blue featured image via screenshot of cnn
