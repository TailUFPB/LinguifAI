likening girls to common crops that should be rushed off to the market as soon as possible is a growing belief among conservative  christians  if you have heard of the duggar family you ve likely heard of the quiverfull movement they belong to  which requires christians to have as many kids as possible  which is why the duggars have  children but there is another part of the quiverfull movement that is even creepier one quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits  they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible  in other words  this christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middle aged men in the middle east their website is called  let them marry   and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmer father and provided to men who are  in need  girls are like apples on trees  their fathers are the farmers  whose job is to care for them  he must protect his apples from pests and disease  he must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely  neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location  but  when each reaches peak ripeness  it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will  to those in need  so there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them  but it is the farmer s duty to provide for both  in due season  here s the image via raw story a quote from the group leader  vaughn ohlman  makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of same sex marriage like conservatives constantly claim  but directly from religious fanaticism  which former quiverfull member vyckie garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband  kept in trust by daddy  we believe that not only should most people marry  they should marry in their youth  the bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth   prov     is     mal      and  children of the youth   ps      scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age   cor       leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless  barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actions in short  this conservative christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girls just another example of the christian sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats  featured image from pixabay
