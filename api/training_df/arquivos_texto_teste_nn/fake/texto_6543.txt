a lot has changed since ted cruz dropped out of the race for the gop presidential nomination  leaving donald trump as the presumptive nominee  well  perhaps not a lot has changed  but it was a bit of a shocker when  because of trump s victory  the  ber conservative website redstate suggested that now would be the time for the senate to approve the nomination of merrick garland for the supreme court now  to be fair  redstate  which is published by erick erickson  a man once called the most powerful conservative in america  has never been a fan of trump  much of the blog s front page  as of late  has been dedicated to the  nevertrump movement  here is how badly redstate wants you not to vote for trump i say this without rancor  sarcasm or ill will  for anyone who wants to know what s next for the  nevertrump movement  the answer is that we don t vote for trump  each person will deal with that differently   some will vote for third party or not vote  some will vote for hillary   nevertrump means different things to different people except for one thing   it means we will not vote for trump  not ever  and nothing that s happened tonight has changed that over the course of the next few weeks and months and years  as a conservative movement we will spend a great deal of time in self reflection  examining the weaknesses in our movement that allowed a cancer like trump to flourish in our midst  we will have hard decisions to make about our affiliation with the republican party  and what we will do with our votes in november but one thing and one thing only remains certain  donald trump will never have our vote  we said it  and we meant it yikes  but what does that have to do with the nomination of merrick garland  well  redstate is convinced that there s no way on earth that trump could make it to the white house  and that if hillary nominates someone  she might nominate a  duh duh duh  liberal now that donald trump is the presumptive nominee  this is not even a close call  there is absolutely no reason to drag this out any longer  garland is not a great choice  but he is not a terrible one  either  and more than anything  he is old  for a modern supreme court appointment  and will be up for replacement in probably  years instead of  or  republicans must know that there is absolutely no chance that we will win the white house in  now  they must also know that we are likely to lose the senate as well  so the choices  essentially  are to confirm garland and have another bite at the apple in a decade  or watch as president clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and   years younger  and we are in no position to stop it unfortunately  no matter how many senators agree with redstate  there s little chance that garland will see a confirmation hearing  only one man stands between him and the hearing  and that man has vowed to never  under any circumstances  negotiate with terrorists president obama  even as of wednesday  mitch mcconnell is standing resolute to obstruct to be fair  redstate s article wasn t an editorial stance  erickson himself hates trump  probably as much as you or i  but he s not ready to go so far as to concede anything to the black man in the white house  naturally  he didn t say that  but he is concerned that independents might vote for hillary  from nbc news  if republicans confirm merrick garland  in addition to further alienating the republican base  they risk taking away keep arguments that can persuade independent voters to go with a republican senate  ticket splitting is a rare phenomenon in the united states  but this is a rare election where ticket splitting is a real possibility   erickson wrote yes  ticket splitting is a real possibility  but   of americans want to see at least a hearing  if not a confirmation  perhaps going forward with a hearing could help solidify the fractured party featured image via wikimedia
