in   robert slater wrote a book called no such thing as over exposure  inside the life and celebrity of donald trump  it was a biography but eventually it turned out to be an example of how trump resorts to bribery to rewrite his own public history donald being donald  his own ego demanded he get involved personally in the book s creation once he was made aware of it  he had to ensure that it was nothing but a positive story about him slater described what happened when trump saw the book  he asked me to take out an anecdote that he had told me on the plane flying to chicago about how he had informed his second wife that he was going to divorce her by announcing it first to the new york post  greatest anecdote anybody has ever told me  he put the newspaper down in front of her door that said   donald is divorcing marla   that s how she learned about the divorce donald was not even enough of a man to tell his own wife that he wanted a divorce  he was such a coward and bully that he announced it to a tabloid trash  newspaper   while publicly shaming her for literally the entire world to see  how the hell will he ever deal with vladimir putin if he can t deal with talking to his own wife then there s that bit about the bribe  trump promised slater that if he liked the book he would buy a huge number of them  this is how trump operates  he s so ashamed of his past that he offers money in order to whitewash his own history slater said that his publisher saw nothing but dollar signs  so despite his inclination at first towards integrity and truth  they gave in and whitewashed the biography of those facts to ensure a big payday directly from trump s wallet at the end of the day  trump is the longest term case study for  affluenza   he was born a rich a hole who just spent years growing bigger  given his celebrity  he literally globally shamed his wife at the time  then used money to avoid some of the consequences of his actions featured image via getty
