billionaire investor warren buffett has portrayed himself as a proponent for fixing income and wealth inequality  famously telling congress they should tax the wealthy more  as he claims to pay lower income tax rates than his secretary  in reality  his actions have hurt working class and middle class people  through his lobbying efforts in favor of the electric utility companies he owns in nevada  buffett s utility company nv energy  strongly opposed the emergence of solar power in the state brought by elon musk s solar city  which made it affordable for homeowners to install solar panels  because the solar panels often put energy back into the grid  utility companies like the ones warren buffett owns wind up paying those residents for energy  nevada senator harry reid in regards to buffet s company told the las vegas sun  looking at this as a lawyer  my personal feeling is that this is a violation of the sherman antitrust act  buffett s lobbying efforts pushed nevada s utility regulator  the public utilities commission  to remove incentives for homeowners to have solar panels  making solar power once again unaffordable for nevada residents  the decision effectively derailed the fastest growing market for solar power in the country a petition for buffet to ease his opposition to solar power was signed by over   renewable energy advocates in protest  actor mark ruffalo  who called the public utility commission   the anti robin hood  also participated in the protests at the end of   solar city ceased operations and installations in nevada as a result of the public utilities commission decision  resulting in the loss of  jobs  the decision could set a precedent across the country in opposition of solar power  which not only has been championed by billionaire warren buffett  but the koch brothers as well  over the argument solar power makes the market place unfair for competitors koch advocacy groups didn t directly enter the fight in nevada between elon musk s solar city and warren buffett s utility companies  but they have lobbied in nearby states against incentives for solar power in florida  which has the third best solarity of any state in the country  the koch brothers have led efforts to keep solar power out of the state to protect electricity sales of investor owned utilities  as it remains ranks  in the nation in solar production  for investors  more infrastructure on the electric grid yields more profits  but solar power directly threatens those profits  in florida  the average household pays more than  percent higher for electrical consumption than the national average   percent of florida s electricity generation comes from natural gas  and  percent from coal the koch s grassroots political group  americans for prosperity  called for florida to fight against the choice for solar  many organizations who have received millions in donations from the koch brothers helped struck down an initiative to open up florida to solar power on voters  ballots in   including  plus and the national black chamber of commerce  whose latest convention was sponsored by koch industries   despite the lobbying efforts of the koch brothers  solar power has bipartisan support  as the ballot initiative to open up solar power in florida was led by tea party founder debbie dooley  who now directs the group  conservatives for energy freedom as solar power becomes more accessible and affordable for americans  utility companies and their investors  especially the most powerful ones such as warren buffet and the koch brothers  are obstructing solar s growth through lobbying state governments  despite the obstructions  solar power is gaining bipartisan support across the nation  let s say if the only thing we had was solar energy if that was the only power source if you just took a small section of spain you could power all of europe   said elon musk in a speech at sorbonne university in paris this past december   it s a very small amount of area that s actually needed to generate the electricity we need to power civilization  or in the case of the u s   like a little corner of nevada or utah would power the united states  the technology exists to harness the energy from the sun  which more of hits the earth in one hour than humanity uses in an entire year  sooner or later relics of old capitalism like warren buffett and the koch brothers are going to have to join the  century in this transition to renewable energy featured image courtesy of occupy democrats
