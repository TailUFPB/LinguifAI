nebraska senator ben sasse seems to be fed up with his party  and there s no way in hell he s going to vote for donald trump  in a lengthy facebook post  the nebraska senator called for a third party run to stop trump  while he was certainly none too kind to democratic frontrunner hillary clinton  he made it clear that his sights are set on stopping trump from getting anywhere near the white house  here is the embed of the post now  anyone with any sense regarding how our political process works knows that there s no way in hell a third party candidate can win in the current climate  in other words  if others jump ship like senator sasse has  the gop throws the election to clinton  yep  you read that right  there is at least one senator in the republican party who is already openly willing to pursue a track that goes against his own party s nominee  that is how much he hates trump he isn t the only one  either  most likely  house speaker paul ryan has already come out and said that despite the fact that trump is his party s presumptive presidential nominee  that he cannot support him at this time  further  there are plenty of republicans who are struggling with the idea of supporting a nomination where donald trump is at the top of their ticket  it s about time   finally  there are republicans who are at last somewhat sane who have drawn a line in the sand to show that they value their country over their party  there was a time when this would never have been the case  that is how bad trump is now  again  sasse was no friend to democrats in this post  but his response to the idea of a donald trump nomination is quite telling  the guy is no friend to trump as the gop nominee featured image via bill clark getty images
