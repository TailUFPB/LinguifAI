what happened to time magazine  the iconic news periodical has reached what may be an all time low with a cover so bloated with pro trump agitprop that it s astonishing it ever made it off of the editor s desk  yikes this week  time readers will be greeted with a bright red cover with huge letters proclaiming  as trump has often said  that america is bankrupt and needs pay off its debt or else face doom  to make the connection to trump even more explicit  the subtitle is  make america solvent again the problem  as economists were quick to point out  is that almost everything about this cover is meant to terrify the ignorant and obscure the truth  it s fear mongering plain and simple  it plays right into trump s hands new time cover addresses the national debt  pic twitter com   joe perticone   joeperticone  april    economists  the cover is mind numbingly stupid  as mat yglesias at vox carefully explained  there are major problems with every facet of the argument  for starters  given how wealth inequality works  averaging the debt across all americans is a nonsensical way of calculating how debt ridden the country is  you don t owe     and companies and billionaires  like trump  owe even more under the circumstances  it s true that dividing up the debt burden evenly among all households would be an enormous burden on many americans  but there is no reason to divide the burden up this way  the way the federal government finances things is it collects more money from the people who have more money there s also the fact that this  debt  is often owed to other americans  the united states borrows from itself a lot giving the illusion of a deep deficit to foreign powers  when really the money is changing hands within the boundaries of the country the whole time  part of paying off our debt would include cutting a check to ourselves but perhaps worst of all   solvency  doesn t mean what time wants you to think it means  the american economy is the most powerful in the world  and has grown a lot since the darkest days of the great recession   which means paying our debts hasn t been a problem  in fact  the only time creditors began to panic over america s debt was when republicans in congress floated the idea of defaulting on them to prove a political point  the antics earned america a drop in its credit rating   not because creditors believed it couldn t pay  but because they worried republicans simply wouldn t pay unfortunately  none of this is made clear by time  instead  people who glance over to a magazine rack in the coming weeks will see the kind of message that donald trump has played up  america is broke and pathetic and needs to be made  great  again with his powers of dealmaking  this is simply not true  and on the flip side  many economists have warned that a trump presidency would hurl the world into crisis  as he has routinely floated the idea of starting trade wars with countries he doesn t like  an event like that really could have the power to destroy america s economy in a way that would be difficult to ever recover from by enabling a trump talking point  time owes the country an apology  scare tactics and misleading information are what trump does best  and he doesn t need any help from a magazine many people trust featured image via twitter
