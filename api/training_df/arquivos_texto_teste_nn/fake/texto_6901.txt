of all the biblical teachings donald trump could choose from  the republican front runner landed on the one best known for telling people to be vindictive donald trump was a guest on wham  am when he got a question that by now he should have prepared for and somehow still clearly hasn t  what s your favorite bible verse  trump s flailing response speaks volumes when host bob lonsberry asked him what passage particularly  informed  his character  trump stumbled around before finally landing on  eye for an eye  well  i think many  i mean  when we get into the bible  i think many  so many  and some people  look  an eye for an eye  you can almost say that  that s not a particularly nice thing  the adage goes that crimes should be punished by committing an equally severe punishment on the transgressor  if a victim loses an eye  then the assailant should have his ripped out  notably  the new testament is steadfastly against this form of justice  even worse  trump may very well think the founder of christianity was weak for not agreeing with him  jesus christ famously condemned the practice and instead suggested people learn to turn the other cheek  you have heard that it was said   an eye for an eye  and a tooth for a tooth   but i say to you  do not resist an evil person  but whoever slaps you on your right cheek  turn the other to him also  the  eye for an eye  model isn t even unique to judeo christian tenets  long before judaism  the sumerians were doing the same  needless to say  in the intervening thousands of years  legal codes and moral philosophers have evolved beyond this crude form of punishment  it seems part of making america great again means rewinding ethical progress by about   years during his interview he pivoted from the bible to saying america is an embarrassment for not being more vengeful  if you look at what s happening to our country  i mean  when you see what s going on with our country  how people are taking advantage of us  and how they scoff at us and laugh at us  and they laugh at our face  and they re taking our jobs  they re taking our money  they re taking the health of our country and we have to be firm and have to be very strong  and we can learn a lot from the bible  that i can tell you  astonishingly  this isn t even the first time trump has gotten a softball religious question and managed to strike out  earlier  he said his favorite quote from the bible was  never bend to envy  a line which does not appear in the bible  in this respect  trump is getting a bit better  at least the things he s citing now actually exist   even if they are the values jesus deliberately spoke out against but then who can blame trump for being biblically illiterate  isn t there something in there about heaven  camels  eyes of needles  and billionaire real estate tycoons featured image by eduardo munoz alvarez getty images
