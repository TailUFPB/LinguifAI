hillary is starting to pull out all the stops in going after trump s bromance with russian dictator vladimir putin  in her latest attack ad  she reminds us that we don t know anything about his shady ties with russia  and that it s time we find out what s going on there the ad reminds us exactly why we can t trust trump in the white house beyond his blatant  cavalier attitude towards the truth  he very well could be intentionally undermining the u s  by pushing putin s foreign agenda  what she does is paint him as a possible agent to russia  rather than a serious american running for the highest office in the country  and she s right   we need to start asking questions watch her destroy him below hillary s campaign site has an article with five questions we should be asking of trump s ties to russia  and this ad builds on those will trump sell us out to russia if he s elected  probably  hillary s begun digging hard into him for it  too photo of donald trump by joe raedle getty images  photo of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot getty images  images merged by rika christensen
