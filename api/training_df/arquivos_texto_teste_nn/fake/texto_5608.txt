anyone trying to defend donald trump after his disgusting anti semitic tweet is having a really hard time first  former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski got shut down at his new gig on cnn for insisting that there was nothing wrong with trump tweeting out an anti hillary clinton meme that blatantly used the star of david and originated from a website frequented by neo nazis and white supremacists  it didn t go well for lewandowski  and it didn t go well for michael caputo  who tried to come to trump s rescue earlier today in a monday morning interview with cnn  the former trump campaign advisor tried to make the case that trump shouldn t be apologizing for the anti semitic post  according to caputo  there was nothing to be sorry about  this was not intended to offend anyone  caputo also denied that the star s shape was the star of david  and insisted that it was merely a geometric image that some associate with the horrible days of nazi germany  reminding everyone that the trump campaign did in fact fix the star of david debacle by slapping a circle over it  caputo continued  this was an unforced error  there s no question about it  otherwise they wouldn t have changed it  but to apologize for it  i don t think so  twitterthe interview got even more insane as caputo insisted that almost no one found the image offensive  which is a lie  and accused the media of making a big deal of the red star of david s appearance on the image to distract people from focusing on the fbi investigation on hillary clinton s emails unable to take this nonsense any longer  cnn s john berman stepped in and pointed out that the meme had appeared on a site that was trafficked by neo nazis  this caused caputo to basically lose his mind and fire back   do you know that  do you know that  berman replied   yes    which inspired caputo to basically lie again and say that trump s social media team had no control in choosing what images were tweeted from trump s twitter account because they were  deluged at all times  incoming images from people who make them who want the campaign to use them  that s the dumbest excuse caputo could have come up with  but there s probably some truth in it  basically  caputo is saying that trump s social media staff has been so overwhelmed with people sending them nazi images  they felt obligated to post one  sounds about right you can watch caputo epically fail at defending trump below  featured image via marc piscotty   getty images
