there is a ticking time bomb sitting in new york state that practically everyone in the corporate media is conveniently ignoring   right up until the day it finally turns into a catastrophe and then we will all be standing aghast asking  how did this happen   indian point  a nuclear power plant that sits on the hudson river  is experiencing a serious leak of radioactive material into the surrounding groundwater  contamination levels have increased by  percent compared to previous samples taken  which is causing many experts to cite this as a disaster that is waiting to happen calls have been made for the plant to be shut down completely to avert an environmental cataclysm and public health hazard  due to the fact that the plant sits just  miles north of new york city and could also turn a major american river into radioactive soup via inhabitat comthe plant is leaking tritium  which is a radioactive form of hydrogen  three of the  wells at the indian point plant showed an increase in radioactive material  as well as one well  in particular  showing a   percent increase  not surprisingly  entergy   the company that owns the plant  is claiming this is all totally safe and it will not harm local inhabitants  because the groundwater is located on their property   i m no expert on groundwater  but i feel like entergy doesn t understand how groundwater works  it doesn t respect property lines and will not necessarily stay  in its own yard   as it were  seriously  what are they getting at with this statement john kelly  former director of licensing for indian point  says that this is  more of a regulatory problem than environmental problem   what exactly does this mean  how can you have a  regulatory  problem  without having an obvious environmental one to necessitate a new regulation being created  the only assertion you can draw from this statement is that entergy knows their plant is a crisis waiting to happen  but there isn t a law to force them to fix it   so they simply do not care what happens governor andrew cuomo doesn t appear to be accepting the assertion that there is  nothing to see here   and is pressing state officials to fully investigate indian point and employ  all available measures  including working with the nuclear regulatory commission to determine the extent of the release  its likely duration  cause  and potential impacts to the environment and public health  to say this could be monumental in scope is an understatement  not only is new york city in the range of a potential disaster  but as the map above shows connecticut and new jersey are in range as well  the plant is directly in the center of one of the largest population concentrations in america where vital infrastructure hubs are located  if this would all suddenly get bad  there s no way to even estimate the full extent of the consequences featured image via riverkeeper
