right wing blogs are buzzing with what they view as absolute proof that ted cruz availed himself of the  dc madam s  services while business was still booming on the elite prostitution front  recently  rachel maddow reported that deborah palfrey s former attorney  montgomery blair sibley  is ready to spill the beans on the previously unreleased clients who were not outed as part of the original investigation  he has been in possession of these records for years  but has been prevented via restraining order from releasing them hundreds of names have been released  but sibley is in possession of hundreds more   and at least one of them  he says  could alter the  presidential race  to date  he has not named the person or people who made an appearance in the records  but he is adamant about releasing them  not only has the lawyer filed a request with the supreme court to be released from the order that prevents him from making this information public  but he has vowed to release it illegally if need be  he has also set up a  dead man s switch  that will release the information if something happens to him that prevents him from taking action for a period of  hours many have speculated that ted cruz is the name on the list  given the recent national enquirer piece that  outed  five alleged cruz mistresses  including donald trump s current mouthpiece katrina pierson  previously  anonymous threatened to release evidence that cruz frequented prostitutes   and on april   an account that claimed to be associated with the hacktivist collective did indeed tweet out a now deleted image purporting to show cruz among the many  many phone numbers contacted by palfrey first  there is no evidence to show that the account is in any way related to anonymous  additionally  it seems as though this alleged phone record may be a fake  a closer look at the image shows a rather suspicious typo on the  date of invoice   specifically  it is    a date which does not exist   period there s also the matter of the   call between   and   pm in a list that is otherwise chronological while it is entirely possible that the records are accurate  and that the records simply contain typos  and while it is convenient and even appetizing to immediately say  boom   gotcha  after viewing these records  it does not appear that these are legitimate  while there is almost certainly something slimy in the evangelical christian s past that will ultimately end him  this image  which was released on april fools  day  is likely a fabrication that should be taken with the same grain of salt with which people should take everything conservatives say in general what involvement  if any  did cruz have with the dc madam  it looks like we re still going to have to wait a while featured image via screengrab photoshop
