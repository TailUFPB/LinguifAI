the republican party should be so fortunate  as to have three aging  white  career politicians like hillary clinton  joe biden and bernie sanders running against each other while representing the future of the  diverse  democrat party lol hillary clinton and joe biden gave themselves a pat on the back for the gains made by democrats in yesterday s off year election  for clinton it was that her political group  onward together  supported a number of new progressive grass roots groups that did a lot of work on the ground   last night was a great reminder of what s possible when we come together and fight for what we believe in   clinton tweeted wednesday morning   so i wanted to take a few minutes to celebrate the extraordinary successes of a few groups i   and onward together   proudly fight alongside  for biden  who is keeping the door open to a  presidential bid  it was his candidate picks in a note  to supporters  biden said americans voted for a  different kind of leadership    and last night  nearly every single candidate that i endorsed at your recommendation was elected   he wrote   daily mailwhy were hillary clinton and joe biden both taking credit for wins in va  a blue state that went for hillary in  and  in spite of constantly being referred to in the media as a  swing state   hasn t been a  red state  since   see chart below  new jersey is and has been a blue state for decades  so all of the self congratulations and patting themselves on their own backs seems rather odd unless of course  hillary and joe are setting themselves up for what would be the most entertaining ever democrat presidential primary in   anyone who believes that hillary isn t up for another fight doesn t know hillary  fingers crossed hillary s great at taking credit for a win  but prefers to blame everyone but herself when she loses bigly   hillary clinton has blamed russian hackers for her loss   along with many others  dailymail com has been keeping trackjames comey the fbi vladimir putin the russians wikileaks low information voters the electoral college anti american forces everyone who assumed she d win bad polling numbers barack obama white women the new york times joe biden bernie sanders bernie bros people wanting change misogynists television executives netflix facebook twitter content farms in macedonia the media steve bannon and breitbart the democratic party the republican party cambridge analytica women protesters matt lauer white voters democratic documentary makers voter suppression mitch mcconnell the supreme court father husbands boyfriends male bosses
