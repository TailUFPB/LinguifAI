full frontal host samantha bee braced herself and attempted a dialogue with trump fans away from the mud slinging happening across the internet  she gave trump s followers a chance to show a better side of themselves and they blew it  bee didn t cheat  she didn t walk into a roadside bar and grab a couple drunks with kkk t shirts on  she invited a diverse array of trump supporters  women  gay  black  asian  college graduates  bi partisan  all were represented  the common theme  none of them were able to put forward a single coherent response when asked the most simple questions about their candidate  and when pressed  all hit the hot button of anger the host begins by showing footage of some of the racist violence spilling out at trump rallies across the country  this includes the moment john franklin mcgraw of north carolina sucker punching a black protester and threatening to kill him  trump later stated he would pay the attacker s legal bills  and those of anyone arrested for violence at his rallies  while trump pinned the blame for violence on bernie sanders supporters  bee showed footage of trump fans telling bystanders to go to auschwitz  go to f  king auschwitz   clearly  not a sanders fan but  bee states  surely the millions of trump supporters across the country can t be hysterical racists  there must be some sane  rational  people who are choosing to back trump too  so she picked a sample and offered to put on a lavish party for them in exchange for an open conversation about their candidate and their views it s actually more terrifying than the racist violence  what you see is smart  open minded people  choking down their own souls to belong  bee starts by asking the group how they feel about their candidates statements on banning muslims from the country  temporarily   they say  almost in unison   for our national security  as if this somehow resolves the dilemma  they take no issue with lumping the world s   billion muslims together as terrorists however  when bee asks them how they feel about white supremacists backing their candidate  they are up in arms at the lumping together of themselves with other trump fans  one supporter doesn t even look remotely convinced of her own argument as she mumbles  we all love america  i guess  if there s something we can come together on  we want this country to be great  i think everyone can get behind that  getting angry at the clear embarrassment this question has caused the group  one supporter strikes out with  it s clearly illogical to play the guilt by association game because we could do this all day long  to which bee points out that they have no problem playing that game against muslims silence bee moves on  asking the group how they feel about the racist violence breaking out at trump rallies  they argue that the media is continuing to quote trump out of context  so bee plays the video of trump inciting the crowd to attack a protester  stating that he would do it himself  she turns to the group and asks  can you acknowledge that it is literally impossible  as a member of the media  to ignore a person when they say they would punch a protester in the face  one supporter dismisses the question out of hand  stating that if you get enough people in a space  somebody is always going to get punched in the face  ok bee mingles around the the party  and chats to the woman who stated that trump would bring america together  she tells bee she really wants the wall  to keep out undesirables  when asked who will pay for it  the woman states with glee that mexico will  bee s fact checker points out that mexico is on the record as stating they will not pay for the wall  to which the woman replies  wide eyed  and you know what trump said  the wall just got  feet taller  her final chat at the party is with a man clearly on the verge of rage  bee states that he is making her feel uncomfortable because although he is smiling  there is real anger in his eyes  with another burst of barely suppressed rage and pointing a finger in bee s face  the man states  there s no anger  it s passion  don t mistake that  bee signs off with a resigned sigh that we have to withstand  months more of this  passion   while a rolling a montage of violence at trump rallies what is clear from the footage is that there s no way of holding a rational argument with a zealot  and what s clear from the trump fan party is that he is encouraging zealotry  the unquestioning evangelism of trump  in groups that might otherwise display all the signs of being critical thinkers and evidence based voters  that is way if anything  this bizarre party is more terrifying than the hysterical scenes at the rallies   because these people know better  and they re choosing to be sucked into the dark world of donald trump anyway  featured image via flickr screengrab
