after widespread  bipartisan outrage and several high profile calls by republican colleagues to knock it off  donald trump decided instead to triple down on his racist comments about the judge presiding over his trump university fraud case   and then start adding other minority groups that he also feels can t be trusted during a sit down with cbs s john dickerson on face the nation  trump said it was  common sense  to keep minorities out of positions of authority or else they might be biased against people like trump  when dickerson pressed trump to justify his overtly racist attitudes by using a hypothetical muslim judge instead of a hispanic one  the republican nominee said he would similarly ask that a muslim recuse himself under the assumption that given what he has said about muslims  the judge would be unable to give him a fair trial it led to this mind blowing exchange  isn t there sort of a tradition though in america that we don t judge people by who their parents were and where they came from   dickerson replied and trump countered again   i m not talking about tradition   i m talking about common sense  ok  trump has repeatedly insisted that he really does stand behind the accusations that the judge in his case  indiana born gonzalo curial  is a  mexican  hater who wants to punish trump for his promise to build a wall on the border  now he has expanded it to muslims as well  what group is next clearly a position that in more decent times would disqualify a candidate  instead republicans have opted to tsk tsk trump while at the same time pretend to believe that what he said isn t racist  just  brash   it s unclear whether even they buy that particularly pathetic excuse there is  of course  little need to debunk trump s offensive approach to the justice system  but a ucla law professor summed it up nicely  trump s theory is  apparently  that anyone can get any judge disqualified for  conflict of interest  just by saying things that the judge finds offensive enough   volokh wrote   don t like the jewish judge on your case  say things that are critical of jews  and now the judge presumably has to step aside because of a conflict of interest  don t like the female judge  say things that women tend to find offensive  don t like the judge who was a republican activist  say nasty things about republicans  in other words  the only person trump thinks is qualified to judge trump is trump  or perhaps  men who share his same skin color watch trump s egregious comments below would a muslim judge also be out of the question here   realdonaldtrump   it s possible  yes   https   t co   face the nation   facethenation  june    image via cbs
