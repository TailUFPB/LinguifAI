actress charlotte rampling really stepped in it when she declared that the boycott of the oscars by black actors was nothing more than  anti white racism   anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the fact that  for the second year in a row  only white actors have gotten oscar nominations is highly suspect  rampling  however  said the following of the controversy  maybe this time  no black actor or actress deserved to make it to the final selection  why should we always categorize people  i think nowadays we are living in easily offended societies  there will always be someone who s too beautiful  too black or not white enough  well  there s one person who spoke out against the remarks  chelsea clinton  she took to her twitter account and roundly condemned the remarks  calling them  outrageous  ignorant  and offensive  outrageous  ignorant   offensive comments from rampling  https   t co   chelsea clinton   chelseaclinton  january    problem here is that rampling and those who think like her have absolutely zero understanding of systemic racism and the way it works when it comes to seeping into literally every crevice of our society and lives  rampling  like many people suffering from white privilege  is terrified that she ll lose her throne if there s more space for others chelsea clinton  however  understands just what this boycott is  and why it is so important  it should not have taken public outcry and boycotts for the academy to change its rules regarding voting for these awards  that is what it took  though and in   that s a damn shame i am just eternally grateful to chelsea clinton for speaking out against the likes of charlotte rampling and others who would squash this very important conversation  racism is alive and well  even in supposedly  liberal  hollywood  it is time   far past time  in fact   that we realized that racism didn t end with the signing of the civil rights act thank you  chelsea clinton  for saying what needed to be said here featured image via chelsea clinton twitter
