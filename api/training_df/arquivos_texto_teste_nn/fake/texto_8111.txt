one way or another  the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia will change the course of american history scalia s death leaves the court with eight justices  four liberal and four conservative the next justice appointment has the potential to determine the nature of the court for years to come  while a liberal justice will tip the balance in favor of progressive and liberal ideas  a conservative justice  like scalia or worse  will tip the balance in the opposite direction as we ve seen in recent years  decisions made the supreme court impact the lives of american citizens in critical ways while there are an infinite number of reasons that we need a liberal court  here are the top ten issues most likely to be impacted by a change in the political balance of the court in the near   laborlabor unions and the rights of american workers are facing constant attacks  both from billion dollar corporations and the right wing state politicians who represent their interests in the immediate future  a liberal court could influence the outcome of friedrichs v  california teachers association  a case which has the potential to cripple organized labor in the u s the was argued before the supreme court in january    but a ruling has not been handed down by the court  in the case that the court s ruling was a   decision  the case will have to be heard again  once a replacement for scalia has been appointed   separation of church and stateon tuesday  february   rabbi adele plotkin was removed from a meeting of the chino valley  arizona city council  his crime  protesting the council s on going prayers in the name of jesus in defense of their actions  the council cited the supreme court s ruling in greece v galloway  in december   the court ruled   that government officials in the town of greece  new york  did not violate the establishment clause by opening meetings with christian prayers in may of   the justices reversed their opinion in the case  even as many arguments remained unsettled to understand just how  not settled  the case actually is  here s the overview from the  case update judgment  reversed     in an opinion by justice kennedy on may     justice scalia and justice thomas join the majority opinion except as to part ii b  justice alito filed a concurring opinion  in which justice scalia joined  justice thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment  in which justice scalia joined as to part ii  justice breyer filed a dissenting opinion  justice kagan filed a dissenting opinion  in which justice ginsburg  justice breyer  and justice sotomayor joined this case is just one of many with the potential to erode or destroy the establishment clause  which prevents public resources from being used to promote religious doctrine  and protects all americans from being forced to accept the religious beliefs of whoever happens to be running their local  state or federal government on any given day   lgbt discriminationon june     the supreme court issued its historical ruling in obergefell v  hodges  otherwise known as the  gay marriage decision  since that decision  right wing nuts across america have attempted to enshrine discrimination against the lgbt community into local  state and even federal law under the guise of religious freedom  conservatives have attempted to get away with everything from refusing service to gay couples to firing lgbt employees in the name of jesus as we ve seen in recent years  there s no end to right wing creativity  when it comes to anti gay discrimination  whether they re trying to ban sodomy and oral sex or illegally refusing to sign marriage licenses  lgbt rights remain under attack all across the country a liberal supreme court is of monumental importance in protecting the lgbt community from religious bigotry and anti gay bias   money in politicsa liberal court could open the door to restoring the integrity of u s  elections the disastrous supreme court ruling in the  citizens united case has allowed unlimited amounts of corporate money to flow into our political system in a   decision  the conservative court ruled that money is a form of speech  under the pretense  the court found that limiting the amount of money flowing through the political system equates to suppression of speech on the part of the government while the american public overwhelmingly disapproved of the court s decision in the citizens united case  as long as the court maintains a conservative bias  there s little chance that the ruling will be overturned there is plenty of room to challenge the decision with a liberal leaning court   women s rightsthe rise of the tea party in america has brought with it an unprecedented number of attacks of women s rights from state enforced vaginal ultrasounds to disturbing attempts to exclude pregnant women from healthcare coverage under the affordable care act  the right wing war on women threatens the health and well being of more than  percent of the american population at stake in america is every woman s right to life  along with her right to self determination and body autonomy  as the right wing continues to try to give more rights to a zygote than the woman whose body it inhabits  a liberal court is a critical last line of defense against these attacks   environmentless than a week ago  a   ruling by the supreme court temporarily blocked president obama s climate change regulations from taking effect as the new york times reported on february  the  to  vote  with the court s four liberal members dissenting  was unprecedented   the supreme court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court at stake here is much more than whether or not the president s efforts to reduce carbon emissions will become a reality the case  brought by representatives of the fossil fuel industry  challenges the environmental protection agency s right to create and enforce environmental regulations at all   healthcareafter years of legislative and legal battles over the affordable care act  the supreme court finally upheld the constitutionality of president obama s signature healthcare law in  but this decision has not stopped right wing fanatics from attacking various parts of the law  bringing case after case to the supreme court  in an attempt to undermine the court s original decision as recently as january    the court refused to hear another challenge to the law  the challenge was filed by an artist who said that being forced to pay for healthcare violates his rights  he was joined by sens  john cornyn  texas  and mike lee  utah   and right wing nut ted cruz wrote an absurd amicus brief in support of the case while a more liberal leaning court will likely dissuade further attempts to overturn the law  the opposite would be true if scalia were somehow replaced with a right wing extremist   voting rightsin june of   a   decision of the supreme court struck down the most important provisions of the voting rights act what s more  in a string of cases brought before the court in   the conservative majority consistently ruled in favor of those who sought to restrict voting rights  rather than expand them rulings made it possible for states to introduce voter id laws  although it s long been established that such laws negatively impact people of color  the same justices ruled in favor of allowing states to restrict early voting and restrict voter access to the polls a liberal leaning court is vital to protecting and restoring the right of every citizen to participate in elections   immigrationin january  the supreme court agreed to hear a challenge to president obama s executive actions on immigration as the new york times reports here  when agreeing to hear the case the justices raised the possibility of a broad decision by taking the unusual step of adding their own question to the case  asking the parties to address whether mr  obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation s laws  the answer to that question could significantly alter the scope of presidential power in realms far beyond immigration confident that the court s conservative majority would find cause to rule against the constitutional authority of a liberal  black president  the five right leaning justices had clearly planned to take the lead in the case the outcome of the case is likely to be entirely different  however  with a liberal leaning majority   policethe supreme court is regularly charged with the duty of defining what police can and cannot do under the constitution the five justices that made up the court s conservative majority have given police more and more leeway for example  in june of   the court expanded the rights of law enforcement officers to perform warrantless searches prior to that  the court ruled that a police officer cannot be held liable for violating a citizen s rights  as long as the officer claims he didn t know law the court also granted immunity to police officers who shot a mentally ill woman inside a healthcare facility while it s questionable that the addition of a liberal justice would influence the outcome of cases involving law enforcement  it certainly can t make the situation worse  unfortunately  even some of the supposedly liberal justices currently on the court have sided with conservatives  helping to expand the rights of police  which necessarily means narrowing the rights of ordinary citizens as stated earlier  these issues are by no means the only ones that will likely be impacted a shift in the political leanings of the court president obama has vowed to appoint a replacement for justice scalia  in spite of threats of obstruction from the republicans in congress given that many of the policies that the president has fought for over the past eight years hang in the balance  there s little doubt that he will find a way to ensure that a liberal justice is appointed in scalia s stead image credit  wikimedia commons
