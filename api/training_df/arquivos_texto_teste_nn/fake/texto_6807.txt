hillary clinton and donald trump emerged victorious in blowout wins in their home state of new york on tuesday  in a field of three  trump managed to capture just over  percent while clinton  in a field of two  captured just under  percent with clinton and trump gaining in delegates  it s becoming increasingly likely the two will face off in the november general election  should there be no contested conventions  and if trump emerges the nominee and so does clinton  that spells very bad news for the republicans real clear politics  which gathers daily polling from multiple sources and finds a median  shows that as more americans are exposed to trump s campaign  the more likely they are to back hillary clinton as vox puts it this is  according to political scientists  around the time when general election polling becomes predictive of the actual vote   were this a few months ago  i d say   what s the big deal    christopher wlezien  a political science professor who s done a lot of work on election polling  told vox back in march   but polls today are much more meaningful than they were  days ago  and the polls today are much less favorable for trump  around this time  mitt romney was more popular than donald trump is  and he was within   percent of president obama   who obviously won  right now  clinton is about ten points higher than the donald as general election polling becomes more representative of the actual outcome  vox and real clear politics estimate that at this rate democrats not only would win the presidency and take back the senate  they could even take back the house one reason the republicans are having such a hard time catching up to clinton is because they aren t united  and are quite fractured  democrats  while having their own differences  are nowhere near the breaking point the republicans are  and that is a huge advantage heading into the general election republicans should be terrified  if they were smart  they would broker their convention and nominate kasich  who consistently beats hillary clinton in the polls  but since when has the republican party done the smart thing years of fear mongering and peppered racism has not  nor will it  pay off for the gop  they created this monster  now they have to deal with it  featured image via justin sullivan getty
