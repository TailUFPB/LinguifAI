if there s one person who is loved by all in the democratic party  it s massachusetts senator elizabeth warren  her no nonsense attitude and get it done approach to policy and politics are things that cannot be matched  she is so loved that her endorsement of any particular candidate is one that is sought after and coveted people have been waiting on pins and needles to see who warren will endorse in the democratic primary  will it be bernie sanders or hillary clinton  and after the iowa caucuses  where hillary and bernie were in a statistical tie  people would like to know now  more than ever  who she will pick in hopes that it will push one candidate ahead over the other however  warren  being the magnificent person that she is  is choosing to focus on the issues  and not to politicize things by muddying the waters with support for any one candidate  said  no endorsements now  i think that what the democrats are doing is terrific  we re out talking about the issues  i look at the republican debates and the difference between what they re doing and what the democrats are doing that really shows who s on whose side  warren knows that when you pick a particular side of the debate the message can sometimes be lost  both hillary and bernie are talking about the economy  both hillary and bernie are talking about making healthcare and college affordable  both hillary and bernie are seeking to continue progress in the united states and not let the reins fall back in to the hands of republicans  warren is letting the issues be explored  and solutions be offered  while letting the people decide for themselves both candidates running would love a warren endorsement  she s showed support for both sanders and clinton in their approach to wall street and what needs to be done  so  while many supporters of either candidate will love to say that she s  hinted  at one candidate or the other  cases can be made for both  so  like warren said in regards to if she ll announce who she s endorsing   we ll see   and everyone knows that s code for   i m not telling you either way  featured image  flickr
