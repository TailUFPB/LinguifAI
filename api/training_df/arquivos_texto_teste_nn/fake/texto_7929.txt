fox business host  stuart varney  had an interview with nevada superdelegate  erin bilbray  that made varney get more than a little angry  bilbray has pledged to vote for bernie sanders during the democratic national convention  varney became  hot under the collar  because bilbray supports higher taxes for the rich varney has a net worth of approximately   million dollars  that means the financial analyst would probably be paying more in taxes should sanders win the white house and get some of his proposals passed  varney argues against sanders  proposals to make taxes a bit more progressive to address skyrocketing income inequality  saying  you re going to take it off me and give it to somebody else  i got it  okay  bilbray defends her position  however  varney wasn t hearing it  let s not beat around the bush   varney goes on to say   he is going to take it off me  i already pay  percent of my income in taxes and he wants more  please  don t confuse the issue  he is going to take it off me and give it to somebody else  if you think that s okay  that s fine with me  i don t  let me move on  varney  seemingly not wanting to have a conversation about facts or policy  insists on having a conversation about the morality of having the rich pay a higher share of taxes  bilbray says that she wasn t prepared to have a conversation about morality  though she thinks it isn t moral for people to be working as they as they are and still struggle just to get by varney only repeats his earlier position  while steadily growing angrier now  sanders himself has called income inequality  the great moral issue of our time   sanders has revealed himself to have a humanist philosophy on morality  sanders also happens to have a lot of respected economists who agree with his tax policy proposals too  sanders recently explained his spirituality  saying  i believe that  as a human being  the pain that one person feels  if we have children who are hungry in america  if we have elderly people who can t afford their prescription drugs  you know what  that impacts you  that impacts me  and i worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say   it doesn t matter to me  i got it  i don t care about other people   so my spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry  when veterans sleep out on the street  it impacts me  that s my very strong spiritual feelings  it would be a pleasure to see a gentleman like sanders have this conversation with varney you can watch the interview below featured image from video screenshot
