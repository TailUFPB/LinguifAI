while donald trump continues to paint himself as the anti saudi  anti terrorist candidate  the truth is coming to light that he may in fact be financially beholden to the saudi royal family after trump retweeted a photo shopped image of megyn kelly  a saudi woman  supposedly a member of the royal family  prince alwaleed bin talal together  in which the image describes bin talal as a  co owner  of fox news  the prince had a few words to share trump you base your statements on photoshopped pics i bailed you out twice a  time maybe https   t co  https   t co           alwaleedtalal  january     prince alwaleed  who only has a one percent stake in fox news   hardly a co owner  included news snippets in his tweets  one news story was the fact he had to buy trump s yacht  which had recently been turned over to creditors when it fell a staggering   million in debt alwaleed also included the story of how he bought trump plaza hotel in new york after promising to erase the mogul s debt  calling it a  defeat for the real estate developer   the new york times reports that the outstanding debt accumulated form the hotel around   million  yet the prince was able to buy it down to roughly   million there are two questions everyone should be asking  one  how did trump run up   million in debt over a yacht  and how did he acquire   million of debt from a world famous hotel  second  how can anymore expect trump to be  tough  on the saudis and the royal family when he owes them millions of dollars can you imagine the outrage from republicans if president obama had over a billion dollars worth of debt paybacks to the saudi royal family  republicans though  always the hypocrites  are choosing to turn a blind eye to the issue  instead the continue to believe everything the blowhard says another conflict of interest  out of dozens now pending against the presidential nominee  arises again  once more  the republican candidate shows how inept he is at his own financials  and he again shows that he gets his information completely from the media alwaleed  a trump kasich supporter  has had a few twitter spats with the saudi prince  after the billionaire  and heavily indebted  called for a ban on muslims in the united states  and trump responded by calling him  dopey  and told him that his  daddy s money  couldn t persuade him   how ironic featured image via olli scarff getty images
