conservatives are busy mourning the death of antonin scalia  and coming up with ways to make sure that no one president obama picks will make it through to the court  well  if they are angry and scheming right now  this next prediction will have the right positively fuming according to nbc news  tom goldstein  the supreme court expert who is the mastermind behind scotusblog  is predicting that president obama will nominate current attorney general loretta lynch to replace the recently deceased scalia  calling lynch a  very serious possibility   goldstein went on to say  the fact that lynch was vetted so recently for attorney general also makes it practical for the president to nominate her in relatively short order  goldstein s predictions are in sharp contrast to those of robert reich  who believes that the pick would be judge sri srinivasan  who has been nominated to a lower court of appeals by president obama  however  it seems that goldstein s prediction makes much more sense  both practically and politically this nomination could be a political windfall for the left  and a disaster for the right  with so many republicans vowing to refuse to allow any of obama s nominees onto the court  their image problem when it comes to race will not be helped if they refuse to confirm lynch  after all  she would be the first black woman to make it to the supreme court  and they would look like a bunch of racists and misogynists  further  according to goldstein  lynch s history as a career prosecutor makes it very difficult to paint her as excessively liberal  essentially  a loretta lynch nomination does everything the left needs it to do  and completely paints the gop obstructionists into a corner  they already have serious problems with racial minorities  and with the way they treated the loretta lynch confirmation for the position of attorney general  they can t afford to treat her badly again  people already called that racism and misogyny out for what it was  and if they want to maintain any kind of semblance of respect when it comes to race issues and minority communities  they will not block lynch a second time  goldstein s points on the issues a lynch nomination poses for the gop were nothing short of perfect  i think the administration would relish the prospect of republicans either refusing to give lynch a vote or seeming to treat her unfairly in the confirmation process  either eventuality would motivate both black and women voters  oh  i surely hope that this is true  talk about a great way for president obama to stick it to the gop on his way out featured image from white house flickr
