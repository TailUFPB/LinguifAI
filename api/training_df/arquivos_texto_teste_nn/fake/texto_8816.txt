fox news invited blogger crystal wright onto fox and friends monday morning to remind america just how dangerous the democratic party is for americans   especially if you re african american wright  who is african american herself  went on the show to speak about her new book con job  which focuses on racial injustice and the so called  negative impact  democrats have had on the  poorer  dumber  and more criminalized  black community  she started off by talking about how bad welfare programs were to african americans  but inevitably made a detour into other hot topics like gun violence and abortion  in speaking about the many assertions made in her book  host steve doocy asked the conservative blogger and author   you talk about over the last  years  trillions of dollars have been put to fight poverty  yet poverty is proliferating in many neighborhoods because  wright said  blaming the party that actually cares about black lives matter  police brutality and social justice  well  because of democrats and the con that they re running on black americans  they have made black americans poorer  dumber  and more criminalized  doocy asked why do you say that  that s their end game  wright answered  it s not just me  look   percent of   you know how the president goes around  wants to talk about regulating legal gun ownership  i ve never seen barack obama talk about the black lives being killed by other blacks in chicago  dc  or baltimore  ninety three percent of all black homicides are committed by other black people  and you know the number one cause of death among young black men ages  to   guns  illegal guns  cus they re killing each other  that s the con job  but yet  black people keep voting against their interests  and i would argue the democrat party is literally killing black americans from the womb to the streets  wright is actually  and not surprisingly  wrong   president barack obama talks about murder in places like chicago often  just last week  the president said it happens on the streets of chicago every day   wright is also forgetting that   of all white homicide victims are murdered by white people   but yet no one talks about white on white crime but no matter what our president has done in terms of racial justice  wright believes that democrats don t actually care about black people or the black lives matter movement   they only care about getting black votes  she must be completely unaware of what her party does   dissing democratic front runner hillary clinton  wright said  that is why  is going out and saying   hey  black lives matter  but oh guys guess what  i support planned parenthood  the billion dollar abortion industry  wright uses planned parenthood as an example only because statistically african american women are more likely to seek out medically sound and affordable abortions from the clinics to give an example of a republican candidate that does care about black people  she cited the always offensive front runner donald trump  claiming that he was the most pro black candidate due to the fact that he supports restricting immigration you can watch the bizarre interview below despite what wright says about democrats  there s proof that her beloved republican party has also failed to meet her expectations featured image is a screenshot
