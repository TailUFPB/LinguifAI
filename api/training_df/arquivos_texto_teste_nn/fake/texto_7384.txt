in february  video surfaced of evangelical pastors leading students in prayer in hollister  missouri during lunchtime in the school cafeteria as it turns out  school officials actually allow this a few times a week  and the christian group that proselytizes to the students is the only religious group that has been allowed to interact with students on public ground that is supposed to be secular the religious group  known as klife  has been going around indoctrinating students at several schools for a few years now  and because hollister students have been conducting prayers in the lunchroom  klife senior pastor robert bruce visited the school and took part in the prayers  which weren t exactly silent and could be heard throughout the room even by students who do not subscribe to the christian religion  since then  bruce and his organization have been preaching to all the students at lunchtime and have forced prayer upon them as if it s a requirement to eat here s a video of one of the prayer sessions via youtube soon  the freedom from religion foundation got involved  advising the school to end the practice of allowing a single religious group to have such open access to the student body and reminding them of the law  it is well settled as a matter of established law that public schools may not advance  prefer or promote religion   ffrf said in a statement  it is unconstitutional for a public school to allow an evangelical christian organization to impose prayer on all students  giving the group access to all students as part of school programming suggests that the school district has preference not only for religion over nonreligion  but also evangelical christianity over other faiths  this sort of entanglement between religion and public education is inappropriate  the ffrf is correct  while the supreme court can t stop students from praying silently together or individually  it has ruled that schools cannot promote one religious belief over anotherbut so far  superintendent brain wilson has resisted that advice because he claims any community leader can visit students during lunch  it kind of makes one wonder how he and parents would react if satanic temple leaders came knocking on the school door  because you know they would not like that one bit it s also pretty clear that klife s goal is to indoctrinate kids into christianity at a young age  because as branson junior high principal bryan bronn said in   somebody once told me that if you wanted to reach students and you wanted to be serious about being  as jesus called us to be  fishers of men  then you need to be serious about where the fish are at  and we all know that fish travel in  schools  in other words  treat students like fish in a barrel where they can t escape and you ll likely brainwash many to follow you  that s apparently the case in hollister and other area schools  which means non religious students in these schools must feel pretty damn intimidated and bristol palin totally approves of that on her little blog earlier this week  the daughter of america s village idiot wrote about how proud she is that christian students in hollister are forcing their religious beliefs on atheists as parents  we pray our children will take our faith and it make it their own  we instill in them the building blocks of a relationship with jesus  and hope they will have the boldness to carry it through their lives  a few children in hollister  missouri recently made their parents very proud as per usual  palin goes on to whine about how the ffrf is involved and even brought out the tired conservative line that the constitution says freedom of religion and not freedom from religion  and then she wrote this to the students in hollister  you are what our country needs  continue your hard work  stand strong together  and don t allow yourselves to become discouraged  you are fighting a hard battle  but one that has value beyond measure in short  bristol palin wants those students to stand up against those evil atheists and jam christianity down their throats whether they like it or not but that would be a complete violation of those students  first amendment rights  and by allowing an evangelical group to have so much power over students  the school is basically sponsoring a specific religion  the school is also failing the lemon test set by the supreme court in  which says any school sponsored practice must be secular  neither advance nor inhibit religion  and can t result in an excessive entanglement between government and religion well  this certainly isn t secular since it s just one religious group participating  it s clearly only advancing religion while inhibiting the beliefs and non beliefs of other students  and it s a public school financed by tax dollars and overseen by the state government of missouri  which means it s mixing government and religion  the school could claim the prayer isn t being disruptive but that isn t true either since this story has drawn attention from the national and local media and is setting up future lawsuits no one is saying that students can t be christians  but there is a place for christians to go practice their religion and that place is generally known as a church and i hear it is open on sunday or just about any day of the week featured image via flickr
