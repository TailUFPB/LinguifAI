now that the republican choice for president is presumably donald trump  many are being asked who they ll support in the general election and if they could actually get behind a trump presidency  so  when megyn kelly had documentary filmmaker michael moore on her show  she asked him just that kelly knew that moore is a bernie sanders supporter and it s looking like hillary clinton will be the nominee  there have been some sanders supporters who say they ll switch to trump  because they can t support hillary  these are the same people who would seemingly cut off their nose to spite their face  it s also the epitome of privilege  because these folks clearly have nothing to lose if trump wins fortunately  moore is not one of those people  when asked by kelly   let s say it is trump clinton  a guy who understands the working class  has made some films involving them  from flint  michigan  could you get behind donald trump   moore sarcastically responds  only to help push him somewhere  then he stops short  and says  wait a minute  he has secret service protection now  i shouldn t say that  and kelly hilariously  and accurately responds  you d be the one getting pushed  moore then says  i would push him to a more gentle place away from everybody  clearly  moore knows that we cannot have trump as president of the united states  he also makes it clear that trump is not who he makes himself out to be and is conning his conservative supporters just to get votes  hopefully  more people follow moore s lead and err on the side of making sure trump never becomes president  instead of taking their ball and going home by declaring a moral victory by voting against hillary if she is to become the nominee trump is a con artist and a crafty businessman who has built his career by manipulating people into giving him want he wants  don t fall for it  america  please watch kelly interview moore here  with the question regarding if he could support trump beginning at the  minute mark https   www youtube com watch v raekxrkhfcgfeatured image via video screen capture
