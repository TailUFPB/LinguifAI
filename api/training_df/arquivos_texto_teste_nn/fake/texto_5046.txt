when there is talk of your father  and probable lover  and his campaign manager skipping hand in hand though a field of daisies with russian dictator vladimir putin  it s probably not a good idea to hang out with someone who is rumored to be his girlfriend   but that s exactly what ivanka trump just did  people magazine is reporting that  daddy s little girl  and putin s likely lady friend  alleged chinese spy wendi deng murdoch  yes  she was also married to fox news overlord rupert murdoch   were spotted over the weekend enjoying scenic dubrovnik  croatia  in eastern europe sight seeing with  wendimurdoch in dubrovnika photo posted by ivanka trump   ivankatrump  on aug    at   pdtfor years  rumors swirled that murdoch s ex and trump s pal putin were dating   ever since the two elites divorced their wives in  and   the kremlin has not confirmed nor denied the relationship  and deng flat out denied the accusations last month  years after they became public  but anonymous sources within the kremlin confirmed the  serious  relationship  via us weekly reports of the pair have been floating around for years  ever since their respective divorces in  and  one insider close to the powerful leader tells us weekly the relationship is  serious  but given trump s decision to practically hump putin s leg and his  and his current campaign chair s  confirmed financial ties to putin and his allies  it would be a wise decision for ivanka trump to avoid even the appearance of impropriety because of her heavy involvement in daddy s campaign  russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets   trump s son  donald jr   told a real estate conference in   the washington post reports   we see a lot of money pouring in from russia  trump s reliance on russian money to turn anything resembling a profit may explain why he repeatedly praises the russian leader  even denying that he invaded the ukraine despite reality proving him wrong in a  second google search  the post explains trump s relationship with putin the dynamic illustrates the extent to which trump s worldview has been formed through the lens of commerce rather than the think tanks  government deliberations and international diplomatic conferences that typically shape the foreign policy positions of presidential candidates it also reflects trump s willingness to see world leaders through his own personal connections  in a republican party in which an ability to stand up to putin has been seen as a test of toughness  trump s relationship with the russian leader is instead one of mutual flattery  putin said in december that trump was a  colorful and talented  person  a compliment that trump said at the time was an  honor  the back and forth has continued  in a mid june rally  trump cited those comments as the reason he will not reject the russian leader   a guy calls me a genius  and i m going to renounce   trump said   i m not going to renounce him   the next day in st  petersburg  putin again called trump a  colorful person  and said he welcomed trump s proposal for a  full scale resumption  of u s  russia ties on the campaign trail  trump has called for a new partnership with moscow  overhauling nato  the allied military force seen as the chief protector of pro western nations near russia  and trump has surrounded himself with a team of advisers who have had financial ties to russia if the numerous reports regarding a down low putin murdoch relationship are true  and it seems they are  this could create gigantic problems for trump as he continues his routine of supporting russia in all things  after all  a discreet vacation in croatia would be a great time to discuss bigger plans  like trump s call on russia to hack hillary clinton for him if deng s weak response years after the relationship was rumored to have begun and only after it began to get more press is true  if she has  never met  putin as she says   well  to use trump s words   some people say featured image via people magazine the guardian
