pretty much all of sarah palin s endorsement of republican presidential frontrunner donald trump was definitely off the wall  you weren t sure if you were watching a circus performance by a lady dressed in wind chimes  a piece of visual art that you might find at the museum of modern art  or a person just before they get a psych evaluation nonetheless  there palin was in all her glory  watching her speak  you really couldn t tell if she was just really excited or maybe just really drunk  however  her enthusiasm for trump was most definitely spirited and could be felt through television sets across the nation by people who were dumbfounded at what they were actually witnessing however  if there was one moment of all the crazy moments that could perfectly sum up the embodiment of palin s long winded endorsement of a man who shouldn t even be allowed on a tour of the white house  let alone be president  this was it sarah palin s poetry to describe trump supporters pic twitter com   angelo carusone   goangelo  january    you need a translator to figure out what the hell she just said  it went something like  how  bout the rest of us  right wingin   bitter clingin   proud clingers of our guns  our god  and our religions  and our constitution  in all honesty  that s really all she needed to say  that pretty much wraps up the modern day republican party full of extreme right wing  bitter people clinging to their guns and religion and pretending to follow the constitution  it s also the perfect summary of her entire speech  everything else  along with that jumbled sentence  sounded like drunken jibber jabber to the point donald trump looked extremely uncomfortable standing next to her with a look of  oh sh t  what did i just do   however  now he s stuck with her and all her unhinged glory  hopefully she ll bring the same luck to trump s campaign that she brought to john mccain s featured image  twitter
