anti trump besties matt damon and george clooney sat down with good morning america s michael strahan to discuss their good friend  democrat mega donor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator  harvey weinstein  not only did both actors  who owe much of their successful careers to harvey weinstein  wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator  but they waited until only days before their new movie   suburbicon  is about to debut  to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to notably absent in the interview is the third actor ben affleck  who completes the trio of bestie actors  after affleck spoke out on the harvey weinstein controversy  he was also accused of covering up weinstein s behavior  as well as videos that show affleck used his power to prey on innocent women  notice how quickly damon throws affleck under the bus  saying he knew  but only told damon  who of course  never told anyone else  americans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious  holier than thou liberals who have no values or morals  yet try to shame americans for supporting political candidates who don t hold the same liberal views as theirs  are left with only one option  boycottsuburbicon and  boycotthollywood in the interview that aired on monday morning  george clooney and matt damon said that they knew weinstein was a  bully  and  womanizer  who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels damon also confessed that he was aware weinstein had sexually harassed  the first lady of miramax  gwyneth paltrow just before the actress shot the  film adaptation of jane austen s  emma  for the studio  i knew the story about gwyneth from ben  because he was with her after brad  and so i knew that story   said damon  but i was working with gwyneth and with harvey on  ripley  he then added    i never talked to gwyneth about it but ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding   and he treated her incredibly respectfully  always  affleck and pitt have not spoken about the incident  and damon s revelation that he learned about weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement  i am saddened and angry that a man who i worked with used his position of power to intimidate  sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades   said affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations damon s decision to characterize the relationship between paltrow and weinstein as  always  respectful is a bit odd as well  considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview clooney meanwhile said that like many of weinstein s victims  he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars  harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with   said clooney  i didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine  and i didn t really think that they had affairs with harvey   and clearly  they didn t he then added   but the idea that this predator  this assaulter was out there silencing women like that  it s beyond infuriating  and the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out  i want to know all of it  daily mailwatch  as these two actors desperately attempt to save their upcoming movie   suburbicon   as well as their hollywood careers  he didn t do it out in the open     matt damon on harvey weinstein  https   t co  pic twitter com   good morning america   gma  october    it s indefensible  that s the only word you can start with  harvey s admitted to it  and it s indefensible  i ve known harvey for  years  he gave me my first big break as an actor in films on from dusk till dawn  he gave me my first big break as a director with confessions of a dangerous mind  we ve had dinners  we ve been on location together  we ve had arguments  but i can tell you that i ve never seen any of this behavior ever i ve heard rumors  and the rumors  in general  started back in the    and they were that certain actresses had slept with harvey to get a role  it seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn t get the jobs based on their talent  so i took those rumors with a grain of salt  but the other part of this  the part we re hearing now about eight women being paid off  i didn t hear anything about that and i don t know anyone that did  that s a whole other level and there s no way you can reconcile that  there s nothing to say except that it s indefensible a lot of people are doing the  you had to know  thing right now  and yes  if you re asking if i knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young  beautiful women  sure  but i had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence  and that these women were threatened and victimized  i ve been talking with a lot of people about this  and i don t know many people who knew of that there s an argument that everyone is complicit in it  i suppose the argument would be  that it s not just about hollywood  but about all of us  that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don t speak up  you re complicit  and there s no question about that
