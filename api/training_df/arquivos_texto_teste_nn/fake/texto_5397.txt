paul ryan is in a little bit of hot water  not because he s establishment  not because he s proposing a giant cut to medicare or medicaid  and not because he s thwarting the rnc no  he s in hot water because he seems to think that lack of diversity is a good thing the speaker recently posted a picture on his instagram page celebrating the new interns for the republican party on capitol hill  the picture  taken with a selfie stick  shows the smiling speaker with an entire whites only workforce  with the majority of them being men  no diversity  no color  nothing but lily white college kids the speaker wrote   i think this sets a record for the most number of  capitolhill interns in a single selfie   speakerselfie  needless to say  speaker ryan and the republicans faced backlash but it was the democrats who had the best response everyone knows the democratic party is the party of inclusiveness  everyone  no matter their race  ethnicity  religion  gender or sexual orientation is welcome  in all capacities  while the republicans seem to have a whites only policy when hiring interns  the democrats like to broaden their horizons congresswoman sheila jackson lee  a democrat from texas  posted on her twitter page a picture of the democratic interns  and  well  there is a big difference can anyone tell me what the difference is  well  for starters  there s more women  there s also individuals of all different races and ethnicities the difference could not be more stark  as republicans  yet again  struggle to appeal to minority voters  it should come as no surprise to them why those who aren t white males have a hard time trusting them just take a look at their convention  out of the   delegates at the rnc  who nominated trump to be their candidate   only  were people of color  which amounts to approximately   percent of the  prime time speakers who will be addressing the convention over the four days   percent are white  only seven speakers are black  and three are latino when  percent of your interns are white  more than  percent of your delegates are white  and  percent of your speakers are white  you don t deserve the minority vote  you cannot be trusted nor taken seriously if you refuse to have them represented in your most official capacities no wonder this year s rnc was branded  rnc so white  this year s gop is the least diverse  it really is now the party of donald trump  they learned absolutely nothing from their  autopsy report  and they may suffer irreparable damage in november featured image via sheila jackson lee twitter
