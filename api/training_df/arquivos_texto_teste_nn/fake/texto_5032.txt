in a speech on monday  donald trump proposed an absurd  idealogical test to gauge the  american values  of immigrants seeking to become naturalized citizens of the united states  khizr khan and senate minority leader harry reid are calling out the billionaire bigot and daring him to take the test himself   without failing khan made headlines when trump attacked him after he spoke at the democratic national convention  khan talked about his son  who gave his while serving with the u s  military in iraq  and asked if trump had ever even read the constitution before offering to lend him his copy  in response to trump s proposed test for immigrants  khan slammed his bigoted rhetoric and challenged the republican nominee to take the test along with him this is my country too  we must make it safe   as muslim americans it is our obligation to keep our country safe  we reject all violence  we support better immigration policies  we stand as a testament to assimilation and being part of patriotic america as anyone else i challenge trump to take the naturalization test with me any day  his is demagoguery and pandering for vote  a divider like trump can never be the steward of this country reid also responded to trump s naturalization test by daring him to step up and take the test himself  he said in no uncertain terms that he didn t have any reason to believe that trump would be able to pass and  would almost certainly fail  since donald trump wants to impose new tests on immigrants  he should take the one test every immigrant has to pass to become a united states citizen  he would almost certainly fail  given his general ignorance and weak grasp of basic facts about american history  principles and functioning of our government the senate minority leader added that  unlike immigrants  donald trump represents none of the qualities that make america great   and then proceeded to list a multitude of ways in which immigrants do just that trump claimed that extreme  extreme vetting  is absolutely necessary to  screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles   he insisted that this test would include questions to gain an understanding of an applicant s stances on gender equality  gay rights  religious freedom and the rule of american law  anyone who fails the test would not be allowed to become a u s  citizen and this will keep us all safe  because isis despite trump s arguments otherwise  it was glaringly obvious that he wasn t trying to screen out just any immigrants and this was just another way he had come up with to keep muslims out of the united states  ironically  trump and most of his followers would fail the test themselves featured image via joe raedle getty images
