today  senator bernie sanders released a new commercial on his efforts to help migrant workers in florida  the advertisement stars a woman from mexico named udelia chautla who narrates the commerical  which is more of a mini documentary  about her experiences with low wages and abuse as a laborer in florida s tomato fields  there were cases of bosses abusing workers   chautla said in spanish   they would not provide workers with water or restrooms  the bosses would get angry because some of the men wouldn t want to keep working and start hitting them   it affected my children because i didn t have enough to buy food  the entire advertisement will air on univsion this thursday in florida  chicago  and arizona  ahead of primaries in those states           nbsp if  d getelementbyid id   return   nbsp js   d createelement s   js id   id   nbsp js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  amp version      nbsp  span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    fjs  span  parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script     span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    facebook jssdk  span            gt how many more immokalees are there  how many fields or factories are there  we have to ask ourselves  who benefits from posted by bernie sanders on saturday  march    in   i traveled to the tomato fields of southern florida and met with migrant workers who were paid starvation wages for backbreaking work and were being ruthlessly exploited   wrote bernie sanders on his campaign website   after the visit  i invited leaders of the coalition of immokalee workers to washington to testify during a senate committee hearing regarding abusive labor practices  as a result of the tremendous grassroots effort of this coalition  working conditions in immokalee improved and workers received a wage increase  in   bernie sanders wrote an article on what he saw in immokalee  in the united states of america  millions of workers are being forced into a race to the bottom  as poverty increases and the middle class shrinks  they are seeing their standard of living decline   he wrote   they are working longer hours for lower wages  and are losing their health insurance  pensions and other benefits  what we have in the tomato fields of florida are workers who are living on the lowest rung of the ladder in that race to the bottom  we must address their plight not only from a moral perspective  but with the understanding that if we look the other way  and accept the terrible exploitation they are suffering  every american worker is in danger as that race to the bottom accelerates  if any state in the country needs a bernie sanders  it is the state of florida  according to data compiled by bloomberg   of the  cities in the country with the greatest income inequality are in florida  miami  tampa bay  and gainesville  the wealthiest  percent of households in florida earn  percent of all income earned in the state  nearly a quarter of african americans in the state can t legally vote because florida is the only state in the country other than iowa to place a lifetime ban from voting on convicted felons  south florida is already facing many threats caused by climate change  with some scientists predicting rising sea levels will flood miami by   meanwhile  florida s republican governor rick scott has banned state agencies from even using the phrases  global warming  and  climate change  in their correspondence whether its environmental concerns or growing levels of poverty and wealth disparity  many of the problems focused on by bernie sanders campaign are exemplified in florida  this is the same state that brought us jeb bush  senator marco rubio  and elected governor rick scott  who even republicans have  called the state s worst governor ever  so it should be no surprise scott is being seriously considered for donald trump s running mate  hopefully  the campaigns of bernie sanders and hillary clinton can resonate with voters in the state to swing florida s electoral votes in the direction of democrats for the  general election because florida will once again likely be key in determining who the next president of the united states will be featured image courtesy of flickr
