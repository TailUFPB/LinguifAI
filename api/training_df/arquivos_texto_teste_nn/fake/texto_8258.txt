marco rubio sounded so robotic during the last gop debate that people are now trolling him by dressing up as robots as you ll recall  rubio had a terrible performance on saturday night thanks to the efforts of new jersey governor chris christie  christie nailed rubio for repeating the same line over and over again in a matter of minutes as if the florida senator malfunctioned and became a broken record  let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing   rubio said in response to christie s charge that rubio lacks the experience to be president   he knows exactly what he s doing  rubio would go on to repeat the line several more times  let s dispel with this fiction that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing  he knows exactly what he s doing  here s the bottom line  this notion that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true  he knows exactly what he s doing  christie didn t let rubio get away with it either  christie accused rubio of being scripted  this is what washington d c  does   christie said   the drive by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized  second speech  that is exactly what his advisers gave him  it was a disaster for rubio  especially since he looked to be rising in the new hampshire polls  but now  he s seen as a robot who is pre programmed to say certain things and he s not going to able to forget about his robotic blunder any time soon some clever people had the brilliant idea to troll rubio by dressing up as robots  in the twitter image below  you can see two guys in their robot gear  one is named marco roboto and the other is called rubio talking point  outside rubio s  nh event today  per  inesdlc   marco roboto     rubio talking point    from  americanbridge pic twitter com   ben siegel   benyc  february    if the republican primary couldn t get any stranger  we now have robots trolling the candidates and we have marco rubio to thank for it domo arigato  marco roboto  featured image from digital journal
