if there s anyone right now worthy of complete and utter condemnation  it s republican presidential frontrunner donald trump  so  while speaking at a tech conference in san francisco  facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg laid into trump   hard zuckerberg said  i m starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world  i hear fearful voices talking about building walls  it takes courage to choose hope over fear  instead of building walls we can help build bridges  instead of dividing people we can connect people  we do it one person at a time  one connection at time  that s why i think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before  this  of course  is a direct jab at trump s ridiculous idea that the united states should build a giant wall spanning the entire length of the u s  mexico border  and zuckerberg is right   we shouldn t be building walls  we should be tearing them down and building relationships that will foster future growth and development between the neighboring nations zuckerberg also said  our lives are connected  whether we re welcoming a refugee fleeing war or an immigrant seeking new opportunity  whether we re coming together to fight global diseases like ebola or to fight climate change  we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together  not push people apart  which is exactly right  we don t need a leader of our nation that is going to build walls to keep the world out  and in essence  keep us in  this sort of isolationist  xenophobic and nonsensical fear baiting serves absolutely no one  it doesn t keep us safer  and it most certainly doesn t foster relationships with the rest of the world  hopefully the nation will come together this november who will seek to build bridges and not walls featured photo by adam berry getty images via flickr
