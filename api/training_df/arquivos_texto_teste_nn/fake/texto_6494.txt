in case you have been living under a rock  democrats got slaughtered in the  midterm elections  that year featured voter turnout that was at its lowest since world war ii  unfortunately  republicans thrive on low turnout   especially when they can take advantage of the supreme court s monumentally stupid decision to gut the voting rights act  already  we are seeing an impact  in   gop voters have been flocking to the polls to support their favorite kkk endorsed bigot  donald trump  democrats  however  have largely been staying home  especially in southern states on saturday  president obama addressed the graduating class at howard university  where he dropped a truth bomb on the crowd  if you stay home  we lose  obama acknowledges that republicans have managed to not only keep barriers in place even after the many decades since the voting rights act was passed in the first place  but that they are also erecting  new barriers to vote  like nonsensical voter id laws they claim will combat almost nonexistent voter fraud  but he also pointed out a harsh truth with which we need to come to terms  democrats have a bad habit of not showing up to the polls  this is the only advanced democracy on earth that goes out of its way to make it  difficult for people to vote   the president said  referencing the  legacy  of white supremacists attempting to limit the black vote   but let me say this  even if we dismantle every barrier to vote that alone would not change the fact that america has some of the lowest voting rates in the free world  in   only  percent of americans turned out to vote in the midterms   obama told the students    the second lowest participation rate on record   he particularly urged black voters to get their behinds to the polls  noting the low african american participation rates  president obama reminded them that democrats staying home  made a difference in what  gotta deal with   in other words  democrats who stay home elect republicans  people wonder   how come obama hasn t gotten this done  how come he didn t get that done   he continued   you don t think that made a difference  what would have happened if you had turned out at      percent all across this country  people try to make this political thing really complicated   the president said pointedly  but it s actually quite simple  it s mad   if you have more votes than the other guy  you get to do what you want  it s not that complicated  and you don t have excuses  you don t have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote  you don t have to risk your life to cast a ballot  other people already did that for you  then  he reminded us of what happens when we don t exercise our right to vote  when we don t vote  we give away our power  disenfranchise ourselves  right when we need to use the power we have  right when we need your power to stop others from taking away the voting rights of those more vulnerable than you are  the elderly  the poor  the formerly incarcerated trying to earn their second chance  you need to vote all the time   not just when it s cool  not just when it s time to elect a president  not just when you re inspired  it s your duty  the president clarified that it s not just national elections that matter  it goes beyond who you put in the oval office  or with whom you fill the seats in congress  it s important to vote for progressive policies at  every level  it is not that complicated   the president said   don t make it complicated  in november  remember obama s words   and do your duty featured image via screengrab
