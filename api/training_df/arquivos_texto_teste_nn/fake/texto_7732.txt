they whined and fear mongered  but in the end  republicans had to sit and watch as oregon took action to help struggling workers make a fair living on wednesday  oregon governor kate brown signed a bill into law raising the state minimum wage to the highest in the country  but in a unique way that takes into consideration the differences between urban and rural business growth according to the oregonian the bill gives oregon the highest statewide minimum wage rates in the nation  to    inside portland s urban growth boundary     in midsize counties and    in rural areas by  the law was agreed upon by labor unions and businesses in a compromise that should stand as proof that both sides can work together for the common good of the hardworking people who are trying to feed and cloth their families governor brown expressed pride at what oregon democrats have achieved for families across the state with the help of unions and businesses  i am extremely proud of the collaborative spirit of the stakeholder groups that worked to develop this legislation  oregon has not only avoided a number of potentially problematic ballot measures  we have taken a very smart approach in a way that makes sense for workers and for businesses no matter where in oregon they are  on facebook  brown wrote that the new law will  ensure hard working oregonians get a much needed raise in order to keep up with rising costs of rent  food  and other necessities  even president obama praised the new wage hike in a statement via the white house  and called upon congress to do the same for the rest of the nation i commend the oregon legislature and governor kate brown for taking action to raise their state s minimum wage  since i first called on congress to increase the federal minimum wage in    states and the district of columbia have acted on their own  these efforts will boost the paychecks of hardworking americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet  today  more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum  that s progress  but congress needs to keep up with the rest of the country  they need to act  and finally give america a raise  and until they do  i ll continue to encourage states  cities  counties and companies to act on their own to support hardworking families this is a great day for oregon workers  who must be a little more excited than usual to go to work now that they know they ll be taking home much more needed income to provide for themselves and their families the same cannot be said for most of republican controlled alabama and other red states  republicans there recently passed a law banning counties and cities from increasing the minimum wage within their own boundaries  making clear that they have no intention of raising the minimum wage in that state for the foreseeable future so while people in oregon can have hope that the future will be financially brighter  people in alabama are struck and that s why it doesn t make sense for people to vote for republicans  featured image via kptv
