when bill o reilly calls himself a journalist  he shows he has no idea what that word actually means because he seems to be wholly unable to fact check anything  on the o reilly factor wednesday night  he went after democrats and the economy the same way republicans love to  by attacking the idea of helping low wage workers as something that will destroy absolutely everyone basically  he believes that if we want people to live comfortably on only  hours of work per week  we ll have to raise wages so high that we ll cause the u s  economy to collapse  in fact  he seems to think that reducing poverty by raising the minimum wage is a radical left wing  fringe idea that will ruin our economy if we actually go ahead and implement it in short  he says it s a horrible idea because he has no idea how our economy works the funny thing is that he used to trumpet a higher minimum wage   at least  he used to support a   hr minimum wage  however  he s also claimed that raising the minimum wage will only help a tiny fraction of the population  because reasons  why hurt everyone to only help a very few people who don t deserve it anyway  right he s also accused the government of at least being a major contributor to the problem  if not the whole source of the problem   big government doesn t work   he says  while literally millions of americans are the victims of corporate greed  no  earning power has not improved much under president obama  but there are two problems that billo the clown is overlooking  first is an obstructionist congress  and second is just how limited the president s power actually is when it comes to the economy  if congress won t do what he wants  even on economic measures  then he s stuck except for where federal contractors are concerned there s a reason bill o reilly has earned the nickname  billo the clown   and it s because of utter bull cookies like this  he fancies himself a journalist  the facts are not on his side featured image by jamie mccarthy getty images for the rumble
