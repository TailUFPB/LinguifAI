this is a two year old american pit bull terrier  apbt   her name is akamara this is a human baby  his name is siegmund siegmund first met akamara the day after he was born  we never leave siegmund alone with akamara   after all  she s dangerous to him  she might quite literally snuggle him to death  here s what happens she gets pretty sad about it  but she s only allowed to put her head near him  and only with eyes on her at all times  he s just too small and she s too insistently snuggly she really wants to lay on that pillow nothing to see here  just a ferocious pit bull trying to cuddle with a two day old baby he s almost two weeks old now  and she s getting pretty impatient about it  why isn t he petting her  why will he not play tug akamara really can t help but cuddle the baby  it s her instinct  little known to most people  but american pit bull terriers   one of several breeds commonly referred to under the broad title  pit bulls    are nanny dogs  as the united kennel club  ukc   which recognizes and classifies apbts as a breed  states in their breed standard   apbts make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children  they make bad guard dogs  by the way   they re too friendly  friendlier than you d believe  the american temperament test society rates them higher than many common family breeds  such as golden retrievers  here s an interesting video by animalist on pit bulls         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus all js xfbml    fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs     document   script    facebook jssdk           gt dogfighting has existed probably since humans domesticated dogs  and has flourished during the last century as an underground sport  pit bulls are favored for a number of reasons  but that s not their fault  and it certainly isn t due to their temperament  it s because they bite hard  and when you factor in their size  they bite extremely hard you can take a territorial  defensive dog   a normal personality type across most breeds  which requires socialization and training as a pup to deter aggression   and turn them into a fighter  it s criminal  but possible  and those dogs  if rescued  may suffer from ptsd or other mental trauma that increases the chances of an attack  especially if rescued by an inexperienced or unprepared owner  but it s not the breed  it s the choice by dog fighters to use the breed  even if you restrict the breed  they ll find another if it came down to it  dogfighters would probably pit chihuahuas against each other  it s the sport and the blood  it s the breeders and fighters  not the dogs  we don t put city wide bans on cars that can go over  mph because a few people are souping them up and racing them  we arrest the racers and take their misused cars away akamara is a rescue  but a victim of only neglect  i got her at six months old with mange  no inoculations  and a desperate need for attention  her immune system was extremely deficient due to mange and allergies  and she s struggled with secondary ear infections her entire young life  i would not advise rescuing an adult dog with unknown history in a house with children just remember  this isn t what most pit bulls look like this is
