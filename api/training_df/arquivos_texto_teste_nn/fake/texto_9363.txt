on this thanksgiving  i would like to address an open letter to the multimillionaire national football league players who continue to take a knee when  the star spangled banner  is played dear kneeling brothers as a proud army veteran  mom and black american  i thank god that i live in the greatest nation on earth  for me  thanksgiving doesn t just come once a year  i m thankful  days a year you make far  far more money than almost all americans   regardless of race  kids look up to you as heroes  you appear on tv and in the media yet  you keep on protesting   refusing to rise and respect our national anthem and respect the men and women like me who serve or have served in our military i was willing to die for my country when i put on the army uniform  and you re not even willing to stand up for a short song  this is too much of a sacrifice for you one of the many lessons i ve learned along the way is that there is no place on the planet like america  she is not perfect  because we are not perfect  yet  she is a consummate beacon of light  set upon a hill  for nations who look to her for hope  dignity and direction you big guys should appreciate that   and pause for a few moments to express your patriotism and love for our great nation when our national anthem is played and our flag flies before thousands of people who have paid good money to see you run around a field chasing a little ball let me tell you about me  i m not as big and strong as you  but i stepped forward to join the army to fight for your right to play games in peace weeks before i graduated from the army s basic training program  i had an epiphany  i could be deployed to war  would i go  would i put my life on the line for someone else it didn t take me long to come to a resounding yes  if called  i would go but i gave myself an assignment  if i was going to potentially give life or limb to defend this great country  i would need to know what  exactly  i was defending  i am still learning one of the lessons i ve learned about america is more of a personal lesson  i am not a victim  my two beautiful black babies are not victims  black americans are not victims we are victors   not so much because of anything we have done  but because of those who came before us  slaves in chains  treated like farm animals  to be  owned  by others  and after emancipation  those who endured the humiliation of drinking out of the  dirty  water fountain or taking their child into the  colored  restroom those who were spat upon or cursed out solely because they were deemed the  wrong  color  those who had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to be eligible to vote  notwithstanding their college education those who were hosed down  billy clubbed across the head or attacked by trained dogs just because they walked across a bridge those who were aroused from their sleep to see hate filled men covered in white sheets  a cross burning in their front yard and their neighbor calling out for their son those who  oftentimes  paid the ultimate sacrifice   not for their own benefit  but for the joy that was set before them we  today  are the joy that was set before them  and  how do you repay them for their sacrifice to be treated as equal under the law  you have chosen to take a knee if you followed the rhetoric we hear today  america is not far removed from those jim crow days of legalized discrimination against black people if you closed your eyes and just listened to the blistering speeches coming from antifa  the black lives matter folks and many politicians  you would think we re not even  years removed from slavery itself the narrative behind  hands up  don t shoot  perpetuates the storyline that around every street corner there s a police officer waiting to shoot a black man  it is these narratives that have given life to you nfl players kneeling during our national anthem if there was truth behind these narratives  then i would readily support you black millionaire athletes using your national platform to shine a bright light on the systemic racism against the black community but we re not living in  or   racism is certainly not dead  but it s not the powerful monster backed by all the resources of government either  and you guys are not exactly downtrodden  going hungry  being shoved to the back of the bus  or used for target practice by ku klux klansmen dressed up like cops allow me to make a few suggestions to you as an alternative to continuing to disrespect our country and flag  if you want to make a real difference that extends beyond getting your picture on a magazine cover  please consider doing the following first  invest in black urban schools  to help them pay for the educational programs and enhanced learning opportunities that wealthy suburban schools have to help their students succeed second  commit to providing mentoring and college scholarships for    or even just one child in the inner city  from elementary school through high school and into college  you will change their futures third  take   million or   million   not all of your vast wealth   and invest it into creating jobs  businesses and entrepreneurial internships to help black people achieve the american dream  find ways to personally take your millions directly into a distressed community and invest fourth  take a family out of the inner city by giving them a mortgage free home  consider the ripple effect of good this stand would have on the lives of an entire family for generations to come fifth  educate yourselves and then others on what the democratic party has done to the black community  i have yet to find an inner city run by conservatives  yet i see one democratic politician after another representing some of the most distressed communities  these politicians themselves usually do not live in those distressed communities and often live in expensive homes while their kids attend private schools teach yourselves and others to hold elected officials accountable  be determined to no longer fall prey to their sleight of hand manipulations that only serve to distract you from their lack of effort to make real changes in the black community doing just one of these things would make an indelible imprint on any community  especially the black community so instead of taking a knee  take a stand to stomp out poverty by investing in businesses  by creating an environment that promotes family stability  and by fanning the flames of hope  dignity and direction into the lives of some of our most depressed citizens by the grace of god  i was never called into war during my army service  i know many others who were  some did not return whole  so  while i can t play pro football  i have two legs  two arms and a brain that tells me to appreciate and love the united states of america for all this i am thankful  and i think you should be too happy thanksgiving kathy
