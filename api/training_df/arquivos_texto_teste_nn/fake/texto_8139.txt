a new campaign ad from reality tv star and current republican presidential front runner donald trump exploits the death of  year old jas shaw in order to further the racist narrative trump launched his campaign with  in the ad  shaw s death at the hands of undocumented immigrant pedro espinoza is used as an argument to elect trump president  jas shaw was a  year old football star who was gunned just outside his home   a narrator says as the words  gunned down  appear in white bold letters against a red background on top of the photo   his killer  an illegal immigrant gang member who just got out of prison  the  second ad  which will soon air in south carolina ahead of the feb   republican primary  features jas shaw s father  jamiel shaw  who has endorsed trump for president and appeared on the campaign trail with him  in the ad  shaw says trump is the only candidate who will end illegal immigration  trump is the only one saying   you re going to be dealt with  we re going to enforce that     shaw says in the ad   we re going to enforce that  that s a beautiful thing  it is  of course  impossible to end all illegal immigration and trump s proposal to deport  million people is similarly a stupid and unworkable idea that has been derided by people on both the left and the right but trump doesn t actually care about how practical the idea is  he is pandering to base  racist impulses on the right and from the day his campaign launched he has been exploiting bigotry in order to advance politically the new ad is the direct  descendant of  s  willie horton  ad  in which images of a black murderer were used by republican supporters of president george h w  bush  who were also connected to roger ailes  now the head of fox news  to attack democratic presidential nominee as  soft on crime  trump s anti latino  anti muslim rhetoric has already resulted in assaults on latinos by perpetrators who said trump inspired them  as well as incidents at trump rallies of muslim and black protesters being physically and verbally assaulted by trump backers an ad broadcast on television during a heated primary simply ramps up the outrage felt by many on the right and give them the excuse of another ethnic target the mainstream media has studiously avoided pointing out the hate motivating trump s campaign  either out of fear of backlash from conservatives or just out of the sense that a continued trump campaign is good for ratings featured image from youtube
