on sunday  weekly standard editor bill kristol teased that an  independent candidate   an impressive one  with a strong team and a real chance  could be entering the presidential race very soon   an announcement that would strike fear into the heart of the presumptive republican nominee  donald trump twitteralthough kristol didn t throw out any specific names  it was definitely an exciting announcement for the  nevertrump movement  and a predictable move from the republican strategist  for the last few weeks  kristol has been calling for an independent conservative to run against trump   a personal mission that has earned him scorn and names like republican spoiler  and  renegade jew  from conservative news outlets like breitbart thanks to trump s social media addiction and the fact that he is incapable of focusing his attention on creating sound policies and solutions like a true presidential candidate should  trump noticed almost immediately that kristol had launched yet another attack against him shortly after kristol s announcement  trump fired back using his favorite social media platform   twitter  he lashed out  calling kristol a  dummy  and  loser  and begged his fellow republicans  to be smart   strong   he also channeled his campaign manager corey lewandowski  who had recently said that if there was a third party candidate  we could all kiss the second amendment goodbye because the democrats would take over the supreme court twittertwittertwittertrump is likely terrified by the idea that he might have another candidate to beat   because surely another republican candidate would not only split the gop  but highly jeopardize his chances of winning against democratic front runner hillary clinton  but regardless of how trump feels about kristol s announcement  it s definitely an exciting one for the democrats  if a third party candidate enters the race to run against trump  the gop can pretty much forget about winning the election featured image via spencer platt   getty images
