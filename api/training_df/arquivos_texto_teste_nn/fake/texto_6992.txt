donald trump likes to promote himself a shrewd businessman  but many who have done business with the man have been cheated and lied to while few people are under any illusions as to trump s honesty or integrity  a closer look at his campaign finance scheme suggests he may be running an enormous scam on all of us from the time trump announced that he was entering the race for the republican presidential nomination  trump has been telling his supporters that his campaign is mostly self financed that s true  and it s not true donald may want people to think he s a multi billionaire  but as addicting info reports here  his actual net worth is estimated to be much lower as it turns out  trump is  self financing his campaign  by lending money to himself  as of february  the trump campaign had loans totaling    million  more than  percent of all the money his campaign had brought in to date as this graph from sunlight foundation shows  trump has actually given very little to his campaign image credit  sunlight foundationdetails on the terms of these loans appear to be a well kept secret  it s hard to imagine a profiteer like donald trump not charging interest on    million in loans then there are revelations that the trump campaign is spending large sums of money at trump owned businesses as the daily beast reports here  between the time he entered the race and the close of   the campaign had paid more than   million to tag air inc trump owns a commercial sized plane  a boeing    which is equipped to safely transport  passengers in seat belts plated with  carat gold although they might prefer to sit in the dining room  one of two bedrooms  or in the shower   or they might prefer to travel in his smaller jet or one of his two helicopters  his aircraft ferry him around the country  from new york to des moines to manchester to biloxi  at a steep cost steep is right  the bill ran over    for a single day  in june of  there were also huge bills paid out to trump owned restaurants like trump cafe and trump grill  while trump restaurants llc got a    all on its own the campaign paid rent and utilities to trump tower commercial llc  along with in kind rent to donald j  trump  trump cps llc  and trump plaza llc the daily beast also reports trump even has his own companies to manage payroll  trump payroll corp  and trump tower commercial llc  where tens of thousands of dollars are regularly funneled before landing in the pockets of his well compensated staff campaign finance law bars candidates from profiting off their own campaigns yet at least one fec expert told the daily beast that trump s financial scam is unprecedented according to paul ryan  of the campaign legal center this is sort of a strange gray area of the law that i don t think the fec has ever addressed  as olivia nuzzi of the daily beast reports were trump to profit from  say  the sale of  ivanka s salads  ryan said it would be a  technical violation  of fec law   but it doesn t make sense for it to be a violation  why should it matter  in other words  if it was his own money to begin with  if it is being recirculated back into his pocket throughout the course of the campaign trump once vowed to be the first presidential candidate to make a profit from his campaign back in february  the new york times reported that he may be closer to doing that than anyone realizes but in the end  donald trump s campaign may up being little more than a costly political commentary on the shady way that corporate america functions if trump is an expert at anything it s privatizing profits  while transferring losses onto u s  taxpayers he s filed multiple bankruptcies  so many in fact  that according to cnn money  trump s casino empire surpasses every major u s  company when it comes to the number of bankruptcies filed over the past  years the idea that trump could walk away from his presidential bid with millions of dollars in profits  while leaving the taxpayers holding all the bills  is not all that far fetched  especially given his expertise in the world of shady corporate finance image credit  gage skidmore
