bristol palin didn t go to harvard law school like president obama or her frenemy ted cruz did  she wants us to know this  apparently  someone  please get ahold of bristol s personal assistant  email inbox  whatever she uses to keep in touch with the vast worldwide community she tries to communicate with on a daily basis  and tell her  we already know this  precious pic via patheosnevermind the fact that she forgot to use the word  be   thereby automatically rendering her sentence structurally unsound  that s less important  let s soak in for a moment the gist of what she s saying  that is  if it s even humanly possible first  here s some context  in a nutshell  bristol is glad her mom has decided to endorse donald trump  she s mad that ted cruz campaign spokesman rick tyler issued the following statement when rumors first started circling that sarah palin would throw her support behind the donald  i think it  be a blow to sarah palin  because sarah palin has been a champion for the conservative cause  and if she was going to endorse donald trump  sadly  she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life  on marriage  on partial birth abortion  she then went on a long diatribe of how she  likes cruz  after meeting him  but that this statement was just way over the line  cue the inspired  i didn t go to harvard law school  quote  in other words  she s saying she knows a few things despite not knowing other things okay  we re done trying to understand palin logic  our heads are starting to hurt  cue the internet reaction where she s currently getting the roasting of a lifetime for making the comment pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter in all fairness  we finally do get what bristol was trying to say  she s not that bright but is still going to speak up regardless  in that respect  the apple doesn t seem to fall too far from the tree  perhaps next time she can say something like   i didn t get married  but i still know how to teach abstinence and make babies at the same time  featured image via flickr
