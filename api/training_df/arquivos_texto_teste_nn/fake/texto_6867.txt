there is a popular belief among republicans that the mainstream media is in cahoots with liberals  the theory  as they tell it  holds that liberals run the  mainstream  media  and therefore give favorable political coverage to democrats and demonize conservatives  the belief is so common  in fact  that fox news  the country s most watched news network is seen by many as restoring the  balance  between the two sides  republicans have fox and liberals have everything else   or so the thinking goes it s a convenient fantasy if you re a republican  if the media has a  liberal bias  then what they report is inherently suspect  when  say  reporters find that there was absolutely no evidence that hillary clinton did anything wrong during benghazi  conservatives can sleep well knowing that it s just because those reporters are covering for her  if republican lawmakers then waste millions of dollars and thousands of hours on that particular witchhunt  well that s fair game because the  mainstream  news wouldn t give americans the full story a new report done by social media analytics company crimson hexagon has taken that conservative narrative and blown it completely out of the water  running a deep analysis of how much negative vs  positive media coverage each of the still active presidential candidates has received  the team found the exact opposite of what fox news viewers might expect  who has been viciously attacked the most during this campaign hillary clinton which two candidates received the least amount of positive coverage  hillary clinton and bernie sanders vox turned the data into a simple graph  and the results are startling crimson hexagon looked at hundreds of thousands of online stories published since january of   the data is nothing if not comprehensive  what this means for you and me is that for a year and a half now  we have been more or less constantly bombarded with negative stories about democrats and less so about republicans  on the flipside  an average american is more likely to hear a positive story about kasich or trump than they are about either of the two democratic options trump may complain about how unfairly he is being treated  but from this analysis it s clear that the only ones with legitimate gripes are sanders and clinton this  unfair and unbalanced  coverage of the election may explain why hillary clinton is seeing bafflingly high unfavorability polling  even while donald trump  the republican front runner  publicly endorses things like waterboarding  religious based discrimination  and violence towards protesters  america s a sponge and it s been soaking up the negativity for years this may come as a shock to fox news viewers  but their  media has a liberal bias  worldview is built on a lie  how do you convince someone to watch your network and no one else s  tell them the rest are frauds  fox has been beating that drum so long that at this point even they can t control the conservative base any more  chat with a trump or cruz supporter and you may soon learn that fox news is  too liberal  these days  too  liberal in reality  the mainstream media has very few party loyalties  the only idol they worship is that of ratings and the best ratings come when they are drumming up controversy by promoting scandal  if that means going after donald trump  they ll do it  but oftentimes it also means going after clinton and sanders for reasons that otherwise objective reporters would see almost immediately as manufactured nonsense  recently  just to take one egregious example  the washington post ran a story that claimed nearly  fbi agents were looking into hillary clinton s emails  a lot of ink was spilled over it over the next  hours making clinton look very bad  and then someone bothered to track down the source  it was a republican lawmaker  the story was nothing more than a fabricated hit piece started by a goper looking to hurt clinton and used an all too eager washington post reporter to do it reality may have a liberal bias  but news networks sure don t featured image via regine mahaux getty images
