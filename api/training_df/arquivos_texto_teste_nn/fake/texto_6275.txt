donald trump s number one fangirl  ann coulter  believes we have a superior culture we must keep pure  to that end  she thinks that small pockets of certain types of people in the u s  are fine  so long as they don t overwhelm our wealthy  white  christian  european culture  guess who else she said that about  jewish people in an interview with bbc radio   the following exchange took place  americans don t want immigration   coulter said  demanding a complete halt   they don t want any more  why can t we have a home  bbc interviewer james naughtie challenged her   if someone had said that about jewish immigration into new york a century ago  would you have approved of it  oh god  not the jews again   the exasperated coulter exclaimed  that s like two percent of the population   she added   that did not overwhelm our culture   listen to her her put her bigotry on full display below  why can t we have a home   we do have a home  that question makes absolutely no sense   she acts like white christians are being forced out  has that ever happened to a culture before  oh  wait  yes it has  when her vaunted white  christian europeans forced native americans out of their homes seeing as how christianity was born from judaism  and jesus christ himself was a jew  she takes an odd position on jews  but coulter is one of the worst bigots we ve got   that s why she supports donald trump  despite her enduring love for him though  while trump was talking about how israel has no greater supporter than himself during one of the gop debates last year  she tweeted   how many f ing jews do these people think there are in the united states  the implication is that she believes jews have an outsized influence here  she claims that s not the case  though  she was merely talking about how republicans act like our jewish population has an outsized influence  she s not the anti semite here  or  at least  on her planet she s not an anti semite that s in spite of the fact that she also said  at the time  that republicans are merely pandering to the jews  who is she pandering to  then  probably donald trump she says anti semitic stuff fairly frequently  and then she puts on her walking contradiction costume when she defends herself  anyone with a pulse knows i am pro israel and against the enemies of the jewish people  i have a whole chapter in my current book praising israel and prime minister benjamin netanyahu  it s the people attacking me who couldn t care less about israel or jews  she ll never admit she s said something sick and wrong  that s probably another reason she s a trump fangirl  he doesn t admit when he s wrong  either  sure  the jewish population here is okay  but she d want them deported in a nanosecond if their population exploded  her hateful  bigoted self needs the comfort of white  christian europeans all around her  everyone else is a threat featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
