last week  social media was filled with memes mocking the bundy militia s plea for snacks  unfortunately for the imbeciles currently occupying federal land  america had a lot of fun and sent the militants a bunch of stuff that they did not like  patriot  and well known white supremacist jon ritzheimer posted a video on facebook on monday complaining about the various items people have sent the militia in lieu of the snacks  tampons and cigarettes the group asked for  it was really mind blowing to me that people would actually spend their money  on this    he said   this box right here      for shipping   they spend and waste their money on all this hateful stuff to send out here to us and buy this ridiculous stuff  this one was really funny   a  bag of dicks   rather than going out and doing good  they just spend all their money on hate and hate  in the video you then see ritzheimer rage sweep the stuff off of the table and onto the floor  he declares  we re going to clear the table and we re going to continue to do work and do good for our country  we re not going to be deterred  we re not gonna let you and all your junk and hate mail sidetrack us honestly  we don t know what he s talking about  americans were just trying to give him a nice bag of d cks to snack on  they re gummy and delicious  why doesn t he want our gifts perhaps the best part of the video was the caption under it  ritzheimer often exploits his military service to justify his hatred for the muslim community  but under the video he says  to my family  i love you very much and i am sorry i can t be there with you  please look at this as a deployment  only this time i m actually serving my country rather than being sent over seas to line the pockets of corrupt politicians  so  what  now he doesn t believe he honorably served his country while in the military  if that s the case he needs to stop talking about being a former marine  our military deserves more respect that some guy who just rolls out his service when it s convienant for him   like so many other tea party republicans do i think that what this  patriot  really wants is more stuff  so if you have a few extra dollars to spare  maybe you could also send him some mouth watering d cks to chew on while he is actively fighting against the country he claims to  love  so much watch his angry rant https   www facebook com scrappyphx rider videos  featured image via video screenshot
