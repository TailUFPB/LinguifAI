while republican presidential frontrunner donald trump can boast and claim he s going to win the presidency hands down  he s forgetting that he s only been in the republican primary against some incredibly weak and equally as unappealing candidates  sure  he s popular among his band of merry morons who want a wall to keep out foreigners and may not have learned how to use a fork yet  but when it comes to the general election  he s pretty much toast no matter who the democrats run up against trump  whether it be the frontrunner hillary clinton or bernie sanders  they both would kick his ass at the ballot box come november  clinton is even ahead in the popular vote by millions against anyone running  if that s not already a clear indicator of what s to come later this year another person who knows trump will lose is president obama  and he s also very blunt in explaining that the real estate mogul reality television star isn t qualified to be president  nor would he be able to actually fulfill the duties of commander in chief during the white house correspondents  dinner the president quipped   they say donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president  but in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world  miss sweden  miss argentina  miss azerbaijan  then on monday  president obama said during an interview with wmur in new hampshire  i think that he is not somebody who even within the republican party can be considered as equipped to deal with the problems of this office  but look  we live in a democracy  clearly indicating that people are more than allowed to vote for him  but he added  if in fact the republicans nominate mr  trump  then it s going to be an interesting fall season  i m confident that ultimately the democrat in that circumstance will win  which is absolutely correct  it would also be a rude awakening for the republican party that clearly has let itself fall apart before our very eyes  which honestly is very entertaining  but equally as terrifying what it comes down to is this  donald trump is not only a dangerous choice for president  but him running is just absolutely ridiculous  he s not at all prepared for the role of president of the united states  he doesn t even talk the talk  he just goes around bullying his competition  women  minorities  and muslims all while talking about a wall that is never gonna happen  nor does it even make logistical sense enough is enough  folks  just remember  no matter who   vote blue featured photos by bill pugliano  joshua lott getty images
