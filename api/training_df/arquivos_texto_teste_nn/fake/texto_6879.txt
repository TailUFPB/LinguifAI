some people just don t understand  freedom of religion  whatsoever  the first amendment separates church from state for two reasons  to protect the church and the state  religious freedom is the ability to worship how you choose on your own time  however  if a public school  funded by public taxpayer dollars that is for all citizens regardless of religion  has something that puts one faith over another  that s not  freedom   it s promoting a theocracy so  when the freedom from religion foundation sent a letter about removing a bible verse from a website to the troup independent school district in troup  texas   mind you  a public school district open to all   this sent many ill informed people into a tizzy one of those ill informed people  who still has every right to worship her god on her time  is brittany taylor  taylor is the parent of two kids that go to troup isd  she was beyond angry that the public school district would take down the bible verse that read   as goliath moved closer to attack  david quickly ran out to meet him   she thinks that even though public and held to the constitution to separate any church from any state run place  the school should be able to promote christianity taylor said  we support our school fully  they kind of had their hands tied in the situation  we wanted to fight back for them  there s literally nothing to fight back about  yet  what did she do  make t shirts that read  our god is bigger  for students  including her own children  to wear  she s literally putting out the argument that many often satirize of  my god is bigger than your god  in the clash over religion and religious freedom sam grover  freedom of religion foundation  said  under the federal constitution  a government entity like a school district can t endorse one religious belief over others or religion generally over non religion  which is exactly correct quite honestly  her kids should be free to wear whatever they want  but the school itself cannot and should not promote any religion  public school is not a church  and thus not the time nor place for public worship of any god  yet everyone is still perfectly free to worship on their own time  no one is losing any form of freedom  no one of course  taylor believes she s being  told  what to do  because you know  she doesn t understand how the constitution actually works  she said   it will be in our children s hearts and they will not stop praising god because a group told them to   no one told your kids not to worship  nope  not at all  but okay all that these parents are doing is making a point they clearly don t need to make  but really  if you re gonna be stupid  the least you could do is leave your kids out of it watch the coverage of this story via kytx  featured image via video screen capture
