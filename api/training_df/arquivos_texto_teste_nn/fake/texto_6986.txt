hate to disappoint the naysayers of hillary clinton who would love for her to be tossed out of the presidential election  but the short answer for what her private server did to the nation is   nothing  scandalous  right while appearing on fox news sunday  president obama told chris wallace that while not a good idea  when it comes down to if national security was ever at risk in regards to then secretary of state clinton s private email server  there was never any risk he also stated  i also think it is important to keep this in perspective  this is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state  and did an outstanding job  he also said  there s carelessness in terms of managing emails  that she has owned  and she recognizes  clinton certainly has owned up to the carelessness of her private server on several occasions between countless interviews and debates  and insists that she will be cleared of any and all alleged wrongdoing obama also made a special point of saying   i guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the justice department  or the fbi  not just in this case  but in any case   because many on the right have already been implying that clinton is somehow receiving special treatment  which is simply just not the case  the president said  nobody is above the law  how many times do i have to say it  republicans and those opposing hillary are holding tight to the verrrrrry slim possibility that she will somehow be indicted for having a private server and emails that changed classification status after the fact according to huffpo  the state department said this month it has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in clinton s emails at the request of the fbi  the department  complying with a judge s order  has released more than   emails from clinton s private server  clinton  quite literally  is complying with everything that is being asked of her  and she alongside the president seem pretty damn confident that she will be vindicated  which will likely be exactly what happens  featured image via video screen capture
