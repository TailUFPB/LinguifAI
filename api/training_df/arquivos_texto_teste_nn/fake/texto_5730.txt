if we ve learned anything from donald trump s constant flip flopping on his policies and stances on issues  it s that whenever he tries to fix an idiotic statement he s made  he usually just manages to make it far worse  we saw this with his numerous stances on abortion  in which he first stated that women should be punished for terminating pregnancies  and then furiously backpedaled in several different directions once he realized that statement was too inflammatory trump is once again revising one of his policies  and this time it s a correction to one of the most controversial statements in his campaign   his proposed ban on muslims  having once said that all muslims should be banned from coming into the united states  trump has now changed it to only forbidding the muslims coming from  terror states   these comments come as trump is at his golf resort in scotland  a place that he will apparently now be welcoming muslims to cnn reporter jeremy diamond heard the words straight from the donald s mouth  and reported back on twitter twittertwittertwittertwittertwitterthis seems like a major step back from trump s  request for  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on   recently  following the tragic mass shooting in orlando  florida  trump called for a complete immigration ban from countries that have a history of terrorism against america  along with his new comments on saturday  trump was noted saying  we are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here  that i can tell you i want terrorists out  i want people that have bad thoughts out  i would limit specific terrorist countries and we know who those terrorist countries are  some have said that trump s switch from a religious ban to a regional ban actually makes sense  although in actuality trump is still doing both  he is still deeply discriminating   he is just using softer  more acceptable language to fluff it up  it s also unclear exactly which countries trump s new stance will apply to   there are only three counties of the state department s official list of state sponsors of terrorism  syria  iran and sudan  however  trump probably hasn t taken into account that terrorist groups often have members in different countries  which can include u s  allies  but then again  when has trump ever thought something through while trump is now saying that his ban would only apply to muslims in terror states  spokesperson hope hicks would not say if non muslims from those countries or muslims living in peaceful countries would be exempt from the ban for all the flip flopping that trump does  it s honestly hard to know when to believe him  regardless  his infamous muslim ban has been one of the biggest points in his campaign  so we re sure this isn t the last we ll hear about it featured image via jeff j mitchell   getty images
