the short answer  i don t think so  but it s possible the other day on morning joe  the democratic presidential frontrunner said the following during a phone in interview with the msnbc morning show hosts  i guess at the end of the day  for me   you know  people talk about their extraordinary grandchildren  but i actually have one   and we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities  and we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities  but it s not enough and i think too many people are forgetting what are some of the biggest determinants as to what happens to your children and grandchildren  the first being what kind of country we are and whether we re still providing the opportunities to realize your promise and potential and what kind of world s going to be out there waiting and i feel passionately that just because we had it in the past  doesn t mean we re going to keep it in the future  you shouldn t have to be the granddaughter of a former president to have your american dream realized  i think every kid should have a chance to live up to her god given potential  a debate has erupted online in which bernie sanders supporters are suggesting that clinton s remarks about how she actually has a grandchild is a not so subtle jab at the fact that sanders has seven grandchildren through his current wife of  years  jane o meara sanders  whose three children were from her previous marriage to be clear  clinton launched into a long answer to a question from mika brzezinski that began with something about the contrast between her and the other democratic  candidates  plural  but there was a long section preceding her grandchildren remarks about what she intends to do and what her qualifications are  then the thing about the grandkids  so  there wasn t an explicitly sanders oriented context for her remarks but if this was  in fact  a cut at sanders  it s confounding as to why she would make such an esoteric remark  what does she gain with democratic voters by implying that her grandchild is legitimate  while sanders  grandchildren somehow aren t  i mean  how many primary voters know that much about sanders  family  i ve been following sanders  career for ten years now  and i had no idea he was even married until recently much less that he had three step kids and seven step grandchildren  i also didn t know until today that three of his grandkids were adopted from china one blogger  shane ryan  observed that sanders  during his stump speeches  often refers to his grandkids as  extraordinary   i tried to confirm this  but didn t turn up any transcripts or pullquotes to verify it  so  chances are   if true   very  very  very few people know that sanders uses the word  extraordinary  to describe his grandkids  making clinton s jab   if intentional   even more obscure is clinton capable of lashing out when backed into a corner  sure  is it possible she intended to randomly criticize sanders  grandkids via some sort of twisted political calculation  absolutely  but it d be terrible politics  you don t mention families   much less criticize the origins of an opponent s children  the topic is off limits  by doing so  she d only make herself look like terrible human being one thing enemies and fans alike can agree upon  she s smart enough and experienced enough to understand blowback  seriously  what kind of democratic primary voter would  get  her attack and then vote against sanders because his seven grandkids aren t biological  while clinton s grandchild is blood related  it seems like there s more risk than reward in such a gambit so  what do you think  featured image via video screen grab
