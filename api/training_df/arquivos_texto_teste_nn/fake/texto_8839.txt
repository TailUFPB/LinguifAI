last week  republicans in congress decided to once again waste everyone s time and tax dollars trying to repeal the affordable care act  they know that there isn t a snowball s chance in hell that president obama was going to approve any of their attempts to repeal the law  however  they continued the ritual of passing doomed legislation anyway  only to have it vetoed by president obama on friday speaker of the house paul ryan discussed the republicans  atest attempt to repeal the aca on sunday during an interview on face the nation  during the interview  the show s host john dickerson grilled ryan on the party s lack of a viable option to the aca  you said that you wanted the republicans to offer an alternative to the president  one of the first things you did this year  though  was offer that repeal   dickerson reminded ryan   how is than an alternative   dickerson asked  it s not   ryan responded   it s why we have to come up with an alternative  so  you re right about that one  will you   dickerson asked  skeptically  absolutely   ryan stated  earnestly   my goal   i don t know how far it will go given we have a filibuster and a guy named obama who s not going to replace obamacare   but my goal is that  we as republicans  if we don t like these laws  don t like the direction the country is going  i think we have to be more than just an opposition party  it should be noted that during the rest of the  minute interview  ryan names a plethora of problems in the united states  yet doesn t offer anything resembling any actual solutions to those problems  we have to be a proposition party   went on to say   so  if we don t like this  we ve got to show how we would do things differently  and we really think obamacare is failing  whether it s premiums  restricted access  high deductibles  families losing the insurance they wanted to keep  people are hurting and we need to offer a solution  so  yes  on this and many other issues  we need to offer alternatives  and that s exactly what i intend on having us do  which is exactly what every republican has said since the aca became law  they have absolutely nothing to offer the american people to replace the aca with  the only viable place for healthcare to move forward in the united states at this point  is to create a single payer system  and of course  the republican party isn t going to propose that any time too soon you can watch the full interview below featured image credit  screenshot via youtube
