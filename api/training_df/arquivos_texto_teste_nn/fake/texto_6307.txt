knowing that hardworking americans need to be paid fairly if they are putting in extra hours on the job   hours away from their home and family  hours above and beyond what should ever be expected   president obama is now strengthening overtime pay rules in an email from president obama  he stated  we re strengthening our overtime pay rules to make sure millions of americans  hard work is rewarded  if you work more than  hours a week  you should get paid for it or get extra time off to spend with your family and loved ones  it s one of most important steps we re taking to help grow middle class wages and put   billion more dollars in the pockets of hardworking americans over the next  years  adding  this is a step in the right direction to strengthen and secure the middle class by raising americans  wages  when workers have more income  they spend it   often at businesses in their local community   and that helps grow the economy for everyone  according the department of labor  the new rules will do the following basically  making sure people get paid for the hard work they re putting in of course  republicans are already incredibly upset that workers will be paid fairly for being overused  republicans seem to prefer people get overused and underpaid speaker paul ryan  r oh  has now admitted that he s furious with president obama s new rules  claiming  his regulation hurts the very people it alleges to help  who is hurt most  students  nonprofit employees  and people starting a new career  by mandating overtime pay at a much higher salary threshold  many small businesses and nonprofits will be unable to afford skilled workers and be forced to eliminate salaried positions  complete with benefits  altogether  yeah  more money in people s pockets is always harmful to their well being  and making it so employers hire more employees if they want don t want to pay overtime is definitely harmful to economy  you know  because adding jobs and people being satisfied with their jobs  which in turn lowers turnover and increases quality  is a bad thing or not let s be blunt  republicans seem want to make sure employers keep as much money as possible by making sure they re allowed to pay employees as little as possible  they seem to see giving money to top to let in  trickle down  is an investment in the economy  but investing more money in the people  or rather  consumers  who actually drive the economy  is a bad thing republicans have it exactly backwards  and the sooner they realize this the better  what s most ironic  paul ryan is paid an obscene amount to work only mere weeks per year featured photo by win mcnamee getty images
