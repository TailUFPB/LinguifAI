meet rep  robert aderholt  r al   he s a jesus lovin  christian that supports massive military spending while simultaneously opposing feeding hungry children no  seriously  it s too expensive to spend    billion a year to feed  million kids but the   billion a year on war is a ok with him  the administration knows their proposal to expand this program to the tune of   billion over  years is simply not feasible in this budget climate and through the annual appropriations process   aderholt said the summer food benefits program is designed to fill a food gap for children who rely on free  and reduced price school meals for much of their nutrition  after small pilot programs in a handful of states over the past four years  administrators are confident that even a   monthly benefit during the summer months can reduce severe food insecurity among low income children by  percent  a nationwide program would benefit  million children each summer once fully operational  according to white house estimates it gets worse  not only does the program have bipartisan support  aderholt is literally the only person blocking it just to make clear what a total dick move this is  aderholt is staunchly amti abortion and a strong believer in the  sanctity of life   unless  apparently  that life is out of the uterus and needs food  then aderholt is just fine with letting them go hungry  thinkprogress has a comprehensive explanation of why feeding hungry kids now should be society s top priority as well as more of aderholt s hypocrisy here only a republican could single handedly block feeding  million children suffering from food insecurity and still  with a straight face  claim to be  pro life  on the other hand  aderholt has explicitly opposed trimming the bloated military budget to pay for  uncontrolled domestic program spending   so uncontrolled spending on bombs is good but uncontrolled spending on food for the poor is bad republican jesus must be so proud featured image via sodahead
