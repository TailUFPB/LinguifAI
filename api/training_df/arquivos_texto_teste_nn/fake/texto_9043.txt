pastafarianism is a fairly new religion  its adherents are atheistic in belief  and they worship the flying spaghetti monster  the religion took off in   founded by bobby henderson in response to the kansas board of education s decision to allow so called  intelligent design    which is nothing more than biblical creationism in a very transparent disguise   to be taught as a valid point of view in public schools  ever since the religion became popular with non believers everywhere  pastafarians have been fighting for the same rights that every other religion has   including the right to wear religious headgear in driver s license photos  for pastafarians that means wearing colanders in their photos the latest fight in this arena comes from chris avino of georgia  avino was allowed to wear the colander in a temporary driver s license photo  but the decision was reversed for the picture that would be used on his permanent document  officials insist that the state of georgia  does not deem it appropriate to allow customers to be issued identification cards of licenses that portray satirical or offensive points of view   this ruling comes courtesy of angelique mcclendon  an attorney for georgia s georgia department of driver services  mcclendon s decision comes because she says that while headdresses  scarves  and veils can be worn in photos for religious purposes  that a colander is not a veil  scarf or headdress  a colander is a kitchen utensil commonly used for  washing or draining food  mcclendon also went on to condemn pastafarianism altogether  saying that it is  not a religion   but instead philosophy that mocks religion  avino  however  took his cause to twitter  and seems to be considering taking the state through the legal system regarding his religious right to wear his colander  he answered mcclendon s ruling by saying  just because a colander is not traditionally used as a headdress does not mean that it cannot serve that purpose  in fact  it does serve that purpose for the tens of thousands  perhaps even hundreds of thousands  of believers who claim pastafarianism as their religion you may find our beliefs to be strange  but as strange as you may feel they are  they are still our beliefs  some may find it strange that christians believe that jonah spent   days in a whale s belly  according to some texts  some may find it strange that muslims believe that muhammad was carried to the seven heavens on the back of a winged horse  some may find it strange that scientologists believe that xenu  the dictator of the galactic confederacy brought billions of people to earth in a dc  like spacecraft  stacked them around volcanoes  and killed them with hydrogen bombs  maybe you  the reader of this letter  do not personally believe that muhammad flew to heaven on a winged horse  but do you question the validity of islam as a religion  he went on to make the very valid point that it is not up to the state to decide which religions deserved recognition  and that if they recognize one  they must recognize all  our religion exists  it is legitimate  it s claims are no less valid than the claims of other recognized religions  i am in no way breaking the law or breaking any rules by wearing my religion s headdress  a colander  during my driver s license photo  but dds is  dds is infringing on my  amendment right to express my religious beliefs freely within the laws of the united states of america  within the laws of the state of georgia  and within the rules of the dds  the thing is  when you strip away the commonality and acceptance of mainstream religions like christianity and such without question  they are no more valid than pastafarianism  there is not a shred of evidence that any of them are true  therefore  if christians  muslims  jews  hindus  and others get recognition  pastafarianism should as well  chris avino is right  it is not up to the state to decide that his religion deserves no recognition  all religions are equally ridiculous  and i champion his right to wear his colander sue the pants off them  mr  avino  and wear your religious colander with pride featured image via twitter raw story
