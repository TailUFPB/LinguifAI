laurence tribe  who was ted cruz s own constitutional law professor at harvard  visited msnbc s the last word  to discuss cruz s total lack of understanding on  and general contempt for  the constitution of the united states professor tribe said point blank that ted cruz only cares about the constitution when it benefits ted cruz  or if he can use it as a weapon to hurt other americans  otherwise  he could not care less if the constitution says you have a right he doesn t want you to have you really can t argue with professor tribe s assessment of cruz on that  he couldn t be more correct professor tribe spoke briefly to the recent  birther  attacks put forth against cruz by fellow republicans and donald trump  he said that these attacks brought into light the glaringly obvious example of how ted cruz simply chooses to interpret the constitution in any way that is convenient for him at the time  with no regard to the actual law what this does is give us a window into the character of ted cruz  the sort of person he is  with respect to the american constitution  whats intriguing   it was true even when he was my student years ago   he used to believe in  originalism   that is the constitution always means what it meant when it was adopted  except when it s not convenient for him to mean that  this is a perfect example if the constitution always meant what he claims  namely that if you got an american mother it doesn t matter where in the world you re born  you become a natura born citizen at birth  well then  why in the world did congress need to pass a law dealing with naturalization and immigration in   saying  from now on  although it wasn t true before  if you have a mother who s an american citizen  thats good enough  source  msnbctribe s example seems innocent enough  but it speaks to a larger issue where cruz simply doesn t care about constitutional law  remember   we were still torturing people as recently as  years ago  regardless of what the constitution said  professor tribe continued on even further in criticizing him even further  saying the cruz he taught constitutional law to at harvard is nothing like the cruz of today  he implied that it was like the cruz of today never studied constitutional law at all  tribe also touched on some of cruz s other comments  where he said that the supreme court s word has no impact on the law of the land  professor tribe could only describe it as  scary  watch ted cruz s former constitutional law professor completely destroy his presidential qualifications below featured image via video screen capture
