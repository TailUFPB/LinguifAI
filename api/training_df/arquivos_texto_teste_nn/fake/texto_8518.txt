if there s one thing about donald trump that pretty much everyone knows by now  it s that he s never wrong  well  at least according to donald trump  he ll never admit a mistake  he ll double down on controversial statements  and heaven forbid he s asked a question he doesn t want to answer  or even worse  challenged on an answer on live television  the latter is exactly what megyn kelly did in the first gop debate  and oh boy  has that thrown trump into full tantrum mode  especially finding out she ll be moderating the next gop debate to be held on fox news  he literally told cnn s wolf blitzer  i mean  i don t like her  she doesn t treat me fairly  so  in turn  trump is threatening to boycott the next debate because he thinks kelly is a meanie trump even took his sophomoric toddler behavior to twitter and instagram and polled his followers should i do the  gopdebate  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    should i do the  gopdebate a video posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on jan    at   pstall of this led fox news to issue a reply that was absolutely accurate  probably one of the few times they ve said something that is completely true  a network spokesperson said  sooner or later donald trump  even if he s president  is going to have to learn that he doesn t get to pick the journalists   we re very surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by megyn kelly  they basically called trump out for being terrified of megyn kelly  if he s terrified during a debate because he s asked questions he doesn t completely fancy  how is he going to deal with leaders around the globe who would inevitably call him out all the time for the decisions he would make as commander in chief fox also told mediaite is a statement that was pure gold  we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings  fox news had the perfect response to trump s hissy fit over megyn kelly moderating the next debate  if you desire to be leader of the free world  you re going to have to realize people aren t going to kowtow to your every whim  and bullying really isn t an option with diplomatic relations  trump needs to grow the f ck up featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
