for years now  sane minded individuals in congress alongside president obama have tried to enact common sense gun reform  and now  where those in congress have failed to act  the president is doing what he can to tighten up existing gun laws and make sure those who shouldn t have guns don t get them with obama s bold actions to curb the epidemic of gun violence comes very open dissent from several members of congress  they ve chosen to side with insanity and the gun lobby over common sense one member of congress  rep  john fleming  r la  decided to opt so far away from common sense  that he tweeted this regarding president obama s actions  under obama s executive gun control action  your doctor may report you to the fbi  under obama s executive gun control action  your doctor may report you to the fbi  https   t co moeamqdgda  john fleming   repfleming  january     any human being with even the slightest bit of common sense would agree that doctors better damn well be reporting mentally ill patients to the fbi furthermore  the disclosure to the fbi from doctors restricts any form of revealing what a diagnosis would be  so privacy is still protected while safety concerns still reached  starting next month  no legal repercussions can effect the doctors doing their due diligence  the new rule states  the disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for nics purposes  chief executive of the mental health rights advocate mental health america  paul gionfriddo  even stated  that could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it  and they didn t  the administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group  all of this begs the question  who would be against such measures  and clearly rep  fleming raised his hand in enthusiastic agreement that doctors should keep their mouths shut and the mentally ill should have easy access to firearms this goes directly against the nra and right wing aphorism that it s not the gun  it s the person  however  if you re against keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill  then you aren t following through with that logic  and now rep  fleming can forevermore be labeled a dangerous hypocrite thank goodness president obama is in power and is taking action when congress refuses to do their job  it is the job of those who represent us to act in our best interest  however  so many choose to act in the best interest of those lining their pockets with lobbying dollars  and in this case  it s the gun lobby shame on you  rep  fleming featured image via flickr
