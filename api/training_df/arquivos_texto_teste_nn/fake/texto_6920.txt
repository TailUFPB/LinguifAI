donald trump has spent this election demeaning megyn kelly in shockingly sexist ways  after the first republican debate demonstrated that kelly wasn t afraid to call trump on his nonsense  the front runner floated the idea that she was so aggressive because she was menstruating  in the following months  he has repeatedly viciously attacked her   even on her own network for her part  kelly has always tried to take the high road  she has argued that her goal is to move past the feud with trump and get to a place where the two can treat each other like professionals  trump didn t seem to get the memo  as his campaign has picked up  and kelly s dream of watching trump simply flame out dimmed   he s lashed out at her in interviews and on social media   megynkelly  the most overrated anchor at  foxnews  worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll  to  or  pt lead  she said    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    constant barrage has certainly done damage to kelly  for years  she was seen as the rising star of fox news and big things were lined up for her  the fight with trump has undermined a lot of that  trump s fans  many of whom were dogmatic fox news watchers  have taken his side and kelly has become their public enemy number one  the sexism he hurls at her is dished out ten fold by his rabid supporters however  there is one tenet of fox news that is placed above pride  integrity  self respect or logic  ratings  kelly herself admitted to pbs s charlie rose that trump would probably be back on her program at some point despite his low opinion of her because  that will be a big moment  do you think that will be a big television moment  apparently  the moment is now  sources at fox news confirmed today that megyn kelly secretly snuck into trump tower to hold a private meeting with trump and it s easy to guess what the agenda was  she wants him back kelly reached out to trump s office to set up the meeting  one of the sources said the face to face chat raises the possibility of a kelly trump interview sometime in the future kelly is known to be seeking high profile guests for a barbara walters style prime time special on the fox broadcast network in may fox released an official statement that seems to support this fox news chairman   ceo roger ailes has spoken to donald trump a few times over the past three months about appearing on a fox broadcasting special with megyn kelly airing on may   kelly requested a meeting with mr  trump  which took place at trump tower this morning  the results of that meeting will be revealed on tonight s kelly file at  et  kelly has acknowledged in recent interviews that trump is a fascinating person to cover and has electrified the republican base this is a strong about face from just a month ago  when she confided to variety that she s been desperate to get him back on but there was never a moment where he wasn t attacking her  to be honest  every time i prepare an invitation to sit down with him  he attacks me on twitter or elsewhere  i had always been hoping i could reach out to him at a time when he wasn t angry  i don t think it would be a good interview if he was angry at me   but then he never stops with the attacks  as we ve seen repeatedly  fox news has only the thinnest veneer of integrity easily wiped away with profit considerations  trump has been ruthless in going after kelly and other fox hosts who don t openly grovel at his feet  and many of them do   but the network is more than willing to swallow their pride if they need to promote  say  a  barbara walters style prime time special  and would love the ratings trump attracts featured image via craig barritt getty images for cosmopolitan magazine and wme live
