legendary abc news reporter ted koppel has seen a lot of change in the way news is covered during his lifetime   and clearly not all of it is good in a fiery interview with fox news pundit bill o reilly  koppel turned the tables and laid out a scathing indictment on the entire conservative network s way of doing business  it was beautiful to watch o reilly attempted to seek advice from koppel on how best to approach an interview with donald trump  the republican front runner is known for being brash  aggressive and evasive  o reilly put it to his former colleague   not an easy interview  how would you do it  but koppel wasn t having the fake sincerity  o reilly  and his ilk at fox  created this monster  you and i have talked about this general subject many times over the years  it s irrelevant how i would do it  you know who made it irrelevant  you did  you have changed the television landscape over the past  years   you took it from being objective and dull to subjective and entertaining  and in this current climate  it doesn t matter what the interviewer asks him  mr  trump is gonna say whatever he wants to say  as outrageous as it may be  thanks to people like o reilly  who routinely ignore facts to push a right wing agenda  trump can get away with saying anything he wants and the gullible fox audience will eat it up  facts no longer matter because they ve been told for years that the truth has a liberal bias anyway when o reilly ignored the critique  koppel again went for the throat  he suggested fox might try to counter trump  and this might sound crazy to a guy like o reilly   by some reporting  it s an old fashioned concept  but i think demonstrating who and what mr  trump is and what his policies really amount to is something you don t do in an interview  he doesn t answer the questions  letting trump control the interview doesn t work  msnbc tried it with their townhall and it was a complete disaster  trump is a showman  what he lacks in substance he makes up for in empty bravado  instead  koppel told o reilly  try actually exposing the truth for once it s refreshing to see someone so unequivocally call bill o reilly out right to his face  it helps that it comes from a long time veteran of the news business  o reilly had hoped to get some tips from the years of experience under koppel s belt  but wound up getting way more than he bargained for watch the video below via media matters featured image via fox news
