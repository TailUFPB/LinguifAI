there are too many people in our society who find the idea of two people of the same gender kissing  holding hands  and even being in love just too disgusting for words  these would be our bigots the ones who are working feverishly on keeping the lgbtq community down by dehumanizing them  and painting them as an evil in our society these people s hatred led to omar mateen killing  people in the pulse nightclub in orlando  a facebook post  which ends with   you weren t the gunman  but you re the culture that built him  you re the bullets in his gun   is the sheer  naked truth of the situation there are those who are angry about the  politicization  of orlando  if those people would wake up to what s really happening  they d see that it was political from the start why  because we have all of this bigotry coming from our very own lawmakers  pundits  and analysts  who want that bigotry codified in law so they can stay on top of their golden pedestals  we have pastors and other religious leaders who are celebrating what happened in orlando  and they think they haven t contributed to this  here are the faces of some of those people  complete with a simple phrase that adds to the power of the above post furthermore  the lgbtq community has been assaulted over and over  by the same cold blooded fuckery that caused orlando  with gop presidential candidates  opposition to marriage equality  too  i support same sex civil unions but to me  and millions like me  marriage is a religious service not a government form     ben carson i have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman  and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage     ted cruz throughout the millennia and in every religion in the world  marriage has a very specific meaning  marriage is a institution  grounded in spirituality  it is the union of a man and a woman  and from that union comes life  and life is a gift from god     carly fiorina we must resist and reject judicial tyranny  not retreat  this ruling is not about marriage equality  it s about marriage redefinition  this irrational  unconstitutional rejection of the expressed will of the people in over  states will prove to be one of the court s most disastrous decisions  and they have had many     mike huckabee  will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of christians who disagree with this decision  this ruling must not be used as pretext by washington to erode our right to religious liberty     bobby jindal i am disappointed the supreme court today chose to change the centuries old definition of marriage as between one man and one woman  i m a firm believer in traditional marriage  and i also believe the  amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue  i fundamentally disagree with the court rewriting the law and assaulting the  amendment     rick perry we have to reclaim marriage as an institution that s not about two adults or more than two adults  that it s about children  marriage has always been about children     rick santorumand last  and we certainly wish least  donald trump  i would strongly consider  then there s north carolina s bathroom law  and governor pat mccrory  who defended it by saying it was a privacy issue  yes  privacy for everyone except transgender people  one has to wonder if residents of north carolina have to carry their birth certificates with them now there was also florida governor rick scott  who refused to acknowledge orlando as an anti lgbtq hate crime in addition to an act of terrorism  he said florida s lgbtq community can engage in the oh so effective practice of prayer if they want to be safe we had kim davis  who refused to abide by the obergefell decision and who the religious community celebrated for standing up for the right to discriminate  the same is true of alabama chief justice roy moore  they re seen as champions of religious freedom  rather than the purveyors of hate they really are what all of this does is tell ordinary citizens that it s just peachy keen for them to be hateful and evil towards the lgbtq community  it also causes severe self loathing in people who try to subscribe to those beliefs  but are lgbtq and still in the closet  when these things reach the breaking point and explode  they do so violently  as they did in orlando  you re the bullets in his gun   yes  they all were  they don t have to be mateen  or anybody else who commits a hate crime against the lgbtq community  to be responsible for this featured image by gerardo mora getty images
