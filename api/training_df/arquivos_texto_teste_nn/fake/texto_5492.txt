bernie sanders finally endorsed hillary clinton on tuesday with a rousing speech to unite the party  and donald trump exploded in rage on twitter in a series of twitter tantrums  trump attacked sanders by claiming that he is  selling out  by getting behind the democratic nominee  it took six posts before he tired himself out bernie sanders  who has lost most of his leverage  has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton  he will endorse her today   fans angry   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters  they are not happy that he is selling out   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    crookedhillary is not qualified https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro war pro tpp pro wall street crooked hillary clinton   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    to all the bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals   global special interests  we welcome you with open arms  people first   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    course  trump had been hoping that bernie would stay in the race because he wanted to see chaos at the democratic national convention  which would only help him  now he s trying to persuade sanders supporters to join his campaign well  bernie sanders only needed a single tweet to shut trump down big talk from the same guy who was too afraid to debate bernie in california  https   t co   bernie sanders   berniesanders  july     trump had agreed to debate bernie but chickened out on two separate occasions after the vermont senator eagerly accepted trump s condition that money be raised for charity to make the debate happen but just because bernie endorsed hillary that does t mean he sold out  hillary clinton captured the most states and the most delegates  she won  but bernie still is having a major impact on the party  he pulled hillary further to the left and has gotten several of his policy goals written into the democratic platform such as a   minimum wage that s a huge victory that should make sanders  supporters very pleased  jumping to trump s campaign just because sanders isn t the nominee is ridiculous because if trump wins this country will only go backwards and all the progress sanders has fought for will have zero chance of happening  at least with hillary we could expect to see some of his proposals become reality  especially if democrats retake the house and senate featured image  drew angerer getty images
