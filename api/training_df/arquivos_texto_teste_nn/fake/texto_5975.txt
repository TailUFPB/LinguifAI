for almost an entire year donald trump insulted  berated  bastardized and scrutinized everything that wasn t a white  christian male  republicans barely flinched then he makes a comment about a mexican judge s heritage when it pertains to his fraud lawsuit  republicans lose their minds  and rightfully so  it appears that trump s comments about judge gonzalo curiel has hit a special nerve in one state legislator the des moines register has broken the news that david johnson  who has served in the iowa general assembly for  years as a republican  will be leaving the gop over the party s  bigot  nominee  donald j  trump johnson told the register  i will not stand silent if the party of lincoln and the end of slavery buckles under the racial bias of a bigot  the now former republican will be registering as a member of  no party preference   and said he will never support hillary clinton for president  however  johnson has also stated that he is not sure he will caucus with the republicans in the legislature  feeling that members of the gop have become  too timid  to take on trump and his supporters  johnson did say that if a formidable republican steps up to the plate and challenged trump nationally  he may rejoin the party  but said  if mr  trump is the nominee  he becomes the standard bearer for a party that s on the verge of breaking apart  he simply cannot unify the gop  if there is a profound split  i ll gladly rejoin republicans who are dedicated to equality and justice for all  and let trump lead his supporters over the cliff  and that s exactly what mr  trump will do  johnson also knows how this will hurt him politically  but says he doesn t care  citing his record of often going against the republican establishment in the state when it comes to education funding and medicaid program one thing is for sure   we will see many more republicans follow johnson s lead in he coming months featured image via elijah nouvelage getty images
