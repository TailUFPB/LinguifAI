the republican party is an absolute mess and we re starting to reap the benefits while the gop has spent obama s entire presidency attempting to do nothing to help the country  they ve recently taken it so far that they hardly bother to show up at the capitol at all  this is creating some really  really stupid problems it s easy to see why house speaker paul ryan was reluctant to take the job because one of the unenviable tasks he s expected to do is to somehow trick the hundreds of republican lawmakers he leads into actually doing their jobs once in a while  it s not easy recently  an increasingly frustrated ryan even told congress that they needed to make more of an effort to show up on time for legislative votes  the process is supposed to take  minutes  but with lawmakers slowly trickling in when they feel like it  oftentimes it can go on for an eternity   if you re getting the sense that lawmakers are behaving worse than high school students dragging their feet to homeroom  you re not the only one   the lack of urgency means congress hardly gets anything done  members should be reminded  members should attempt to come to the floor within the  minute period as prescribed by the first ring of the bells  all sides of the aisle   ryan said  as a point of courtesy to each of your colleagues  voting within the allotted time would help with the maintenance of the institution  the chair appreciates the members  attention to this matter   he said with a smile apparently  nobody listened  least of all ryan s fellow republicans when it came time for republicans to vote on a measure meant to derail obama s historic nuclear deal with iran  over  lawmakers  mostly republicans  were visibly absent  it appears that voting for a thing they themselves had introduced had slipped their minds  an unhappy ryan slammed down his gavel after  minutes and abruptly ended voting which vacated the tally due to insufficient votes how big of a screw up was this for republicans  the window to truly derail obama s iranian deal closed with ryan s gavel  they blew it  instead  secretary of state john kerry says america will begin upholding its obligations to the deal starting in a matter of days  barring any setbacks from iran  implementation day  which is the day on which iran proves that it has sufficiently downsized its nuclear program and can begin to receive sanctions relief  is going to take place very soon  likely within the next coming days somewhere  in a supreme irony  many republican lawmakers were probably catching up on sleep after spending last night giving breathless interviews disingenuously spreading the lies that iran was holding american navy service members hostage  as usual  their lofty rhetoric doesn t match their actions  if iran was really so dangerous and they cared so much for the troops  would skipping this vital vote really be an option yet another example that the dysfunction in washington stems largely from the republican party  as the right wing movement continues to become swallowed by anti government extremists who were once considered the radical fringe  even doing the jobs you were elected to do   say  pass legislation   can paint you as a  rino   instead  many republican lawmakers try their best to destroy the government from the inside by willfully throwing wrenches into the works  but as we ve seen  this  scorched earth  approach can backfire  during those times when republicans actually do want to accomplish something  they fall apart  we see it here another republican chance to hurt obama goes down in flames by a needless unforced error due to stupidity  apathy  and laziness  what a legacy this congress is building for itself  republicans ought to be so proud feature image via
