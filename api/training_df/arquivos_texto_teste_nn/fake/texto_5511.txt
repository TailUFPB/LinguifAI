in constructing the  republican platform  delegates seem to be running a contest over who can come up with the silliest  dumbest  most outrageous planks imaginable  this latest one  which was just presented  is probably the most egregious example of the gop s love of limited government everywhere except in people s private lives  because morals mary forrester  who is not surprisingly a delegate from north carolina  introduced an amendment to rein in use of adult material in a subcommittee meeting on healthcare  education and crime  she said  pornography  with his  harmful effects  especially on children  has become a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions  we encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children s safety and wellbeing  really a public health crisis because adult material is totally on the same level as gun violence and superbugs the stupid it burns before this  we must legislate everyone s morality  amendment was presented  that particular plank in the gop s platform was more or less limited to trying to ensure that the internet didn t become a safe haven for sex offenders  they encouraged vigorous prosecution for sex offenders also  which makes sense forrester  though  is a member of the religious right  which means deciding what people can and cannot do in their private lives and crying out   but really  it s for the children   which is absolute horseshit  she s also one of the many delegates working their asses off to alienate everyone who isn t christian and straight by condemning every form of relationship that isn t male female she and the christian group  concerned women for america  believe that the widespread availability and use of adult material is just too addicting for young people  and therefore  it s up to the state governments to curb it  it s such an insidious epidemic and there are no rules for our children   forrester said   it seems to be for young people  they do not have the discernment and so they become addicted before they have the maturity to understand the consequences   yes  by all means  let s put prohibition in place for anything to do with sex  too  because it always works  that s why we have no more alcohol or drugs anywhere at all in this country oh wait of course  the gop is pretty much under the full control of the religious right  which is packed with pseudo christians who think it s their god given duty to tell everyone  everywhere  how to live every aspect of their lives  they do it under the guise of   it s for the public good   like they are with bathroom laws  but really  they just want everyone to stop with the stuff that makes them feel all icky  featured image by win mcnamee getty images
