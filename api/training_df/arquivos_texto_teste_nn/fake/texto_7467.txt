tuesday night was a very big night for democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton  the former secretary of state had a clean sweep of wins across all five states that held primaries  these wins will help push her forward towards her path of securing the democratic nomination for president however  where there is the glory of being declared the victor  there will always be someone there to tear you down  and not just in a way coming from the opposition  but rather in weird unexpected ways  such as  being told one is not celebrating properly  which is exactly what msnbc morning joe host joe scarborough did to hillary tuesday night apparently  according to scarborough  hillaryclinton wasn t gleeful enough to his liking  and wasn t presenting herself in a way that he thought she should be on her victorious evening  if you watched hillary s speech  she was  in fact very happy and gleeful  but apparently scarborough thought differently  so  he told her to  smile  smile  you just had a big night   primaryday  joe scarborough   joenbc  march    hillary never smiled for the rest of her life  guess what  that s perfectly fine  scarborough has no right to tell a woman she needs to smile just because he thinks she should telling a woman to smile is ridiculously sexist  if you can t grasp that it is  that likely says more about you than it does about anyone else  women shouldn t be required to smile at the drop of a hat just because someone thinks they should  if it s not required of men  why should it be of women  not to mention the fact that it is so annoying  women  and i speak for myself as someone who has been told to smile regularly  are  quite frankly  tired of it however  leave it to samantha bee to let him know that it s perfectly okay for a woman not to smile all the frickin  time   joenbc pic twitter com   full frontal   fullfrontalsamb  march    is also how women should look at joe scarborough from now on featured image via instagram
