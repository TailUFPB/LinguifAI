a  year old cameroonian immigrant man was barely surviving on la s infamous skid row when he was brutally gunned down by cops last year  despite the victim being unarmed and vulnerable  the la police commission has ruled this killing  justified   coming as it does  among a string of such killings  it seems it is now legal for la cops to shoot unarmed  homeless people with impunity last march  charly keunang died after being shot six times by the lapd  officers claimed he was reaching for one of their guns  but a bystander video undermines this story  the la police commission refuses to release their body cam footage of the shooting  and the ruling seals the footage from public view permanently as can be seen in the bystander footage  several cops charge into keunangs tent while he is sleeping and begin swinging at him  he was known to be in a poor state of mental health  and it is little surprise at all that such a traumatic incident would have terrified him and provoked a fight or flight response  how might you react if you awoke with several men in your face who were hitting and dragging you  the cops then  reacted  to a crisis of their own creation members of the man s family are now suing the la for   million one would hope that a case like the horrific death of charly keunang would be unique  however  it is all too commonplace in la  in september of the very same year   year old mentally ill homeless woman norma  angie  guzman was gunned down by the lapd too  again  a mental health crisis was turned into target practice session by the lapd and it s not just la  over in albuquerque  new mexico  city police shot and killed  year old homeless man james boyd for the crime of camping in an unauthorized area of local foothills in the same month  a cop in miami shot and killed a homeless man in a public park  the man was well known and liked by regulars of the park  and a maintenance worker at the park found it almost impossible to believe the officers account  he stated that the deceased man was a regular feature in the park with a routine  to sit down and go to the library and use the computer  read the newspaper  that s his thing every morning and wait for me to open up the door   he said   man  for that to happen to a guy like that  no i don t understand that  this really is where the issues of under investment in public services  and police brutality combine to create a perfect storm  millions of dollars has been stripped form la s homeless services budgets in the last five years  while homelessness has risen  percent in just the last two years  at the same time  mental health support services have also been cut  this means more people are on the streets  with less support  and when a crisis occurs  the police are getting called instead of mental health professionals so while this is a problem for the police  it is also a matter for legislators and voters  if we want our streets to be safe  it serves us all to invest in the proper treatment and support of vulnerable people  while police and some civilians may perceive a homeless or mentally ill person as the threat  they are far more likely to become a victim of violence than to commit violence  either from ruthless policing  or unscrupulous passersby  featured image via screengrab
