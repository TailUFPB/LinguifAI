donald trump s hopes and dreams of building a  big  beautiful wall  along our southern border sound great to the  poorly educated  people he credits with his success  but  unfortunately for them  reality is a thing  in an interview with jorge ramos on thursday  former mexican president vicente fox made it very clear that the donald would not be building any wall with mexico s money  no matter how many promises he makes to the methamphetamine fueled  mindless droves of subhuman  unwashed vermin who back him recently  the trump campaign touted his  support  among hispanics in nevada  failing to mention that the   percent  of hispanics he attracted only included gop voters   in other words  a group of people science says is lacking in the  smarts  department   since there were only  people who identified as latino in the state  and the exit poll had a margin of error of   because of the tiny sample size  the reality is that a meaningless number of hispanic people actually support trump  i d like to know who those hispanics are   fox said of trump s inflated number  urging even those individuals to  open their eyes   please  you hispanics  latinos in the u s   open your eyes  it s not to defend our race  not to defend our creed  it s to defend this very same nation that is hosting you  this nation is going to fail if it goes into the hands of a crazy guy  as for the wall  fox made it very clear that he nor anyone from mexico will be paying for trump s signature policy symbol fox is not the first former mexican leader to speak out against trump s hatred  earlier this month  former president felipe calderon told trump where to stick it  we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall  and it s going to be completely useless  no offense  no offense to america  so donald trump   is ambitious but not exactly very well informed man  i don t want to say ignorant  but he is not very well informed  naturally  after having a second leader from our neighbor to the south inform him that his  make mexico pay for the wall  idea isn t going to pan out  trump is a little angry  taking to twitter  the donald demanded that fox apologize for hurting his wall s feelings fmr pres of mexico  vicente fox horribly used the f word when discussing the wall  he must apologize  if i did that there would be a uproar   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    s pretty clear that trump isn t going to get to build his wall   at least not with mexico  money  it s up to the rest of us to ensure that he doesn t find himself in a position that it becomes a serious possibility watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
