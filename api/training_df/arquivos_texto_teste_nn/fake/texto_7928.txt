attacking women s health is not a  moderate  position so  it s pretty easy to call bullshit on ohio governor john kasich s insistence that he is the only moderate republican left in the gop field on sunday  kasich signed a bill stripping planned parenthood of millions of dollars for performing what republicans call  nontherapeutic  abortions which are defined as any abortion that isn t in the case of rape  incest  or saving the life of the mother in other words  kasich and his conservative supporters in the state legislature are telling planned parenthood that if they want to continue being funded  they must deny women their constitutional right to obtain an abortion unless they meet one of the three criteria listed above the problem with this conservative logic is that only  percent of services planned parenthood provides are abortion related  plus  state and federal funding is not used by planned parenthood to pay for abortion what state and federal funds are used for  however  are crucial medical services that women will no longer have access to because republicans don t care about collateral damage in their war on a woman s right to choose according to huffington post  planned parenthood is about to lose    million that would have been spent on  hiv testing  cancer screenings and programs that help prevent domestic violence and infant mortality  this isn t even the first time kasich has attacked women s health since becoming governor he has also signed bills banning abortion after  weeks of pregnancy  banning public hospitals from accepting transfer patients from clinics  and stripping rape crisis centers from funding if they refer patients to an abortion provider as for the current bill kasich signed  planned parenthood president cecile richards denounced it and the man who signed it  john kasich is proudly eliminating care for expectant mothers and newborns  he is leaving thousands without vital std and hiv testing  slashing a program to fight domestic violence  and cutting access to essential  basic health care  it s clear kasich has no regard for women s health or lives  and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of ohioans who rely on planned parenthood  and kasich signed this bill  now one of the most extreme anti women laws in the nation  as he parades across the country trying to convince everyone  especially women  that he is a  moderate  republican deserving of their support in his bid to become president of the united states  a position he would absolutely use to ban abortion entirely and eliminate planned parenthood kasich is not a moderate  he s just another conservative extremist like ted cruz featured image from flickr
