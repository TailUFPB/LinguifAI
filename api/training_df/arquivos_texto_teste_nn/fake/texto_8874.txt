as you re probably aware already  donald trump released an instagram video this past week in which he attacks bill clinton s embattled sex life while tarring hillary clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to bill insane it only gets more insane when the video shows hillary and bill flanked by another bill   bill cosby on thursday night s edition of the o reilly factor  yet another bill   bill o reilly   along with former white house press secretary dana perino  reviewed the video  at the tail end of the segment  o reilly said something that ought to shock everyone o reilly said to perino   y making hillary clinton the focus  and this ad that we re going to show you features cosby  monica lewinsky   o reilly continued   you know  i don t know if hitler made it  but you know  he might have  it s crazy  so  yes  bill o reilly just compared donald trump to hitler  frankly  i don t quite know how to feel about this  on one had  o reilly violated godwin s law by invoking hitler during a political discussion on the other hand  o reilly isn t totally wrong  obviously  there s only one hitler  and i ve resisted the urge to go there  but the ad is classic propaganda  the likes of which the nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign  maybe the compromise is joseph goebbels  hitler s minister of propaganda  but we re still in godwin s territory then again  if a prominent conservative wants to give the democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial  i m all for it  if the democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads  and perhaps sent a letter to o reilly  thanking him for the easy win  they re insane  this ought to play in pro hillary or pro bernie ads from now until november  thanks  o reilly via media matters  featured image via twitter
