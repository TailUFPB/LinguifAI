listening to several of the republican candidates for president  one could wonder if they ve been in a cryogenic sleep for the past seven years  and they re still talking about how badly george w  bush screwed things up  however  no  they keep repeating the lie that the nation is so much worse now than it was at the brink of a recession before president obama took over  republican voters should honestly be insulted by this  being treated like idiots absent from reality  although  maybe they are idiots absent to reality  and these republican candidates are just being opportunistic repeating this lie of  seven disastrous years  of obama  marco rubio took to the media branch of the gop  fox news  to give a quick campaign message and offer his well wishes for the new year  hi  this is marco rubio  a senator from florida  and a candidate for president of the united states  as we leave  behind and look forward to   with the elections that are coming up in november  this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn america around  after seven disastrous years of the current president  we have a chance to reclaim the american dream  and that s why i m running for president  and my resolution for  is to do everything i can to not just restore the american dream  but to expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before  so that this  the greatest country in the world  can be greater than it s ever been  so  what america does rubio want to go back to  exactly  one where people are losing their homes  one where jobs are lost at a rate of   per month  one where people could be denied healthcare for a preexisting condition  one where the  amendment is ignored and marriage equality doesn t exist  one where osama bin laden is still alive  one where credit card companies can still screw customers over left and right honestly  what does rubio want to do to  turn america around   because it sure as hell looks as though we are headed in the right direction  and if anything could stand a candidate to continue obama s progress and advance it further rubio apparently wants an america where wall street runs the show  people die or go bankrupt from lack of health coverage  and americans aren t treated equally under the law  so  if that s the america rubio wants   thanks  but no thanks    marcorubio   this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn america around     https   t co   fox news   foxnews  january    video featured image  twitter
