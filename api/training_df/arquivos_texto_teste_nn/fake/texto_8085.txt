we often hear about the  liberal media s  attempts to swing everything to the left  this myth of media bias is often repeated on fox news  on right wing blogs  and basically anywhere conservatives gather  the  liberal media   according to them  seeks to destroy everything good and pure   like the right to discriminate against  the gays  and  the blacks   and impose a christofascist theocracy on our nation  according to legend  the most  liberal  of the  hour news networks is msnbc unfortunately  even msnbc seems to be shifting to the right lately  on monday  the news network deleted a clip that was unfavorable to  of all people  ted cruz the clip in question was from sunday s edition of meet the press  and featured host chuck todd expressing nothing short of disgust as cruz spoke  in the clip  as cruz compares recently deceased hatemonger and supreme court justice  antonin scalia  to ronald reagan  todd can be heard  almost imperceptibly  muttering  oh god  as cruz makes the comparison cruz  and  chuck  just as ronald reagan was to the presidency  so antonin scalia was to the supreme court  he had that big an impact todd  oh god cruz  and i think his passing yesterday really underscores the stakes of this election after reports began to circulate  msnbc could  have   being the  liberal media  and all   published a statement explaining that  yes  todd was a bit astonished by the stupidity of cruz s statement  even considering how terrible reagan was  let s face it  scalia was much  much worse   instead  they pulled the clip  the only reason  the only reason this would have happened would be to protect cruz from embarrassment  this is the clip  with audio enhanced to make the phrase clear according to mediaite   msnbc has re aired the clip  and only now  they have scrubbed todd s aside from the conversation   the new clip does  indeed  seem to be missing the words  oh  god  this revisionism  sadly  paints msnbc in a bad light  as a news organization  they have a responsibility to report the truth  in this case  they removed audio from a report in order to save themselves some trouble the right loves to paint msnbc as dishonest  in this case  they were tell msnbc it is not ok to dishonestly edit their reports by clicking this link  the last thing we need is another fox news watch the new clip below featured image via screengrab
