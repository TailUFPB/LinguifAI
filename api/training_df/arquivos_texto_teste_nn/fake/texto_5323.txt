if sane americans have done one stupid thing over the last year  it s not take donald trump seriously  unfortunately  there s a lot of discontent among the right toward the changing face of the united states and on the left  there s discontent over the fact that the united states isn t changing fast enough  and that discontentment could easily land donald trump in the white house  according to fivethirtyeight s statistical guru  nate silver while the polls are in a virtual tie  a breakdown of electoral college votes paints a much bleaker picture  according to silver  trump is ahead of clinton by a whopping  points silver s  now cast   updated with fresh surveys on monday  shows trump s current likelihood of winning at   percent  compared with clinton s   percent  in the  battleground states  colorado  virginia and michigan would go to clinton  while florida  nevada  new hampshire  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  wisconsin and iowa would go to trump the breakdown shifts a bit between the electoral college and the popular vote  silver s model currently predicts the popular vote going   percent to trump vs    percent to clinton  but the electoral college giving trump a wider margin of victory   votes and clinton   source  politicothis warning alone should be enough to wake up some who are on the fence and some bernie sanders supporters  but not all is lost  silver notes that polling during conventions is notoriously inaccurate on the one hand  the conventions are not a particularly good time to sweat every tick in the polls  instead  they tend to be one of the less accurate times for polling  historically  it s unusual for candidates not to at least pull into a rough tie after their party convention   john mccain and sarah palin did so in   for example  and even walter mondale led a couple of polls in   but those bounces do not always turn out to be predictive silver has another hand  though  and he s saying that clinton has had a very bad july  she could get a convention bump this week  but with wikileaks  email dump and sanders supporters protesting every single speaker  it s doubtful  in other words  be afraid  but vote and drive people to the polls if necessary featured image via slaven vlasic at getty images
