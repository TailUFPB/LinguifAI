earlier today  hillary clinton weighed in on the horrific  tragic shootings of two black men in louisiana and minnesota as well as several police officers in dallas  texas  all which happened within the last few days  what the former secretary of state had to say is something we all need to hear in an interview with cnn  wolf blitzer brought up a comment made by the governor of minnesota  in which he said that police brutality victim philando castile would still be alive if he d been white  blitzer asked clinton if she agreed  and why she thinks she could be a more unifying presidential candidate and heal race relations better than rival donald trump  the answer to that question was obvious  but her response was nothing short of powerful acknowledging white privilege and the fact that racism is still very much alive in america today  clinton promised that she will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes  of black families who fear every time their children go somewhere  who have to have the talk about how to really protect themselves when they re the ones who should be expecting protection from encounters with the police   she also said that white people should start listening to legitimate cries  of the black community  she said  too many african americans have been killed in encounters with police over matters that should not have led to that action being taken  clinton also said that the recent shootings should worry every single american  and vowed to continue working for change so that no more innocent black lives are lost  this is the kind of call to action  and as president  i would implement the very comprehensive set of proposals that i ve been making for more than a year  we must do more to have national guidelines about the use of force by police  especially deadly force  you can listen to clinton s powerful statement below this is how you call out white privilege  police brutality  racially motivated violence and show your support for the black lives matter movement  donald trump  on the other hand  had something far more disappointing to say   as expected featured image via flickr
