it is now clear why donald trump attacked the judge in the case overseeing lawsuits against his now defunct trump university the judge ordered the company s internal sales documents to be released over trump s objections  and what they have exposed is a business that preyed on people s dreams of wealth and success   based on trump s own image cultivated over the decades  using trick language and sales gimmicks right out of the sleaziest  boiler room  the  playbooks  for the now defunct business owned by donald trump  the presumptive republican nominee for president  were unsealed tuesday in a class action lawsuit by customers who say they were defrauded  last friday  a judge who has earned trump s scorn sided with attorneys for the washington post who argued that the public had a right to know what was previously confidential the documents outline how employees should guide customers through  the roller coaster of emotions  once they have expressed interest  the motivation that they experienced can die quickly as the realities of their daily lives take over  it is our job to rekindle that motivation   to make them once again see the potential of achieving their dream   according to a  sales playbook  the documents show how  rather than a real estate sales course  the trump university system was designed to push people to pay for ever increasing levels which they were told would lead to more and more lucrative business  in fact  as the lawsuits show  many were very unsatisfied with the experience  even more damning is the fact that the business doesn t even exist anymore  but is just another scheme that trump slapped his name on in order to make a quick buck then ran away when it got complicated trump was apparently so concerned about the information in the sales documents coming out that he rescheduled the press conference he had to address his failure to give money to veterans groups to the same day the trump university documents came out featured image via flickr
