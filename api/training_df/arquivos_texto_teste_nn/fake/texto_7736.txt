ben carson is setting all three of his supporters up for disappointment  in a statement wednesday  the retired neurosurgeon announced that  in light of his crushing defeat on super tuesday  he will likely no longer continue the charade that can loosely be called his presidential campaign carson announced that he will be skipping the fox news presidential debate in his hometown of detroit on thursday   i remain deeply committed to my home nation  america   cason s statement says   i do not see a political path forward in light of last evening s super tuesday primary results  carson promised that  this grassroots movement of  we the people  will continue  i appreciate the support  financial and otherwise  from all corners of america   carson added    gratefully  my campaign decisions are not constrained by finances  rather by what is in the best interests of the american people  carson s attempt to  become the man to lose to the democratic nominee started out promising  but carson s campaign took a series of wrong turns that thrust him as far into political obscurity as carly fiorina after the center for medical progress   baby parts  videos were shown to be heavily edited and fraudulent carson s wild tales   like his claim that he once tried to gut a motherf cker only to be thwarted by a rogue belt buckle and that he attacked his mother with a hammer   his story about bravely telling an armed robber to shoot a popeye s chicken cashier  as well as his wild theory that biblical storybook character joseph built the pyramids to store grain  did him absolutely no favors  nor did his complaint that obama isn t black enough  his campaign also suffered from numerous shakeups  like much of his staff abandoning the sinking ship that was team carson all at once while he was reluctant to give up  carson seems to have finally come to his senses  now  perhaps  he will have time to travel to egypt with his buddy jesus so they can have their portrait painted inside a grain pyramid he promises to discuss more about his future plans at cpac  the annual gathering of christofascist lunatics like carson as the stupid part of america s options narrow  one thing remains certain   it is more important than ever that you make it to the polls in november here are some of the dumbest things carson has said  his intelligence and wit shall be missed featured image via twitter
