on sunday  donald trump called for his republican presidential primary rival  john kasich  to drop out of the race  he s taking my votes   trump said  well  trump  that s not how any of this democracy thing we have works but okay trump lamented the fact that kasich has not dropped out of the race  claiming that kasich is  taking  more votes away from  referring to himself in the third person   trump  than cruz  all he s doing is just  he goes from place to place and loses  and he keeps running  well  why doesn t marco rubio do that  why doesn t jeb bush do that  why didn t all of them do that  now if he wants to go and have his name put in nomination in the convention  he can do that  he doesn t have to run and take my votes  now  not to second guess trump s clearly well researched analysis  i highly doubt that people who plan on voting for kasich are going to flock to trump over cruz  or even that they would even bother voting for either of the two candidates  kasich  while not nearly as moderate as he would like people to think he is  is the choice candidate for those republican voters who want the gop to retain some shred of dignity while kasich is far behind in the primary race  his continued run does pose a threat to trump s campaign  the rnc s only hope at this point to prevent a trump nomination is a contested convention  even if trump receives the most amount of delegates  if he does not receive a majority of delegates  republicans can deny him a nomination every delegate that cruz and kasich soak up puts trump further away from having a majority of delegates you can watch trump cry about kasich s campaign below featured image from  photo by scott olson getty images
