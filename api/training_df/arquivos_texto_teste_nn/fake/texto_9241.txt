in a last minute attempt to create a legacy for himself  obama traveled to cuba to hang out with raul castro and prove to americans how easy it is to form relations with brutal dictators of oppressive regimes   unfortunately for barack obama  it was not his finest moment  and his attempt to normalize relations with cuba didn t work out so well for members of our us embassy  who have now been diagnosed with  brain abnormalities   after experiencing some sort of attack that many experts suspect was inflicted with a sonic weapon   the left rejoiced when president barack obama decided to normalize relations with the cuban regime  reopened our embassy  and allowed travel to the island but most of that has come to a screeching halt after mysterious attacks on our diplomats  which have caused serious health problems  the state department has decided to recall all non essential personnel from the embassy and urged americans not to travel to cuba   legal insurrectionthe leftist boston globe publication gushed over barack obama s historic visit to cuba when president obama travels to cuba on sunday with his family  he is making a vital foreign policy statement  and not just about the small island off the tip of florida  the bigger principle at play is the value of diplomatic engagement over isolation  cooperation versus cold war thinking  the visit   the first time a sitting american president has been to cuba in almost  years   is a manifestation of the hope that democratic ideals can spread over time once normalized relations are established obama will not only be meeting with president raul castro  but also with middle class cubans  entrepreneurs  and political dissidents  a symbolic yet reassuring move on behalf of democracy and fairness  already the opening of relations is bearing fruit  with new businesses sprouting and a flourishing tourism industry taking root legal insurrection   the attacks on american officials at the u s  embassy in havana  cuba  keeps getting stranger and stranger  the latest information revealed that doctors have found brain abnormalities in the victims  from the associated press it s the most specific finding to date about physical damage  showing that whatever it was that harmed the americans  it led to perceptible changes in their brains  the finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved medical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate  several u s  officials said  describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks  white matter acts like information highways between brain cells some of the victims woke up in the middle of the night and heard  disembodied chirping in the room  or a strange  low hum  or the sound of scraping metal   others described how  they felt a phantom flutter of air pass by as they listened   there are some victims that did not notice anything but the victims felt the effects of these noises or non noises  hours later  these symptoms included nausea  loss of hearing or sight  headaches  vertigo  and dizziness  symptoms appeared to have gone away once the victims came back to america  at first officials and doctors believed a sonic weapon caused the issues  now they don t know the officials did not say if the doctors found these changes in all of the victims  elisa konofagou  a columbia university biomedical engineering professor  told the ap that  acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain s white matter tracts  and she  would be very surprised  if that is the cause of the abnormalities from the washington post  physicians are treating the symptoms like a new  never seen before illness   the ap wrote  and expect to monitor the victims for the rest of their lives  although most have fully recovered from their symptoms by now the physicians are working with fbi agents and intelligence agencies as they look for a source  and u s  officials have not backed down from their accusations against the cuban government  which denies any involvement despite a history of animosity between the two countries in october  experts provided the mysterious noise to the ap  it s high pitched  almost like nails on a chalkboard  they do not know what kind of mechanism produced this sound or who developed it  those who heard a sound heard the same thing yet the ap has reviewed several recordings from havana taken under different circumstances  and all have variations of the same high pitched sound  individuals who have heard the noise in havana confirm the recordings are generally consistent with what they heard  that s the sound   one of them said as the number of affected have risen  the state department had no choice but to take action to protect our people  secretary of state rex tillerson decided in late september to bring home all non essential personnel from the u s  embassy in havana  thus cutting the staff by   and halt citizen travel to the island a few days later  tillerson decided to expel  diplomats from the cuban embassy in washington  d c instead of a legacy of a great man who built much needed bridges with legitimate foreign nations  barack hussein obama  the community organizer turned president  is left with the legacy of creating the most divided united states of america since the civil war
