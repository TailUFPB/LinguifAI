it s almost pathetic how quickly and easily our frenemies on the right jump to hanging people whenever they don t like them  recently  a west virginia lawmaker made national headlines when he said the former first lady hung on the mall in washington  d c  michael folk  who also worked as a pilot for united airlines  was suspended indefinitely after his words circulated and his employer was notified  but this sort of thinking  this violent desire to kill one s political enemies  is almost the norm in the gop not only do we hear chants calling for clinton s arrest and execution at gop rallies  and even at the convention   but this sort of ugliness rears its head even in local politics  an ohio lawmaker is under fire after he called for clinton s execution   not because she has actually committed a crime   but just because he wants her dead licking county commissioner duane flowers  r epugnant   stood in a meeting of the board of commissioners and shared his thoughts clinton tuesday  disgusted that the nation criticized melania trump for blatantly stealing part of michelle obama s  democratic national convention speech  flowers said that people should be focusing on hanging hillary  during the meeting  he blurted out later in the day  after the criticism began to mount  he sad he regretted the remarks he made while  emotional  i got caught up in an emotional moment   flowers said   she just totally makes my mind want to pop out of my ears  i really can t believe she s running for president  i m convinced  years ago  she d been locked up for life  i truly believe she has become above the law   he added   that s how far our system has fallen  clinton  of course  has committed no crimes and the ones of which republicans say she is guilty would not carry the death penalty  most of them  anyway   unfortunately  flowers seems to be a victim of right wing media s incessant insistence that clinton is a murderer and many other things she is not  as a republican  flowers has no choice given his mindset but to decide she should be dead fellow republican and president of the board  commissioner tim bubb  jumped in to defend flowers after the remarks went public  saying that his buddy shouldn t be judged for publicly calling for the death of a high profile political figure  i think he was on a rant and kind of venting   bubb said   he sometimes wears his emotions on his sleeve  i hope you don t characterize it as that s all he is  there s a lot more to him than that  he s a good county commissioner   besides  he didn t mean for the public to find out about what he d said  bubb explains  i don t think duane meant it to be a statement on the record  we re fairly conversational  but it is a public session  we re not necessarily making statements for the greater world  technically  we re in public session  and i guess anything you say is a public comment  people get caught up in this  r  versus  d  and blue versus red  and we should probably try to avoid that in public session and on the record   bubb said   every public official has to decide what they want to say  unfortunately  contrary to these assertions  this sort of thing is normal for republicans and the remarks are typically meant for the world to hear  they use statements like this to energize their rage fueled base  to bring in votes  to keep the divide between americans going as much as possible  because the reality is that they depend on this sort of thing to get elected  it s simply what works with their base   and  unfortunately  the very people who want to murder someone when they get  emotional  are the ones who want to remove restrictions on gun sales think about that featured image via licking county official website getty images  ethan miller
