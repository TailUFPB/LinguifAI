during a segment of triumph s summer election special  donald trump supporters got trolled hard  a group of trump supporters volunteered to be a part of a focus group  as far as the trump supporters know  they have been selected to watch and review potential trump campaign video advertisements what they don t know is that the campaign ads they are watching are entirely fictional  the point of the prank is to test the supporter s loyalty to their chosen candidate   we decided to assemble a group of them for an unfiltered view at how they connect with trump s vision for america   as triumph the insult comedy dog puts it the phony ads they watch are rather extreme bizarre even  during the ad  a trump impersonator says that they will build a giant electrified fence as a temporary way to keep  any illegals  out while they construct the real wall that trump has promised to build if he is elected president the people in the focus group also watch an ad where trump calls out hillary clinton  demanding that she reveal to the world that she is a man pretending to be a woman another ad features trump s solution to helping women feel more secure in bathrooms  rather than banning transgender individuals from using the restroom  trump will provide every woman who uses a public bathroom with a firearm spoiler alert  the trump supporters totally fall for the gag  believing they are real  now  it is important to keep in mind that research has shown that people tend to offer opinions about subjects that are ridiculous  however  given just how extreme the advertisements are  it s still rather pathetic   not to mention hilarious you can watch the video in full  below featured image from video screenshot
