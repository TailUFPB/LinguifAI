this is a huge condemnation of the republican party ever since donald trump kicked off his campaign for the presidency  republicans have cowered before him endorsing him one by one even after saying that they disagree with him and despise the divisive and hateful rhetoric he spews but former george w  bush speechwriter michael gerson put his writing skills to use on thursday to pen an epic rebuke of donald trump and the republicans who support him  trump pretty much represents the negation of everything i ve argued about politics and ideology for the last  years   gerson wrote on facebook what he is attacking is not just  the establishment   he is attacking a way of doing politics based on persuasion  consensus  compassion and inclusion  those who argue that conservatism is fundamentally at odds with these values know nothing of conservatism  but trump represents the confirmation of the worse conservative and republican caricatures   a belief that cultural and religious minorities are threats  a belief that america should abandon its deepest values in the conduct of global affairs  a belief that the values and institutions of our government have failed  and that the times require a strong hand gerson continued ripping trump for wanting to tear down what makes america great at its best  and  god knows  it has not always been at its best  america shows a welcoming spirit  an example of how a great nation can be united by ideals instead of bloodlines  a place  as george washington said  where  there shall be none to make him afraid   we should love american traditions and institutions enough to repair them  not hand them over to an authoritarian wannabe  who is too ignorant to even understand the inheritance he is casting away and then he really let trump have it trump s magical policy thinking  setting goals with no serious thought of how they might be achieved  his menacing encouragement of political violence  his disdain for ethnic and religious minorities  which has unleashed and emboldened racists and anti semites of every sort  his penchant for conspiracy theories  including a very dangerous vaccine denialism  his promises to conduct the war on terrorism by ordering war crimes  which would set up a constitutional crisis when the us military honorably refuses  his cynical manipulation of gullible religious leaders with tactics that border on blasphemy  his casual use of lies  which he defends even when exposed gerson then turned his focus toward the gop and slammed them for supporting trump even though he represents the destruction of all the progress america had made since gaining independence from great britain and damned them to regret it for all of time how does any of this return lost greatness to our nation  sometimes i want to shake people  intellectually not physically  who favor political  disruption  and ask  disruption in favor of what  look at what you are doing  look at what you have done  the republican party is now firmly harnessed to the wild  uncontrollable horses of fear and exclusion  it has already sustained damage with latino voters that may take a generation to undo  and now many republicans will find rationalizations to support trump  that is natural   the reality of politics in every time  many people simply go with the winner  but this isn t a normal time  i believe that the decision to support trump  like an embarrassing tattoo  will follow them the rest of their lives  republicans are not merely making a choice  they are looking into the abyss here s the full post via facebook         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt i feel bad  on one hand  to be so focused on  some would say  obsessed by  the trump phenomenon  and it is my intention posted by michael j  gerson on thursday  march    ended his post by leaving a link to an op ed he wrote for the washington post in which he says republicans are staining themselves by supporting trump and that perhaps one of the only honorable option left to save themselves from being forever remembered as the party that destroyed america is to vote for hillary clinton seriously  republicans  listen to michael gerson  his advice may just save your party from killing itself featured image  cagle
