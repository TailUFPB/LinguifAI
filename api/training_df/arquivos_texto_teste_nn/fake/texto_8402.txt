hecklers at gop rallies rarely disappoint   after all  the republican presidential candidates have given them so much material to be inspired by  on sunday  at one of his last rallies before the iowa caucus  ted cruz had an experience with a heckler he probably won t ever forget as cruz gave his stump speech  an audience member shouted that he didn t feel so well while pretending to vomit in a trash can  stating that his illness was because  ted cruz looks so weird   this brave heckler wasn t far from cruz and he repeated it loud and clear just in case the candidate missed it the first time  scott bauer  a reporter for the associated press  fortunately captured part of this hilarious interruption on video and tweeted it for all to see   tedcruz enters des moines rally pic twitter com   scott bauer   sbauerap  february    course  security removed the heckler out of the rally almost immediately and cruz said   i guess the bars let out early   on social media  some people in the audience expressed sadness that the heckler was taken away  as the rally certainly could have used him twittercruz then used the moment to take a jab at one of his rivals and joked  is that donald trump yelling in the back   the joke was completely appropriate  considering that trump and cruz are competing with each other for the iowa caucuses later tonight it was actually reported by the associated press that the heckler was in fact ill   so perhaps it was really cruz s creepy appearance that set the protester off  it would make perfect sense  considering the unpleasant  cringeworthy effect that cruz s face had on his own daughter  to top off cruz s disastrous  rejection filled weekend  his tour bus got stuck in the mud in iowa and he had to hitch a ride with his aides we ve seen some pretty creative hecklers during the gop candidate s campaigns so far  and cruz has had more than his fair share  earlier this month  two hecklers actually made it onto cruz s stage at a gun event  making for a completely awkward moment  but he s not the only one   recently  front runner donald trump got treated to tomatoes being thrown at him  featured image via gage skidmore
