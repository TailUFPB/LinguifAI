liberal fox news host  geraldo rivera  took to twitter to express his disgust over the hypocritical left and their selective outrage over sex harassment allegations based on the political party of the accused geraldo rivera asked the left a very good question   why are so many who profess to be outraged  amp  repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by  realdonaldtrump unmoved by similar allegations vs   billclinton  so offended by alleged conduct in a moscow hotel room  yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the  ovaloffice   why are so many who profess to be outraged   repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by  realdonaldtrump unmoved by similar allegations vs   billclinton    so offended by alleged conduct in a moscow hotel room  yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the  ovaloffice    geraldo rivera   geraldorivera  november    the media shark tank surrounded trump  hoping to prove the alleged sexual harassment charges  not surprisingly  after trump won the election  all of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct have gone into hiding   against him  were real  they refused to even consider the confessions of multiple women against bill clinton and his enabling wife during the campaign  the real difference  of course  is that the women accusing bill clinton of sexual assault  have been screaming from the rooftops for decades about the sexual abuse they endured by the former governor of arkansas rivera brought up another great point in his tweet as it relates to the fake trump russian dossier story that the left has been apoplectic about since the news broke in the liberal media several months ago  it appears  however  that the left has already forgotten the reason bill clinton was impeached after lying to a federal grand jury about having sexual encounters with a  year old intern in the oval office while serving as our nation s president meanwhile  it s also curious how many rino s in congress  including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  have said that without any investigation or opportunity to prove that any of the allegations of sexual misconduct against  minors are untrue  that republican candidate for us senate  judge roy moore  al   should step down  does anyone remember telling hillary to  step down  because there should never be a geriatric pervert allowed to roam the halls of the white house putting visitors and the staff in potential danger of sexual assault  for that matter  does anyone remember telling bill clinton to  step down  when he was accused of sexual assault over and over again while he was running for the office of the president of the united states  the answer is  no   there was no such call for either clinton to  step down  and give up their political ambitions this isn t the first time fox news host geraldo rivera  who is a self described liberal  has spoken out against the hypocrisy of the left  in february   rivera resigned from a voluntary position at yale university after the school decided to change the name of a residential college that honors a slavery supporter rivera said sunday on twitter that he resigned as an associate fellow of calhoun college  he said the position was an honor  but intolerant insistence on political correctness is lame
