ben carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery  he has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the  pants on fire  category of fact checkers on numerous occasions his stories about growing up some street wary tough guy who liked to beat and stab people turned out to be fabrications  his tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone  the only thing carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class  he likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon whatever it was that pushed ben carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly  left unscripted and with a microphone  carson is his own worst enemy  that was never more obvious than it was at a recent campaign stop to talk to  graders in des moines at the isaac newton christian school apparently carson was again trying to build on that old favorite  dumb kid  card when he turned into by far the dumbest person in the room  without considering that he was dealing with  year olds  carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them  a des moines register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student w  crowd of   realbencarson just called out to  grade class  who s dumbest kid in class  at least half dozen kids point to  student   timothy meinch   timeinch  january    you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you  you should have your idiot filter cleaned  in what universe is it ok to ever degrade a child to make a political statement  the student said he wasn t upset by being singled out  which may make carson feel better  but certainly not the kid s parents carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end  hopefully he drops his aspirations to de throne george w bush as the least qualified buffoon ever to occupy the oval office sooner than later before he causes any more damage featured image by gage skidmore
