donald trump just got owned by a legend during a concert in los angeles  singing icon and longtime clinton supporter barbra streisand took the opportunity to deliver a few sharp barbs at the republican nominee first  she brought mentalist lior suchard onto the stage and slammed trump s intellectual capacity  the only person whose mind he can t read is donald trump s  because he doesn t have one   she quipped indeed  trump does not know anything about anything  which is why he uses generalities to make it seem like he knows stuff  only the most fervent trump supporters are actually gullible enough to fall for this scam  and the republican leadership  of course but streisand saved her best shot for last she told the story of a fundraiser in which a study was mentioned that said   no matter what the color of your skin or where you were born   cuba  china  malaysia  madagascar   our genetic make up is    identical to every person on the face of the earth  streisand then waited a beat before delivering a damning and hilarious punchline  the other    is donald trump  here s the video via youtube donald trump is an embarrassment to the human race and republicans should be ashamed that they made him the leader of their party it s too late to do the right thing and replace him now  the best thing republicans can do at this point is just admit they made a huge mistake and try to save the country by making sure trump loses big in november what started out as a joke is now a serious threat to our democracy and the survival of this nation  donald trump is literally obsessed with using nuclear bombs and there is no way to stop him from doing so if he becomes president  he would light the world on fire  this is the culmination of all the hate and fear republicans have been preaching since president obama took office in   it s time for them to take responsibility and take a huge loss this year so they can begin the long task of rebuilding a more inclusive party that actually has ideas and can gain respect that will not happen if they continue to support donald trump and everything he represents featured image via wikimedia
