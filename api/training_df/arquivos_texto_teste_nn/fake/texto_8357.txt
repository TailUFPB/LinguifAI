on tuesday  the day after he won the republican party s iowa caucus  presidential hopeful ted cruz admitted that his campaign had sent out an email alert implying that political rival ben carson was dropping out of the race the email warned that carson was leaving the campaign trail after iowa  and said that he would be making a formal announcement next week  recipients of the email were instructed to spread this lie among carson supporters during the caucuses  please inform any carson caucusgoers of this news and urge them to caucus for ted cruz  even a broken clock is right twice a day as addicting info reported here on february   ben carson told his supporters in a speech on caucus night  for months  my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class  but in reality are masters at it  on tuesday  cruz sort of apologized for the deceptive emails  claiming it was all just an innocent mistake on the part of his campaign staff according to cruz s statement  circulating false rumors as  breaking news  is  fair game   while circulating the truth just wasn t a priority last night when our political team saw the cnn post saying dr  carson was not carrying on to new hampshire and south carolina  our campaign updated the grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story  that s fair game what the team should have done is send around the follow up statement from the carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out that was a mistake from our end  and for that i apologize to dr  carson ted s apology also didn t explain why carson s follow up statement  which made it clear that he was not dropping out of the race  wasn t seen as a  breaking news story   by the cruz campaign  but i think we can figure that out for ourselves carson wasn t the only candidate to be dogged by dirty republican politics during the iowa caucuses a post circulated on social media claimed that jeb bush was paying people   an hour to fill seats during the caucus in des moines and need some quick money apparently jeb bush will pay you to listen to him  pic twitter com   jeff sadosky   jeffsadosky  february    bush s iowa rally  two men  who later claimed to be paid actors  stood up and began loudly demanding payment for attending the event  we ve been here for two hours and we haven t been paid   one said bush responded by having the men escorted out of the rally  here s video of the men being escorted out  courtesy of the uk s daily mail after the uproar died down  bush asked the crowd   have the yr s  young republicans  gone yet   he went on to tell the audience  that s what we used to do back in the day  we would come to other campaigns and do what they did  good old gop family values  teach the kids how to lie  steal  cheat and con people in order to get what they want as jeb himself so plainly put it  following the caucus night debacle   those are the tactics  used by the republican party and as carson pointed out  the more they point fingers and accuse others of dirty politics  thefeatured image credit from gage skidmore via flickr
