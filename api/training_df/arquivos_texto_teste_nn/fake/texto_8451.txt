benghazi was just a ploy to hurt hillary clinton s shot at the presidency  admits rep  darrell issa  like other senior republicans who have also admitted the truth about the right s never ending benghazi investigations  issa opened up and told the truth to a friendly right wing radio show  you know  people often ask trey gowdy and myself  what did our investigations do   rep  darrell issa  r ca  told boston herald radio on friday morning  gowdy currently chairs the house select committee on benghazi  while issa conducted his own investigation in  when he served as chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee  well what they did is that they opened up an opportunity for the american people to sort of smell what s in the garbage can   issa said   and i think that s the reason that a devout socialist who wants to nationalize almost everything in america is close to and probably will beat hillary here in new hampshire  it s not because they like republicans  it s because they don t trust hillary  multiple bipartisan investigations have repeatedly cleared sec  clinton and president obama of malicious wrongdoing in response to the attack on the u s  compound in benghazi  libya  those investigations found that systemic problems in the policies protecting ambassadors and other diplomats on foreign soil led to the tragedy that killed ambassador chris stevens and the contractors hired to provide security that hasn t deterred the right from constantly invoking benghazi  particularly in relation to clinton s presidential campaign  fox news and other conservative media outlets recently expressed the hope that the michael bay movie  hours would provoke an outcry against clinton outside of the circle of the right  instead  the film has been a box office flop and is one of the worst performing films ever released by the super successful director just as screaming  benghazi  failed to derail president obama s re election  it does not appear to be a potent force in halting sec  clinton s presidential campaign featured image via flickr
