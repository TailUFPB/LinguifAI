high profile back stars from will smith and jada pinkett smith to spike lee will be boycotting this year s oscar s ceremony in solidarity over the persistence of racism in hollywood  but for one  white  nominee  this is all just a case of  racism against whites  first  veteran hollywood star and oscar winner michael caine told black stars they must be  patient  and await the point where they are permitted full entry to the academy he was joined by actor charlotte rampling  who is nominated for best actress for her role in  years  and will be competing against four other white actresses   brie larson  jennifer lawrence  cate blanchett and saoirse ronan not only will there be no black actor in this category  but there will be no black actor in any category of the oscars in   not a single nomination however  like caine  rampling believes that black stars of hollywood are making a fuss about nothing  worse  that their calls for greater representation in hollywood amounts to racism against her and her fellow white actors  she said during a radio interview on friday  it s racist to whites  one can never really know  but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list   then  in a final fit of white privilege she added  why classify people  these days everyone is more or less accepted  people will always say  him  he s not as handsome  or  him  he s too black  or  he s too white  but does that necessarily mean there should be lots of minorities everywhere  what does it mean that  still think they are a minority  it would be a much better world if rampling was right  if black actors were being judged on their merits and simply fell short  but if she truly believes this  her disconnect from reality is profound  as variety points out in   variety ran a series of articles asking why there aren t better roles for black actors  three decades later  the situation hadn t improved  on feb      variety carried the front page banner naacp faults film employment  last year  the hopes for diversity were based on one film  paramount s  selma   which earned two nominations  for best pic and song  winning the latter   this year  there were more opportunities  including  creed  straight outta compton  and  chi raq   as well as  beasts of no nation  this year  it s even worse surprising omissions from the actor race this year included idris elba for  beasts of no nation   will smith for  concussion   michael b  jordan from  creed  and the many young actors in  compton  to add insult to injury  despite the fact that creed featured a black actor in the starring role  and was written by a black man   the only nominee was a white man not only is hollywood failing to acknowledge the black actors who have delivered breathtaking performances throughout the year  but the industry is also decades behind television in providing leading roles for black actors in mainstream movies which make them household names  as the guardian discovered when they crunched the numbers a  los angeles times study found that nearly   of oscar voters were white  some   were black and   were latino  more than three quarters of voters were male  the median age was  so  let s be clear  this is not about hurt feelings  this about a very real  systemic issue  and as these figures show  it s not just on race where hollywood fails to reflect the diversity of our societies it is far better that white stars stand in unity  like george clooney and michael moore  to help transform hollywood for the better   than they stick their head in the sands and continue to ignore an unjust status quo  but for some  the reality of racial prejudice is an ugliness they would rather pretend doesn t exist featured image via wikimedia commons wikimedia commons mod com
