when donald trump isn t busy insulting gold star families or inciting his followers to assassinate his presidential opponent  he spends a lot of time talking about the dreadful obama economy   one in which  admittedly  growth is slow  a new study  though  shows that trump is pointing his stumpy finger in the wrong direction  the blame lies squarely with his republican party the report was published by the economic policy institute  it blames republican austerity  not democratic spending  for the fact that economic growth was just   percent during the second quarter  and frankly  it hasn t been spectacular for a long time  it s easy to blame the man in the white house  which is what republicans do  but they are wrong the epi places the blame on  s republican budget cuts  fiscal austerity at the state and local levels  gop states  refusal to expand medicaid under the affordable care act  instead of cutting spending during the recovery from the great recession  we should have been spending more   specifically on infrastructure and on programs that help people this economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles  for example  the employment recovery from the trough of the great recession to its pre recession peak took  months  following the recession in the   employment recovery took  months  in the early  it took  months  and in the early  it took  months the us government would have had to spend an additional   in  alone to match the spending that followed the  recession  bivens said  while such spending might run up the us deficit   something republicans in congress are opposed to   it would also have led to  several years of full employment  and the federal reserve increasing interest rates source  the guardiananother problem is the low interest rates  during the recovery from the  recession  the interest rates started at   percent  now  with interest rates approaching  percent  and have been for a long time  there s no place to move them the study does place some blame on the obama administration  though  he didn t make effective enough use of the bully pulpit the obama administration  could have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete  identifiable roots in decisions made by the congress   bivens wrote   had the obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth  it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the united states faces a recession  featured image via darren hauck at getty images
