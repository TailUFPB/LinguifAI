president obama made history yet again by making the rate for americans without health insurance reach another historic low  however  you wouldn t know about it because virtually none of the mainstream media have talked about it on any level gallup healthways well being index was updated on april  with new data for the first quarter of   the statistics have now been released  and it shows that the uninsured rate for american adults dropped to  percent  which is the lowest ever recorded in the poll s history this unmitigated success has followed a trend since the third quarter of   which is the last one before the affordable care act s mandate for health insurance took effect the graph below shows the virtual bottoming out of the uninsured rate  considering where we were as a nation only three years ago  coupled with the stubborn resistance of many in complying with the new requirements  the results are simply amazing not only are the results on the uninsured rate historic overall  but the largest benefits are among african americans  hispanics  adults under  years of age  and adults making less than    per year  if republicans really want to  repeal every word of obamacare  as they promise to do  it would literally make their party go extinct  young and minority voters will be lost to republicans for a generation or more  and doom them extinction the republican  plan  during the  election has been more of the same  repeal  repeal  repeal   with no plan to replace as usual  however  there has been a lot less talk of repeal as of late  even ted cruz  who could have  i will repeal every word of obamacare  chiseled on his tombstone  has been strangely silent on the issue  votes to repeal have seemed to be drying up  and you hear hardly a peep coming from senate republicans on the matter these days perhaps the gop has finally reached the last stage of grief   acceptance featured image via getty
