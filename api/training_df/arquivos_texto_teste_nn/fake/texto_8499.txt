the book of leviticus is often cited by conservative  christians  as examples of biblical law the nation must obey  ted cruz  however  doesn t practice what he preaches according to leviticus    ye shall not steal  neither deal falsely  neither lie one to another  but that is exactly what the texas tea party senator did during a face to face interview with david brody on the christian broadcasting network the interview addressed cruz s past failure to tithe  an obligation important to the evangelical community in which christians are required to give at least ten percent of their income to the church as set by the bible  it s especially important to the pastors in the movement who need those hard earned dollars to enrich themselves and if cruz wants the support of evangelical voters  you would think he would be honest and explain himself satisfactorily  or at the very least  beg for forgiveness  but not only did cruz tell a fabricated story to cover his ass  he did so right in the face of a christian journalist and all the christians watching  listen on the question of tithing  all of us are on a faith journey  and i will readily admit that i have not been as faithful in this aspect of my walk as i should have been   cruz said  that article focuses on ten years ago  we don t have the ability to go back and change what occurred ten years ago when heidi and i were newly married and we d just started a family  but at the end of the day  being a christian is not about holding yourself out as righteous  it s about beginning with the understanding that we are flawed sinners and we are saved not by deeds but by christ s redemption  i am grateful that god is a patient and forgiving god and this area  as in many areas of my life i am working to do a better job walking in my faith  here s the video via cbn mediaite s tommy christopher  who grew up in a fundamentalist household  fact checked cruz s story and discovered that it is nothing more than a tall tale the story he references  first of all  doesn t focus on  ten years ago   it covers ted s tax returns for a five year period that ended five years ago  from  to   ted cruz made      and gave     to charity  that s    of his income  or about    of a tithe  in   when cruz made  only    grand  he and heidi weren t  newly married   they d been married for five years  and they weren t  starting a family   they didn t have kids until  in other words  the story ted cruz gave about he and his wife being something of a struggling couple with mouths to feed is bullshit  he made more money in five years than most americans do in a lifetime  yet he couldn t be bothered to share his wealth with the church community he has been aggressively pandering to over the years  if cruz had followed the general rule  his tithing would have totaled    over those five years once again  ted cruz gets caught being a liar and a total hypocrite featured image  nation of change
