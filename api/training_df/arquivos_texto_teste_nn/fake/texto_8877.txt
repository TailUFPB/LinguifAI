taya kyle  the widow of infamous  american sniper  chris kyle  attended cnn s  guns in america  town hall thursday  where she grilled president obama on his executive actions regarding gun control and safety  mrs kyle  who received the  thank you  right wingers said would never come from the president for her husband s service  took to the moment like a champ  managing to squeeze every conservative talking point possible into a few short minutes a somewhat bizarre moment came when she told the president we  can t outlaw murder   she presumably meant that there s no way to stop all murders from happening  so why bother trying if it will inconvenience someone with a  minute background check  the thing is that the laws that we create don t stop these horrific things from happening  right and that s a very tough pill to swallow  we want to think we can make a law and people will follow it  but by the very nature of their crimes they are not following it  by the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here  i don t know any of them would have been stopped by the background check and yet  i crave that desire for hope  too  part of it is we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder  because the people who are murdering  right  are   they are breaking the law but they also don t have a moral code that we have  so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb  mrs  kyle and those who think like her probably thought her point was some form of a slam dunk   that the president wouldn t be able to answer  that turned out to not be the case  as her argument is based in nra myths and lies and not in the reality that we all live every day she does make some interesting points about the direction the country has been traveling when it comes to violent crime but stops short of reasonable when she says we should be celebrating the dropping murder rates in our country  the president agreed that we don t put enough emphasis on the good that we ve done  but that s because there s still so much horror happening every day he s right  we can t simply say   hooray for us  we kill fewer people than we did in   let s stop worrying about it   we have to remain vigilant and continue to institute policies that will bring the violent crime rates even lower over the next  decades as well  the president s actions are a part of that plan and a part of his ongoing commitment to make america safer watch the entire exchange between president obama and  american sniper  widow taya kyle below featured image via screen capture
