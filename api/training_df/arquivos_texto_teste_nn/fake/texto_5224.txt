it s disgusting enough that donald trump jumped to serial womanizer and harsser roger ailes  defense in the wake of a growing sexual harassment scandal at fox news  when asked how he d respond if his daughter  ivanka  was being harassed the way that ailes harassed many women  his answer was positively vile kirsten powers  a fox news contributor and usa today columnist  pointedly asked trump that very question  his reply  i would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case  because it should always be incumbent upon the woman to handle the situation quietly  instead of her harasser s responsibility to  oh  we don t know  maybe not harass women  novel idea  yes  trump literally just said he wouldn t want his daughter to report it  to complain  to fight for herself  or to out her harasser  from there  given his defense of ailes and his own proclivity towards womanizing and harassment  we can assume that he expects her to work to avoid ruining her harasser s career and life at all costs just over a week ago  trump told nbc s chuck todd the following  some of the women that are complaining  i know how much he s helped them now  all of a sudden  they re saying these horrible things about him  piling on a bandwagon  in his opinion  perhaps  maybe he thinks they re jaded because ailes passed them over for promotion  or worse  because ailes didn t hit on them  but hit on other women in front of them and they were jealous  the mind of a misogynist can create all kinds of theories as to why women would dare ruin a career as obviously stellar as that of roger ailes most women can t just up and quit their jobs because they re being harassed  even if they all could  they should absolutely not be expected to  why  because the harassment is not their fault  and it should be on their harasser to go find a new damn job  it s the harasser who was wrong ivanka stands by her father in his bid for the presidency  and he should not be telling her to tuck tail and run in the face of harassment  as if the harassment is her fault  that is victim blaming at its absolute worst  he s a horrifically sick bastard for that featured image by jeff swensen getty images
