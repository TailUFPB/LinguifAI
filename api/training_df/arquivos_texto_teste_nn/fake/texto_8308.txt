germans call it backpfeifengesicht  it s a colloquialism which translated means  a face that needs to be hit   however  you don t need to be german to want to punch ted cruz in the face  while there hasn t been any formal polling on the question  i personally would feel safe wagering money on it being over  percent of america  but what does this all mean  are we a nation of unreasonable bullies for wanting this doctor richard cytowic has taken some time to explain to america why they are not a nation of bad people for their burning desire to smash a knuckle sandwich into ted cruz s jaw  it turns out this is all a very natural and very scientific thing we are experiencing while i would never actually suggest someone would do something like punch ted cruz in the face  i m not suggesting they don t either   the feeling that you want to means you are operating at a normal mental state   so just enjoy the feeling and embrace it within reason dr  cytowic explained that humans learn to read facial expressions from the day they are born  it s one of our most rudimentary and instinctual means of communication  our brains have had a million years of practice at reading facial expressions  generating an instant like or dislike of the person that they are attached to  to put it more simply  it s an evolutionary survival trait to determine friend from foe  and our brains are extremely good at it by now with this in mind  it explains a lot about why practically everyone hates ted cruz  it isn t just his policy  there are oodles of idiot republicans we could hate for that same reason  ted brings out a more visceral and emotional reaction  unlike most others  even among his fellow republicans nobody likes him  and that says a lot dr  cytowic goes on to describe how cruz s facial expressions do not shift the way normal human expression does  he has rarely observed a normal smile from ted cruz  in a normal smile the corners of the mouth go up  and the muscles circling the eyes contract making them narrow and forming crow s feet at the outside corners  when it comes to ted  his mouth just tightens into a straight line  and on the rare occasion that it deviates from this  the corners bend downward   the outside of his eyes bend downward as well  which is completely opposite of what is normal  as the eyebrows typically bend upwards to put it simply  ted cruz has a look of disgust on his face that only gets worse when he tries to look happy and smile  it s like he is some kind of anti politician  because you would think that someone who has his kind of fan base would naturally be able to express themselves more pleasantly  so remember  when you see ted on tv and you want to throw something at the screen  it means you re ok because it s only natural featured image from twitter
