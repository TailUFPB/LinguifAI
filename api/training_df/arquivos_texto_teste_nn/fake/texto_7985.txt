you d think in the year  we d no longer have to deal with discrimination of this magnitude anymore  but alas  the nation is still filled with bigoted morons  so  we still have businesses refusing service to customers based upon  in this case  religion the oktaha  oklahoma gun range  save yourself survival and tactical gun range   what a name  decided to prohibit  year old raja ee fatihah from their establishment because he s a muslim  and now the u s army reservist  who proudly serves his country despite being openly discriminated against by bigots  is throwing a much deserved lawsuit back in their face the gun range  quite openly  prohibits muslims  as can be seen in the photo save yourself survival and tactical gun range via cairlittle did they realize that the person whom they banned from their establishment was none other than a board member in the oklahoma chapter of the muslim advocacy group  the council on american islamic relations  cair   the american civil liberties union  aclu  is the one who helped file the suit  and the legal director of the oklahoma chapter  brady henderson perfectly stated  whether the sign in question says  no muslims  or whether it says  no coloreds  or whether it says  no women  or  no christians  or  no buddhists    it is just as un american and fundamentally it is just as wrong  fatihah said the range was fine and pleasant with him until he revealed that he was  in fact  muslim  he said  at that point  they started treating me with suspicion  the aclu released this as part of their press release  the lawsuit alleges that the policy violates oklahoma s non discrimination law as well as the civil rights act of   which forbids certain places of business from denying service to customers based on their race  color  religion  or national origin  although the business is open to the general public  in july   the owners posted a sign near the front entrance announcing that muslims are not permitted at the facility and that the business is a  muslim free establishment  there is no justification for a business denying people service based on religion   said fatihah   i am a servant of my community in every respect  and as a proud american  i have enlisted in the u s  army reserve to protect this country  i should be afforded the same rights and privileges as anyone else  when fatihah arrived at the business s main counter  owners required him to fill out a liability form and provide his name  address  and driver s license number  standard procedure for patrons seeking to use the gun range s facilities  however  after fatihah identified himself as a muslim  the owners armed themselves with handguns and demanded to know whether he was there to  commit an act of violence or as part of a  jihad   fatihah was then made to leave the gun range without receiving service  according to wbrz  the oklahoma store owner s attorney  robert muise  says fatihah was denied service because he was belligerent  not because of his religion  however  if you look at the sign on the front door that reads plain as day  muslim free establishment   it s hard to buy that story line  it will definitely be interesting to see how this lawsuit moves forward and if justice will be served featured image  council on american islamic relations via mother jones
