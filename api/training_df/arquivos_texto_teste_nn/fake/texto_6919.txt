on tuesday  tom hayden  one of leading dirty hippies that drove republicans  and democrats  completely insane in the  wrote a lengthy editorial in the nation to announce that he was dropping his support of bernie sanders and voting for hillary clinton in the california primary  while not sparing a critical eye towards clinton  he explains that despite not being an angel  she has successfully worked within the system for almost  years to affect change  according to hayden  she has the best chance to beat the republicans and advance her agenda through both a hostile congress and an unsure electorate hayden actually agrees with most  all   of bernie s end goals  as do many of hillary s supporters  we all want universal healthcare  more taxes on the rich  less guns on the street  equal pay for women and an end to income inequality  but where the problem comes is how to get there the populist clarity of bernie s proposals can be problematic  even for some of his supporters  for example  to simply reject obamacare in the belief that  political revolution  will lead to a single payer solution is simplistic hayden is worried bernie has done nothing to ensure he will have the political muscle to make his plans work  a one election revolution won t cut it without  a plan b  which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections  take fracking for example  hillary has been condemned for not calling for a total ban  but hayden  a much more plugged in activist  is more impressed by clinton s long term goals and less so by sanders  absolutist stand but hillary s position goes beyond what virtually any state has done  the new york times writes that she  has pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate plan  and intends to install  million solar collectors in four years meanwhile  bernie s total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed  his energy platform is comprehensive  but he offers no strategy to implement the paris summit in the short term and it s not just bernie s policies that hayden is concerned with  there s also the question of his vulnerability as a candidate  hayden  quite correctly  points out that republicans have almost completely ignored bernie my second worry about bernie s candidacy is that he has not really faced an all out republican financed media assault in this entire campaign  if he s the nominee  that will be merciless i ve had this discussion a number of times with bernie supporters who think that republican attacks will roll right off  but republicans managed to convince a significant portion of the country that the center left obama is actually a far left socialist bordering on communist and that obamacare was a  government takeover   the right wing media machine is a propaganda tool that would make the totalitarian government in george orwell s  weep in pure jealously  by the end of the first month  bernie would be labeled a marxist  by the end of the second month  he would be the reincarnation of stalin  and that would be among the nicer things they would say about him just to be crystal clear  a certain number of bernie supporters insist that obama is a center right republican  yet it is undeniable that he s been successfully labeled a far left radical by the right  how would bernie be immune to this  there s no clear answer even worse  the automatic response from bernie supporters is  they ll do the same thing to hillary   as if that would change the character assassination to come  but even that answer is unhelpful because they ve been doing this to hillary for longer than many of bernie s supporters have been alive  the clintons are the most scrutinized politicians to ever live  bar none  there are literally no new scandals to dig  or make  up  the corporate media has been trying to claim her scalp since the  and the right has spent millions upon millions on opposition research with only rumor and innuendo to show for it what are they going to do  hold some more benghazi hearings  good luck with that but the main reason hayden says he s supporting hillary is that the black community is overwhelmingly supporting her i intend to vote for hillary clinton in the california primary for one fundamental reason  it has to do with race  my life since  has been committed to the causes of african americans  the chicano movement  the labor movement  and freedom struggles in vietnam  cuba and latin america  what would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who i am  that would be a transgression on my personal code  i have been on too many freedom rides  too many marches  too many jail cells  and far too many gravesites to breach that trust some of bernie s  overwhelmingly white  supporters have taken the not so subtly racist attitude that the black community doesn t know any better  but hayden correctly points out that bernie himself made the choice not to appeal to them bernie s campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing  starting  months ago  he chose to invest resources instead in white majority regions at the expense of the deep south and urban north blaming black people for not supporting bernie when bernie deliberately chose to focus his energy elsewhere is a deeply problematic attitude and a shirking of responsibility there s  a lot  more and hayden does not pull punches with either candidate  but his overall message is clear  vote for whatever candidate you want in the primary  but at the end of the day  stopping the republicans is more important than hero worship  if you want real change  you have to do more than vote in presidential elections  sit back and wait for it to come featured image via getty
