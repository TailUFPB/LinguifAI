fox news  own military expert blasted donald trump  too  but saved his most devastating shot for ted cruz during an appearance on kennedy on thursday night  lieutenant colonel ralph peters ripped into the republican presidential candidates for pushing ridiculous military strategies to take out isis trump has suggested using nuclear weapons while cruz has chosen carpet bombing as his plan of action  both of which would violate international law and us law carpet bombing in areas with high concentrations of people such as in cities and villages is considered a war crime by the geneva convention  of which the united states is a signatory nation  using nuclear weapons  meanwhile  would cause destruction on a scale that would draw serious condemnations from our allies and would also be a war crime if dropped on a city both ideas are so bad  in fact  that even fox s own right wing military expert smacked them down and lambasted them for not only not having served in the military but for not doing any research  none of the political wannabes  none of the aspirants have done their homework  none served in the military   they re all too important   but at least do your homework  guys  now if you want to use a nuclear weapon on islamic state  tell me  what s the target  what s the operational advantage  how would you deal with the ramifications for allies  it s the kind of thing people throw out there  and it s just goofy loose talk  but peters also went on to specifically target ted cruz  when ted cruz talks about  carpet bombing   i get the sense he thinks it s dropping carpets out of an airplane   peters said   you ve got to know what the basic terms mean  peters and kennedy both had a good laugh at cruz s expense talking about how he ll probably load up planes with debris taken from homes and drop it on unsuspecting people in the middle east  i ve got all these remnants from when i redid my guest house  i ll just drop  em on isis   kennedy said   exactly  carpet warehouse   peters replied   but seriously  there was one point where i really got angry  and then peters set his sights on trump  when trump was challenged about the military and him giving an unlawful order  and the military not obeying it  he said   oh  they ll obey it   well no  mr  trump   our military takes an oath to support and defend the constitution of the united states  they obey the lawful orders of the commander in chief  but if the commander in chief  the president  ever gives an order that conflicts with the constitution  the constitution winds   hands down  every time  so i just wish these guys would   you know  come on  if you won t do the homework  guys  get your staffers to do some for you  in short  cruz and trump do not possess the ability to lead our military  they would use our armed forces to commit war crimes and would cause a constitutional crisis by giving orders to the military that our soldiers would likely refuse to follow ralph peters may be a right winger who constantly disrespects president obama  but he s on point about trump and cruz and their inability to be a competent commander in chief featured image  flickr
