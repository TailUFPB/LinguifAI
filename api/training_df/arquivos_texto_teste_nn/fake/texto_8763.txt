president obama gave america a bit of the spirit of the  s back when he announced  during his final state of the union address  his support for a new american  moon shot  to develop a cure for cancer  it harkened back to the days of john f  kennedy s  we choose to go to the moon  speech he delivered at rice university in   and richard nixon s signing of the national cancer act of  where he dedicated federal funds towards working on a cure for the disease a national goal to cure one of the worst and widespread diseases known to humanity is an incredible undertaking  if it were successful  it would save countless lives  ease untold amounts of suffering  and reduce the colossal expenses we incur by managing the disease every year  but  because obama suggested it someone had to have a problem with it for years now  there has been a running joke of  if obama is for it  fox news hates it   this included such silly notions as drinking enough water every day  to breathing oxygen  and other common interest items like these  reality has overwritten satire yet again when fox news insisted that obama s national cancer cure initiative was a waste of time because obamacare won t allow it to happen one of the objectors was dr  marc siegel  who appeared on fox and friends to declare that obama was the  wrong president to cure cancer   it was a strange way to start his argument  but the implication was clear  some conservatives like siegel just don t want to see obama with a  win  even if it meant we could cure cancer starting tomorrow jumping immediately onto the anti obamacare bandwagon  fox hosts started suggesting that the affordable care act inhibits cancer research  this is something that is not proven true  some trade groups have made the disingenuous leap connecting cost saving measures to a reduction in research  however  there are other aspects of the aca that promote more research across the board seigel continued on  implying that barack obama had not committed substantial funds to cancer research  by citing richard nixon directing   million towards cancer research during his presidency  barack obama has actually directed   million towards cancer research as part of a   billion raise to the national institutes of health seigel also claimed that the aca wouldn t provide enough coverage for treatments developed during a national cancer initiative obamacare is narrow networks of doctors   he continued   it doesn t include most of these major medical centers  the cancer institutes  it won t include these treatments that are    per year  and not only that  as you just said  it stifles innovation source  raw story seigel is trying to conflate the coverage of current treatments with cures that have not been invented  it s a bit disingenuous to suggest that a cure that has not actually been developed yet will not be covered by the aca  data on which insurance policies cover treatments that have yet to be invented simply do not exist seigel s argument about existing treatments does not have merit either  media matters had previously pointed out that conservative media had misrepresented the facts in an ap report about narrow health care networks to falsely claim enrollees in aca exchanges cannot get coverage for treatments at advanced cancer centers  the  narrow networks  that were used as the basis for the right wing misinformation was a marketing tactic to provide lower premium options to customers and had virtually nothing to do with the aca forcing them into that position watch the full clip below it s ridiculous that fox news is actually fighting back against a national cancer cure initiative  simply because they can t let it go on obamacare  but that is exactly what is happening  he already won on jobs  national security  ending wars  ensuring marriage equality  providing health insurance to tens of millions and bringing america back into the hearts and minds of the rest of the world  they can t stand the thought of him also being the president that  cured cancer  as well featured image  screengrab
