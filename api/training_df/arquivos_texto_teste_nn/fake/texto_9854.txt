major hollywood liberal activist rob reiner is no match for tucker carlson who calls reiner out on his morgan freeman propaganda ad on cyber war with russia  tucker talks about how our real enemy is china when it comes to cyber wars haha  reiner starts to get a little miffed at tucker when tucker calls him out on china epic  this is the meat of the interview  i agree with you we are very divided  and maybe this is one of the reasons  a lot of this is disingenuous  anyone who looks at cyber warfare will tell you  any honest person  will tell you the chinese military is the primary culprit in the united states  hacked into the white house not too long ago  nobody said anything  you guys in hollywood sell your movies in china  you bow to the imperatives of their propaganda and censorship office  you change your movies to suit them  and yet no one says we re at war with china notice how reiner brings up the facebook ads that the left is now going after because a russian group spent   on ads during the election  so it comes down to the fact that this is an effort at  ironic  propaganda to convince americans that russia stole the election  did you catch that clapper is part of this    wth  if people want to turn their heads at that  it s at their own peril really who s the propagandist mr  reiner  he might want to look in the mirror
