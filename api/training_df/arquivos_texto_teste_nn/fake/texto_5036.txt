there cannot be any bigger example of irony in american politics than donald trump s newest proposal for immigrants coming into the united states according to a new report  donald trump will put forth a proposal that will test incoming immigrants on their support for  american values  as a litmus test for citizenship  what will these questions entail  whether or not these immigrants support gender equality  gay rights  religious freedom and the rule of american law the irony is rich   a man who has no respect for gender equality  gay rights  religious freedom or the rule of law is going to ask hardworking immigrants if they support the things he does not  maybe it s a catch    perhaps if the immigrants answer  yes  to any of the following a trump administration would deny them entry suppose an immigrant comes through and is asked if he or she does not support gay rights  like many christians in this country  many muslims or catholics from south america do not support same sex marriage  if a muslim or a south american catholic answer that they do not support same sex marriage  would a trump administration brand them  ultimately  as anti gay remember  donald trump doesn t support same sex marriage in other words  he himself would most likely fail his own immigration test trump s senior policy adviser  stephen miller  told the associated press that the aim of the new litmus test was to selectively determine who our  friends  are and which immigrants would best be equipped to fight against  radical islamic terrorism   so there it is   this isn t a test on all immigrants  it s really a test on muslims cleverly disguised as a legitimate part of immigration customs i guess that whole adhering to religious freedom thing doesn t ring true for trump or his lily white allies  miller also told the ap that the purpose of the litmus test is to fill the cracks left by gaps in traditional vetting from countries that are  well  predominantly muslim  even though our vetting process is meticulous  once again trump s  policy proposal  has fallen flat  when your own candidate couldn t pass such a subjective test  it s best not to make others take it featured image via jeff swensen getty images
