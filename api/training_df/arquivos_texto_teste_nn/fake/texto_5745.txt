the announcement that donald trump s problematic  misogynistic campaign manager corey lewandowski was fired from the republican presidential candidate s campaign was a somewhat satisfying one  however it was soon replaced with bewilderment when it was announced that cnn had picked lewandowski up mere days of being thrown out of the trump campaign  cnn offered lewandowski a job where he is rumored to be paid as much as    as a political commentator for the network  the network s move raised eyebrows   especially considering the fact that lewandowski as actually forbidden to criticize trump thanks to a handy contract trump makes all of his minions sign on thursday evening  lewandowski had his very first paid appearance   and it went exactly how you might expect it would   awful  on erin burnett s outfront show  lewandowski flat out told viewers that he would not be criticizing trump  yet in the same breath promising to  tell it like it is  using the same vague response tactics he likely learned from trump himself  lewandowski dodged questions about his loyalty to trump and said  i am a guy who calls balls and strikes  i am going to tell it like it is  i ll tell you exactly like it is  whether you like it or not  i m a straightforward person  that s not going to change  if something is wrong  i ll tell people it s wrong  if something is right  i m going to tell people it s right  lewandowski s appearance was basically ten minutes of sucking up to the donald  painting the picture that trump is  the only person who is going to save this country  for my children and hopefully their children someday  even amongst claims that the trump campaign was broke you can see this train wreck unfold for yourself basically  lewandowski is treating his new role as another opportunity to be a spokesperson for trump  even after the campaign cut ties with him  this interview left viewers in shock   most notably new york university journalism professor jay rosen  who had the perfect reaction twittercnn s decision to employ lewandowski is baffling  considering that the network has recently spent a considerable amount of time pointing out trump s lies  giving paid airtime to someone who is obligated to say nice things about a horrible presidential candidate seems to really contradict the dent cnn was trying to make in the trump campaign featured image is a screenshot
