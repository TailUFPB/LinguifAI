ben carson was  very  briefly the republican frontrunner for president of the united states   and now he s getting demoted by donald trump s campaign for being too big a liability  the campaign which once tweeted a picture of trump eating a taco bowl with the caption  i love hispanics  thinks carson makes them look bad and sadly  they re probably right ben carson has managed to step on every rake in the yard in his bumbling attempt to help trump get elected president  he s confided to reporters  on the record  that trump might make a terrible president  but at least  we re only looking at four years  how bad has carson been for trump  dubbing him the  worst surrogate ever  cbs news  emily schultheis pegged carson early on a campaign surrogate s job is to travel across the country and go on tv  saying nice things about the candidate and helping boost his or her chances at the presidency what a campaign surrogate is not  however  supposed to do  is suggest their candidate is a bad person  admit he has a twitter problem and an issue with  humility   defend that candidate by suggesting a tv anchor has been charged with a crime  and reassure skeptics that  even if your candidate is a terrible president  it s only for four years so when carson made headlines yet again for screwing up   this time naming a list of potential vice presidents trump was considering including alaskan campaign death knell sarah palin   carson was removed from the vice presidential planning group  or as carson s spin team meekly put it  he asked to be removed because he had many more super important jobs to do that lie was exposed in less than a week  the real story is that trump kicked carson to the curb because carson had absolutely no idea what he was doing three sources close to the trump campaign said carson didn t leave on his own  he was pushed according to sources close to trump s campaign  carson was demoted after trump specifically wanted him to head up the vp selection team  he submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later  carson allegedly called trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this at this point  it s hard not to feel bad for carson  having seen the highs of being a front runner  carson got smoked in iowa thanks to a vicious lie spread by ted cruz  later he would be pulled into a literal closet to hear ted cruz tell him  sorry not sorry   only to finally give up and throw his lot in with trump   a man who once called him a pathological liar barely above a child molester  now that same man is firing him and only because carson s mouth almost never bothers communicating with his brain before saying things like  he has some major defects  there s no question about it  just like the rest of us  but before we let carson s sadsack routine tug on our heartstrings  let s remember that this is a man who ran for president on the premise that the egyptian pyramids were grain silos only to give up and throw his weight behind a man he seems to have nothing but contempt for just to cling a bit longer to the political spotlight  carson s right about one thing  he does have major defects featured image via justin sullivan getty images
