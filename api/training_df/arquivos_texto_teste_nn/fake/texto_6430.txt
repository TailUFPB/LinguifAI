as the creeping realization that donald j  trump is  in fact  the republican nominee slowly dawns on conservatives  there has been a new push to re frame the candidate as more  presidential  and more  serious  than people had originally thought  this requires a level of mental gymnastics that would qualify for the olympics  while trump s backers   and some in the media   continue to insist trump is  shifting  towards maturity  he keeps emphatically insisting that he really is the racist  xenophobic blowhard he originally postured himself as consider this  just one day after the newly elected mayor of london publicly humiliated trump over his abhorrent plan to ban muslims from entering the united states  trump was on increasingly pro trump fox news to announce his latest big plan for when he s president  a tribunal run by rudy giuliani with the sole purpose of working out what to do about the muslim  problem  we have a president that won t even use the term  radical islamic terrorism   he won t use the term  he refuses to say the term  even after paris where  people were killed or san bernardino or any other place  it s a real problem  so we ll figure it out  and we will get it going  but we have to be extremely careful  in fact  i m thinking about setting up a commission perhaps headed by rudy giuliani to take a very serious look at this problem  but this is a worldwide problem  and we have to be smart giuliani  famous for his handling of new york city s response after    has spent the last decade and a half growing increasingly fanatical  in recent years it s not uncommon to see him on fox news complaining about black people and muslims in ways that sometimes even make the conservative hosts blush giuliani is now trump s go to guy on islamophobia  when the candidate spuriously claimed that  thousands  of muslim americans were cheering on    giuliani quickly rushed onto cnn to describe  in vivid detail  one such example  we had one situation in which a candy store owned by a muslim family was celebrating that day  right near a housing development  and the kids in the housing development came in and beat them up and  i think both facts were corroborated to be true  because they were celebrating that the towers were coming down  some of the kids got really upset about it and they came in and did a pretty good job of beating them up  except those  facts  were not true  what giuliani was referring to turned out to be an anti muslim hate crime  here s what really happened that day yesterday i saw first hand how anger over the world trade center attack turns on muslims who call new york home  at   p m  on  st   five black teenagers stopped in front of the american muslim community of east harlem site   a closet sized candy store with a make shift mosque in a back room  tiny store owner muhammad chaudhry stood in the doorway  one of the teenage boys asked him   do you feel sorry for america  the kid then gave chaudhry a knock out punch in the face that sent him reeling backwards and onto the floor this man  whose hatred for muslims made him misremember a hate crime to fit his warped view  will now be tasked with solving trump s fabricated muslim  problem   that is a very scary thought featured image via ralph freso getty images
