bernie sanders mildly criticized israel s actions during the  massacre of over  palestinian civilians by describing it as  disproportionate   i m going to stress the word  mild  here because it will be held up as an extreme attack on israel because that s where our political system is today  any politician that even slightly disagrees with israel s tendency to shoot first  ask questions never is labeled as the next coming of hitler by the rabidly pro israel right and the slightly less rabid pro israel left  a fact that did not escape cnn s jake tapper tapper then inquired why sanders  who like many american jews identifies as jewish but says he s  not very religious   was taking a  critical  position on israel  it is interesting that the first jew in american history to win a delegate  much less a primary  is taking a position on israel that is usually in american politics everyone just supports israel and whatever israel wants to do  you re taking a more critical position   tapper said it s rare for anyone  much less a journalist  to put it so bluntly so kudos to tapper as well  bernie  not one to shy away from controversy  gave a perfectly reasonable response that will in no way mollify his pro war critics  a more balanced position   sanders interrupted   whether jewish or not jewish  i would hope that every person in this country wants to see the misery of never ending war and conflict ending in the middle east  it s a difficult issue  other people have tried to deal with it for years  all that i m saying  as somebody who is absolutely pro israeli  absolutely  percent supports israel s right to exist in peace and in security  i think that the only way we succeed is of course the united states supports israel  but you cannot ignore the needs of the palestinian people  you can t just be concerned about israel s needs  you have to be concerned about the needs of all the people in the region   sanders added ohhhhhh  he s going to pay for that  one of the basic tenets of the pro israeli worldview is the palestinians are not real people  they re all  terrorists  and  terrorist sympathizers   even the small children  keeping them deprived of food  medicine and other basic human needs is only natural since they re little better than animals  if you think i m exaggerating  you must not have spoken to many strident israel supporters or listened to how the israeli government and people talk about a final solution to the palestinian problem here s bernie completely crazed  anti semitic  but not really  rant featured image via screen cap
