republicans and religious conservatives made a big show on wednesday by criticizing current republican presidential frontrunner donald trump over his comments on abortion  the right treated trump s declaration that under a regime where abortion is outlawed  women would have to be  punished  as if it were some crazy deviation from what the anti choice right has been saying for years in an interview with business insider  secretary hillary clinton quickly dispensed with this utterly false notion https   www facebook com businessinsider videos  clinton  the democratic presidential frontrunner  said that trump also revealed what many republican lawmakers and candidates believe  she cited efforts by gop governors and state legislatures to curb access to abortion  what s important here is that all the republicans agree with him  they all want to see women s rights eroded and for abortion to become illegal again   she said   that s why so many state republican governors and legislators are defunding planned parenthood and shutting down clinics that not only provide a safe abortion  but hiv testing  cancer screenings  and so much else  clinton added   so he tried to walk it back  but i think you have to take him at his word  the official republican party platform  passed at the  republican national convention  is very clear on abortion  the text calls for the passage of a so called  human life amendment  to the constitution  which would classify every fetus at every stage as a full  human  life  and as a result  any sort of abortion   even for rape or incest   would count as a murder  but not only would doctors be subject to arrest  in this world view a murder could not happen without it being solicited   by the mother the end result is  that if abortion law is enacted the way the official republican party platform calls for it to be  women  and possibly their spouses  would at best be considered part of a criminal conspiracy to commit murder usually the media allows republicans a pass on this  rarely asking what the logical conclusions in the real world would be of an outright ban on abortion  as secretary clinton noted  the only mistake trump made is in saying in front of cameras what conservative republicans believe and talk about behind closed doors featured image via facebook
