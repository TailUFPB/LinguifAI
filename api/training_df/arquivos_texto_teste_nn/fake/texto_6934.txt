despite the damage that the presidency of george w  bush and his war mongering administration did to the reputation of the united states  the world continues to look at america as a place of hope and great possibilities  this can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when barack obama ran for and then won the presidency  the world realizes the influence the united states exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments  especially when it relates to presidential candidates thus  much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of donald trump  a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president  he won t rule out using nuclear weapons  he s repeatedly insulted and threatened mexicans with his stupid wall  he wants to kick start an arms race  he wants to ban muslims from entering the united states  islamophobia would be state policy  and he wants to punish women who have abortions as is stated in the video below  if trump actually makes it to the white house  there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man  there will be a surge in what people will call anti american ism  people will mock the nation as dumb  vulgar  and aggressive  it will be like it was in the geroge w  bush years  only much much worse  we don t need another bush  or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible  let s help keep america safe from this man by doing what we can to make sure he does not become president watch and share this video featured image via video screenshot
