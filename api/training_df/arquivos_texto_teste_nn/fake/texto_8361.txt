it s no secret that nobody likes ted cruz   he s an arrogant  self important elitist who believes he speaks for god himself  his face is one of the most punchable on the planet and his screechy voice makes you cringe with disgust  when he starts on one of his  righteous  rants you can t help but hope a light fixture falls on his head  leaving him forever incapable of speaking donald trump wasn t kidding when he said that everyone in congress hates ted cruz  cruz refuses to deal or compromise within his own party  nevermind across the aisle  a cruz presidency would be nothing short of a disaster for this country that s today s perspective  today  we know all about the whiny toddler that is ted cruz  but what about his past  is he somehow new to the idea of being hated  according to an article in mother jones  apparently not a prominent aide to george w  bush s  campaign could barely contain himself when we asked him to discuss cruz  who worked in the campaign s policy shop  this person described cruz as hyper arrogant and widely despised  and he emphasized over and over that the pervasive dislike of cruz within the bush ranks had nothing to do with ideology   cruz  he noted  never objected to bush s call for compassionate conservatism  immigration reform  and national education standards  and no one on the campaign regarded him as an ideologue   the problem was simple  his personality so before ted cruz took on the role of ultra conservative nutbar teahadist  he was a moderate conservative inside the bush cheney  campaign  as the aide inside the campaign tells it  cruz isn t just a big jerk now  he was a big jerk then  ted thought he was an expert on everything   says this campaign veteran  who asked not to be named   he was a smart and talented guy  but completely taken with himself and his own ideas  he would offer up opinions on everything  even matters outside his portfolio  he was a policy guy  but he would push his ideas on campaign strategy  he would send memos on everything to everyone  he would come to meetings where he wasn t invited and wasn t wanted  he sounds a lot like that guy who shows up for the neighborhood cookout uninvited with a tin full of liver and onions and a six pack for himself  apparently  the best way to end a meeting was for ted to walk in   people wouldn t go to a meeting if they knew he would be there   said the aide   it was his inability to be part of the team  that s exactly what he was  a big a  hole  well isn t that enlightening  ted cruz isn t just an a  hole  he s always been an a  hole  his complete lack of personality and inability to maintain personal relationships came back to bite him  however  when he was denied a job in bush s administration   nobody wanted to work with him  imagine that ted cruz took off for texas where he could find the most ignorant constituents to pander to  managing to get himself elected on a tea party platform of stupidity and zealotry  since tea partiers don t really count ass  people  per se  it s safe to say that ted cruz just might go down in history as the most hated man in history featured image from gage skidmore
