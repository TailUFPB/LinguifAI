president obama s trip to hiroshima would come and go without an official apology to the japanese people for dropping hellfire on them to end world war ii  the official position of the u s  government is that the bombings were a necessary evil to end a war with no end in sight  ultimately saving lives and bringing the world back to peace  just because the president wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be while the president s speech was eloquent  reminding us that the people of hiroshima were just like you and i  it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world  in this video by abc news  you can see president obama intently listening to the man s story through a translator  at one point the man begins to break down and our president  obviously working off of pure decency and instinct  put his arm around the man and gave him a hug the japanese are a proud people who prefer the bow and the handshake  but the elderly gentleman who had been to hell and back seemed grateful that the president of the united states would show him such compassion conservatives  who have been demonizing the president s plans to visit the site for weeks now are out in force  condemning the action as an apology rather than a human being connecting with another human being in a display of true compassion  something their shallow  selfish minds can t quite reconcile with  anne coulter  for example  tweeted this bit of assholery before the president hit the podium in hiroshima for someone  born in hawaii   you d think obama would prefer visiting pearl harbor  pic twitter com   ann coulter   anncoulter  may    it to someone as crass as coulter to take something as simple as a trip to a friendly state and turn it into the ugliest thing possible  she may have a point  though  all of the idiots harping on this trip and calling it something it isn t have a point  it s not like the japanese government ever apologized for pearl harbor  right oh wait  yes  they did regardless of what the clowns tasked with riling up the conservative base think of this particular state trip  it makes those of us who understand diplomacy proud to be americans featured image via screen capture
