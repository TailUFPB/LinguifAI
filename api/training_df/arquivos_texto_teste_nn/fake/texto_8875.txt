the next american revolution ended before it ever started  by the hands of the very  patriots  that claimed they were ready to die for the freedom poachers and arsonists ammon bundy s occupation of misfit militiamen is already starting to fracture apart because they just can t seem to get along with each other  brawling  fraud  theft  booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality tv show ever blaine cooper  whose real name is stanley blaine hicks  was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch  the victim of the assault  jeff kagan  quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed  after the assault  no reason was given for the assault  other than the fact kagan walked from his camp across the street  towards the main militia gathering area  when he approached the area  cooper attacked both kagan and one other individual  cooper also attacked one of a  member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from ptsd  allegations were made that cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities  by exploiting his ptsd and suicidal tendencies  while cooper appears to still be there  he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers  count him as about  to  lost members self titled  captain  joe o shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel  this caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members  such as john ritzheimer  after all the booze money was gone  the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign brian  booda  cavalier  who goes by the name fluffy unicorn  yes he really does  has also been forced out of the militia as well  this happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the us marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life  cavalier was the personal bodyguard of ammon bundy for a time the infamous  blue tarp man  lavoy finicum  is also leaving the gathering  despite his allegations that the fbi will arrest him if he does  i need to get home  i got cows that are scattered and lost   finicum was quoted as saying  clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around  individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well  the group was actually  people and now it is down to  without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows perhaps the first bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new  who really knows  with luck  these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance featured image via wmur
