the republican party is fractured  and divisions are deeper than ever thanks to one donald j  trump  some republicans feel the party needs to unify behind trump now  but others  particularly senators in tight races  know what trump is doing to their re election chances  as such  an old friend has come out of the woodwork to shill for them  former president george w  bush george the lesser  along with jeb  and their father  george the greater  will not support trump for president  a former spokesman for w   freddy ford  told nbc news why w  would hop back into the cesspool of conservative u s  politics after such a long hiatus  president bush believes that it s critical to keep the senate in republican hands  he is actively helping some senators in tight races who are strong leaders and share timeless conservative values  ford also told the new york times  friends say that the former president is deeply bothered by mr  trump s campaign message  especially his derogatory remarks about muslims and immigrants  at the event with mr  mccain  mr  bush stressed the importance of preserving the republican held senate as a  check and balance  on the white house  suggesting that such a check was needed  whether the next president is mr  trump or hillary clinton  the presumptive democratic nominee  in other words  maintaining what little relevance the party has left is more important than trying to defeat trump at this point  because the only way to defeat trump himself is to endorse hillary  as a die hard republican  george the lesser won t do that  so he s gone out and hosted fundraisers for vulnerable senators like john mccain  r az  and kelly ayotte  r nh   and he s got three more planned for sens  roy blunt  r mo   ron johnson  r nc   and rob portman  r oh  the gop is defending many more senate seats than the democrats this year  which is part of their fear that trump will cost them everything but the house  and the only reason they d hang onto the house is ridiculous gerrymandering this hasn t gone unnoticed by the democratic senatorial campaign committee  which reacted to this news with a statement sent to the hill  republicans are so desperate for people to forget that they ve pledged their allegiance to donald trump that they are now campaigning with the architect of a disastrous foreign policy who wanted to privatize social security and left office with the economy losing nearly   jobs a month  obviously  they re scoffing at this particular strategy  as well they should  it s an odd move for george the lesser  and shows the party s growing fears over the donald and what he really stands for featured image by david cannon getty images
