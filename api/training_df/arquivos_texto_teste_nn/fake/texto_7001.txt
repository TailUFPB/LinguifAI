there are at least two votes on which donald trump can t count in the new york primary   the daughter he badly wants to f ck and his son  eric  this might seem crazy at first   after all  ivanka has been campaigning hard for daddy  and eric trump appeared alongside his brother as the latter offered to ship their father s black critics out of the country  but as crazy as it seems  it is true the state of new york has incredibly strict voter registration laws   ones that promise to create issues for people of both parties  as with many states  new york operates on a  closed primary  system  simply put  you cannot vote in a party s primary unless you are registered with that party  normally  simply switching parties would solve the issue nicely  but the empire state has the earliest change of party deadline in the country   october   of last year   which is six months before the primary election yahoo news reports that both eric and ivanka are not registered as republicans in the state donald trump s three oldest children have campaigned with their father and served as surrogates during the presidential race  but only one of them is actually a member of the party trump hopes to lead records from the new york state board of elections show that neither ivanka trump nor eric trump is enrolled in a political party  trump s oldest son  donald trump jr   is a republican in other words  only the son who actively courted white supremacists on behalf of his father is able to vote for him in the upcoming primary  sure  they support him  but it has to be humiliating for the donald that two of his oldest children will not be casting a ballot for him registration for new voters in new york is more lenient  with a deadline of march    but even if ivanka and eric are unregistered  it is still too late for them to cast a vote for the annoying orange this could also be bad news for bernie sanders  who has been swiftly closing the gap between himself and hillary clinton in the state  since he has been converting people of varying political persuasions since he announced his candidacy  it is likely that many of his supporters will not be able to cast a ballot for him  think progress reports when it comes to new york s fast approaching presidential primary election  lerner said potential voters from both parties would likely be impacted by new york s strict election rules  but she said that people voting for  the two non establishment candidates    sen  bernie sanders  i vt  and billionaire donald trump   would bear the brunt of the confusion  that s because voters for those candidates were more likely to have been previously unaffiliated with a political party  or more likely to have wanted to switch parties to vote for their preferred candidate sanders supporters even set up a page back in october raising the alarm about the change of party deadline for independents and voters registered with more liberal factions like the green party or the liberal party so far  it seems true that non establishment candidates like trump and sanders tend to do better in open primaries  where people can vote in whichever party s primary they choose both sanders and trump stand to take a hard hit from new york s strict party switching regulations  though he is sure to be a hit among first time voters  who registered in record numbers in new york this year  the full impact of already registered voters who wanted to switch parties to vote for the candidate of their choice remains to be seen  but one thing is certain   trump s kids will be sitting this primary out featured image via getty jeff j  michael
