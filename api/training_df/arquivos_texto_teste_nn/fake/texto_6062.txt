republican presidential nominee donald trump is trying really hard to ignore the controversy and lawsuit surrounding trump university  earlier this week he even attacked the media because they had the audacity to do their jobs and report on the lengths the university went to in their efforts to defraud people of their money  on thursday  new york attorney general eric schneiderman appeared on msnbc s morning joe to discuss trump u and said the university was not legitimate and the gop nominee knew it  this is straight up fraud  it s like selling people something you say is a mercedes and it turns out to be a volkswagen   schneiderman said   and even if some people say   well actually  i kind of like the volkswagen   it s still fraud because it s not a mercedes  this was not a university  although trump claims that he will be vindicated and trump u was completely above board  the details of the three lawsuits against him tell a different story  during an interview with fox news in february  the billionaire claimed that he  handpicked the staff for the school and those people did a  good job   ag schneiderman told the hosts at morning joe that those statements were blatant lies  trump s role was really as the pitchman  and we ve got his videotapes  and we ve got his sworn testimony which undercuts every statement in the videotapes  he said   my hand picked experts will teach you my personal secrets   he and the president of the university have already testified under oath he never met the instructors  they weren t hand picked  they weren t experts   some of them came out of fast food and retail  and he had nothing to do with the supposed secrets that were taught because he had nothing to do with the curriculum the attorney general added that trump scammed these people during one of the worst economic times in american history  so people were led to believe they were getting the personal secrets of trump  during hard economic times  we re talking about       people wanted to scramble to find a way to make money  he duped them in  thousands of people paid millions of dollars and we re out to get them their money back  think about what all of this means for a minute  before the housing market collapse  trump said that he wanted the bubble to burst so that he could make money  that eventually happened and millions of americans suffered greatly  people lost their homes  their jobs  their savings  it was horrific  so  after he prayed for their demise by wishing the crash would happen  he convinced people to go to trump university so that they could get out of the holes they were in and become rich like him   but it was all a scam  now this same person is running for president and he is one step away from the most powerful position in the world  how did he get there  by  once again  scamming people into believing that he will save them donald trump is a horrible human being and we must come together and keep him out of the oval office  so  remember  vote blue   no matter who watch ny  agschneiderman on trump u  this is just straight up fraud https   t co   morning joe   morningjoe  june    image via spencer platt getty images
