trump s acceptance of a purple heart  and his saying that he d always wanted one of those  really pissed off a lot of people considering that the way one actually earns a purple heart is to be wounded in action  cameron kerr  a  true  purple heart recipient  decided to start a satirical gofundme page in response to trump s sheer gall the page  called  help trump get a purple heart   explains that the money raised doesn t actually help trump do anything  instead  kerr has every penny going to help syrian refugees   a group of people that trump says we can t vet and is a huge trojan horse of terrorists kerr said  as with seemingly everything else in his life  mr  trump got one handed to him instead of earning it  that being said  as a purple heart recipient  who earned one the old fashioned way by returning from afghanistan one leg lighter  i fully endorse his desire to earn one and would happily oblige his interest in doing so  by being one of the first to chip in to fly him to the conflict zone of his choosing  after all  you re never too old to follow your dreams   since kerr can t actually accomplish that  he is  instead  turning one of trump s biggest insults to those who serve and sacrifice into something positive  let s face it  if trump hates it  helping it is probably positive  the groups to which the money goes are all vetted  so donors know that their money actually is going towards its intended cause  if trump knew  he d probably have a conniption because his name is tied to this the money is going to three different groups in short  kerr found a way to turn trump s insults  dullness and hatred into something good  it s such a crying shame trump won t be able to earn a purple heart the right way  is it not  however  he can help syrians escape their war torn land  even if he doesn t realize he s doing it  joke s on him photo by alex wong getty images
