rarely in life do you see people go so perfectly together  however  donald trump and sarah palin are made for one another  they are the peanut butter and jelly of political duos  unfortunately for america  though  most of us are allergic to nuts after trump decided to throw his hissy fit and not attend the fox news gop debate being moderated by megyn kelly  because apparently he is allergic to her cooties  palin decided to take to facebook  as she does  and lay down her defense of the hotel magnate she starts the post with   media  here  let me define for you a genuine  game changer    you tell  em  sarah  i m sure they can t wait to read what you have to say  after all  your opinion is so relevant and paramount to all of politics  or for that matter  the world palin doesn t want trump to get bullied by the  ballyhooed media debate game   she goes on and on  and on  rambling in an indecipherable word salad  she says things like  enough is enough  trump s victory on this issue proves we have a choice  the courageous gop frontrunner is speaking for us with his  screw it  biased media  the people deserve better  red line  finally  trump will now lead others with this empowerment to go around media filters and egos and everything else that s stood between people with a heart to serve and the voters  as well as  we can go elsewhere to seek truthful information that includes a candidate s voting record  their responsibility in spending other people s money and balancing budgets  their record of negotiating to win  their private sector acumen and personal accomplishments  who they re beholden to  if they ve incentivized more illegal aliens to flood our borders with gifts and freebies   making america much less secure  oh  and so much more  yes  that s all one sentence  oh  and what s better than starting a sentence with  like   like  if politics is their profession in perpetuity  which is the antithesis of our founders  vision  she then goes on to say that she s studied journalism  which  i guess  technically she has  however  she apparently didn t learn much along the way palin finishes her post with  p s   that is just pure gold as she throws shade at fox news and megyn kelly for not kowtowing to trump s demands   p s  is it just me  or if a debate host has made himself or herself the principal in a story they re expected to objectively cover for the edification of the public  and they even acknowledge they re the reason the frontrunner chooses not to participate  then isn t it common sense  and courtesy to the voting public  to simply  humbly allow someone else to moderate the debate  with all due respect  what a strange game at play  it s at the expense of straight shooting candidates gunning in competition for the nation s top administrative position  and more importantly  at the expense of americans who deserve to hear them instead of the cries from a pity partying press with noses out of joint because someone finally took a stand for common sense and an even playing field  sarah palin really shouldn t be the one to talk about  common sense  considering she has no sense at all  this is probably one of her more bizarre posts where she apparently used the  talk to text  feature on her mobile device  if there s anyone out there willing to decipher or translate this  have at it without further ado  here s the word salad in all its glory           if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  amp version       span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    fjs  span  parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script     span class  hiddenspellerror  pre    data mce bogus    facebook jssdk  span            gt media  here  let me define for you a genuine  game changer regarding donald trump honoring our u s  veterans instead posted by sarah palin on thursday  january    image  flickr flickr
