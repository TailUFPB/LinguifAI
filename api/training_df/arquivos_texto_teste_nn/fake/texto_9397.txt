you might remember this bright moment from when obama was president a couple of years ago   high school choir students sang the star spangled banner in the  story atrium of a hyatt hotel in louisville as part of the kentucky music educators convention  any anti anthem liberals in the building probably ran out screaming into the night good thing louisville doesn t have an nfl team  if there had been a visiting team in the building  some of the players would have had to put their helmets on to keep their skulls from exploding remember when obama supported kaepernick s anti anthem protest  obama defends kaepernick s decision to disrespect american flag   he s generated more interest in something that needs to be talked about when obama had the opportunity to speak out against  s quarterback colin kaepernick s disrespect for our flag  he chose instead to defend his actions  explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem  as long as he was bringing attention to the cop hating killing  divisive black lives matter terror group president obama said san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem  but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept at a news conference in china on monday  the president said he did not doubt kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of african americans by law enforcement in u s  cities  obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues  there are a lot of ways you can do it   obama said after the g  summit here   as a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are  but i don t doubt his sincerity  i think he cares about some real  legitimate issues that have to be talked about  if nothing else  he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about  obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas  but he said he was aware of the public response  which has been sharply divided  the president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between african americans and police officers over the past several years  including in baton rouge and dallas this year  you ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry   obama said   sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated  but i d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all  my suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it  maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality  that s how we move forward     washington post
