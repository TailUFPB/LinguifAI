we all know that there is no way to be a scientist and a creationist at the same time  science deals in facts  creationism deals in fantasy  so when the peer reviewed  scientific journal plos one recently published a paper that claimed god designed our hands  the backlash was swift and loud the paper was written by a team of scientists from china and worcester  massachusetts in order to better understand hand coordination  the abstract states  it is not understood which biomechanical characteristics are responsible for hand coordination and what specific effect each biomechanical characteristic has   but the abstract also contained something that made plos readers  and  at least  one editor  so angry the journal eventually retracted the paper  it said the explicit functional link indicates that the biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture between muscles and articulations is the proper design by the creator to perform a multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way the body of the paper mentions  the creator  two more times  and the conclusion said in conclusion  our study can improve the understanding of the human hand and confirm that the mechanical architecture is the proper design by the creator for dexterous performance of numerous functions following the evolutionary remodeling of the ancestral hand for millions of years wow  pretty outrageous right  how in the world did a scientific journal allow that to slip by them  well  that s exactly what plos  readers wanted to know  according to vox on the plos website  many angry readers called for the retraction of the article or an amendment of the line  many of plos s own editors were fuming  one wrote in a comment   the article should be retracted and the handling editor should be dismissed  as an editor for this journal  i am appalled  however  the chinese scientists who wrote the paper said it was all just a big misunderstanding  they claimed that a language barrier is really to blame and they didn t mean to imply that god is to thank for creating our hands  ming jin liu  the leader author of the study said that the team actually meant  nature   she explained  our study has no relationship with creationism  english is not our native language  our understanding of the word creator was not actually as a native english speaker expected we will change the creator to nature in the revised manuscript  i can understand how that could happen  but that doesn t excuse plos one s editors for publishing something with such a glaring error  that absolutely should have been caught before it went up on the site and it really hurts the journal s credibility  we should be able to go to this site and know that we aren t going to come across any papers that imply creationism is legitimate  it s not  no matter how much the christian right fights to make it so featured image via facebook
