as donald trump continues to be showered with adulation from conservatives  one right wing radio host is seriously regretting the role right wing media has played in his rise the republican nominee s campaign has been devoid of facts since the first day and his conservative supporters have eaten up every word he has uttered with absolute relish  from claiming that the election is rigged  to calling president obama the  founder of isis   to claiming that most americans like him  not to mention his relentless accusations that the mainstream media is just making stuff up because they are in league with hillary clinton in addition  trump and his supporters deny science and math and attack anyone who disagrees with them as  unpatriotic traitors  who should be targeted with violence or suppressed from participating in the democratic process the bottom line is that conservatives have been drilled by conservative media to hate facts and any media source that reports them  which is why an extremist con man like trump is now the leader of the republican party and one right wing radio host now regrets the way he and others like him have turned conservative voters into fact hating zombies  we ve basically eliminated any of the referees  the gatekeepers   conservative radio host charlie sykes told business insider during an interview conducted by oliver darcy  there s nobody  let s say that donald trump basically makes whatever you want to say  whatever claim he wants to make  and everybody knows it s a falsehood   he explained  the big question of my audience  it is impossible for me to say that   by the way  you know it s false   and they ll say   why  i saw it on allen b  west   or they ll say   i saw it on a facebook page   and i ll say   the new york times did a fact check   and they ll say  oh  that s the new york times  that s bullshit   there s nobody  you can t go to anybody and say   look  here are the facts  and i have to say that s one of the disorienting realities of this political year  you can be in this alternative media reality and there s no way to break through it  and i swim upstream because if i don t say these things from some of these website  then suddenly i have sold out  then they ll ask what s wrong with me for not repeating these stories that i know not to be true  sykes then warned that there will be consequences for what conservative media has done over the last few decades  when this is all over  we have to go back   sykes said  presumably back to a time when facts mattered   there s got to be a reckoning on all this  we ve created this monster  look  i m a conservative talk show host  all conservative talk show hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted with the mainstream media  so we have spent  years demonizing the liberal mainstream media  and by the way  a lot has been justifiable  there is real bias  but  at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible outlet out there  and i am feeling  to a certain extent  that we are reaping the whirlwind at that  and i have to look in the mirror and ask myself   to what extent did i contribute  indeed  conservative now look upon trusted mainstream media outlets such as nbc and the new york times as their enemies simply because they report facts  this has led to the rise of conservative outlets such as fox news  which often twists facts or lies outright to make their viewers angry in an effort to steer them toward a certain political viewpoint  and that is precisely why fox has been called the propaganda arm of the gop but all of that demonizing of facts and the mainstream media outlets that report them has created the political climate in which con men like donald trump are thriving  in fact  trump s supporters love lies so much that they didn t even notice or care when trump told them to their faces that he has been lying to them american democracy could be irrevocably harmed by right wing hucksters who seriously believe the mainstream media has a liberal bias  the problem is that facts are not bipartisan  something is either a fact or it isn t  and just because the facts are not on the side of conservatives and their bullshit policies and ideas that does not give them the right to demonize them for their own gain  that s how we end up with paranoid idiots like trump getting this close to becoming president  and stupidity and paranoia are the last things america needs in the white house featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
