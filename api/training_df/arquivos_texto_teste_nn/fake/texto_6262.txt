the gop didn t panic when a poll conducted earlier this year showed that utah might vote for the democratic candidate in november in order to avoid electing donald trump  however  they might want to start showing a little concern now  because two new polls show something similar for two more strongly red states  arizona and georgia  which tend to vote red in presidential elections  are showing signs that they  too  would turn blue before they d vote for trump donald trump has long claimed that he s going to win states that typically vote blue in presidential elections  which would rewrite the electoral map  at least for   georgia and arizona  however  don t like his misogynistic statements about women or his racist  hardline comments and unworkable policies against immigrants  utah just plain can t stand him  so can he rewrite the electoral map  sure  but not necessarily in his favor  in georgia  trump leads hillary by just four points  which is within that poll s margin of error  in other words  they re in a statistical tie there  georgia has voted republican in every presidential election for the last  years  but they re making themselves into an example of the disdain many feel for trump s fitness to lead a nation over in arizona  trump leads hillary by just two points  influenced by a huge  never trump  movement among republicans there  if trump can unite the party  he ll probably win arizona  but for now  it s not looking good for him  and it s looking just terrible for john mccain in the senate  too  the horror  trump and his campaign think that his appeal among white  blue collar workers are what will put traditionally blue states back into play for republicans  creating a ton of new swing states that haven t existed for a long time they re totally ignoring the fact that this goes both ways  though   they ve already made three red states look at the color blue with new appreciation  some republican strategists are pointing out that his polarizing rhetoric  which is alienating women and minorities  will make him struggle in a lot more republican states in fact  there is really only one way he ll gather enough electoral votes to win the white house  hillary has a much wider path than our dear mr  trump has it s not likely that arizona and georgia  to say nothing of utah  will be the only three of these states to start leaning away from trump  former pennsylvania governor ed rendell said  with donald trump  i think he ll have the ability to turn some working class  blue collar democrats   the so called reagan democrats   he ll have the ability to get them to switch over  the question is  are there republican moderates that will switch over to secretary clinton or bernie sanders  for every one blue collar worker that donald trump picks up  he has the potential to lose one or more suburban republican moderate to come over and vote for our side  there are actually a lot of those moderates who won t vote for trump  as noted above  arizona and georgia are now key states  along with utah and many others  trump might be crowing over his success in states that have lost a high number of manufacturing jobs  but other states have other issues  and all he s proving is he might not rewrite the electoral map so much as partially invert it  giving even more states to the democrats than usual featured image by mark lyons stringer getty images
