trump received a massive amount of backlash earlier in his campaign for his disrespectful  offensive mockery of award winning new york times reporter serge kovaleski  who suffers from a muscular disorder called arthrogryposis  although trump denied that he d been making fun of kovaleski  he obviously was   some uncovered footage reveals that trump has been poking fun at those with physical and mental disabilities long before that incident in a  interview on the howard stern show  trump made light of those with mental disabilities and challenges when he called a reporter  retarded  for criticizing his business skills   something we all know the donald is extremely sensitive about despite his claims that he has  very thick skin  since trump has zero experience in politics  the only thing he s been able to use as justification for why he is qualified to be president of the united states is his business record   which is actually horrendous when you look past the lies he spews  still  even if he knows that several of his businesses have failed or were scammy operations  trump does not like it when people point this out  so when trump was questioned on stern s show about a reporter who critiqued his business skills  trump resorted to insults and disrespecting an entire demographic of people with disabilities in the interview  co host robin quivers addressed the criticism on trump being shady and scammy in his business deals  quivers said   they are saying that then those guys don t get a return  you always make out but the guys don t get a return  trump shot back  okay  i know  and that makes me a bad person right  i know i was criticized in one magazine where the writer was retarded  he said   donald trump put up   million  they put up   million and they are   partners  why isn t donald trump putting up more money   and you know it is supposed to be because i am smart if i put up this  they put up like  times more money  and then they criticize me for not putting up more money  i mean these guys are dopes  but what am i going to do  you can listen to the audio below  where trump also talks about suing media outlets that speak out against him and the upcoming election trump often uses the fact that he is not  politically correct  as a selling point in his race for the white house  and his bigot  racist tribe obviously connects with that  but mocking a group of people  whether it s for their race  religion  sex or physical mental disability is honestly disgusting  if you need to be reminded of just how awful trump is  here s a clip of when he mocked kovaleski   an incident that he still will not admit to featured image is a screenshot
