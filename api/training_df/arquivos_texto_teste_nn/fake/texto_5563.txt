republicans are desperately trying to convince america that hillary clinton can t be trusted with national security  but they conveniently ignore how they have put our nation in danger themselves once again  republicans are obsessed with hilary clinton s private emails after the fbi declined to charge her with any of the imaginary crimes republicans think she committed so they are interrogating fbi director james comey over the decision because they didn t get their way however  it should be pointed out that this whole  scandal  is just another manufactured persecution effort designed to sabotage the election prospects of their main opponent in the presidential election according to slate  hillary clinton did not even come close to compromising national security because even if russia had hacked her private server the information gleaned would have been of little interest seven of the eight email chains dealt with cia drone strikes  which are classified top secret special access program  everyone in the world knows about these strikes  nongovernment organizations  such as new america  tabulate them  newspapers around the world including the new york times  where some of the same reporters are now writing so breathlessly about clinton s careless handling of classified information cover these strikes routinely the other top secret email chain described a conversation with the president of malawi  conversations with foreign leaders are inherently classified in other words  even if terrorists had hacked clinton s server they would not have learned anything they couldn t have learned from simply picking up a newspaper furthermore  the house republicans conducting these witch hunts have actually put national security at risk and they also use private emails as it turns out  rep  jason chaffetz and rep  trey gowdy also use private emails alternet reports that chaffetz uses his private email address on his business card instead of his official government email address and trey gowdy also uses his website email address here s an image of chaffetz s business card gowdy even outed a cia operative by releasing documents to the public as he was investigating clinton for somehow exposing our national security to outside risks  i don t recall him ever calling for himself to be investigated for that alternet tried reaching gowdy for comment but he ignored the request which means he refuses to discuss his own private email uses  it s true that there are legitimate issues with clinton failing to segregate work and personal email   alternet conceded   but it s troubling that members of congress handling sensitive investigations into national security matters such as the benghazi incident don t appear to be willing to be transparent about their own email practices  indeed  congressional republicans are not the only hypocrites when it comes to emails  former secretaries of state condoleezza rice and colin powell also used private emails and received classified information on them when they worked in the bush administration  and let s not forget the millions of emails that the bush white house deleted clearly  there is a double standard here  apparently  republicans have no problem putting national security at risk with their own failure to keep classified information off of private email servers but when a democrat does it they immediately pounce as if it has never been done before  they declare that it s some major  scandal  even as they are doing the same thing if republicans want hillary clinton to be arrested so much  they should voluntarily turn themselves in to fbi custody for doing the same thing and much worse  that means president bush  karl rove  condoleezza rice  colin powell  trey gowdy  and jason chaffetz should all be slapped with shiny metal bracelets  but we all know that republicans won t do that featured image  flickr flickr
