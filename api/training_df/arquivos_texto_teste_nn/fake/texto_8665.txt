president obama has been working for months to bring home four american prisoners held in iran  it finally paid off with a deal that saw iran and the united states exchange prisoners  the president showed that diplomacy instead of war is the right course of action to take however  that wasn t good for the republicans who started complaining as soon a  the president announced the deal  it s typical of republicans to play the partisan card even when what happens is good for the country  on late night with seth meyers  meyers said  of course  a good day for obama only lasts seven minutes before republicans shit all over it  which they did  because republicans were outraged obama traded seven iranian prisoners to get the americans back  donald trump was apparently upset that the us gave up seven prisoners while iran gave up just four  yet  clips show that trump called it a bad deal yet also took credit for it  meyers summed it up well  imitating trump s accent  meyers said  it s a terrible deal we should be ashamed of   and not to brag  it was my idea and you should thank me for it  trump also denied that he ever said the prisoners would never be released even though the video shows that he did   another contradiction from america s favorite contra dickhead   meyers said it s typical fashion for republicans to go after the president even when the results are good for the country
