trump s spokeswoman katrina pierson isn t known for being the brightest crayon in the box  she once went on air wearing a necklace made of bullets to show how committed the trump campaign is to upholding the second amendment at all costs  for instance  well  she s back now  and this time she is defending her crazy boss and his even crazier supporters and their violent tendencies chances are  these days  if there s a donald trump rally  there is violence  so  of course  when being interviewed  pierson and other workers on the trump campaign are asked to denounce this behavior  of course  they never do  though  on sunday  pierson appeared on fox and was asked about the escalating violence at trump rallies  host jeannine pirro wondered aloud if the entire trump show   the violence the protests  all of it   were anarchy  or perhaps some kind of game to get a specific candidate nominated  pierson s response was predictably stupid  i think a lot of it is anarchy  but i think more importantly this is organized chaos  they are trying to create a public perception of violence to scare people  supporting mr  trump  she then went on to make the ridiculous assertion that conservative values have been absent in the community  since the days of gop favorite ronald reagan  and ever since it has been a free for all for the militant left in this political  correct society where it s okay for them to use violence as an intimidation tactic or just yell  racist  or  hitler  to smear someone s character  pirro then hit pierson with something she can t stand  facts  shocking  coming from a fox host  i know   she reminded the spokeswoman that there were no protests and no violence at the rallies and speeches of the other gop presidential hopefuls  pierson chose to ignore this and say  you have people like moveon org and black lives matter and some of these anarchy groups  that s all they do is look for fights  they ve been provoking people all over the country long before mr  trump entered this race  pierson went on to give the ominous warning that trump s supporters would only be emboldened by those who try to plot to stop him from getting the gop  nomination  saying  this is the american people having a head on collision with the truth  which is that the democratic side is not on the side of the people  and the militant left is their army  and what we re seeing now is that people supporting mr  trump  they re not afraid  they re going to go out there and they re going to fight for american values and american families because that s who needs to come first  this woman is just another example of how ridiculous   but also dangerous   trump  his supporters  and his campaign are  they are to be stopped at all costs watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
