bill o reilly has said some ridiculous things on his show over the years and his so called conservatism has translated into outright bigotry and nonsense in many cases  that tradition continued with yet another nonsensical statement  this time about women  watch the video here it all started with o reilly s interpretation of what bernie sanders and hillary clinton said during the democratic debates on the issue of abortion  believing that  both candidates say they want few limits on abortion   during an interview with fox news analyst kirsten powers  o reilly said  if you are going to say that the two democrats running for president both favor pretty much abortion at any time  for any reason  and they hide behind the women s health issue  but that could be a migraine headache  you know  ok  i don t want to have the kid  my boyfriend left me  my husband left me  whatever it may be  i got a migraine  kid is going to be born next week  let s get  powers interrupted  saying   i don t think that many people get abortions because they have a migraine headache  o reilly continued  ok  it doesn t matter  it s theoretical  when you have two candidates saying they don t want any limitations in the law place  they don t want any  that can happen  and we know what happened in kansas  did that big investigation on tiller you know what happened there  and so that s so radical and so far away from what the american people want  that s just one example  o reilly has proven himself to lack any credibility whatsoever and his male privilege is disturbing to watch  when will people learn that a woman has a right to choose  after all  in the end  it s the woman s body and o reilly s nonsense is typical of males believing they have authority over a woman s body as well as her choices i m looking forward to the day when this guy s show gets cancelled featured image via video screenshot
