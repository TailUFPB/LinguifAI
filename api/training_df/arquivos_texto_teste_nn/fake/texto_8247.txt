it is extremely important to vet the people we put in charge of our children    especially in positions of power  apparently  a chowchilla  california school  along with the local police department  failed to do so when it came to school resource officer timothy hormel hormel is currently on administrative leave because of allegations that he had sex with a minor  the  year old cop was arrested by the mandera county sheriff s office after the accusations surfaced  as per usual  the police department is conducting an internal investigations in the hormel s allegedly criminal actions  according the sheriff s department  the minor was not a student at any school hormel was assigned to what makes this all so frustrating is that a predator like that never should have been anywhere around school children  especially not in a position of power  there s a reason there are age of consent laws  children do not have the mental and psychological capacity to consent to sex with adults  further  hormel could have used his power as an officer of the law to coerce the sex  if it did indeed happen either way  this guy needs to go to jail if he did this  and that sheriff s department and local school system need to be investigated watch a video news report below  via abc  featured image from video screen capture
