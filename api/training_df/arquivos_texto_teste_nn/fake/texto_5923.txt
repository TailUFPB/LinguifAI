d l  hughley is never one to be shy with his opinions  and once again he didn t hold back when discussing gop presidential nominee donald trump s racism  and the fact that despite said racism  top republicans continue to endorse him  hughley sat down joy reid on her msnbc show am joy  and shredded the entire gop first  joy reid asked hughley how he felt about president barack obama  and hughley said  the funniest thing about barack obama is there are things we want him to do because he s black and he just won t do  like we want him to go  hey  man  that s enough   and he does it better than like that dude who calls you a liar or some of the stuff  i think he s a decent  humane  thoughtful human being and i think we will miss him when he s gone  then  hughley s attentions were turned to presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton  and he had high praise for her as well  he called her as qualified a human being as i have ever seen run for president   after that  hughley endorsed the idea of hillary clinton having progressive firebrand elizabeth warren as her running mate  he said of the potential of such a ticket  this man would react to two competent well intentioned principled women with glee  i don t see anybody   listen  everything men have  black men in particular have  we have because of women  everything we have  every single thing  it s their time in the sun  it s a shame two women   i mean  i m not trying to be offensive  but they seem to be braver  who fights  who goes back and forth on twitter  which is such a dumb notion  but who does trump stay away from  elizabeth warren  saving the best for last  hughley then went on to rip not only donald trump  but whole gop for their racism and their endorsing a clear racist for the highest office in the land  he said  donald trump is a racist he s a racist and anybody who   listen  paul ryan basically said that s textbook racism  so what paul ryan actually said is  a racist is better than a liberal   if you say that  it s because you re not affected by racism  everything we are  because liberals built this country  you are what you are because of liberals  hughley then ripped reid s msnbc colleague joe scarborough  host of morning joe  and i was on with joe scarborough  and i don t agree with everything he says  but he brags about this being the  party of lincoln   when you ve got to keep referencing the dude on the penny  you better update your resume  stop it  everything you enjoy right now  everybody they like now  they hated before  they hated martin luther king  now they pretend  they hated muhammad ali  and they didn t like him until he was shaking going up the stairs at the olympics  they didn t start loving him until he was no longer a threat  you don t get to be a little racist  you don t get to be a little pregnant  hughley is right  the gop is full of racists  there s no denying it now  they are literally supporting a racist for president in a country that has one of the nastiest histories of racism ever  they d rather have an incompetent racist who is so thin skinned he d likely start a war in a fit of crazy rage for president rather than a strong  competent  more than qualified liberal woman  they are literally putting party before country  the good of themselves and their own political careers over that of the nation and world that says a whole hell of a lot about today s incarnation of the republican party  and none of it is good thank you  mr  hughley  for saying what needs to be said watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
