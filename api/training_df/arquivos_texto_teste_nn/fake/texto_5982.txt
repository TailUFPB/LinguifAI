trump doesn t have a plan about how  exactly  he will build his wall on the mexican border   but home depot co founder bernie marcus surely has some idea where he can get his supplies  recently  the retired ceo and chairman of the home improvement supplies company wrote a piece for real clear politics in which he expressed both his hatred for barack obama and his love for the  republican nominee in his unsolicited ravings  the billionaire says that trump is the only hope for america  in rhetoric typical of those on the far right  he informs us that barack obama is destroying our country and the one who can fix everything   make america  great again  if you will   is the donald i know donald trump  but we re not close friends  however  i believe he will begin on day one undoing the damage done by president barack obama  i stand ready to help him at every turn like many  i am deeply concerned about the us supreme court  when trump recently released his list of potential appointees  i grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced  even more important  clinton will push the court leftward for generations  she must be stopped  i genuinely believe that if we to  started the home depot today   he adds   we would fail because of the hurdles government  especially the current administration  places in front of small business owners  he laments the future of the supreme court under a clinton presidency  according to marcus  clinton will  push the court leftward for generations  and  must be stopped   and  once again  the one to stop her is trump donald trump is right  to inspire more of these men and women  we must make america great again  record breaking numbers of republican primary voters agree  they overwhelmingly want donald trump to lead this sea change  and we believe he can  but he needs to stand on our shoulders  he cannot do it alone one of the greatest lessons we took away from the home depot is to always listen to your customers  without their input  we surely would have failed  republican leaders must listen to their customers  too   their voters   and they have spoken clearly  as americans  the choice is abundantly clear  if you want four more years of president obama  vote for hillary clinton  if you want to take the country in a new direction  vote for donald trump   he says  urging americans to stand up for hate  and wall building  he s right  though  given those two choices  it is important to vote for the best one to lead america forward  the one who can be trusted to continue and expand upon trump s policies   and with sanders almost out of the picture  please don t kill me  i voted for him   that choice is very clearly hillary clinton  while democrats disagree over which of our two very qualified candidates should run against trump  the most important thing we can do is ensure that donald trump doesn t make it anywhere near the white house the next president will nominate multiple judges to the supreme court  like marcus said  the fate of numerous equality measures rests on donald trump not getting elected  featured image via algemeiner com
