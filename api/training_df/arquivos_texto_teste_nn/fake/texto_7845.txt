at a texas rally meant to celebrate his recent endorsement by one time opponent chris christie  donald trump said the  amendment doesn t extend to journalists who write  purposely negative  articles about him  his plan  one of the view policy positions he s actually laid out  would be to  open up  more libel laws and then sue the newspapers into oblivion to a crowd of supporters  trump laid out his vision for what free speech would look like in trump s america  it boiled down to  be good to me or i ll destroy you  i m gonna open up our libel laws  so when they write purposely negative and horrible  false articles  we can sue them and win lots of money we re going to open up those libels laws  so that when the new york times writes a hit piece  which is a total disgrace  or when the washington post  which is there for other reasons  writes a hit piece  we can sue them and win money  he closed with promising his fans that he ll  sue  critics like they ve  never got sued before  how did trump s supporters respond to this terrifying  fascist vision for the future  they went crazy  a cheer went up in the crowd that nearly drowned out trump s comments trump says he wants to  open up our libel laws  so he can sue news outlets and  win lots of money   pic twitter com   policymic   policymic  february    s attack on the media represents a bold new step in trump s march towards a literal nazi political platform  america has long enjoyed a  relatively  free press and  whether politicians like it or not  the openness has helped keep america free from the kind of totalitarian governments seen in places like north korea and china  it doesn t mean that the press is always fair  notably  barack obama has faced a constant barrage of right wing hit pieces directed at his character  his family  and his legacy  however  as bad as it gets  americans have always recognized that restricting the voice of the media is a line that shouldn t be crossed   until now trump  who views any criticism of his ideas or rhetoric as an insult  has a massive ego and paper thin skin  how would he define  negative  and  false  articles  where would he stop  on what basis would he sue the new york times or the washington post or even liberal blogs which don t agree to go quietly along with his message of bigotry  racism  and war mongering  the answers to those questions are almost too terrifying to imagine featured image via hollywood reporter screengrab
