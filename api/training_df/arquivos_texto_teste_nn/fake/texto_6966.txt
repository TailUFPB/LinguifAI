donald trump is currently leading in the polls in new york state  but he won t be receiving two votes from his own kids  on monday  donald trump admitted his son  eric  and daughter  ivanka  forgot to register to vote as republicans before the deadline in march to be eligible to participate in the new york primaries on april   they were unaware of the rules and they didn t register in time   trump told fox news   so they feel very  very guilty  they feel very guilty but it s fine  as we reported over the weekend  both ivanka and eric are registered to vote  but not affiliated with either political party  their oversight is illuminating to the disorganization of the donald trump campaign when donald trump first announced his presidential campaign in the republican primaries last year  media outlets couldn t stop covering the circus sideshow of the republican party  which has taken over as donald trump is on track to win the republican presidential nomination  the funniest thing about it is he barely had to try  a few racist speeches  vague promises  and egotistical rants about how america needs to be great again  and only donald trump  a winner  can make it that way  and the majority of republican voters have rushed to get behind this fascist demagogue  the remainder of the republican primary is now left between donald trump and ted cruz  both vying for who can fearmonger more republicans into supporting them while republican establishment candidate and ohio governor john kasich  who has his own brand of crazy  tries to hold onto being considered viable in the defense of trump s kids  voter registration should be automatic  as states such as oregon and california have done  and the entire voting process  from registration to casting a ballot should be facilitated  they aren t the only two people who have been shut out of the democratic process because they either lacked the information necessary to ensure their participation or weren t responsible enough to take the time to register with a party affiliate featured image via flickr
