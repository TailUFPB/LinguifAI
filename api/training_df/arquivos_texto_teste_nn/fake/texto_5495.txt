president obama gave a powerful speech today at the memorial service for the five police officers who lost their lives in the horrific ambush on law enforcement that took place last thursday in dallas  texas  unfortunately  but not at all unexpectedly  most of his moving words were lost on conservatives the president dropped some major truth bombs on race in america and followed up with a discussion of the choices that we  as a society  make which bring us to the place we find ourselves today as a society  we choose to underinvest in decent schools   we allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment  we refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs  we flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book    applause    and then we tell the police  you re a social worker  you re the parent  you re the teacher  you re the drug counselor   we tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs  and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience   don t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind   and then we feign surprise when  periodically  the tensions boil over right wingers began to lose their minds the moment it became clear that obama was going to have anything more to say than simply offering the worthless thoughts and prayers conservatives are so fond of  when he mentioned guns  it pushed them over the edge and they launched the  glockabook hashtag to mock the president s spot on words snow white and the seven glocks glockabook  the department of no   santastavern  july    the glock saved christmas   glockabook  heather  unbound   waversox  july    glockabook gone with the glock so  you don t like the fact we can legally carry   frankly  my dear  i don t give a damn  redheaded mischief     july    glockabook  the glocks of the baskervilles  p  fahrquar  rat   irishspy  july    glockabook  the glocks of the baskervilles  p  fahrquar  rat   irishspy  july    how many people have to die before these folks start to realize that maybe  just maybe  we have a problem with guns here in america  although deep down i knew better  part of me thought that this could be the straw that broke the gun loving camel s back and woke republicans up terrifying reality facing our country  but  i have thought that every time a mass shooting happens  and every time the only thing right wingers have to say is  don t take my guns   it s disgusting and it is downright sad featured image via aude guerrucci pool getty images
