it appears that the bundy militia has finally managed to radicalize a highly impressionable american into joining their cause   and it just so happens to be one of donald trump s campaign officials in a shining example of the kind of people who gravitate towards the republican front runners campaign  jerry delemus  an anti government fanatic  dropped what he was doing as the co chairman of  veterans for trump  in new hampshire to join up with the bundy family members in oregon to attempt to kickstart a revolution to overthrow the federal government according to his facebook  delemus  who is married to a new hampshire republican state congresswoman  arrived in burns  oregon along with a  videographer  to wage a  psyops war  on the mainstream media that are spreading  lies  about the bundy brothers  screengrab via raw storydelemus is no stranger to walking right up to the line of insurrection  he has been adamant that the government is ruled by tyranny and may need to be overthrown  the bundy brothers are just the kind of fanatics that he would latch on to  as the daily beast recently reported  delemus spent much of  trying to raise an right wing army in rochester  he s begging for a fight  i believe that we have another financial collapse coming soon and it will be worse than the one in    delemus warned   there are stark differences we must realize that we have nearly a   interest rate and our debt is nearly double  not to mention our credit rating has been dropped  on top of this we have a government that has no respect or regard for the rule of law as provided in our constitution if we do not stand against this insanity we can be sure we will fully slip into tyranny  we are in a similar position our founding fathers found themselves in and their decision to stand was equally difficult  during the  standoff at bundy ranch in nevada  he was right there with the other  patriots   marching with guns and facing off against the federal government apparently  nobody let him know that trump was not on the same page  trump may be a racist  xenophobic narcissist  but he s not  let s overthrow the government  crazy  at the same time delemus was grabbing his camping gear and buying a plane ticket to oregon  trump was disavowing the militia  trump  like many of his republican challengers  felt the militia was too extreme  even for conservatives when asked his feelings on the group  he called them lawless   you have to maintain law and order  no matter what  it s a bit awkward that one of his staffers is now joining their ranks so why would a guy like delemus support  law and order  trump  that s easy  they share an affinity for hating muslims inspired by the bigotry in texas  delemus recently tried to organize a  draw muhammad  rally in new hampshire in the hopes of inciting violence between right wing bigots and muslim residents  the event fell apart and delemus claimed he  won  against muslims anyway by  spreading awareness  if delemus s rush to join an anti government militia illegally occupying a wildlife refuge shows us anything  it s that trump s base is teeming with right wing extremists held together by little more than hatred  it s hard to imagine a single other candidate losing a campaign staffer to an insurrection and maintaining his or her massive lead in the polls  but trump doesn t rely on anything but his own big mouth to keep himself in the lead feature image via youtube
