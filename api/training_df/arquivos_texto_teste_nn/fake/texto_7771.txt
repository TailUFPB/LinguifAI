when looking at any donald trump event lately  it can almost be guaranteed that there will be some sort of protest  with his vitriolic and racist rhetoric  he s bound to have at least a few people stand up and say something  now  with trump getting closer and closer to being the clear republican nominee  these protests are becoming even more frequent  and trump always makes sure any dissenting voice is removed  because god forbid anyone disagree with what he has to say in an effort to remove these protesters as fast and as peacefully as possible  the trump campaign has been playing this announcement before every event  this is a peaceful rally  in order to notify the law enforcement officers of the location of the protester  please hold a rally sign over your head and start chanting   trump  trump  trump   ask the people around you to do likewise til the officer removes the protester  thank you for helping us make america great again  now  if you re like me and thought   no way  that can t be real  that has to be a voice over  because it s just too goddamn creepy   well  upon further research  it is  in fact  true  according to nbc news  as of a couple of months ago  trump began running this announcement at the beginning of his rallies  attendees were instructed ahead of the event to not harm the protesters  an announcement that is becoming more frequent at the start of trump s events audience members followed those rules as far as could be seen  cheering  trump  and  u s a  until the interrupters were escorted out by event security and law enforcement  so  it seems this announcement is not only very real  but it is why we hear the  trump  trump  usa   chants at every rally surrounding a protester using their freedom of speech to openly dissent check out the extraordinarily bizarre announcement here an announcement before trump s rally on how his supporters should deal with protestors  pic twitter com   vic berger iv   vicbergeriv  february    image  flickr
