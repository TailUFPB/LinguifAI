this should be a headline in the onion  but sadly  this story isn t fiction or satire   it actually happened mourners at the funeral of noela rukundo had the shock of their lives when the ceremony was gatecrashed by none of other than the presumed deceased  but no one was more stunned than her husband  balenga kalala  who believed he d gotten away with her murder five days before  burundi born noela had left the home in melbourne  australia that she shared with her husband to attend the funeral of her step mother in her native country  she had no idea that kalala had paid a gang of gunmen to make sure she never made it back to melbourne alive after hiring the gunmen  kalala even played a major part in placing his wife in their sights  as the bbc reports by early evening noela had retreated to her hotel room  as she lay dozing in the stifling city heat of bujumbura  her phone rang  it was a call from australia   from balenga kalala  her husband and father to her three youngest children  he says he d been trying to get me for the whole day   noela says   i said i was going to bed  he told me   to bed  why are you sleeping so early  i say   i m not feeling happy   and he asks me   how s the weather  is it very  very hot   he told me to go outside for fresh air  noela took his advice  i didn t think anything  i just thought that he cared about me  that he was worried about me  but moments after stepping outside the hotel compound  noela found herself in danger  i opened the gate and i saw a man coming towards me  then he pointed the gun on me she was thrown into a car  seated between two gunmen  a hood was placed over her head and face  and she was driven away at speed  after some time  the car stopped and the men began to ask her what she had done to make her husband furious enough to kill her  she refused to believe that her husband was behind the plot  so they called him and put him on loudspeaker  when they asked kalala what to do with his wife  he answered simply  kill her  noela s life flashed before her  she had fallen in live with kalala when he arrived in australia as a refugee from the democratic republic of the congo in   he had taken on her five children from a previous relationship  and the pair had since had three children of their own  yet now  he was killing her just as noela was coming to the conclusion that her life was over  the hitmen told her they would not kill her instead  they would extort more money from her husband  telling him their price had gone up   while giving her time to flee the country back to australia  noela says the gang told her  we give you  hours to leave this country   your husband is serious  maybe we can spare your life  but other people  they re not going to do the same thing  if god helps you  you ll get to australia   and so it was that five days later  kalala got the shock of his life  when noela returned home  she found her husband receiving a steady stream of mourners at their home  she waited for the last to leave  and then approached her husband  when i get out of the car  he saw me straight away  he put his hands on his head and said   is it my eyes  is it a ghost   she replied  surprise  i m still alive  kalala was arrested  charged and eventually convicted of attempting to murder his wife  he was sentenced to nine years in prison that same year   other australian women were not so lucky  their male partners were successful in their plans to kill them  in the u s   more than   women a year are killed by men they know  most commonly a current or former male partner  by contrast  women kill around  men a year  there is most definitely a gender component to this violence  this is an issue we must address  not only as a nation  but as a species thank goodness  in the case of noela  that her assassins turned out to be her saviors  featured image from youtube screengrab
