ap news  the regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table  the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute steven whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the frosty freeze  his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half century ago  coffee is  cents a cup  refills  cents  the pot sits on the counter  and payment is based on the honor system people like it that way  he thinks  it reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them  when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here  in god s country  in this small county isolated in the foothills of the appalachian mountains everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking  and  recently  news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because elliott county  a blue collar union stronghold  voted for the democrat in each and every presidential election for its  year existence until donald trump came along and promised to wind back the clock  he was the hope we were all waiting on  the guy riding up on the white horse  there was a new energy about everybody here   says whitt  i still see it  despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements  he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains  a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of trump s white working class base the frenetic churn of the national news  the ceaseless twitter taunts  the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen  rarely registering  when they do  trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic it means god  guns  patriotism  saying  merry christmas  and not happy holidays  it means validation of their indignation about a changing nation  gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas  it means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away on those counts  they believe trump has delivered  even if his promised blue collar renaissance has not yet materialized  he s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent  he s already done enough to get my vote again  without a doubt  no question   wes lewis  a retired pipefitter and one of whitt s regulars  declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards he thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life  and if they don t  he believes they would have if democrats and republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way  what lewis has now that he didn t have before trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him  one thing i hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner   says whitt     he s a fighter  i think they like the bluntness of it  he plops down at an empty table next to the card game  drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes  bill  bill  bill   he reports to his wife  chesla  who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together  he needs to run home and change of out his frosty freeze uniform  the first of several work ensembles he wears each day  and put on his second  a suit and tie  he also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner  elected as a democrat the whitts  like many people here  cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working  or  hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage  there s the school system  and a prison  and that s pretty much it  outside of town  population   roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too  then up into the hills of appalachia  with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the american imagination whitt slides a medical bill across the table  looks like this one is the new helmet   he says  and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt      they will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed    since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition  his skull was shaped like an egg  the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be  tommy  their baby boy with big blue eyes  has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should they pay   a month for insurance  but when they took their baby to a surgeon in cincinnati  they learned it was out of network  in network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries  so they opted to pay out of pocket  at the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor  it would have all been free this represents the cracks in america s institutions that drove whitt  a lifelong democrat  from supporting president barack obama to buying a  make america great again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch  many of their welfare dependent neighbors  he believes  stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead  where s the fairness in that   he asks but whitt doesn t blame trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better  he blames the  brick wall  in washington  the politicians he sees as blocking everything trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish a third of people here live in poverty  just  percent of adults have a college degree  but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do  and those jobs have gotten harder to find many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs  when trump bemoans the  american carnage  of lost factories and lost faith  it feels like he s talking to the people in these appalachian hills  when he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way  they embrace him coal has ticked up since trump took office  mining companies have added   jobs across the country since his inauguration  more than  of them in kentucky  but industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky  coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation  far cheaper natural gas  mechanization  thinning appalachian seams  with the opposition he s had  i think he s pulling the plow pretty good   offers wes lewis from the card table  a few months ago  he says  he saw four brand new coal rigs going through town   for the longest time  under obama  all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers  because people turned belly up  they went broke  lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work  he s noticed new trucks in people s driveways  too  which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures  these tiny signs stack up to him as proof  lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls   made in mexico   it reads  trump s bringing them back   he says lewis  a registered democrat  trusts trump because he trusts his values  and because of that  he trusts trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him  if the factories and mines don t come back  he ll blame the opposition  if there isn t a wall on the mexico border  he says  it won t be because trump didn t try  if investigators find his campaign colluded with russians  it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down go here to read entire story
