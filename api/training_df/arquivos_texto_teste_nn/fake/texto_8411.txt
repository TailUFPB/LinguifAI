at this point in the presidential race  you ve either come to determine that donald trump is the person for you  because policy inexperience and racism are appealing for you  or you ve realized that trump is a racist  misogynistic  egomaniacal ass  and if anything can be shown by the polls that have shown trump holding a huge lead over his competition  it s that the republican base prefers bigotry and bombastic hyperbole or facts  figures  and a solid plan for the future trump being as he is  isn t exactly new either  he s always been the narcissist that he actually  truly is  he s always thought his ideas are perfect and his shit doesn t stink  he s even gone so far as to compare a book he wrote to the united states constitution and the declaration of independence back in   while pushing people to buy his latest batch of drivel  he made just that comparison first there was the declaration of independence  then there was the constitution  now there is  timetogettough  available today   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    book time to get tough  also held a very familiar tagline   making america   again  trump honestly sees himself as a savior of sorts  a deity that will magically solve all the nations problems  in comparing himself to the founding fathers he resorts to an emotion that those dumb enough to fall for the line  will see him as just as profound as those who sought to make freedom a national ideal and form a new nation the thing is  he s no savior  nor is he anything like the founding fathers  he s a narcissistic businessman out for himself and wants to see how far he can go  not for the nation  but for his own ego  just listen to any campaign rally  he s obsessed with polls numbers and will talk the entire time about how  great  he is  and spend next to zero time talking about any sort of plans or policy america is already great  and if you want to keep it that way  make sure you vote blue this november featured image  flickr twitter
