donald trump s statements are frightening to those who see the danger of his rise and his antics are certainly theatrical  maybe that s why he fits in perfectly in this amazing game of thrones mashup clip watch video here  his face  along with quotes from his speeches and interviews  is cut into a mashup of the hbo hit drama as the viewer gets a sense of both the hilarity as well as the absurdity that is donald trump  it seems that trump fits in quite well in the seven kingdoms  produced by australian satirist huw parkinson  the video begins with trump turning away daenerys targaryen from the city of quarth trump later attacks pope francis for criticizing him and complimented himself  saying he was a  nice guy   he also said that he s going to build a massive wall and negotiates with littefinger although the video is entertaining  it also sends a strong message about both the absurdity and the danger that is trump  if his current stances on everything from banning muslims to attacking mexican immigrants are backed up with actual power by winning the presidency  then he ll not only be a danger to those communities  but will bring to power all of the racists that have backed him thus far  making america quite a dangerous place  featured image via screenshot
