the so called  war on drugs  has has taken another enormous blow as a study shows that states that legalize marijuana have seen a   reduction in the number of deaths due to painkiller overdoses  that s not some of the states but all of them  the difference is quite striking   said study co author colleen barry  a health policy researcher at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in baltimore   she notes that the trend became visible in every state a year after the pot was legalized the study suggests that because patients that are experiencing chronic pain can substitute or suppliment marijuana for their pain pills  they are able to take smaller  or no  doses of the pills and are less likely to experience an overdose this is even more significant than it seems  and it seems pretty significant   since the great recession destroyed thousands of white communities all over the country  there has been a surge in drug abuse by white people  in fact  the death rate among white males has jumped dramatically  while it s decreased in every other demographic  much of this has been from addiction to pain killers and  later  heroin the reasons for this are not hard to understand  when confronted with the same kind of crushing poverty and despair that has afflicted black communities for generations  white people turned to drugs the same exact way  this  of course  means that we ll be forced to crack down on white drug users and send them to prison for decades just kidding no  we won t be locking up millions of white people  this is america  silly  when white people are in trouble  we have to help them  not lock them up what this means is that legalizing marijuana can and mostly likely will be seen as a partial solution to the opioid epidemic devastating white communities  big pharma won t like this because fully legalized marijuana will annihilate their pain killer profits  normally  big pharma s profits are more important than human lives but when it s only white lives on the line  you can be sure that something is going to be done about it  featured image via getty
