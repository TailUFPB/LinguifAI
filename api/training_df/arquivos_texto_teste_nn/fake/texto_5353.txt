donald trump regularly references slain u s  ambassador to libya chris stevens  but the victim of the  terrorist attack wouldn t want it that way  says stevens  mother  on saturday  the new york times ran an open letter from mary commanday explaining that her son was not the sort of person who would want his name to be disgraced by its inclusion in right wing propaganda  the letter was short and not so sweet  serving as two paragraphs of  f ck you  for trump and the rest of the republican party  who have spent years reducing commanday s son to a political talking point to the editor as ambassador j  christopher stevens s mother  i am writing to object to any mention of his name and death in benghazi  libya  by donald trump s campaign and the republican party i know for certain that chris would not have wanted his name or memory used in that connection  i hope that there will be an immediate and permanent stop to this opportunistic and cynical use by the campaign oakland  calif commanday s request comes on the heels of stevens  sister telling the right to stop exploiting her brother s death last month in an interview with the new yorker  anne stevens told the publication that she doesn t blame clinton for her brother s death and doesn t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her  i do not blame hillary clinton or  leon panetta   stevens said  they were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world  and their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had  this was  of course  confirmed by the results of the eleventy billionth republican benghazi investigation  which once again cleared clinton of wrongdoing  with the many issues in the current election  to use that incident and to use chris s death as a political point is not appropriate   anne stevens said will trump and the rest of the gop respect stevens  family s wishes  of course not   because they don t actually care about the victims  do they featured image via cbs getty images  david becker
