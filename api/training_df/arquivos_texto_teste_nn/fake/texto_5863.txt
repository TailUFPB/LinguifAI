on some level  one must sympathize with donald trump  the  year old gop nominee is too stupid to know he s stupid   and his followers are leaps and bounds beyond that  in a recent speech in greensboro  north carolina  trump said something very telling about president obama s remarks about the orlando terrorist attack  nobody at the end of that speech understood anything other than  boy  does he hate donald trump  what the president actually said makes perfect sense  if you re not donald trump or his legion of morons   there has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn t use the label   radical islam   the president pointed out that none of his advisors has ever told him we will  turn that whole thing around  if he begins using the ridiculous fox news coined phrase that trump keeps spewing  the phrase   radical islam  isn t a strategy  obama pointed out  it s a talking point naturally  this made trump angry  most people get upset when someone points out that they are mind numbingly stupid  but msnbc s lawrence o donnell saw something in trump s response to obama s words that perfectly explains why he is so angry all the time you have every right to believe that that is exactly and only what donald trump got out of president obama s speech  you have every right to believe donald trump didn t understand anything in the speech  when someone as rank ignorant as donald trump tells you he doesn t understand something  believe him o donnell cut back to a clip of trump saying that  nobody  understood the clear and concise remarks   that s the way i felt after the third week of physics class   the host said   i didn t understand anything and it was a horrible feeling  imagine feeling that every day  every day of your life  you don t understand anything  that is the very  very sad life of donald trump   he continued there he is confessing to the constant  merciless pain of not understanding anything  and it s very simple stuff donald trump is confessing he isn t understanding  it s very simple  imagine what that s like  someone saying something that s very clear and concise   it still might be possible to disagree with in some way  but no one should have trouble understanding that  but donald trump told you today that he doesn t understand anything that president obama said   nothing  imagine how that must feel  imagine how maddening that is  president obama stand sup and speaks in clear  simple sentences and you understand not a word  that has to be truly maddening  is that what is making donald trump so mad   he asks have we finally nailed what makes trump and his followers so irrationally angry about everything  is it truly that they don t understand anything  trump says he loves his  poorly educated  fans  and there s good reason for that   he s right there with them watch o donnell bring down the hammer below featured image via screengrab
