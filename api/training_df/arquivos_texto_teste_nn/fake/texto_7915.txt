pope francis is now the anti christ in the eyes of donald trump supporters  including a delusional gop lawmaker in new hampshire nearly a week ago  the pontiff criticized donald trump s stance on immigrants by calling him a fake christian  a person who thinks only about building walls  wherever they may be  and not of building bridges  is not christian   pope francis said  this is not the gospel  donald trump later responded by telling pope francis that he ll wish donald trump were president when isis attacks the vatican  it was a vicious rant that turned trump s supporters into instant pope francis haters one of those trump supporters is new hampshire gop rep  susan delemus  who took to facebook last thursday to point blank call the pope the anti christ her original post was just images of her favorite verses from the book of psalms  but after one of her friends asked her if she had heard pope francis  remarks about trump she commented   the pope is the anti christ  do your research  when another friend expressed doubt about the pope being the anti christ  delemus responded   i m not sure who the pope truly has in his heart  here s a screenshot of the exchange via facebook when asked about her comments  delemus told politico that she was talking about the entire papacy  and used her geneva bible as proof that the pope is the anti christ because she claims the founding fathers wrote notes in it pointing to the pope as the anti christ  i was actually referencing the papacy   she said   and what i wrote after that  do your research   if you read the geneva bible  which is the bible i use when we study  the commentary is   actually by the founders of the united states actually  the protestant church   their commentary references the papacy as the anti christ  yeah  that s not going to make catholics feel alienated at all  there are  million catholics in the united states  and you have to wonder how they feel about one of trump s biggest supporters calling their religious leader the most evil figure in all christendom  featured image  facebook
