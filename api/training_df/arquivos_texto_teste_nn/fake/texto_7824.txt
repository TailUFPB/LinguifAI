on thursday during a visit to mexico city  mexico  vice president joe biden apologized to the citizens of our neighbor to the south for the hateful rhetoric they have been hearing from our nation s republicans   especially the hate speech coming from donald trump s campaign  there has been a lot of damaging and incredibly inaccurate rhetoric and i would argue  i almost feel obliged to apologize for some of what my political colleagues said  it is about mexico  it is about mexican people biden explained to president enrique pe a nieto that  it s a heated campaign season   and that republicans are willing to say pretty much anything to be declared king or queen of stupid mountain as they vie for the gop nomination  the words of trump or any of his colleagues  the vice president said  is the antithesis of how most americans feel  it s a heated campaign season and i just want you to know  mr  president  that the most heated rhetoric you ve heard from competitors for the nomination for president is not who we are as the american people  it is not the view that is the view of the majority of the american people  it s the exact opposite  it s the opposite view  the gop s rhetoric toward hispanics has been rather hateful  but donald trump has attracted the most scrutiny with his assertion that the mexican government sends people to the united states   people who  according to the billionaire bankruptcy expert  are all rapists  drug dealers  and murderers  in fact  he plans to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it  because trump is apparently too stupid to realize that tunnels are a thing trump s hate is so pervasive that two former mexican presidents have recently spoken up in opposition to the horrible rhetoric spouted at any of his rallies  in early february  felipe calderon informed trump that it is extremely unlikely that his country would build his signature campaign promise  we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall  and it s going to be completely useless  no offense  no offense to america  so donald trump   is ambitious but not exactly very well informed man  i don t want to say ignorant  but he is not very well informed  later in the month  former president vicente fox was a bit more blunt  i declare  i m not gonna pay for that f cking wall  trump s anti hispanic hate speech has even inspired violence against a completely  legal  homeless man  in august  two men  inspired  by donald declared that the billionaire was  right  before beating the helpless and unarmed man with a metal pipe and urinating on him  rather than condemn the attack  trump called the men  passionate  individuals who want to  make america great again  it is impressive that biden would take it upon himself to apologize   but those who truly bear the shame are our frenemies on the right  unfortunately  they will never apologize because they are incapable of feeling shame watch biden apologize below  featured image via screengrab
