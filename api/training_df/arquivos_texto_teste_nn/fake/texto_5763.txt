when congresswoman gabrielle giffords was shot in   congress refused to act  knowing it could happen to any of them at any time wasn t enough to spar action  when  children were killed in their classrooms at sandy hook in   congress did nothing  knowing their own kids could be next  they still decided it wasn t worth the effort then orlando happened  the worst mass shooting in american history  and still no action from the gop controlled congress so democrats decided to do a classic sit in  walk in  sit down  and refuse to leave until something  anything  was done to curb america s gun violence epidemic  dozens of democratic lawmakers are standing their ground on the house floor and refuse to budge  even as the house adjourns for a weeks long recess giffords  who is no longer a member of congress  has written an open letter of solidarity with her former colleagues dear member of the house and former colleagues there is nowhere i would rather be right now than with you on the floor of the people s house  representing southern arizona  fighting for our country  and working to make our communities safer  but your action is the balm for my regret and it is the inspiration for my continued commitment fighting gun violence takes great courage  i ve seen great courage when my life was on the line  i see great courage in many of you right now americans are grappling with a gun violence crisis  it is a crisis that tears apart the lives of so many americans and touches every community  it is both public and private  in our homes and on our streets  at work  at church  at the movies  at a dance club  at school and at school again  at a congress on your corner  the victims are young and old but always with so much life ahead of them  they are white and black  latino and asian  and native american  they are lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  queer  and straight  they are christian and muslim  jewish and sikh  they are veterans and government workers and union members  they are rich and poor  they die by murder  they die by suicide  and they die by negligence  often  they don t die  but they carry the scars  and their lives change forever if gun violence affects all of us americans  then the solution is not up to just some of us  we are all responsible for our safety today and for the country we pass on to our children tomorrow  it s what makes us a country  where our country has already come together behind the simple proposition that we ought to have laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people so must our congress  and they should not waste another minute we must not accept the world that will be the product of inaction in washington  we can do better  some states have already made progress they show us that when we put aside our incidental or momentary differences and stand shoulder to shoulder  we have enormous power it s been said that hope was forged of two powerful ingredients  anger at how things are  and the courage to change them  we will not be driven backwards to live in isolation from one another and in fear of violence thanks to you and millions of americans who share our values of pluralism  liberty  and responsibility we will stand strong and work toward a safer nation for all of us speaking is difficult for me  but i haven t been silenced  and neither should the american people  their representatives must vote to prevent gun violence sincerely gabrielle giffordsin an emotional tribute  gifford s best friend  rep  debbie wasserman schultz  read the letter to her house colleagues in the well of the house  as republicans sat in their offices  contemplating what to do next fixing america s violent obsession with guns has become giffords  life mission  along with her husband  astronaut mark kelly  giffords and thousands of parents of children lost to gun violence are rising up and taking on the nra head by storm  unmoved by temporary setbacks  at the hands of cowardly republican senators   the mobilization of giffords  efforts is gaining traction all across the country  with democrats and republicans alike who agree on one thing   no brainer gun reform  stricter background checks  no fly no buy  and no weapons for abusers and haters while the republicans close the doors  shut off the lights and collect their nra checks  democrats stand firm and stand with the people we all stand in solidarity with giffords  house democrats  and the millions of people affected by gun violence here in the united states and abroad featured image via justin sullivan getty images
