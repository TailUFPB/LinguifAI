texas attorney general ken paxton  already facing intense scrutiny for securities fraud in one case  was just slapped by the u s  securities and exchange commission with three additional charges of fraud based on an alleged illegal kickback deal paxton and a company had used to entice investors and enrich paxton by hundred of thousands of dollars but let s not bury the lede here  his defense for these pretty clearly illegal actions is bonkers paxton is accused of raising nearly a million dollars from prospective investors for a company called servergy inc  and illegally keeping it a secret that he would be directly benefiting from these deals  after he persuaded some wealthy friends to put    into the company  he got   shares of stock in the company  to outsiders   and investigators at the sec   this looked like a pretty clear example of quid pro quo securities fraud  it s very illegal to raise funds for a company without disclosing that you are benefiting from said funds for obvious reasons paxton  a republican elected by  under governor greg abbott  claims what he did wasn t what it looks like because he had always intended to pay for the shares until a miracle happened while innocently chowing down on some hot eats  cool treats at a dairy queen with the ceo of servergy inc   william mapp  during the meeting  according to paxton  mapp apparently heard the voice of god telling him not to accept a penny for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares  instead  mapp said they would be a gift to paxton this apparently is the defense paxton   an accomplished attorney   is going with the sec said paxton told investigators that the shares were a gift from mapp  not necessarily a commission  according to the complaint  paxton claimed he accepted the shares only after mapp refused to accept an offer from paxton to invest    of his own money in servergy  i can t take your money  god doesn t want me to take your money   mapp told paxton during a meeting at a dairy queen during the summer of  in mckinney  according to the sec it s unclear if the  god wanted me to have a strong investment portfolio  defense has ever been attempted in a securities fraud case  but it seems unlikely many juries would be persuaded  and it will be a particularly steep uphill climb for paxton in particular  who is already facing separate felony charges for similar crimes at the state level texas s state government has become a baffling menagerie of incompetence  corruption and scandal  governor greg abbott  when not endorsing fringe theories about obama invading the state  has allied himself with anti pharmaceutical scientologist groups who not only believe texas shouldn t money combating mental illness  but that mental illness doesn t exist  its previous governor  rick perry  recently barely escaped his own legal challenges after a lengthy court battle over his use of vetos while in office  the woman assigned to head the state s board of education is a home schooler who doesn t believe in science  another woman running for the board of education accused president obama of being a gay prostitute in any other state  saying a technology company ceo channeled god to make you rich would make you a laughingstock  in texas  he s just one of many featured image via drew angerer getty images
