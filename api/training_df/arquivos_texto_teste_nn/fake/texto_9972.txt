there s a lot going on in the hillary clinton donald trump russia investigation that all the highfalutin  newspapers that cover politics are still trying to ignore well  investors had better know this stuff before it bites them in the assets  so here goes numerous reports coming out of the senate judiciary committee last week said that former fbi director james comey made the decision not to refer clinton for prosecution long before he even interviewed key witnesses  including hillary remember  the republicans now control this committee  so bad news isn t going to be stifled anymore clinton  you probably remember   lost  her private emails  which she d been storing on a personal computer server  comey chastised her harshly in a televised speech but then said there was a unanimous decision not to recommend prosecution clinton s emails  which were stolen by the russians  have never been found  but as i ve mentioned numerous times  the messages are still in the possession of the national security agency  nsa   which offered to give them to the fbi comey turned down that offer  according to a source who has been very reliable i ve also mentioned that comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary  in fact  my source says that fbi agents were irate about the decision not to go after clinton    nyp
