after a clean sweep of victories for donald trump on tuesday night  he quickly took this as an indicator that he is the presumptive nominee for the republican party  he also took it as the perfect time to completely start to try to throw hillary clinton under the bus there s nothing a misogynist is more fearful of than a strong woman  let alone a strong woman who has actual policy proposals and far more experience for the job you re vying to have  and with hillary clinton nearly clinching the democratic nomination for president  and trump close to clinching the republican nomination  he went directly after clinton for being a woman  even claiming the only reason she s doing well is because of the  woman card  he said  the only card she has is the woman s card  she s got nothing else going  and frankly  if hillary clinton were a man  i don t think she d get five percent of the vote  the only thing she s got going is the woman s card  and the beautiful thing is  women don t like her  well  one woman who clearly didn t like all this talk of the  woman s card  was mary pat christie  wife of new jersey gov  chris christie  who was standing directly behind trump  when he uttered that phrase  she very visibly rolled her eyes christie s reaction was likely that of every woman across the nation who doesn t hate themselves for being a woman  trump is showing that he is absolutely terrified of hillary clinton  otherwise he wouldn t say such a ridiculous thing to try to sway the vote  hillary has more proper policy experience in her pinky finger than trump does in all ten of his tiny fingers keep showing your true colors  trump  because more women just like christie s wife will be setting the narrative for your campaign as they roll their eyes at your clear ineptitude rolling into november   chrischristie s wife mary pat reacts to  realdonaldtrump during his  woman s card  comments on  hillaryclinton pic twitter com   politico   politico  april    it  watch here it really does say it all featured image via video screen capture
