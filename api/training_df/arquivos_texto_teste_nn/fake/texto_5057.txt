paul manafort  the chair of donald trump s campaign  got slammed by jake tapper during a segment on cnn s state of the union sunday morning  manafort attempted to excuse trump s comment earlier this week regarding hillary clinton  during a campaign event in wilmington  north carolina  trump suggested that should clinton be elected  it might be up to  second amendment people  to take matters into their own hands and stop her before she gets rid of the second amendment  if she gets to pick her judges  nothing you can do folks  although the second amendment people maybe there is  i don t know   trump said on tuesday since then  trump and his campaign have received a significant blowback from the comments  trump and manafort have blamed the matter on the media  insisting they are twisting trump s words  those claims are repeated during the segment  host jake tapper said to manafort  here s the thing  it wasn t just reporters  it was republicans  it was people in washington  d c  who want mr  trump to win  at that point  tapper proves his point by finding one of the trump supporters who was in attendance at the event  the trump fan says that he was  aghast  by trump s remark  the point is most people did not interpret it that way  it was not at all meant to be a threat  but the point again is you could have covered what he was saying or you could try and take an aside and take the clinton narrative and play it out  you chose to do that instead  then manafort lists some recent news stories that reflect poorly on clinton  claiming that tapper only covers negative news stories about trump and positive stories about clinton  as a factual matter  on monday  my show covered mr  trump s speech  okay  we did  we covered mr  trump s speech  and we did cover those hillary clinton emails   tapper retorts   so  these things  just because you say them  they re not true  i mean  we have been covering the substance  we have been covering things that are bad  hillary clinton  you can watch manafort get creamed by tapper below featured image via video screen capture
