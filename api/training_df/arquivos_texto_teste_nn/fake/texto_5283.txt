as we all know  sarah palin is america s village idiot  but at least she would have only been vice president had republicans actually won eight years ago but donald trump is aiming to become president  and according to nicolle wallace he knows even less about foreign policy than sarah palin does and wallace would know  too  since she was a member of palin s staff during john mccain s  presidential campaign during an appearance on morning joe on thursday  joe scarborough mentioned the  historical fact  that when it came to foreign policy the former alaska governor was  woefully ignorant  and asked wallace to chime in on donald trump based on her experience trying to get palin up to speed  sarah palin went to bed with an open highlighter smeared on her face most nights because she was trying to learn   wallace said   she was up all night studying and she understood that she was on the ticket with a man who was respected around the world i don t know if this is a gender thing  but he s not even trying to learn  here s the video via youtube and there you have it  folks  donald trump is way more ignorant than sarah palin when it comes to foreign policy and he refuses to learn it s been obvious from the start  however  trump has not only insulted mexico and the   billion muslims around the world  he has stated that he intends to treat foreign policy like a business negotiation he has threatened to pull american support from nato  which would embolden russia  he has threatened to pull american support from japan and south korea  which would leave our two biggest allies in asia vulnerable  and he has said he wants to give nuclear weapons to both of those countries and saudi arabia as well  which would only increase tensions in both asia and the middle east while increasing the threat of nuclear war  trump has also said he won t rule out using nuclear weapons against europe  and that s just the tip of the iceberg this is the man republicans chose to be their nominee  this is the man they hope will be in the white house in   and he doesn t know a damn thing about foreign policy  republicans went from nominating an idiot for vice president to doubling down eight years later by nominating an even worse idiot for president  as many times as donald trump has claimed that the world is falling apart  he has no interest in learning what the problems are so that he can do something to help solve them  the only thing he wants to do is watch the world burn it s no wonder that wallace declared the republican party dead after trump s acceptance speech at the rnc convention last week  clearly  wallace knew from experience just how disastrous trump is as a candidate and how disastrous he would be to our nation  worse than sarah palin  and that says a lot featured image  screenshot
