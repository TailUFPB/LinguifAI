for those who think donald trump isn t bringing horrible racism out from the depths of the right wing s closet  there s rick tyler  an independent candidate running for office in tennessee s third congressional district  he s so worried about the  browning  of america that he s actually running his campaign on taking us back to the   when there were fewer problems  by making america white again yes  that s literally what he wants  he even had campaign billboards put up that said   make america white again   around benton  tenn  tyler claims that he s got no hatred for people of color  he just wants america to go back to a    ozzie and harriet  leave it to beaver time when there were no break ins  no violent crime  no mass immigration  right  there s totally no racism there  we re sure some of his best friends are people of color  too  he thinks that white people are the architects of advanced society  so elevating white people is the best way to  make america great again  he also had a billboard up that was a picture of the white house ringed with confederate flags  which said   i have a dream   for someone who allegedly isn t racist  he certainly enjoys racist sayings and symbols  and implying that people who aren t white are responsible for all our ills today to co opt one of the most famous messages from one of the most famous civil rights leaders in american history for his racist agenda is just vile how does trump fit into this  besides his rampant  blatant racism  tyler wrote the following on his website  he trump phenomenon has and will continue to produce spin off effects and fall out that can be beneficially seized upon by the elect remnant of the god of scriptures  in our present political season the dominant presence of donald trump has served to open us channels of discourse and dialogue that have previously been off limits  his advocacy of a  temporary ban  on muslim immigration and the construction of a wall on the southern border have created a climate conducive to conversation relative to the elephant in the living room no one wants to talk about namely  the urgent and vital subject of race  there it is  the hatred and fear of  political correctness  that pervades the thinking of these racists  they believe it s not racist at all to say that race plays a role in america s downfall  and imply that whites are the only race capable of restoring us to our former glory  nope  it s just  telling it like it is   and tyler seems to have embraced that trumpian mentality wholeheartedly the signs have been taken down  but tyler didn t do it  he wants them back up  saying he paid for them to be up through november s election  if i could i d have hundreds of these billboards up across the  district  that would go over just as well as his initial billboards did  tyler is delusional though  he believes that his signs do reflect the feelings of a majority of people  despite the people from tennessee s third district calling into wcrb tv to say that their county does not  in fact  feel this way  the billboards were likely removed because those people tyler thinks are so supportive of his views were actually upset featured image via screen capture from wrcb report
