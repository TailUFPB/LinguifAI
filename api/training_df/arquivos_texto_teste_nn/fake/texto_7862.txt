if you are or ever have been a member of the working poor  you have probably been screwed over by your bank  maybe you were out of gas or milk or needed medicine and you didn t have enough money in your account  but you really  really needed something so you swiped your debit card and were hit with an overdraft fee   you are not alone  millions of americans are charged these fees  usually about    in my experience   so many people are hit with these fees that they are very profitable for big banks  a new report has found that financial institutions made more than eleven billion dollars from these fees in   alone the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb    established by senator elizabeth warren in    issued the report and found that  banks  worth more than   billion  fleeced the american people out of    billion last year some of the highlights the cfpb reported about overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees overdraft fees are one of the most predatory practices of big banks  many of you have probably been hit by a bunch of overdraft fees at once  say you go to the store and you buy that gallon of milk  but other transactions haven t cleared in your account yet  that gallon of milk may cause you to incur multiple overdraft fees because the banks use  fee harvesting  software that reorganizes your transactions so that they can charge you multiple times these shady practices are one of the reasons banks are now required to disclose their overdraft fee profits  elizabeth warren had a big role in these new rules because of her crusade to save the middle class and the working poor from wall street s love of exorbitant consumer fees  in  warren said  people enroll in overdraft programs to avoid bouncing checks  but too many of them get stuck owing hundreds of dollars in unexpected fees for services they never wanted and didn t know they had   said warren  one of the nation s experts on bankruptcy and consumer credit    the new consumer agency is heading in the right direction to make sure that people have the tools and information they need to avoid these traps  the establishment of the cfpb has helped  in  banks made three times as much    billion  in fees from customers  but for the working class families who are struggling to survive  it s still not enough  we need real reform and banks because it is a huge problem when wall street s business model is  rob as many families as we possibly can  featured image via flickr
