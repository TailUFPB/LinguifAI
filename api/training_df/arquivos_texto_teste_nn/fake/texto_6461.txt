a lot of time people ask the question  why can t we just print more money to get rid of our debt  the answer is simple  if you just print more money  you will be completely devalue our currency  thus sending our nation into a destructive economic tailspin  much like germany in the early part of the  century and if you re donald trump  you re a ok with doing just that the self described business  genius  just showed the american people how truly stupid and inept he is today when he gave a reason as to why america should default on its debt  just print more money  and buy it back  appearing on cnn s new day  trump told host chris cuomo  people said i want to go and buy debt and default on debt  and i mean  these people are crazy  this is the united states government  first of all  you never have to default because you print the money  i hate to tell you  ok  trump s plan basically consists of this  we don t raise the debt ceiling  thus defaulting  but we won t default because interest rates will go up and we will use our liquid assets such as cash  which we ll print more of  to buy back bonds at a discount that will cover the debt according to the washington post the items in the federal budget that are the overwhelming drivers of long term deficits wouldn t really be helped if the government were to unleash massive inflation  the federal government has pledged to pay for medical care for the elderly  through medicare  for the poor  medicaid  and provide basic retirement income  social security  but for each of those programs  inflation wouldn t solve the government s financial problems  it would make them worse  to put it in the technical language  they are real obligations  not nominal obligations  so  in other words  medical costs would skyrocket and social security payments would have to freeze  etc  the country would be in chaos this comes after trump touted himself as the  debt king  who  loves debt  and would use his  experience  in debt to solve all our problems and make us great again and that means printing more money to give us a faux impression of economic security  the same impression that brought many nations to their knees this is the man who is supposed to be the economic genius and the one who will make america an economic powerhouse the level of stupidity is maddening featured image via mark lyons getty images
