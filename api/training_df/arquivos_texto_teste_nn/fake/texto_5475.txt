that s right  according to the latest nbc news wall street journal marist polls  zero percent of black voters say that they are supporting donald trump in the battleground states of ohio and pennsylvania  zero  zip  zilch  nada  surprised  nope  me either and it s likely that neither is anyone else who has been paying attention even a little trump is tied with hillary clinton in ohio  nbc reports that  percent of the  registered voters in the poll were african american and they went for clinton  percent to  percent clinton holds a nine point lead over trump in pennsylvania  of the  voters in the poll   percent were african american and they chose clinton  percent to  percent the nbc wsj marist polls were conducted between july   and also included iowa  but there were not enough african americans voters polled in that state for a statistically significant sample trump has said repeatedly that black people are going to vote for him and insists that they are going to like him  more than they like obama   why in the world he would have such a ridiculous notion is unclear  over and over we have seen black protesters assaulted at his rallies  often shouting such lovely sentiments as  light that motherf cker on fire  trump has made an appalling habit of retweeting white supremacists  white nationalists have made robocalls on his behalf in multiple states  at the same time  he has slammed the black lives matter movement for being too  divisive  and these examples don t even include his bigoted rhetoric towards mexicans and muslims he may deny it  but he knows he is in trouble when it comes to voters of color  that would be why he tweeted a fake photo of an african american family who supposedly supported him  no sane black person would even consider casting their vote for this racist piece of sh t egomaniac zero percent support is exactly what he should expect from the african american community  but judging from the way he has pandered to white supremacists  it is unlikely that these are the voters he s really after anyway  whether he admits it or not  though  he can t win the presidency without them featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
