when trying to figure out who these people are who are actually considering voting for trump  or have already  two things come to mind   they re either racist or just dumber than a bag of bricks trump has been so vague on policy and his supporters simply don t seem to care  they hear about his hatred of muslims and mexicans and come running in droves  his plans  a wall  the best wall  healthcare  the best healthcare  military  the best military  education  the best education  guns  he literally offers no specifics  he just says what comes to mind and these imbecilic supporters cheer  watch any rally and you ll soon realize that he s not running for the nation  he s running for himself  count how many times he mentions polls  notice how few times he mentions legitimate policy ideas  keep track of how many times he uses  me    my  or  i  this vagueness is working though  because while at a diner in nashville  tennessee  anna kooiman of fox news spoke with a trump supporter by the name of austin who said trump is a  proven businessman who has employed tens of thousands of people  he s a man that knows how to get the job done right  austin is basically just repeating  verbatim  what trump says at every single one of his rallies and events  trump proclaims over and over that he is a  great  businessman who has  employed tens of thousands of people  and  knows how to get the job done right   it s pretty much guaranteed that he ll say this at the next debate as well when kooiman pressed this trump supporter on why he thinks trump isn t specific on any policy  he replied  i am not concerned about that  i think he is not being specific so he does not give his competition everything that he s doing so they copy him  and fox news being fox news  kooiman said   there s a great theory there and he s a dealmaker  so  let s get this straight  trump isn t being specific because he doesn t want people to copy him  that s his grand plan to lure voters  that s like a salesman saying   i have this thing  and you re gonna love it  i just can t tell you what it is until you buy it   who in their right mind would buy something they know nothing about  apparently  this guy austin in nashville trump really wasn t kidding when he said he loves the  poorly educated  here s the video from huffington post    featured image via video screen capture
