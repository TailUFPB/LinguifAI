the new york times reports that donald trump is going to win the south carolina republican primary and remind everyone just how unbelievably racist southern republicans are with a campaign message about cracking down on illegal immigration and fighting middle eastern terrorism with methods including torture  mr  trump has built a commanding lead in south carolina polls  his results in the two early voting states so far have alarmed more traditional republicans  who fear that a trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of republicans as an angry and intolerant party  more traditional republicans  means the republicans who are perfectly fine with their base being rabidly racist as long as they keep it out of sight  but after  years of the southern strategy in which republicans appealed  almost nonstop  to the racial resentment and petty entitlement of white people in order to secure their vote  the base of the republican party has no room left for diversity in other words  they built that just to be clear on how screwed republicans are  nate silver s  predicts an   chance of a trump victory in south carolina  he s currently projected to win with   of the vote with rubio and cruz coming in at    and    respectively the times  like much of the media  is trying really  really hard to blame the racism of the gop base on trump as if he summoned it from thin air  this is part and parcel of the unspoken pact to pretend that the republican party is not an angry and intolerant party  but anyone who s paid the slightest attention to what republicans say and what they do is very aware that the rest of the party is exactly as racist as trump  they re just smart enough not to say it out loud  as long as they use dog whistles and coded language  republicans  aided by the corporate media  were able to pander to their racist base while still appealing to low information independents that didn t pay attention  trump is a threat because he s exposing them for who they really are and that will make them toxic to the majority of the country if trump  a pro choice new yorker that is not religious in any meaningful way can win big in bible thumping south carolina  it shows that racism is  indeed  the prime motivating factor of the republican party good luck spinning that  corporate media featured image via ai archives
