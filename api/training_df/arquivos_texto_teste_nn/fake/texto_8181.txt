president obama is nearing the end of his time in office and he s taking stock of everything that has happened since his first election   including a very special message to the people who refused to vote for him based solely on the color of his skin back in illinois to celebrate the ninth anniversary of his entry into national politics  obama sat down for fascinating interview with christi parsons  along with several of obama s former political mentors  as usual  the president was adamant that the only way forward for america is to end the kind of political partisanship that hampers any progress  nobody knows this better than he does  the challenges obama faced as president often came not from natural disasters  hostile enemies  or unforeseen economic setbacks  but simple sabotage from lawmakers who were hoping to score a few cheap political points at the expense of america this was  after all  the president who dealt with a congress whose senate leader claimed early into obama s first term that his number one objective was ensuring obama lost his next election but while obama was characteristically optimistic that america could be better than the ugliness he had seen  it was when the conversation turned to racism that he really delivered the knockout punch  the group was skeptical of whether obama was the victim of merely partisan bickering or if there was another factor going on  i think they were afraid of you  more so than anybody else  it s one thing   like with george bush or anybody else  they may think  well  we might suffer through him for two years   or two terms  but i think they were actually afraid of you  they were afraid of you for a couple of reasons  number one  you were black  and i talk to my republican friends   and i ve got a lot of them   and that s all they could ever talk about  was the race card  the race  you know   he s a nice guy   he s this  he s that  but he s black  well  get over it  for anyone who has been paying any attention to the way obama has been treated during his time in office  this should be a familiar story  it s no coincidence that this president is the only one in history to have to deal with years of  serious  reporters on  respected  news networks like fox  fair and balanced  remember   suggesting that he might not be from the united states  it s no coincidence that obama is often depicted at tea party rallies in highly racist iconography  sadly  it may be the  century but many americans still have a huge hang up about race obama seems aware of all of this  but he turns the tables on the depressing narrative in a brilliant way  look  i ve always said this  that i have no doubt that there are people who voted against me because of race  or didn t approve of my agenda because of race  i also suspect there were a bunch of people who were excited and voted for me  or i got political benefits because of the notion of the first african american president  so those things cut both ways i think that a lot of proof that we are a lot further along than we were is i got reelected  so it would be one thing if the first time that it was just an accident  the second time  i won again  and each time i got more votes in consecutive terms  so despite the racism facing him  obama really has proven just how far america has come  during his first election  nobody knew whether an african american could successfully be elected  he was  the second election  an unquestionable trouncing of whitest guy on earth mitt romney  just proved that things had only gotten better obama concludes  so although there s no doubt that there are pockets of the country where some dog whistles blow and there s underlying racial fears that may be exploited  overall  what s more the case i think is just the straight  hardball politics of running against an incumbent and beating the heck out of them and softening them up  because if a whole bunch of stuff gets done  he s going to get the credit  in other words  after his first election obama knew that it was time to put up or shut up  the best way to combat the  racial fears  and  dog whistles  was to succeed  it s clear that this strategy has been vindicated  racism is by no means dead  but obama s presidency will be defined not in  black and white  terms  but from a long list of victories and accomplishments no doubt this is rage inducing for the most racist americans who had hoped to see the first black president fail  instead  he proved them wrong and hastened their inevitable extinction  not bad  mr  president check out the full interview via the la times here featured image via the white house
