the nra claims to care about our military veterans but they just got busted desecrating a military cemetery by filming an anti hillary campaign ad without permission the  second ad shows benghazi attack survivor mark geist casually walking through the grave markers of our deceased military veterans in the midst of dramatic fear inducing music as he openly blames hillary clinton for the deaths of four americans at the u s  consulate in libya in september   a lot of people say they aren t going to vote this november because their candidate didn t win   geist began before pointing out that millions of veterans won t be voting this year because they are dead   well  i know some other people who won t be voting this year either  hillary as president   no thanks   he continues   i served in benghazi  my friends didn t make it  they did their part  do yours  the   million ad campaign then goes on to urge people to vote for donald trump here s the video via youtube as you can see  geist is clearly being filmed inside of a national cemetery where filming is prohibited by the department of veterans affairs  in order to film a commercial at such a sacred venue requires permission  which the nra didn t bother to seek because they knew they wouldn t get it  that s because their campaign ad is obviously partisan and is using the graves of dead soldiers to attack a political opponent va spokesman james hutton condemned the ad and confirmed that the nra did not seek nor did they receive permission  the national cemetery administration of the department of veterans affairs has not received or approved any filming requests of this nature  nca did not receive a request from the nra to film the subject advertisement  if we had received such a request  we would have denied it based on the partisan content  our veterans  their families and survivors are our top priority  to maintain the sanctity and decorum of va national cemeteries as national shrines  our filming policy states that filming may not be used for the expression of partisan or political viewpoints  or for uses that are  or may be interpreted as  an endorsement of a commercial entity  in short  the nra disgraced this country and themselves by using the graves of our fallen heroes in their political witch hunt against hillary clinton  and this comes in the wake of house republicans ending their four year long benghazi investigation which failed to find any evidence that clinton is to blame for the attack furthermore  it should be pointed out that the family of ambassador chris stevens  who also died in benghazi that day  do not hold hillary clinton responsible for the attack  in fact  they say the  underlying cause  for the lack of security is the way republicans have slashed security funding for u s  embassies and diplomatic personnel in the years prior to the attack  perhaps if congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world  then some of the requests for more security in libya would have been granted   said dr  anne stevens  the sister of ambassador stevens   certainly the state department is underbudgeted  i do not blame hillary clinton or  leon panetta  they were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world  and their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had  this is a sick campaign ad by the nra and they should be ashamed of themselves for sinking to this depth in what is obviously a desperation play because they know their republican nominee is getting his ass handed to him in the polls  if anything  this violation of the sanctity of the final resting place of many veterans  many of whom were probably not republicans or members of the nra  should enrage every american who claims to give a damn about the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country  the nra disrespected sacred ground and that cannot go unpunished featured image via screen capture
