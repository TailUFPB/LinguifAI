sarah palin s horrific word salad of an endorsement of donald trump on tuesday evening didn t make sense in any language resembling english  but a viral vine video puts palin s praise in the only context where it works  in the mouth of iggy azalea in the video from lindsey bieda entitled  iggy s freestyle has gotten quite a bit weaker   the words from azalea s rap breakdown have been replaced by audio of palin from the trump announcement instead of the australia born azalea s  fancy   we hear palin s eardrum piercing rhyme   right wingin   bitter clingin   proud clingers of our guns  our god  and our religions  in case you feel like the creator of the vine took poor palin out of context  this is the entire paragraph from that section of the speech  which would probably make the most epic rap video in history if it received the same treatment well  and then  funny  ha ha  not funny  but now  what they re doing is wailing   well  trump and his  uh  uh  uh  trumpeters  they re not conservative enough   oh my goodness gracious  what the heck would the establishment know about conservatism  tell me  is this conservative  gop majorities handing over a blank check to fund obamacare and planned parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs  and turning safety nets into hammocks  and all these new democrat voters that are going to be coming on over border as we keep the borders open  and bequeathing our children millions in new debt  and refusing to fight back for our solvency  and our sovereignty  even though that s why we elected them and sent them as a majority to dc  no  if they re not willing to do that  then how are they to tell us that we re not conservative enough in order to be able to make these changes in america that we know need to be now they re concerned about this ideological purity  give me a break  who are they to say that  oh tell somebody like  phyllis schlafly  she is the republican  conservative movement icon and hero and a trump supporter  tell her she s not conservative  how  bout the rest of us  right wingin   bitter clingin   proud clingers of our guns  our god  and our religions  and our constitution  tell us that we re not red enough  yeah  coming from the establishment  right got that at least with the azalea video you don t have to watch trump off to the side  leering as he watches the grotesque display go on and on and on featured image via youtube vine
