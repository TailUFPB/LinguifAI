marco rubio has officially joined the anti trump squad  rubio is now urging his supporters in ohio to vote for their governor john kasich ohio is kasich s home state and is the only candidate who has a shot of taking down trump in their primary election  michigan proved that kasich has wide support in the rust belt region of the midwest  though he did not have enough support in the peninsula to actually take down trump rubio s campaign director  alex conant  told cnn that he and the campaign recognize that rallying behind kasich is their best chance of keeping ohio s  delegates out of trump s hands  polls show trump ahead in ohio but if non trump supporter republicans go all in on kasich  it might be enough for the candidate to take the state  if you are a republican primary voter in ohio and you want to defeat donald trump  your best chance in ohio is john kasich   conant told cnn on friday like any good communications director would conant took the opportunity to drive the point home that what holds true for kasich in ohio  is also true of rubio in florida  if you re a voter and marco rubio is not necessarily your first choice   if you like john kasich or you like ted cruz and you re here in florida  you need to vote for marco rubio because he s the only one who can deprive donald trump of those  delegates   conant went on to say   and if we stop donald trump here in florida  we can stop him in cleveland  he will not be the republican nominee  rubio does stand the best chance to steal away with florida s  delegates  that s actually a huge problem for republicans  polls show trump blowing rubio out of the water in the gator state  in order for rubio to take florida  both ted cruz and kasich supporters would have to go all in for rubio that doesn t seem likely  cruz s campaign has burned many bridges with rubio s campaign during the election  as the runner up  cruz also has to maintain the posturing that comes with that position one thing is for sure  next tuesday s elections will probably decide who will take the republican presidential nomination  for rubio  it will almost certainly be the end of his significance in the race  if not the end for him altogether you can watch the relevant portion of the interview below featured image from gage skidmore via flickr
