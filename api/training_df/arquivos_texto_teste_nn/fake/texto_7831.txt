imagining what donald trump would be like as the next president of the united states is terrifying for every level headed american  in fact  most of us don t even want to think about what it would be like bill maher gave us an awful dose of reality on real time last night  when he imagined what a state of the union address from the current republican presidential front runner might look like  the enactment was prefaced with maher pointing out the irony of trump s complaints that former mexican president vicente fox had used foul language to fire back at him after he pledged to make mexico pay for the construction of his beloved u s  mexico border wall if he became president  fox s amazing response to that was  i m not going to pay for the f cking wall  and he refused to comply when trump demanded an apology for the comment amused with trump s complete lack of self awareness  maher quipped on his show  donald trump must admit that  of all his reversals  hypocrisies  and   his condemnation this week of vicente fox for using foul language is the most ridiculous of all  talk about the pot calling the kettle orange  as maher rolls footage of the republican front runner cursing in several public speeches  the fact that trump is pretending to be offended by fox becomes even more hilarious maher then moved on to tackle trump s disturbing popularity with the use of his alias   andrew dice trump   maher commented that the reason trump had risen so high was because voters like his crass way of speaking  maher remarked  they kind of like it when a politician drops the facade and talks the way we all really talk  and to explore just what a future trump presidency might look like  maher acted out a state of the union address to show just how political discourse could go if america doesn t wake up soon and realize that we re better than bigotry and outlandish comments  assuming the position of trump in the scene  maher cursed his entire way through the distasteful address and announced that  the state of our union is f cking awesome  sadly  maher captured trump perfectly and this is probably a very realistic representation of what a speech by president trump might look like  you can watch maher s enactment below  featured image is a compilation from gage skidmore and a screenshot
