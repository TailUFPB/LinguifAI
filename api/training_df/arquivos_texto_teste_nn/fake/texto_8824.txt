david duke is perhaps one of the most notorious grand wizards of the ku klux klan alive today  he also had quite a bit to say about maine governor paul lepage s recent racist rant  lepage suggested that black drug dealers are coming into his state and selling drugs  and while they re at it  getting white women pregnant of course  the backlash was ferocious for lepage s remarks  and he tried to walk them back   but david duke  being the vile racist that he is  devoted airtime on a recent edition of his radio show to defend lepage  calling lepage s racism the trump effect of people not talking in politically correct manner   duke said  you are probably picking yourself off the floor to think that an elected governor in the united states of america would actually talk about this horrible destruction and defilement of young white women  these are not anglo saxon guys from rural maine doing this  these are  again  like the puff diddys   or whatever they want to call themselves   from new york  so  a black man having sex with a white woman is  defilement   these remarks are especially egregious  considering the history in the united states of black men being lynched at the drop of a hate when a white woman cries rape  in the eyes of racists  there is nothing worse than a white woman coupling with a black man  if david duke thought the historical context of what he is saying here would be lost on the rest of us  he is dead wrong duke also had a guest on his show who echoed his racist beliefs  pastor mark dankof  duke and dankof then turned their attentions to democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton  because of her speaking out against police brutality against people of color  duke said to dankof  isn t this the same hillary clinton who has constantly told us about black people being victimized by police  she says that this is a racist problem that police are shooting down blacks  when the fact is  they shoot down proportionally a far higher capita of a white person who acts criminally  this is a lie  of course  see the bundy militia for exhibit a  if those were black people  they d have been dead the first day  and that  ladies and gentlemen  is white privilege  but then again  of course the likes of david duke would never understand that  and nor would he want to duke s full comments can be heard here  at his media archive featured image via screen capture from raw story
