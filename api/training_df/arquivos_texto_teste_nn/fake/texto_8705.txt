while republicans continue to reveal their true colors by openly complaining about the release of american prisoners in iran  president obama is using his latest diplomatic success to teach his critics a lesson in what effective leadership really looks like obama had deliberately waited to talk about the hostage exchange until the american prisoners were out of iran and safe  but upon news that the swap was a success and that the united nations had certified that iran was upholding its end of a landmark nuclear disarmament deal  the white house held a press conference that quickly turned into a  teachable moment  for those who had irresponsibly advocated for war over diplomacy  this is a good day  because once again we re seeing what s possible with strong american diplomacy   obama said at the white house  yesterday marked a milestone in preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon   he noted   most of important of all  we achieved this historic progress through diplomacy  without resorting to another war in the middle east  and yet  somebody might want to tell the republican party that a victory like this without a single shot fired is considered a good thing  the friends at fox and friends were practically despondent when they had to tell their audience that the american prisoners in iran were coming home a good day for america is a bad one for fox obama s negotiations were a massive blow to their narrative for years  republicans have insisted that the only way to get iran to listen to the united states is through threats of war  infamously  republican sen  john mccain ran for president on the platform of  bomb  bomb  bomb  iran   even now  certain conservatives regret not being able to send troops into another middle eastern conflict  war is a tough addiction to kick nobody knows how much republicans want war than president obama  he s been boxing out the war mongers for years  during his comments  he took a dig at those who say war is the only answer citing the cooling of tensions with iran  obama pointed out that his  smart  patient and disciplined approach to the world  has yielded results  america can do   and has done   big things when we work together   obama said   we can lead this world and make it safer and more secure  but we can only do that if we stop listening to those who think threatening violence will make us look tough  america has tried that approach for decades and the situation with iran had only been deteriorating  the change in recent months cannot be overstated the nuclear talks have brought a sense of normalcy to relations with the u s  and iran  with top officials from each country in somewhat regular communication  while obama emphasized that the u s  continues to have deep concerns about iran s destabilizing actions in the middle east and its threats to israel  he also opened up the prospect of tehran working more cooperatively with the rest of the world it s worth noting that those who want war with iran represent a small minority of americas   mostly republican politicians and fox news hosts  it s not a coincidence that mccain s  bomb iran  campaign strategy contributed to his being absolutely smoked by obama s  smart  patient and disciplined  one in the election  it s also not a big secret that americans are tired of sending young kids off to die in intractable wars in the middle east  with the wars in iraq and afghanistan finally winding down  it s only those in the gop who seem eager to embark on a new one if accomplishing america s goals of neutralizing iran s nuclear program while avoiding war was the goal   and for most of the country  it was   then this deal represents a massive success for the country  for the bloodthirsty  it probably stings a little  obama s clearly not sorry featured image via white house
