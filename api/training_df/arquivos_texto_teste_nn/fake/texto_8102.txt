the cops are out of control  they have appointed themselves judge  jury  and executioner in too many cases to count now  and here is yet another  police in san francisco executed a  year old black man  mario woods  by shooting him twenty one times  two of those shots were to his head  according the an autopsy report obtained by local cbs affiliate kron  in this particular case  san francisco chief of police greg suhr did the usual  and lied about a dead man s actions in order cover up the fact that his officers used excessive deadly force against woods  claiming that the suspect lunged at the officers and refused to drop the knife he was supposedly carrying  woods was being approached because the cops believed that he had stabbed someone  however  video taken by witnesses reveal otherwise  woods did not lunge at anyone  and he was outnumbered five to one with armed and trained police officers thanks to the medical examiner s report and the fact that the bullet casings from all  shots that were fired have been found  the cops have been forced to backtrack on their lies  they are now saying that the current narrative appears to corroborate facts gathered by investigators in the aftermath of this tragic incident   they went on to say  the department is committed to a thorough review of the shooting and this report will be an important component of all three ongoing independent investigations  the shooting is under investigation by the police department itself  as well as two other independent city agencies  the san francisco district attorney s office  and the san francisco office of citizen complaints  likely  they hope to be able to investigate themselves and find that they did nothing wrong  not so fast on this one  though the mayor of san francisco  ed lee  has inquired of the department of justice and attorney general loretta lynch for a federal investigation into this deadly shooting  the san francisco board of supervisors want an investigation into not only this police shooting  but those of two other black men who were shot and killed by san francisco cops  that blue wall of silence won t help ya on this one  boys mario woods  mother  gwendolyn woods  has also filed a wrongful death suit against the city  her attorney  john burris  says of the situation  the fact is he was shot in the back  the significance to me is most of the officers who were shooting were not being threatened at the time they fired those weapons  of course  the cops and the city are trying to paint mario woods in a bad light  saying in their response to mrs  woods  lawsuit that her son advanced abruptly toward the officers  and an armed and dangerous suspect in a violent felony  but john burris isn t buying that  and says that woods was not a threat to the lives of the officers  despite the fact that the city says that those cops were in the right  but burris says  you know you can t just use deadly force against someone who is not threatening you  and that is the bottom line  in this case  and so many others  cops use deadly force not because it was warranted  but because they can  and then they get their stories straight and cover it up  that is absolutely despicable  and yet in so many cases they get away with it sue the hell out of them  mrs  woods  i hope you have their badges  too featured image from video screen capture via filming cops
