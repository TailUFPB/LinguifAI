mississippi republican karl oliver just gave the most honest  and most  accurately republican  response that may have ever been given in the history of the modern republican party  to a resident of his state becky guidry sent rep  oliver an email over her concerns about mississippi s planned tax breaks that their republican controlled legislature is considering  the legislature plans to underfund the state s revenue to catastrophic levels by removing income and corporate franchise taxes  it s not a silly concern since kansas republicans have had what can only be considered a post apocalyptic budget and economy ever since they pulled these same shenanigans there guidry s letter is as follows  it is irresponsible of our leadership to suggest eliminating income and corporate franchise taxeswhen  revenue projections are already down  budgets for various services are being cut across the board  funding for public education and other critical services such as child care  foster care and roads bridges are underfunded  if and when this bill reaches the full house for a vote  again  i urge you to vote no  source  clarion ledgerguidry has a well thought out and practical opinion  republicans  however  do not care rep  oliver s spiteful and ignorant response is below mrs  guidry i normally don t return emails that do not request a response  but i found yours so intriguing i simply felt led to respond i see you are not a native to the great state of mississippi nor do you and i have similar political views  the people of our great state overwhelmingly share my same or similar views on government responsibility  i appreciate you going to the trouble to share yours with me  but quite frankly  and with all due respect  i could care less  i would  however  recommend that there are a rather large number of like minded citizens in illinois that would love to see you return with warmest personal regards karl oliversource  clarion ledger i could care less   he probably meant he could not care less  but as the colloquial expression is often said this way  his intent was obvious  as sickening as a response like this is  it is really the most correct one that could possibly be given by a republican  he s right  they really could care less what s good for the people in a town  state  or the entire nation  taking all the poor people s money and giving it to the rich is exactly what jesus would do  right guidry was absolutely shocked and appalled by the response  my interpretation was since i was not born here that my opinion just doesn t count  my husband s family is here   i work and pay taxes  my son goes to public schools in the gulfport school district  we re involved in our community  source  clarion ledgerthis is the new level of contempt that republicans have for america  a trump trickle down seems to be beginning  where authoritarianism and unaccountability are the new  freedom  featured image via wjtv
