in what was either an interview with cnn s jake tapper or a very public suicide note  marco rubio   broken  sad  and tired   suddenly had a lot of good things to say about donald trump  the man he once called a lunatic incapable of being president  rubio  like chris christie and ben carson before him  has done a complete  degree turn on the issue of trump   which isn t as hard as it sounds if your spine is made of jelly speaking with tapper  rubio revealed one humiliating detail after another about his evolution  according to his own account  rubio has privately apologized to trump for once implying that he had small hands  and a small penis   a conversation that would have been amazing to overhear  i actually told donald   one of the debates  i forget which one   i apologized to him for that   rubio said   i said   you know  i m sorry that i said that  it s not who i am and i shouldn t have done it   i didn t say it in front of the cameras  i didn t want any political benefit  he also shrugged off trump s overwhelming popularity with white supremacists  apparently  the fact that groups as toxic and hateful as the ku klux klan and various neo nazis adore trump doesn t bother rubio  or maybe he s just come to accept that this is what the republican party stands for these days  as he says it  it is what it is  it is what it is  might be something you say when you find a little dent on your car in the parking lot  it should not be what you say to dismiss widespread racism thriving within the campaign of the man you just endorsed for president  yikes however the most egregious demonstration of just how feckless rubio has become came when the conversation turned towards hillary clinton  when tapper asked rubio what he thought about trump using outrageous lies like  the clintons killed a man in the   and  bill clinton is a serial rapist   the former presidential candidate said he didn t necessarily agree with the tactic  but trump should keep doing it because it helps him get votes  i don t think he should change if he s been successful   rubio said when asked about trump dredging up scandals of the  to attack hillary clinton  which rubio said he himself wouldn t do   i may not like that direction  but at this point  he won and this is the direction that he won on  all of this would be shocking if it weren t so obvious that this was how things would eventually play out  ben carson  trump s least popular campaign surrogate  has dealt with a similar situation  only worse  he had to grovel in front of a man who once said he was little better than a child molester  at least rubio was just called  little marco  for the sacrifice of both his integrity and his political career  rubio gets to look forward to a long campaign of being further humiliated by trump  chris christie has been forced to endure several instances of degradation at the hands of the guy he now wants to elect president  considering rubio s heritage  it seems plausible that trump will both use him a token latino and also a punching bag when he needs to rile up his anti immigrant flock  dark days are ahead for rubio   and he knows it throughout his interview with tapper  rubio s face oscillated between pained expressions  selling out is never fun watch a portion of rubio s interview with tapper see if you can pinpoint the exact moment rubio s soul dies below featured image via cnn
