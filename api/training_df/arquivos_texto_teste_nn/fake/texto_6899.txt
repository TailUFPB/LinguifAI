there is a saying    in politics  a gaffe is when you accidentally tell the truth   with that in mind  sean hannity just committed the most epic of gaffes during his own radio show when he forgot everything and admitted the truth about not only himself but fox news as well the issue being discussed was hannity s softball interviews with donald trump  while most of the republican establishment are doing everything they can to stop trump  hannity has been practically turning over his own show to trump for his propaganda purposes in every interview he conducts with him hannity has gotten some recent blowback on this behavior and took it very personally  it got him so worked up and upset  that in a moment of anger fueled honesty he blurted out   i m not a journalist   well  look who hit the final stage of grief   acceptance sean finally admitted the thing he s been denying for years  the fact that he s nothing but a screaming loser who has as much journalistic ability as a rotten egg  i ll be honest  if i m interviewing hillary clinton  it s going to be  times harder than any republican  because i believe the republicans have a far better vision  one that i agree with  i just have less disagreement with them  i m not a journalist  i m a talk show host  fair and balanced    the hell you say it surely has to be uncomfortable for the fox news executives in charge of hannity to be put into this pickle  he s a huge cash cow for them  yet now he s admitting that not only himself   but fox news by extension in their employment of him   are nothing but hacks stirring a huge stinking pot of propaganda stew that they force feed gullible americans every night listen to hannity destroy that final scrap of his credibility below featured image via youtube screen capture
