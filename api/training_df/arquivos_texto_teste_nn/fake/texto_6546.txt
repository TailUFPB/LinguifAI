according to ted cruz and many of his staunchest supporters  god ordained him to be the next president of the united states back in august  an iowa republican literally claimed that god prepared ted cruz to be president  we need someone who will go to washington and throw the money changers out   iowa gop chair matt schultz declared   god raises special men and women to protect his people  and i believe this is one of those moments in time    ted cruz is that man who god has prepared for this moment in time  in addition  cruz s wife claimed that god sent her a sign that her husband should run for president and cruz s father rafael declared his son the  anointed one  of course  conservative  christians  bought this hook  line  and sinker  and now they are devastated because cruz defied god s wishes and dropped out of the race american family association spokesman bryan fischer expressed his disappointment on twitter and called for writing in cruz s name on the ballot instead of voting for donald trump tonight is a bad night for ted cruz  but it is a terrible night for the united states  our children  and our grandchildren   bryan fischer   bryanjfischer  may     states allow write in votes for president  does the write in campaign for ted cruz start tomorrow   bryan fischer   bryanjfischer  may    supporters had the sads as well  expressing their condolences on his facebook page and one cruz supporter blamed just about everyone except cruz himself for the defeat right wing talk show host steve deace threw a hissy fit after cruz dropped out by immediately leaving the republican party and declaring that america wanted to be spanked by god by voting for trump  the country missed an opportunity here with an imperfect vessel to try and take a step back towards the righteous path  but it is what it is   deace wrote   and yes  there are things cruz could ve done differently  but when you re up against a zeitgeist as well as a long overdue providential spanking  there s only so much anyone can do  america clearly dodged a bullet by cruz dropping out of the race  while the debate continues on whether or not trump actually believes what he has been saying  cruz definitely believed every word that came out of his own mouth  including his intention to discriminate against non christians and gay people as well as outlawing abortion to the point where he would even force rape victims to carry pregnancies to term but the bottom line here is that ted cruz literally believed that god wanted him to become president in november  yet he dropped out of the race anyway  apparently  reality trumped faith on tuesday night  and evangelicals can t handle the truth featured image  flickr
