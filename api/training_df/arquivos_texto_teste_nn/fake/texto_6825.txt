ted cruz just keeps proving that he does not legitimately want to be president at every chance he gets  the latest dumbassery from his campaign came when his  national security advisor  frank gaffney  started lobbying members of congress to refuse to meet with the people participating in the national muslim advocates day nmad is an event where muslim americans across the nation go to washington  d c  to meet with their representatives in order to voice opinions on public policy  and to also make attempts at outreach from the muslim american community to help bridge some of the cultural gaps that have developed in america seems pretty reasonable  right  we keep hearing how muslims don t  do enough  to combat the threat of islamic extremism in the united states from literally every republican  however  when republicans get their chance to meet with muslims and do something productive  they turn coward  run and hide and people say  they hate us for our freedom   yeah right the u s  council of muslim organizations released the following statement  regarding cruz s outright cowardice of both him and his campaign staff in meeting with them this evening  representatives of the us council of muslim organizations  uscmo   a coalition of leading national and local american muslim groups  will hold a news conference on capitol hill in washington  d c   to condemn the refusal of gop presidential candidate sen  ted cruz  r tx  and his congressional staff to meet with muslim constituents during today s second national muslim advocacy day on capitol hill some  muslim delegates from  states are meeting with a third of the house of representatives and almost half of the senate earlier today   texas muslim delegates to the national muslim advocacy day on capitol hill tried to meet with either sen  cruz or a member of his congressional staff  but were told no one would meet with them  the delegates had tried to arrange a meeting for several weeks prior to today s event source  right wing watchso  if ted and his entire campaign parade of idiots are too frightened to actually meet with some regular americans who happen to be muslim  how will they ever find the courage to fight isis  it s a question that needs an answer ted cruz can t stop reminding us how he loves religious freedom and the constitution  however  he condemns people for their choice of religion and denies them their right to petition their government  which just happens to be in the constitution  it really makes you wonder if ted even understands that he s running for president and not on a reality show when trump wins the nomination  and republicans act surprised  they can look at their golden boy cruz and remember they have nobody to blame but themselves for losing  listen to the cruz campaign explain why america would be insane to vote for him below  featured image via spencer platt   getty
