the democratic debate on sunday night was a little more tense than usual between candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders  the two went head to head and actually discussed important issues that needed to be talked about   unlike their republican counterparts who choose to make every debate about things like discussing hand size and trading personal jabs truth be told  the republicans left running lack any and all substance  they can t properly answer any questions on domestic or foreign policy  and most certainly are unable to be polite with one another on the other hand  there are the democrats  when they get a little loud debating back and forth  it s not about who has the biggest dick or who has the best polls numbers  they actually discuss policy  and are equally as passionate when defending their positions however  there was a moment during the democratic debate when the gop debate was brought up  and while hillary did point out how absurd they are  bernie took it one further and laid down an absolutely spot on one liner sanders hilariously said  when you watch these republican debates  you know why we need to invest in mental health  a truer statement has never been spoken  these republican candidates are not only national embarrassment  they may be certifiably insane watch the hilarious moment here   berniesanders   when you watch these republican debates  you know why we need to invest in mental health  pic twitter com   politico   politico  march    image via video screen capture
