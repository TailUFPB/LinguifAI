don trump jr   the privileged  wealthy son of republican presidential candidate donald trump  showed everyone watching fox news on tuesday night that the apple doesn t fall far from the tree  and that his father isn t the only horrible person carrying the last name speaking with greta van susteren   year old don not only defended his father s horrific violent outbursts  but said that trump s temper tantrums showed the flip side to free speech  this was in response to an incident on monday  where trump flipped out at a heckler that interrupted his rally in nevada  the front runner said he wanted to punch the protester in the face  giving a rather detailed description of how he d like to hurt the man with threats like you know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this  they d be carried out on a stretcher  folks  i think that s the sentiment you see from the average person  they re sick of being beat up  they re sick of being pushed around by everyone  they re sick of not having a voice anymore  that s just something that s unusual  trump has actually become infamous for the violence at his campaign rallies   which he has usually encouraged  people who are brave enough to show up and protest are usually met with threats and sometimes physical assaults  even in instances where they re being completely peaceful  silent and merely holding a sign  but to trump and his son  any violence that comes to protesters for using their first amendment rights is completely deserved  don said  i mean  if someone s trying to break up something  doing a great thing  there s   people in a room  watching an incredible event  and someone s trying to heckle them  i mean  i think it s a pretty natural response  and i think people love that he s honest about that  he doesn t pretend   oh  that s great  he s exercising whatever it may be  his freedoms   he s going to say it like it is  and that s what s resonating so well with the american people  von susteren brought up the fact that even protesters have a right to free speech  and asked don if he thought there was  something special  about those rights  don agreed that the first amendment is indeed special  but probably not in the way von susteren expected  don said  i agree  percent  greta  and there s something special about being able to say   i want to punch that person in the face   it works both ways  i think it s great that people can exercise that  and he should be able to exercise his right to say what he wants about it  he s finally saying the things that people are thinking in their minds  when they re being beat up by government or they re being pushed around  he s saying what the hard working  blue collar  middle class american family is thinking  he s giving them a voice  he s talking with them  he s talking to them  he s not talking at them  like regular politicians are doing  and that s why he s getting such a warm reception everywhere we go  you can watch don disgracefully endorse his father s behavior below featured image is a screenshot
