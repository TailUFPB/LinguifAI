in a strong southern drawl that makes his bigotry all the more enraging  mississippi governor phil bryant attempted to defend his state s anti lgbt law by whining about persecution of christians  which is something that doesn t exist when bryant signed house bill  into law last month  republicans made it legal for christian business owners to discriminate against lgbt people as well as unmarried people who have premarital sex  basically  as long as these bigoted business owners use religion as a shield they can discriminate against anyone they want but bryant defended the law during an appearance on a religious right wing radio show by openly whining about the so called persecution of christians according to bryant  christian business owners are being discriminated against when they are asked to provide service to gay people or atheists or anybody else the owner hates of course  that s not discrimination at all  discrimination against a christian would be if a muslim business owner refused to do business with a customer simply because of their religious beliefs  or if a gay cake baker refused to make a cake for a christian heterosexual couple  if a customer is trying to do business with you  that s not discrimination at all  it s a customer making a transaction in good faith with money  which only helps the business nevertheless  bryant thinks the aclu is unfairly suing the state because he claims the law is all about preventing imaginary discrimination against christians and is not about discriminating against lgbt people at all  i mean  they cherry pick these issues  if they had any integrity at all  they would say   we understand mississippi is actually trying to make sure that christians and people of other faiths are not discriminated against   it is a nondiscriminatory law  it prevents discrimination against simply that segment of the population that has a deeply held religious view about marriage  nobody is saying that bigoted christians can t have an opinion about marriage  but that opinion does not give them the right to refuse service to a gay couple despite the fact that republicans in mississippi and north carolina have given business owners a license to bully lgbt people  bryant complained about alleged bullying and threats from corporations and repeated the conservative myth that transgender protections will allow men to shower in women s locker rooms and use women s bathrooms  we re criticized  we re threatened  we re bullied  we re told by corporations that we re doing the wrong thing   bryant said   where on earth have we come to simply say   i do not wish my daughter in her school or in her university to have to have a male in the shower and in the dressing room and in the restrooms  the fact is that in  states and over  cities that have passed transgender protections there has not been a single instance of a predator using the protections as a defense to commit sexual assault  the only men who gone inside women s bathrooms are the ones the conservative family research council has sent into them in order to scare people into supporting the bigoted laws bryant concluded by claiming that americans support the laws and that they are  common sense  laws  i think the rest of the nation is beginning to wake up and say   what world do they think we re living in  this is not hollywood  this is not more liberal areas  this is america  where common sense still prevails  here s the audio via right wing watch true common sense is knowing what real discrimination and persecution looks like  and that means bryant has no clue what the hell he is talking about  these anti lgbt laws legalize bigotry against a certain group of people under the guise of religious freedom  a freedom that conservatives have abused for too long  and considering the outrage against bigoted states like north carolina and mississippi since they passed their bigoted laws  it looks like most americans damn well have common sense  the common sense to know what hate  discrimination  and bullshit looks like when they see it  or in this case  hear it featured image via wikimedia
