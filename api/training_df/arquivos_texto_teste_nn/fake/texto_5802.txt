the donald trump campaign is in trouble  and it s showing  in a very surprising move  trump has cut ties with his notoriously angry campaign manager corey lewandowski  infamously  the campaign manager was once videotaped  and nearly charged  for assaulting a reporter at one of trump s notoriously violent rallies  now  he s out the door  and no one is quite sure why  the trump campaign released the following cryptic statement regarding lewandowski s exit  the donald j  trump campaign for president  which has set a historic record in the republican primary having received almost  million votes  has today announced that corey lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign  the campaign is grateful to corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future  this move comes amid the fact that trump s democratic rival hillary clinton has pumped more than   million into advertising in key general election battleground states  while trump has not started advertising at all  further  there is a renewed and growing effort among the  dumptrump faction of gop delegates who do not want trump as their presidential nominee  the newly formed group  dubbed  free the delegates   is aimed toward unbinding delegates who are bound to trump and allowing them to vote their conscience instead the thing is  the way trump shook up the primary season with his outrageous remarks that fired up the ignorant  bigoted unwashed masses in the gop s insane base simply isn t working in the general election  lewandowski was definitely an issue  with his hot temper  that  along with trump s own uncontrollable mouth simply could not continue i suppose their recognizing these facts is good for the gop and the trump campaign  but it is likely too late  the general electorate has seen what trump is selling  and nobody is buying it  he s a racist  sexist  xenophobic buffoon  and america does not want him as our next commander in chief  hopefully  this signals a death knell for trump s nutty campaign  and we can focus on moving the nation forward when we elect hillary clinton in november featured image via drew angerer getty images
