after only  hours  microsoft was forced to pull the company s experimental  chat bot  from twitter microsoft s chat bot  which the company had nicknamed tay  was introduced to twitter earlier this week  the bot was designed to interact with people on social media while internet bots are nothing new  tay was unique because of the bot s ability to learn new things from the people it interacted with on twitter it didn t take the internet long to teach tay how to be a full blown racist  sexist asshole image credit  taytweets on twitter  via the los angeles timesanother unique feature of microsoft s wonder bot was that it would repeat anything a twitter user told it to here s a screen capture of what that looked like  courtesy of the international business times  image credit  taytweets courtesy of international business timesapparently none of the geniuses at microsoft saw any of that coming when they developed a chat bot that would learn from  and repeat after  everyone on the internet before microsoft finally removed the bot from twitter  it had tweeted out nearly every offensive  racist  sexist comment the internet could come up with tay tweeted  hitler was right i hate the jews   and i f  hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell  not surprisingly  considering the people the bot was interacting with on the internet  tay repeatedly praised donald trump and his racist agenda  even tweeting at one point  we re going to build a wall  and mexico is going to pay for it  after removing the bot from the internet  microsoft issued an apology for its inappropriate and offensive tweets  saying in a statement  we are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from tay  which do not represent who we are or what we stand for  nor how we designed tay  the statement went on to say  although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system  we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack  as a result  tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images  we take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time  it seems to me that anyone who has spent even a little bit of time on the internet would have absolutely seen this possibility ahead of time image credit  screen capture taytweets on twitter via international business times
