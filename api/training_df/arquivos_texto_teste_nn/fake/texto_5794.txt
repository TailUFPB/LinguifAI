there s no question that donald trump is running a  ahem  unique campaign  it s so unique that he s self funded it into being broke  his fec filings  through may  of this year  reveal an awful lot more than that  though  the campaign has paid millions to his own businesses and property  including his ridiculously luxurious plane  and mar a lago  his personal estate in florida derek willis  a journalist at propublica  tweeted out a spreadsheet that propublica put together of all campaign disbursements to things with  trump  in the name  in total  the campaign has paid nearly    million to trump s own businesses since he launched it last year recipients of payments from trump campaign with  trump  in name  through may   doesn t include mar a lago planes  pic twitter com   derek willis   derekwillis  june    first  that doesn t sound like a lot  maybe trump is actually reining himself in  that s less than five percent of his total campaign expenditures  but this is king donald  and that s not nearly everything  the campaign has also spent    for the use of mar a lago  which is a personal residence  and roughly   million to tag air  inc  the company that operates his private boeing  with the solid gold seatbelt buckles for the use of his plane that brings the total up to roughly    million that trump s campaign has paid to him for one thing or another  and that s more than  percent of the   million that his campaign has spent since he formally entered the race last year how does he get away with that  is it even legal back in january  the miami herald ran a piece on these same expenditures  at that time  trump had paid nearly one out of every three campaign dollars to something he owned  this is actually legal in fact  federal election law requires campaigns to pay fair market for goods and services rendered  even if they come from a candidate s own businesses but the sheer amount that trump has managed to send to himself through loopholes in campaign finance law  is very unusual in short  he knew that election law requires his campaign to pay for everything  otherwise it counts as an undocumented campaign contribution  so  he probably figured  why not use his own businesses as much as possible  then he can funnel money to himself  and there s nothing anybody can do about it because it s perfectly legal it s also more than a little suspicious  because  as the headline of the miami herald s story notes  trump has  perfected the art of the campaign expense   in such a way that he personally profits  even if he ultimately isn t elected but wait  if it s not illegal  why is it suspicious  quite simply  if you want to know how a presidential candidate is going to run the country  look at how they run their campaign  trump won t just run the country like a business  he ll very likely find ways to use the office of the president to line his own pockets while he holds that position in the end  trump only cares about trump  and his campaign finance records prove it better than anything else he s done featured image by jeff swensen getty images
