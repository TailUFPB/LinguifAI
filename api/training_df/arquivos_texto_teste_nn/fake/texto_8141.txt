donald trump used a recent television interview to detail an elaborate conspiracy involving pope francis  the mexican government  and immigration during an interview with stuart varney on fox business  trump explained how he believes the leader of the catholic faith is in cahoots with the mexican government to lead a some kind of immigrant takeover of america  as he puts it  so i think the pope is a very political person and i think that he doesn t understand the problems our country has  i don t think he understands the danger of the open border we have with mexico  and i think mexico got him to do it because mexico wants to keep the border just the way it is because they re making a fortune and we re losing  so to be clear  the pope may be an unwitting collaborator in the mexican government s evil plan to send their drug dealers and rapists across the border to kill americans  but trump believes that during his visit this week  those crafty mexicans are going to get him on their side for the takeover of america barney s other guest  a pastor from dallas  then essentially backs trump up in his absurd conspiracy theory  not only the pope  but evangelical pastors who argue for a lenient immigration policy are really basing their views not on biblical truth  but on personal opinion  but apparently  pastors who are anti immigration are speaking the word of god hold up a minute  perhaps the pastor missed a few pages of the bible  because there are a whole host of biblical references to the importance of helping those in need  wherever they come from from the the parable of the good samaritan  love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind   and   love your neighbor as yourself   from deuteronomy    cursed be anyone who perverts the justice due to the sojourner  visitor immigrant   the fatherless  and the widow   and all the people shall say   amen  from hebrews    do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers  for thereby some have entertained angels unawares  from exodus    you shall not oppress a sojourner  you know the heart of a sojourner  for you were sojourners in the land of egypt  the list goes on and on  the bible is absolutely full of references of the need for generosity and compassion to one s neighbor  newcomers  and anyone who finds themselves in need in fact  there is also a pretty clear instruction in the bible against the attitudes that so called christian conservatives have towards immigrants  and those in need  greed  vanity  envy  wrath  pride  gluttony   all of these appear in the seven deadly sins  for billionaires like donald trump hoard their wealth  splurging it on vanity projects and eating themselves fat  while raging against some of the most vulnerable people on the planet   that is the very definition of basing their views not on biblical truth but on personal opinion  in this case  a personal opinion that contradicts the core values of the faith these extremists purport to serve featured image from flickr creative commons screengrab
