the enormous debt students incur for college is already a huge burden for millions of americans and the stress of financial debt can be daunting  well now it can get even worse  the u s  government is arresting borrowers who fail to pay back their student loans this happened to paul aker  who was arrested for failing to pay back a    loan he took out in   he says that seven u s  marshals showed up to his home with guns and combat gear and dragged him to jail  from there  he was taken to court where he was forced to sign a repayment plan in front of a judge  aker said  it was mind boggling  i couldn t believe it  i was standing before the court with no rights read to me  no legal representation  and i d been told that i owe     just couldn t believe it  the private sector is now able to use the government to force citizens to pay back loans  in this case  us marshals were used on behalf of debt collectors  us congressman gene green of texas said   our federal resources  our us marshals and federal court system are being used by the private sector  a few years ago  congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  private loan companies often charge enormous interest rates that plunge young americans into perpetual debt slavery for a lifetime  it s crazy to think that they re now able to use the resources of the federal government to come after americans who often don t have the financial resources to pay back loans thanks to the u s  congress  this has all been made possible watch video here  featured image from youtube screen capture
