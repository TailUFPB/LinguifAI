a fox news host found herself squarely outnumbered on thursday when she claimed that the conservative network covers racism fairly the hosts of the view discussed megyn kelly s interview with actor and comedian d l  hughley the night before during the interview  hughley sarcastically pointed out that fox news does not cover racism fairly  the only place racism doesn t exist is fox news and the police department   hughley said   that s absolutely true  megyn kelly called hughley s claim insulting to which he replied   and i m insulted by the things i hear on this network  so we re even  i could care less about insulting people that insult me on a daily basis  well  fox news host jedediah bila disagreed with hughley and told her view co hosts that fox is fair when it comes to covering racism  i ve hosted a bunch of shows there  we talk about issues of race all the time   she claimed   i mean  i m on with juan williams all the time  these are serious issues that we delve into  so  it felt like he was labeling the whole network as not willing to accept that racism is something that exists in this country  to recap  it appears bila is using the ole  i m friends with a black person  defense to somehow claim that fox fairly covers racism shen went on to excuse other fox hosts  lack of coverage because she said they are exercising journalistic responsibility  which most objective people know is complete bullshit because fox news doesn t give a damn about real journalism  when you have stories coming out where you have white on black crime  before we figure out what actually happened  a lot of people in media jump to conclusions or we surmise or we guess   bila continued   and it shapes the narrative of how the public hears that  and it s really hard then when facts emerge to go back and say   oh  wait a minute  maybe in this particular case  this wasn t about racism  a stunned whoopi goldberg was quick to slap back  what shapes the narrative oftentimes is a disregard for the fact that we do have a racial issue  we do have an issue between how police are sometimes and how people of color are sometimes  and that s the discussion we don t have   goldberg said and even conservative host candace cameron bure  who often appears on fox news  agreed with goldberg that fox does not cover racism fairly  i watch fox news  i m a fox news supporter  but i agree with you  i don t feel like they are inclusive of all minority groups as much as they should be  because conservatives aren t just white rich men or women  and fox i don t feel always represents that point of view  i thought megyn kelly was great but i really appreciated everything that d l  said as well  here s the video via youtube fox news has been especially unfair to black lives matter in the wake of the dallas shooting even though it is clear that the person who murdered those five police officers was not affiliated with the movement  many fox hosts have disregarded that fact and have continually demonized black lives matter in a way that is inflaming racial tensions even further  fox would not be doing that if they had even a shred of real journalistic responsibility featured image via screenshot
