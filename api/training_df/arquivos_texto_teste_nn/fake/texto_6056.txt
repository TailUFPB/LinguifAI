house speaker paul ryan is nothing but a spineless weasel  earlier in the gop primary season  he seemed to actually have a bit of common decency   not to mention common sense   when he called out trump for refusing to disavow an endorsement from a white supremacist  and when he outright said that he was not comfortable endorsing trump  however  as it became increasingly clear that trump was not to be stopped  ryan started preparing to back off his attacks on the billionaire mogul by having meetings with him   clearly a preparation for an endorsement  now  that day has come  as speaker ryan has officially said that he is prepared to vote for donald trump in the  presidential election ryan s hometown newspaper  the gazette  ran a column where the house speaker announced his support for trump  ryan wrote in the column that he has been speaking with trump  and is somehow now comfortable endorsing him  when such a short time ago he clearly was not  he wrote in the column  through these conversations  i feel confident he  trump  would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people s lives  that s why i ll be voting for him this fall  he went on to say  but the reality is  on the issues that make up our agenda  we have more common ground than disagreement  but of course  at the core of ryan s reasoning for endorsing a dangerous  racist narcissist for the position of leader of the free world is the fact that the gop is putting party before country  and ultimately if they stop clinton  they re just fine with trump in the white house  ryan went on to warn of what would happen if clinton beat trump  a clinton white house would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves  quite simply  she represents all that our agenda aims to fix  and that s really what it s all about  paul ryan is willing to let donald trump literally destroy america with his hateful ideas and dangerous policy proposals and willingness to sever ties with our most important allies in order to not have a truly qualified president because he disagrees with her politically and to top off just how absolutely spineless this man is  he had his speech uploaded to the gazette s website during hillary clinton s big  anti trump foreign policy speech   clearly in the hopes that nobody would notice what he has done shame on you  speaker ryan  hopefully  this is the end of your political career  one can certainly hope featured image via mark wilson getty images
