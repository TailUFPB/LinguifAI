we ve come a long way from the days of rampant stupidity concerning marijuana use  we used to believe in  reefer madness   the laughable idea that smoking pot would drive you innnnsaaaannnnne  then there was the idiotic idea that marijuana was a  gateway drug  that would inevitably lead potheads to become heroin addicts  then  more recently  there was the belief that getting high would make teens less intelligent  but  like most propaganda  the myth of the pot addled teen ahem went up in smoke when science got involved the study  published online january  in the journal of psychopharmacology  found a statistical association between cannabis use and decreased intellectual performance  however  this association vanished when the researchers took other variables into account   the notion that cannabis use itself is causally related to lower iq and poorer educational performance was not supported in this large teenage sample   wrote claire mokrysz of the university college london and her colleagues a quick disclaimer here  i don t smoke marijuana  i have never smoked marijuana  i will never smoke marijuana  even if i didn t have asthma   not interested  don t care  however  i grew up around a lot of people that smoked pot so i find the hysteria over it to be ridiculous  i find the idea of putting people in jail for smoking it offensive in the extreme  cigarettes and beer are far more harmful but marijuana is dangerous  spare me from your ignorance  smoke m if you got em that s not to say that the low i q  story appeared in a vacuum  a study released in  clearly pointed to the possibility that marijuana use over a long period of time could lower your intelligence  people familiar with the drug were  needless to say  skeptical but the anti pot crusaders latched onto this for dear life  after all  all of their other talking points  addictive  lethal  causes violence  etc   have come up short  but now that the original research has been duplicated and expanded on  we know that the original study was flawed  that  of course  is the beauty of science  it self corrects  people often believe that using cannabis can be very damaging to intellectual ability in the long term  but it is extremely difficult to separate the direct effects of cannabis from other potential explanations   mokrysz added   adolescent cannabis use often goes hand in hand with other drug use  such as alcohol and cigarette smoking  as well as other risky lifestyle choices  it s hard to know what causes what  do kids do badly at school because they are smoking weed  or do they smoke weed because they re doing badly  this study suggests it is not as simple as saying cannabis is the problem  will the anti marijuana crusaders amend their narrative or will they continue to insist that smoking pot makes you dumb  considering their fear of cannabis is irrational to begin with  it s unlikely they ll let go of such a useful fiction featured image via twitter
