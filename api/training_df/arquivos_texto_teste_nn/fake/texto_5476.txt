sarah palin is a huge donald trump fan  however  she is also political poison  trump has that whole being politically deadly thing locked down all by himself  so the last thing he needs is the likes of the alaskan half term halfwit showing up to give yet another crazy  drunken  rambling speech in front of the entire nation and world at the gop convention  however  the donald has given a completely nonsensical reason for palin s all too obvious convention absence  alaska is simply too far away for her to travel trump said of palin not attending  she was asked  it s a little bit difficult because of where she is  we love sarah  little bit difficult because of  you know  it s a long ways away  that s as flimsy of an excuse as ever  and an obvious lie  then again  it just continues the trend of gop high rollers and national figures who are sitting this one out  hell  some even suggested that they are not going because of silly commitments like mowing their lawns  even though it s clearly because they don t want to be within a country mile of the upcoming fiasco that is donald trump s coronation party as for palin s conspicuous absence   that s likely rnc bigwigs like paul ryan and reince priebus leaning on trump and his campaign to keep her away  she is yet another national embarrassment  and they already have enough of that with their current  and grudgingly accepted standard bearer  palin proved herself to be a political disaster during the  presidential campaign  when arizona senator john mccain picked her to be his running mate  and the country watched in horror as someone who was so obviously unqualified to be anywhere near washington for any reason almost got to the point of being one  year old man s heartbeat away from being leader of the free world palin never went away after that debacle  and america dodged a bullet for sure with the mccain palin ticket s spectacular loss to barack obama and joe biden  however  she has been a fixture in the conservative movement ever since  and not a welcome one  either  no  this has nothing to do with distance and everything to do with the fact that the rnc and gop leadership has enough chaos to deal with over trump  they don t need palin there as well featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
