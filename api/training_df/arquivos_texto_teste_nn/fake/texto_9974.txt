obama just couldn t keep quiet  he released a statement via facebook today lashing out at president trump s decision to rescind his daca executive action  labeling the move as  cruel  in an immediate admonition of his predecessor following the move   the daca program is unlawful  just listen to obama s own words at a  town hall with univision the daca program is unlawful  for an explanation  look no further than president obama s own words at a  town hall with univision  pic twitter com   foramerica   foramerica  september    defended dreamers   people brought here illegally as children   as  patriots  who are  american in their hearts    and cast trump s move as  political  decision was it not a totally political decision for obama to sign the executive order on daca  to target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong   obama wrote in a facebook post published hours after trump announced his decision in a written statement following a speech by attorney general jeff sessions   it is self defeating   because they want to start new businesses  staff our labs  serve in our military  and otherwise contribute to the country we love  and it is cruel  no  what s cruel is having open borders to allow these people in  what s cruel is to have this unconstitutional policy that now trump has to deal with  president trump is the adult in the room of a bunch of lawless cowards obama s statement  immigration can be a controversial topic  we all want safe  secure borders and a dynamic economy  and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules  but that s not what the action that the white house took today is about  this is about young people who grew up in america   kids who study in our schools  young adults who are starting careers  patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag  these dreamers are americans in their hearts  in their minds  in every single way but one  on paper  they were brought to this country by their parents  sometimes even as infants  they may not know a country besides ours  they may not even know a language besides english  they often have no idea they re undocumented until they apply for a job  or college  or a driver s license  over the years  politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people   our young people   that if your parents brought you here as a child  if you ve been here a certain number of years  and if you re willing to go to college or serve in our military  then you ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship  and for years while i was president  i asked congress to send me such a bill  that bill never came  and because it made no sense to expel talented  driven  patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents  my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people  so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country  we did so based on the well established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion  deployed by democratic and republican presidents alike  because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources  and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm  deportations of criminals went up  some   young people stepped forward  met rigorous requirements  and went through background checks  and america grew stronger as a result  but today  that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again  to target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong  it is self defeating   because they want to start new businesses  staff our labs  serve in our military  and otherwise contribute to the country we love  and it is cruel  what if our kid s science teacher  or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a dreamer  where are we supposed to send her  to a country she doesn t know or remember  with a language she may not even speak  let s be clear  the action taken today isn t required legally  it s a political decision  and a moral question  whatever concerns or complaints americans may have about immigration in general  we shouldn t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own  who pose no threat  who are not taking away anything from the rest of us  they are that pitcher on our kid s softball team  that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster  that cadet in rotc who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance  kicking them out won t lower the unemployment rate  or lighten anyone s taxes  or raise anybody s wages  it is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit  and to common sense  that business leaders  faith leaders  economists  and americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today  and now that the white house has shifted its responsibility for these young people to congress  it s up to members of congress to protect these young people and our future  i m heartened by those who ve suggested that they should  and i join my voice with the majority of americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel  ultimately  this is about basic decency  this is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of america  or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated  it s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be  what makes us american is not a question of what we look like  or where our names come from  or the way we pray  what makes us american is our fidelity to a set of ideals   that all of us are created equal  that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will  that all of us share an obligation to stand up  speak out  and secure our most cherished values for the next generation  that s how america has traveled this far  that s how  if we keep at it  we will ultimately reach that more perfect union  read more  dm
