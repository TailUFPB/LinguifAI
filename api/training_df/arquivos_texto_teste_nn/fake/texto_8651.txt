sarah palin made her first campaign appearance with donald trump on tuesday  and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half term governor and professional grifter let s dive into shrieky mcjutty s official endorsement of the gop frontrunner  shall we  mr  trump  you re right  back there in the press box  heads are spinnin   media heads are spinnin   nah  it s not that big a deal other than the fact that sarah palin single handedly managed to make trump s campaign even less serious than it already was  put another way  trump already acts like he s in the throes of dementia  and palin s endorsement is like trump getting bonked over his bewigged head with a cartoon sized mallet  it s like a twitter troll suddenly being defended in a flame war by the twitter troll s drunken babysitter  palin simply doesn t realize that everyone outside the gop bubble watches her because she s stupid and says stupid things   not because she s any sort of political threat  obviously i was told  you know  warned left and right  you are gonna just get so clobbered in the press  you are just gonna get beat up  chewed up n  spit out  n  you know  i m thinkin  and again  she s going to get clobbered because she has no business on a national stage discussing serious political matters  why  not just because she speaks as if she used google translate to transform her remarks into german  then translated from german back into what can only be described as horribly fragmented english  but chiefly because her speeches are mainly about her   how she always goes rogue and how the  lamestream media  hates her to wit  when i was on stage nominated for veepee  and i got to say   yeeaaah  i ll go  send me  you betcha  i ll serve yes  she has a stellar record of serving   for part of her term  then quitting  and then when the mccain campaign tried to get her to stay on message  she  went rogue  and helped to doom her ticket  good job and now  i challenge you to sentence diagram the following passage  warning  it gets particularly gibberishy by the end i m in it because just last week  we re watchin  our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage  at the hands of iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak kneed capitulator in chief has decided that america will lead from behind  and he who would negotiate dills  uh kinda  like with the skills of a  community organizer maybe organizing a  neighborhood tea  well  he deciding that no  america would apologize and  uh  as part of the dill  as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say  thank you  enemy  the sailors were hastily released unharmed  if trump were president  the sailors would be dead because we d already be at war with iran  if palin were president  the sailors would be dead and we d be at war with the hamburglar   is beholden to no one but we the people  this is trump she s talking about  trump  who s all about trump  and who puts the name  trump  on everything he touches  that trump  is beholden to the people  that s rich  no more pussyfootin  around  our troops deserve the best  you deserve the best  pussyfootin   he is from the private sector  not a politician  can i get a  hallelujuah   where in the private sector where you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize to keep the main thing the main thing  and he knows the main thing  hallelujah  did that just happen at a trump rally  jesus  also  no  balancing budgets isn t about keeping the main thing the main thing  whatever the fuck that means  oh  and yes  trump is a politician  if one runs for president  one is a politician by default  sorry  and then funny  haha  not  funny  but now what they re doing is wailing   trump and  uh  uh  his trumpeters  well they re not conservative enough   oh my goodness gracious  what would the establishment know about conservatism  it s at this point when jay p  morgan  jamie farr and rip taylor would simultaneously gong her off the stage how about the rest of us  right wingin   bitter clingin  proud clingers of our guns  our god  our religion  and our constitution how is it possible to be both resentful of obama s  clinging  remarks  while also being proud of it  it can t be both  by the way   bitter clingin  proud clingers  is my new favorite palinism  right up there with the time when she said the role of the vice president is  position flexible  all told  this is an odd alliance trump has formed here  palin s favorability rating among republicans hovers at around  percent  again  among republicans  i m not sure how this helps trump  other than to further purge any remaining support he enjoys among serious republicans  i m not sure that standing side by side with this bitter clingin  proud clinger is a smart move  but it s absolutely the funniest thing that s happened to trump s campaign since he did
