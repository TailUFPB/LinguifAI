you ll have a hard time not laughing out loud about this one despite having a clear right wing bias  megyn kelly actually had the audacity to claim that fox news is totally  fair and balanced  while whining about a supposed liberal bias in the rest of the mainstream media during an interview with cbs host charlie rose on sunday  kelly accused most media outlets of having a liberal bias when reporting the news  i do believe that there is a left leaning bias in news and most of news   kelly somehow managed to blurt out without her nose growing like pinocchio s  you don t believe there is a right wing bias at fox  a conservative bias at fox   rose asked even though kelly s answer was predictable even before he uttered the question  no  i don t  i think that fox news is fair and balanced  and i think the conservatives who are on air here make no bones about their ideology  again  kelly s nose remained the same even though fox news does  indeed  have a clear right wing bias and is the propaganda machine of the republican party and the evidence of that has piled up over the years here s the video via youtube in november   fox news did more than just report that republicans had taken over the senate  they openly celebrated about it in april   fox head honcho and kelly s boss rupert murdoch actually bragged that his network saved the republican party  a gallup poll even confirms that an overwhelming  percent of fox viewers lean or identify as republicans additionally  even one of the most conservative senators in congress has repeatedly pointed out that fox is  totally not fair and totally not balanced  oklahoma senator tom coburn urged his constituents to stop believing everything they hear on fox because  there are certain shows on fox i can t watch because they re totally not fair and totally not balanced  coburn said the same thing to constituents four years earlier in  after fox news tried to scare people by demonizing the affordable care act and painting nancy pelosi as a bad person  the intention is not to put anybody in jail   coburn said of the fox claim that people would go to jail for not purchasing health insurance   that makes for good tv news on fox  but that isn t the intention  what we have to have is make sure we have a debate in this country so that you can see what s going on and make the determination yourself   coburn continued before blasting fox for besmirching pelosi s character   so  don t catch yourself being biased by fox news that somebody s no good  late last year  a fox news host actually had the gall to claim that  everyone benefited  from locking up more black people in a racist statement that drew outrage fox news has even told blatant lies on the air about muslims that they had to publicly apologize for telling next up  take a look at just one broadcast of sean hannity s show on fox as an example of his own work to make the network a pit of right wing bias even as he claims to be  fair and balanced  in the same breath  as one of my colleagues wrote during a two minute opening to the segment in which he makes his ludicrous claim  hannity used the following words and phrases to describe president obama  liberal  left wing  all out assault on the  amendment and the rights of law abiding americans  trampling on your rights  what s his next target  the first amendment  the anointed one  failed on the economy  failed to create jobs  failed to reign in radical extremism abroad here s the video via media matters last time i checked  president obama has not taken anyone s gun away  the economy is stronger than it was eight years ago  and jobs are being created at a record pace  yet  fox employees like hannity still repeat the same accusations over and over again and finally  let s take a look at bill o reilly  who got his ass handed to him by a group of high school students early last year for his lack of journalistic ethics  in their final report after watching a segment of the host s show  the students found that fox  news  is not  practicing journalism  as much as they are  practicing rank propaganda  in short  fox news has never been  fair and balanced  and if megyn kelly wanted to be known as a credible journalist she should have had the courage to admit it rather than try to sell us another lie like fox hosts do on a daily basis featured image via myside s spew
