michigan s governor rick snyder is desperately trying to retain some credibility by increasing his presence in the media  it isn t working  all he is doing is proving to the world that he is as much a scumbag as the world thinks he is in an interview with fox   snyder said that he would let his grandchildren be bathed in flint  michigan  during the interview  charlie leduff asks rick snyder  would you have your grandchildren bathe daily in that water coming out of those pipes  now  yeah  because again  that s the advice i ve gotten   snyder says  i wouldn t let my child chew on a chinese made toy  i don t think i d let my child  as just as person  a rational person that doesn t know that much  bathe in water what we know there s high levels of lead   leduff responds   you would let your grandchild bathe in that  snyder then tries to squirm his way out of the gaffe he just made by giving this poor explanation for his claim  we don t know that there s necessarily high levels of lead in every bath tub  but again  there could be this risk  but we ve been told by the experts  by itself you just don t leave them by themselves  you need to monitor that to make sure they don t drink the water  here s the interview it really sounded like snyder was trying to make the contamination of flint s water sound safer than it is  didn t it  that s really weird because just hours earlier  snyder went on cbs for an interview where he said that they don t want people to assume that the water in flint is safer than it is during that interview  snyder was again  completely hammered for his utter incompetence  snyder failed to answer even basic questions about what people desperately want to know the interviewer  scott pelley  asks snyder  governor  is the water in flint safe today  snyder responds  saying  we don t want to consider it safe  scott  i think we ve seen progress in terms of improvements in the water testing  but until it s been thoroughly tested  including third party verification  we want people to assume that they should be using filters  or bottled water as an interim measure  pelley presses snyder  so fair to say you don t know what the lead content is in the water  snyder responds  saying  well  again   we don t want people to believe it s safe  extensive testing is going on  has been going on for some time  at that point  pelley seems to have had enough of snyder s evasiveness  he grills snyder  saying  i don t understand why you can t give us the latest testing data and what it shows for the water in flint  what is the number  snyder  still trying to down play his incompetence  says  i don t have the number at the top of my head of the very latest data  and it varies by parts of the city  to this  pelley eviscerates snyder  saying  i would think that the governor of michigan would have those numbers at the top of his mind right now  you can watch the interview below featured image credit  video screenshot via fox
