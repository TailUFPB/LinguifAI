it appears that the curtain that hides the true nature of israel is finally beginning to be pulled back  on friday  former prime minister and defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel has been  infected by the seeds of fascism   that may be one of the biggest understatements of the year  though it does show the beginnings of a new internal outcry against israel s government haaretz reports responding to the resignation of defense minister moshe ya alon earlier in the day  barak said that it  should be a red light for all of us regarding what s going on in the government  life sustaining zionism and the seeds of fascism cannot live together   barak told a channel  interviewer ya alon s resignation is  the end of a chain that began with the case of the soldier who shot    barak said   such incidents give us an x ray image that is opposed to the will of the people  what has happened is a hostile takeover of the israeli government by dangerous elements  and it s just the beginning  this government needs to be brought down before it brings all of us down   barak added   there are no serious leaders left in the world who believe the israeli government  that last quote is particularly relevant to the united states  seeing as the u s  has acted as israel s vanguard for quite some time now  the obama administration s relationship with israeli prime minister  benjamin netanyahu  has been tense  to say the least  much of this has to do with netanyahu s avowed disapproval of president obama s iran nuclear deal however  due to rapid changes in the political ideology of people in the u s  that may change depending on the administration in power  while a majority of americans still have a favorable opinion of israeli  democrats and independents  favorability of israel is plummeting  the republican party s positive outlook on israel remains rock solid  showing support for israel has become an increasingly partisan issue featured image from  photo by john moore getty images
