donald trump will likely go down in history  hopefully way down  as the presidential candidate who embraced twitter as his main campaign tool  while other candidates simply tweet  trump uses the social media platform as his main source of messaging and branding of course  that often gets the candidate in hot water  especially with his habit of retweeting things from white supremacists  but because we know trump spends so much time on twitter  it s the perfect format for trolling the presumed gop presidential nominee  and that s exactly what twitter users have been doing for the last several days  under the hashtag     which imagines trump as a founding father  shudder   it s also completely hilarious  jefferson wrote a stupid declaration  they should have asked me i have a great brain  i would have started with renegotiating          july    no taxation without representation is for losers folks  i just don t pay  hey  that s the system  what can i do     lucille     july    total loon paul revere raving in the streets about british troops  get a grip  paul      josh windham      july    there s something going on with king george  something very  very bad  i mean terrible  folks  we re gonna look into this        tiffany      tiffanyclay  july    s my indian  there he is  isn t he great  i m going to do very well with the savage community     steve     july      perhaps if she wasn t my slave  i d be dating her   aubrey troop   aubreyyeliza  july    makes me think that wouldn t stop trump  i know slaves  i have the best slaves  they re unbelievable     craig rozniecki   craigrozniecki  july    i have the greatest white wig  and it s completely real  believe me  a lot of people have telegrammed me about it     noah finneburgh   noahfinneburgh  july    of independence was very boring  should have been written in gold sharpie  would be classy  only i could do right     noah finneburgh   noahfinneburgh  july     king george won t even say the words radical colonist  sad  we need to hit them hard  fast  and take their tobacco      caleb synan   calebsynan  july     we need a total and complete shutdown of catholics coming into the country   alex rios   alexrioscomedy  july     they re bringing drugs  they re bringing money  they re rapists  and some slaves  i assume  are really good people         discord      dlscord  july    adams is a very short man who came in second  he should be careful what he says about me  disgraceful     noah finneburgh   noahfinneburgh  july    i was at the boston tea party  no broads there  believe me  it was a disaster  hardly anyone interesting showed up     sharon houston   sharonhouston  july    of the reasons this hashtag is going completely nuts is that it is difficult to imagine trump during the days of the founders  or for that matter  during any other time in history  trump is a candidate made from tv and promoted by social media  his limited vocabulary is a plus when he has to post in  characters or less  his grandiosity and shameless self promotions are almost expected  we ve seen racist and nationalistic presidential candidates before  we ve seen rich ones too  but we ve never seen one like donald trump and hopefully  we ll never see one again featured image via marc piscotty at getty images
