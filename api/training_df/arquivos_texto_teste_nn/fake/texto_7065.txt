this has to be the most counter intuitive and ironic result of racism conceivable  the implicit racism of medical professionals is directly preventing the black community from suffering the same epidemic of opioid addiction and overdoses that is devastating white communities all over america the reason doctors and nurses think black people are super humans  yes  for real   researchers at the university of virginia quizzed white medical students and residents to see how many believed inaccurate and at times  fantastical  differences about the two races   for example  that blacks have less sensitive nerve endings than whites or that black people s blood coagulates more quickly  they found that fully half thought at least one of the false statements presented was possibly  probably or definitely true moreover  those who held false beliefs often rated black patients  pain as lower than that of white patients and made less appropriate recommendations about how they should be treated if this sounds insane to you  remember that the police regularly pump unarmed black men full of bullets because they literally believe that black people are inhumanly strong and resistant to pain  the phrases  demonic    inhuman  and  like a wild animal  have been used repeatedly to describe black people  this is a direct result of centuries of racist fearmongering about  aggressive  blacks so it s not at all surprising to find that the medical community has fallen victim to this pervasive implicit  and sometimes overtly explicit  racism but it is a little surprising  ok  very surprising and even more disturbing  that you can get a license to practice medicine without having learned that there are no significant biological differences between blacks and whites  what the hell are medical schools teaching that leaves their students this painfully ignorant as mentioned above  they literally think black people don t experience pain the same way  the result  they don t give black people nearly as much pain medication a  study out of emory university found that at a hospital emergency department in atlanta   percent of white patients with bone fractures received painkillers compared with  percent of black patients  similarly  a paper last year found that black children with appendicitis were less likely to receive pain medication than their white counterparts if you ll recall  the over prescription of painkillers to white people is the direct cause of the drug epidemic assaulting white communities  white people have been getting hooked on pain killers and when their doctors finally cut them off  if they ever do   they turn to the next closest thing  heroin  and it spirals out of control from there by being racist jerks that allow black people to suffer pain in the short term  the medical community has spared them the long term pain of addiction  at last  systemic racism finally did something positive for the black community  hooray  aren t you just so proud of amerikkka now featured image via  com
