last night  hillary clinton accepted the democratic presidential nomination in philadelphia and gave a powerful speech that was the perfect celebratory end to the democratic national convention  her speech portrayed her accurately as a candidate far more qualified to lead america than donald trump  and broke down the barriers with not only bernie sanders supporters  but republican voters as well clinton s acceptance speech was a massive success for those reasons alone  but something even more surreal was taking place  we all witnessed an historic moment as clinton had shattered america s highest glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major party  and the sad thing was  that while clinton set new ground for women in america  all conservatives could do was complain about her voice and appearance apparently  nothing brings out blatant gop sexism like a strong  intelligent  accomplished woman achieving something monumental  instead of recognizing that history was literally being made before our very eyes  conservatives made sure to take clinton down a notch by insulting her on the most minor things  one of the first sexism offenses came from brit hume on fox news  who reduced clinton to her voice and mouth when he said  she has a habit  when speaking  of breaking into a kind of a sharp  lecturing tone  makes you feel like  she has a great asset  as a public person  which is a radiant smile  but she has a not so attractive voice  you can watch hume reveal his sexism below unfortunately  he was far from the only one twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertrump  who is probably one of the most sexist people in the country  also joined in twitterthese were things that have never and would never happen to a male presidential candidate twitterand no sexist attack is ever complete without demanding that women smile and look happy all the time just to make men feel comfortable twittertwittertwittertwittermeanwhile  no one is complaining about trump s combative tone  his nonstop yelling or telling him he needs to smile more twitteramerica still has a long way to go to end sexism  but clinton has definitely moved us one massive step closer toward gender equality featured image via alex wong   getty images
