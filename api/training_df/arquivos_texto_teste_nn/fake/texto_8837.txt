for some time now  the united states has been experiencing a rapid decline in gas prices  it s almost hard to forget when the last time filling up at the tank was a burdensome thing   that s because nearly two years has gone by since gas was over    a gallon  on average across the united states   over the last year or so  gas prices have dropped even further  due to saudia arabia continuing to keep up output  and the iran deal that is expected to glut the global market even more so  all of this is great news   but it looks like the good news will keep on flowing  pun intended  according to experts in the industry the aaa and gasbuddy  two top organizations that follow gasoline prices  say that if refinery capacity stays strong the price of a gallon of gasoline could reach historic lows of    a gallon in some areas   a level that hasn t been reached since   that would be quite a remarkable event prices are already low by historical standards and depending on which part of the country you live in  already under    a gallon  if you look at the map below  you will easily be able to see which parts of the united states already receive the cheapest gas  there are very few areas colored in dark green  lower than    a  gallon   most of the middle part of the country is either light green          or yellow          if gas is pushed downward to    a gallon  that s still a huge percentage drop no matter where you live pic via gas buddygas prices are mostly driven by four things  oil prices  proximity to refineries  refinery capacity and state taxes and levies we already know that crude oil prices are going to continue to fall  although  there are a few detractors  there always are  nevermind that   here s what the money managers that run the economy are doing  while   of them bet on higher prices  okay   fair enough    of them bet on lower prices  it s not even close  this is the least bullish investors have been on oil in more than five years  according to the u s  commodity futures trading commission all in all  gasoline futures fell   cents or     to    a gallon   the lowest it s been since february   and   gasoline also fell   cents a gallon    for the week  which also happens to be the largest weekly loss since september  if the experts are right     a gallon gasoline may not be that far off  thanks  obama pic via gas buddyfeatured image via white house
