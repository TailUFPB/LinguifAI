an arkansas school was ordered to desegregate and for some reason the school thought that meant forcing only black students to attend an assembly on gangs and drugs maumelle high school claims it was only complying with the court order to desegregate when school officials summoned african american freshman students to an assembly via intercom the assembly featured pastor dante shelton  who presented his experience with drugs and gang violence  but it wasn t long before the students began to realize that there were no white students at the assembly  someone in the group asked  why are there no other kids except for african american kids here   aaron perkins  whose sister attended the event  told katv   she felt that it was very racist  but school officials insist the assembly was only part of the effort to desegregate the school  which somehow has been allowed to skirt federal law since it was founded in   it s as if they have never heard of brown v  board of education at all according to school spokeswoman deborah roush  freshmen students were identified by the school because it is a time of transition when they are more easily influenced  black students were selected with the intent that the assembly would be an extension of the district s court ordered desegregation efforts  which encourage programs and opportunities tailored to minority students  and that is just complete bullshit  the very definition of desegregation is the ending of policies that keep people of different races apart  so in no way could this assembly be part of that effort  if anything  it s an effort to cling onto segregation  which keeps the races separate here s the video via katv not only does this school apparently not know the definition of desegregation  they apparently don t realize how racist this assembly was either  by only including black students at this assembly  the school is assuming that only black kids join gangs or do drugs and that is simply an outrageous stereotype  the school claims students could  opt out  of the assembly  but when a student is called via intercom to go somewhere by the school office  you go  so it definitely looks like these students had no choice and are the victims of racism at their school understandably  parents are outraged and the aclu is now involved  maumelle high school owes these parents and the students they singled out an apology  and perhaps another court visit is in order to make sure school officials understand what desegregation means  featured image from screenshot
