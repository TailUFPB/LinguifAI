conservative economist ben stein just let everyone know how much he hates republican front runner donald trump  basically  there aren t enough words to describe how batsh t crazy stein thinks trump is  and how terrifying the leading gop candidate s lack of experience and ignorance on economics is in an interview with cnn s pamela brown  stein spoke at length about what he thought of trump s grand vision for america s economy  after listening to the business mogul spew nonsense about an impeding recession and financial bubble  stein said  in all of my years as an economist  which is roughly  years  i ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from mr  trump  and it breaks my heart  it makes me want to cry because i m republican  i ve never voted for a democrat  and to think the guy who s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible  stein insisted that trump has zero clue what he s talking about  and that it s  horrifying   the economist compared trump s nonsensical  and  breathtakingly horrible rhetoric to being told  men from mars are coming down  and  he s gonna flap his wings and fly  stein went even further and said that it was only by  sheer idiocy  that anyone could support trump s  wacky  ideas stein  like many before him  also made sure to point out that trump s success in business  which isn t much when compared to other wealthy business men and considering all of trump s failures  in no way qualifies him to speak on economics  stein found it baffling that trump doesn t actually have any real economic advisers  you know  i don t know what goes on in his head  he s a force of nature  i don t know what goes on in his head  but it s frightening that he has no economist advisers  carl icahn  a very smart guy on wall street who s made a great deal of money  steve wynn who runs the best hotels in las vegas  but as far as economic advisers  as far as i can tell  he doesn t have any and he desperately needs some  the things he s saying are wacky as wacky can be  just off the charts  you can watch stein tear into trump below stein s hatred for trump is so great that the conservative has actually confessed he might switch teams and vote for democratic candidates hillary clinton or bernie sanders because he s confident that trump will  sink  the republican party  featured image via getty images   win mcnamee
