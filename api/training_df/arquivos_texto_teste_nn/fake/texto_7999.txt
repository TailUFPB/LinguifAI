donald trump just got caught lying about one of his biggest claims as the south carolina primary approaches throughout his campaign  trump has hammered jeb bush over his brother george w  bush s terrible decision to go to war with iraq  a war that cost america trillions of dollars and thousands of lives he has even claimed to be the only candidate in the gop field who opposed the war before we invaded and he did so again during the gop debate on saturday night  i m the only one on this stage that said   do not go into iraq  do not attack iraq   trump declared  nobody else on this stage said that  and i said it loud and strong  and i was in the private sector  i wasn t a politician  fortunately  but i said it  and i said it loud and clear   you ll destabilize the middle east   that s exactly what happened  trump repeated himself again on thursday night during the gop town hall event  even going so far as to say that george h  w  bush dealt with iraq the right way when we went to war against saddam hussein in order to protect kuwait in  up to this point  trump s claims had gone unchallenged  but now an audio recording has popped up of a trump interview with howard stern that blows both of trump s claims about both wars in iraq out of the water as it turns out  trump not only lied about his opposition to the iraq invasion in   he lied about believing that operation desert storm was handled correctly  are you for invading iraq   stern asked trump point blank back in   a year before the first troops set foot in iraq trump   yeah  i guess so  i wish the first time it was done correctly  here s the damning audio via buzzfeed and when anderson cooper asked trump about the stern interview on thursday  here is what trump had to say  i could have said that  nobody asked me that  i wasn t a politician  it was probably the first time anyone has asked me that question  when you re in the private sector  you get asked things  and you re not a politician  and probably the first time i was asked  by the time the war started  i was against it  and shortly thereafter  i was really against  note to donald  it doesn t matter if you were a politician or not  a lie is a lie and your time in the private sector does not exempt you from being called out for it  nor does it excuse it  featured image  flickr
