donald trump s entire image is based around the idea that he is a  winner   and while that idea isn t supported by the reality of trump s legacy of failed businesses and ventures  it is still jarring to see his reaction after he loses a battle republican voters in wisconsin chose ted cruz over trump in the primary on wednesday night  and as he has in the past  trump lost ugly his campaign issued a bizarre  unhinged press release to the media after the results had been called in favor of cruz donald j  trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again  lyin  ted cruz had the governor of wisconsin  many conservative talk radio show hosts  and the entire party apparatus behind him  not only was he propelled by the anti trump super pac s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against mr  trump  but he was coordinating with his own super pac s  which is illegal  who totally control him  ted cruz is worse than a puppet   he is a trojan horse  being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from mr  trump  we have total confidence that mr  trump will go on to win in new york  where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls  and beyond  mr  trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the republican nomination and ultimately defeat hillary clinton  or whomever is the democratic nominee  in order to make america great again completely over the top  factually inaccurate  and failing to make sense  all hallmarks of the trump campaign so far  it shows why republican establishment bigwigs are arguing over strategies to take him down at the convention  as polls regularly show him losing in double digits to both hillary clinton and bernie sanders  a poll from mason dixon even showed trump with only a single digit lead over clinton in blood red mississippi but as this release shows  trump isn t going to let his campaign be snuffed out quietly  if he loses at all  it s going to be with a loud  primal scream  and the gop s bigwigs are going to hear all about it featured image via flickr
