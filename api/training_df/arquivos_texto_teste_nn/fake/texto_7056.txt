when approached by countless people if i m a hillary supporter  i will reply   yes   however  this is usually followed up with   is it because she s a woman   which is the most absurd thing i ve ever heard  sure  i m excited for the possibility of the first ever female president  but in all honesty  it comes down to experience and ability to get the job done  which she has done time and time again throughout her career being tired of this question being posed  and having a decent size facebook audience to deliver my message  i took to my page to lay out my answer once and for all here s my response  i can t tell you how many times i ve been asked   are you voting for hillary because she s a woman   well  to that i have to say   no   but if you re going ask  with that criteria  if i m voting for hillary just because she s a woman  well  i m going to assume you re not voting for her just because she s a woman  and if you use the same attacks that republicans have been using against her for decades  well  that means you re really no better than a republican  and if you use her voting record against her  but then willfully ignore bernie s anti gun reform votes   well  sorry  you re a hypocrite  and if hillary is the nominee this november and you refuse to vote for a democrat or you refuse to vote  you might as well be voting for a republican  as far as experience  don t even go there  she s clearly the most qualified person for the job  so no  i m not voting for hillary because she s a woman  i m voting for her because she s the best damn person for the job  however  how revolutionary would it be to finally have the first woman president  it s pretty badass  and as i was going to keep this solely to my page it became apparent when hillary was accused of ruining the democratic party with her ambition  that this really needed to be seen again  because that is a ridiculously sexist remark  i mean  how dare a woman have the audacity to be ambitious enough to seek the white house  is that ever asked of men  is it  no  it s not so no  i m not voting for hillary because she s a woman  but i sure as hell am voting for a woman with ambition and the go get it attitude that she has displayed throughout her entire career  but let it be known  that if she s not the nominee for any reason  i will vote blue no matter who  because i m able to be an adult and realize the needs of the country are far more important than just the needs of my ideal candidate winning  and if a republican wins  we all lose           if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt i can t begin to tell you how many times i ve been asked by bernie supporters if i m voting for hillary  just because she s a woman   so  to make things easier  here s my response posted by opinionated democrat on tuesday  february    photo by justin sullivan getty images
