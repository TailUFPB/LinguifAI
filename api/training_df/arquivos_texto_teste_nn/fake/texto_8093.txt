supreme court justice antonin scalia is still dead and the republican party is still pledging to block any nominee for the vacancy that president obama puts forth  according to right wingers like ted cruz  the president doesn t have the  right  to elect a new justice because in the distorted minds of the imbeciles in the gop the american people only elect democratic presidents for three years  not the four republicans get  however  not everyone on the crazy side of the aisle believes this nonsense  actually a very high ranking member of the bush administration  former attorney general alberto gonzales  thinks that it is president obama s  obligation  to appoint someone to the court on monday  ag gonzales appeared on cnn s new day to discuss the  controversy  surrounding the vacancy on the highest court in the country  i know there s a big debate going on right now about whether or not obama should nominate someone  from my perspective having worked at the white house and the dept  of justice  there s just no question in my mind that as president of the united states  you have an obligation to fill a vacancy  i suspect president obama is going to do his job   he continued   and after he does his job and nominating a hopefully qualified individual  the senate will do its job eventually on its own calendar  the president absolutely has an obligation to fill the court  it is one of his most important duties as president  of course  i don t really expect ted cruz and his buddies to understand anything about  duties   after all  these are the imbeciles that refused to do their jobs and shut the government down in   their most important job is to keep the government running and they couldn t even do that if they decide to be the jackasses we expect them to be  they will once again cripple the government because they are literally incapable of governing  the republican party doesn t feel an obligation to perform their duties  they only feel obligated to obstruct obama   at any cost watch featured image via video screenshot
