the republican party may be losing another supporter as gop senator susan collins of maine won t rule out voting for democratic nominee hillary clinton collins  who is a moderate  reached that decision based on donald trump s comments regarding judge gonzalo curiel  calling his comments  an order of magnitude more serious  than anything else he s said so far on the campaign trail  collins told reporters this is a difficult choice  and it s one  like many of my colleagues  that i am struggling with  it s not like we have perfect candidates from whom to choose in this election   i worked very well with hillary when she was my colleague in the senate and when she was secretary of state  but i do not anticipate voting for her this fall  i m not going to say never  because this has been such an unpredictable situation  to say the least when pressed that her comment looks like she would be willing to back the democratic nominee over the republican  she responded that is true  but i do want to qualify that by saying it is unlikely that i would choose to vote for the democratic candidate in collins  own words  never say never  while most republicans refusing to back trump have almost all indicated they would never vote for clinton  collins becomes the first hill republican to leave the option on the table   for now collins told reporters just earlier this week that if trump wants to earn her endorsement  he will have to  really have to change  his approach  she also called on he presumptive republican nominee to own up to making a mistake and to apologize to curiel as trump enters the general phase of his campaign  he certainly isn t off to a good start with those in his own party  mark kirk of illinois has rescinded his support for trump and senators ted cruz and marco rubio have held off on endorsing with republican lawmakers so openly hostile towards trump  it leaves people wondering just how many of these people are actually going to vote for him featured image via alex wong
