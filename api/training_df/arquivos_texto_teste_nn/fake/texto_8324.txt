daryush valizadeh  a  neo masculinist  movement leader and blogger who tried to hold events around the nation and world for like minded men this coming saturday is running scared  first  he announced that he could not guarantee the  safety and privacy  of other misogynist douchebags at his  return of kings  meet ups  so he announced that this  international tribal day  would be cancelled  as would all future events  the internet  politicians  and various other organizations and public figures rightly condemned the gatherings organized by a man whose misogynistic writings include calls to make rape legal now  roosh v   as he is known  is alleging that he is being threatened  like most bottom feeding lowlifes  it appears that this loser lives in his mommy s house  despite being a grown man who has been quite successful at peddling his anti woman garbage under the guise of being a  pick up artist   he contacted authorities after the cancellation of the worldwide meet up events  and told police that at least one threat said  we will kill you if you come to our city  now  death threats serve no purpose  and they are illegal  no one should be sending him or anyone else threats  though the urge is certainly more than understandable in this particular case  what he expected to happen  exactly  when he decided to organize events steeped in dangerous ant woman teachings  i ve no idea  of course any reasonable person would be disgusted and outraged at the prospect of such people gather in their cities and neighborhoods one organization that had planned to protest the new york city meeting of roosh v s event said that while they are glad that the horrific meeting was cancelled  their work is far from done  they took to their facebook event page to say the following  we showed the entire mra  pua and neo masculine movements that they are not welcome  and should we see them in person  they ll never forget the experience  to put it politely   but we are vehemently of the opinion that we shouldn t just pat ourselves on the back and call it a day  no  rape culture still permeates our society  and we re f cking tired of it  any reasonable person realizes that  men s rights activists    pick up artists   and  neo masculinists  are all the result of rampant misogyny and rape culture  these people are despicable  and need to go the way of the dinosaur  along with the rape culture that created them in the first place featured image from screen capture from raw story
