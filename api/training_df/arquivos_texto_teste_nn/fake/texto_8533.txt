president obama announced via an op ed in the washington post that he will be enacting some major reforms in the federal prison system  he will be putting an end to solitary confinement for juveniles  and prohibiting the practice as a punishment for low level infractions  the reforms were taken from a report by the justice department that listed recommendations for improving the system  it s estimated that approximately   individuals would be affected unfortunately  this only applies to the federal prison system and not to the majority of prison inmates that are incarcerated for state level crimes  even with that in mind  this is still a bold and very necessary step in reforming american prisons which can serve as a model for states to follow president obama made his case as follows how can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement  knowing its effects  and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people  it doesn t make us safer  it s an affront to our common humanity the justice department has completed its review  and i am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system  these include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low level infractions  expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells  these steps will affect some   federal prisoners held in solitary confinement   and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems  and i will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement source  wapowhile acknowledging that sometimes solitary confinement can be required for certain individuals  president obama made it clear that it s a punishment which is overused and ends up causing more harm than good in many cases there are as many as   people held in solitary confinement in u s  prisons   including juveniles and people with mental illnesses  as many as   inmates are serving months  even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell  with almost no human contact research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating  lasting psychological consequences  it has been linked to depression  alienation  withdrawal  a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior  some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones  prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide  especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses source  wapohopefully  this will be a first step in what turns out to be a long path of reforms to bring our prison system out of the realm of  cruel and unusual punishment   as it was intended to be all along featured image via the georgia straight
