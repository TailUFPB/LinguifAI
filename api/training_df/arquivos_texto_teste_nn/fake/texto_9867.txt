a speech for the ages was given today by president donald trump  he addressed the  meeting of the united nations general assembly in new york for the first time in his presidency  the transcript is below president trump  mr  secretary general  mr  president  world leaders  and distinguished delegates  welcome to new york  it is a profound honor to stand here in my home city  as a representative of the american people  to address the people of the world as millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country  i want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid  the american people are strong and resilient  and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before fortunately  the united states has done very well since election day last november   the stock market is at an all time high   a record  unemployment is at its lowest level in  years  and because of our regulatory and other reforms  we have more people working in the united states today than ever before  companies are moving back  creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time  and it has just been announced that we will be spending almost   billion on our military and defense our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been  for more than  years  in times of war and peace  the leaders of nations  movements  and religions have stood before this assembly  like them  i intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed we live in a time of extraordinary opportunity  breakthroughs in science  technology  and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve but each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value  terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet  rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values  the systems  and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since world war ii international criminal networks traffic drugs  weapons  people  force dislocation and mass migration  threaten our borders  and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens to put it simply  we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril  it is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights  or let it fall into a valley of disrepair we have it in our power  should we so choose  to lift millions from poverty  to help our citizens realize their dreams  and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence  hatred  and fear this institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future  it was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty  preserve their security  and promote their prosperity it was in the same period  exactly  years ago  that the united states developed the marshall plan to help restore europe  those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace  sovereignty  security  and prosperity the marshall plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong  independent  and free  as president truman said in his message to congress at that time   our support of european recovery is in full accord with our support of the united nations  the success of the united nations depends upon the independent strength of its members  to overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future  we must begin with the wisdom of the past  our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security  prosperity  and peace for themselves and for the world we do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures  traditions  or even systems of government  but we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties  to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation  this is the beautiful vision of this institution  and this is foundation for cooperation and success strong  sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values  different cultures  and different dreams not just coexist  but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect strong  sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny  and strong  sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by god in america  we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone  but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch  this week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example  we are celebrating the  anniversary of our beloved constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today this timeless document has been the foundation of peace  prosperity  and freedom for the americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature  human dignity  and the rule of law the greatest in the united states constitution is its first three beautiful words  they are   we the people  generations of americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words  the promise of our country  and of our great history  in america  the people govern  the people rule  and the people are sovereign  i was elected not to take power  but to give power to the american people  where it belongs in foreign affairs  we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty  our government s first duty is to its people  to our citizens   to serve their needs  to ensure their safety  to preserve their rights  and to defend their values as president of the united states  i will always put america first  just like you  as the leaders of your countries will always  and should always  put your countries first   applause  all responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens  and the nation state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition but making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people the united states will forever be a great friend to the world  and especially to its allies  but we can no longer be taken advantage of  or enter into a one sided deal where the united states gets nothing in return  as long as i hold this office  i will defend america s interests above all else but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations  we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign  prosperous  and secure america does more than speak for the values expressed in the united nations charter  our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall  america s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies  from the beaches of europe to the deserts of the middle east to the jungles of asia it is an eternal credit to the american character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history  we did not seek territorial expansion  or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others  instead  we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty  security  and prosperity for all for the diverse nations of the world  this is our hope  we want harmony and friendship  not conflict and strife  we are guided by outcomes  not ideology  we have a policy of principled realism  rooted in shared goals  interests  and values that realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room  it is a question we cannot escape or avoid  we will slide down the path of complacency  numb to the challenges  threats  and even wars that we face  or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today  so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow if we desire to lift up our citizens  if we aspire to the approval of history  then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent  we must protect our nations  their interests  and their futures  we must reject threats to sovereignty  from the ukraine to the south china sea  we must uphold respect for law  respect for borders  and respect for culture  and the peaceful engagement these allow  and just as the founders of this body intended  we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos  turmoil  and terror the scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based  they respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries if the righteous many do not confront the wicked few  then evil will triumph  when decent people and nations become bystanders to history  the forces of destruction only gather power and strength no one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in north korea  it is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of north koreans  and for the imprisonment  torture  killing  and oppression of countless more we were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent american college student  otto warmbier  was returned to america only to die a few days later  we saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport  we know it kidnapped a sweet  year old japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for north korea s spies if this is not twisted enough  now north korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life it is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime  but would arm  supply  and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict  no nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles the united states has great strength and patience  but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies  we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea  rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime  the united states is ready  willing and able  but hopefully this will not be necessary  that s what the united nations is all about  that s what the united nations is for  let s see how they do it is time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future  the united nations security council recently held two unanimous   votes adopting hard hitting resolutions against north korea  and i want to thank china and russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions  along with all of the other members of the security council  thank you to all involved but we must do much more  it is time for all nations to work together to isolate the kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior we face this decision not only in north korea  it is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder  vowing death to america  destruction to israel  and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room the iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy  it has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence  bloodshed  and chaos  the longest suffering victims of iran s leaders are  in fact  its own people rather than use its resources to improve iranian lives  its oil profits go to fund hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent muslims and attack their peaceful arab and israeli neighbors  this wealth  which rightly belongs to iran s people  also goes to shore up bashar al assad s dictatorship  fuel yemen s civil war  and undermine peace throughout the entire middle east we cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles  and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program   applause   the iran deal was one of the worst and most one sided transactions the united states has ever entered into  frankly  that deal is an embarrassment to the united states  and i don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me it is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction  it is time for the regime to free all americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained  and above all  iran s government must stop supporting terrorists  begin serving its own people  and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change  and  other than the vast military power of the united states  that iran s people are what their leaders fear the most  this is what causes the regime to restrict internet access  tear down satellite dishes  shoot unarmed student protestors  and imprison political reformers oppressive regimes cannot endure forever  and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice  will they continue down the path of poverty  bloodshed  and terror  or will the iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization  culture  and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again the iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing in saudi arabia early last year  i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than  arab and muslim nations  we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires them we will stop radical islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation  and indeed to tear up the entire world we must deny the terrorists safe haven  transit  funding  and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology  we must drive them out of our nations  it is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al qaeda  hezbollah  the taliban and others that slaughter innocent people the united states and our allies are working together throughout the middle east to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people last month  i announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in afghanistan  from now on  our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations  not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians i have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the taliban and other terrorist groups  in syria and iraq  we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of isis  in fact  our country has achieved more against isis in the last eight months than it has in many  many years combined we seek the de escalation of the syrian conflict  and a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people  the actions of the criminal regime of bashar al assad  including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person  no society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread  that is why the united states carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack we appreciate the efforts of united nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from isis  and we especially thank jordan  turkey and lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the syrian conflict the united states is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort  we seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people  and which enables their eventual return to their home countries  to be part of the rebuilding process for the cost of resettling one refugee in the united states  we can assist more than  in their home region  out of the goodness of our hearts  we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region  and we support recent agreements of the  nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible  this is the safe  responsible  and humanitarian approach for decades  the united states has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere  we have learned that  over the long term  uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries for the sending countries  it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform  and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms for the receiving countries  the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government i want to salute the work of the united nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes  the united nations and african union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in africa  the united states continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance  including famine prevention and relief in south sudan  somalia  and northern nigeria and yemen we have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like pepfar  which funds aids relief  the president s malaria initiative  the global health security agenda  the global fund to end modern slavery  and the women entrepreneurs finance initiative  part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe we also thank    applause    we also thank the secretary general for recognizing that the united nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty  security  and prosperity  too often the focus of this organization has not been on results  but on bureaucracy and process in some cases  states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them  for example  it is a massive source of embarrassment to the united nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the u n  human rights council the united states is one out of  countries in the united nations  and yet we pay  percent of the entire budget and more  in fact  we pay far more than anybody realizes  the united states bears an unfair cost burden  but  to be fair  if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals  especially the goal of peace  this investment would easily be well worth it major portions of the world are in conflict and some  in fact  are going to hell  but the powerful people in this room  under the guidance and auspices of the united nations  can solve many of these vicious and complex problems the american people hope that one day soon the united nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world  in the meantime  we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden  militarily or financially  nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions that is why in the western hemisphere  the united states has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the cuban people to live in freedom  my administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms we have also imposed tough  calibrated sanctions on the socialist maduro regime in venezuela  which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse the socialist dictatorship of nicolas maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country  this corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried  to make matters worse  maduro has defied his own people  stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule the venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing  their democratic institutions are being destroyed  this situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch as a responsible neighbor and friend  we and all others have a goal  that goal is to help them regain their freedom  recover their country  and restore their democracy  i would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the venezuelan people the united states has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable  we are prepared to take further action if the government of venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the venezuelan people we are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the latin american countries gathered here today  our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors i ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis  we call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in venezuela   applause  the problem in venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented  but that socialism has been faithfully implemented   applause   from the soviet union to cuba to venezuela  wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted  it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure  those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems america stands with every person living under a brutal regime  our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action  all people deserve a government that cares for their safety  their interests  and their wellbeing  including their prosperity in america  we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will  but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal for too long  the american people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals  unaccountable international tribunals  and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success  but as those promises flowed  millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared  others gamed the system and broke the rules  and our great middle class  once the bedrock of american prosperity  was forgotten and left behind  but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again while america will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations  we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government  the duty of our citizens  this bond is the source of america s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today if this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us  it will depend  as president truman said some  years ago  on the  independent strength of its members   if we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together  there can be no substitute for strong  sovereign  and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies  nations that seek allies to befriend  not enemies to conquer  and most important of all  nations that are home to patriots  to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries  their fellow citizens  and for all that is best in the human spirit in remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding  we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved patriotism led the poles to die to save poland  the french to fight for a free france  and the brits to stand strong for britain today  if we do not invest ourselves  our hearts  and our minds in our nations  if we will not build strong families  safe communities  and healthy societies for ourselves  no one can do it for us we cannot wait for someone else  for faraway countries or far off bureaucrats   we can t do it  we must solve our problems  to build our prosperity  to secure our futures  or we will be vulnerable to decay  domination  and defeat the true question for the united nations today  for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children  is a basic one  are we still patriots  do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures  do we revere them enough to defend their interests  preserve their cultures  and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens one of the greatest american patriots  john adams  wrote that the american revolution was  effected before the war commenced  the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people  that was the moment when america awoke  when we looked around and understood that we were a nation  we realized who we were  what we valued  and what we would give our lives to defend  from its very first moments  the american story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future the united states of america has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world  and the greatest defenders of sovereignty  security  and prosperity for all now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations  for the revival of their spirits  their pride  their people  and their patriotism history is asking us whether we are up to the task  our answer will be a renewal of will  a rediscovery of resolve  and a rebirth of devotion  we need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself our hope is a word and world of proud  independent nations that embrace their duties  seek friendship  respect others  and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all  a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful earth this is the true vision of the united nations  the ancient wish of every people  and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul so let this be our mission  and let this be our message to the world  we will fight together  sacrifice together  and stand together for peace  for freedom  for justice  for family  for humanity  and for the almighty god who made us all thank you  god bless you  god bless the nations of the world  and god bless the united states of america  thank you very much
