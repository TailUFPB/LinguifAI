since donald trump first escalated into our lives as a gop presidential candidate  his one major policy platform has been the wall he says he s going to build along the mexican border  most who have any common sense at all know that his proposed wall would be an impossibility and former texas governor rick perry says the wall won t happen at all  it will be a  digital wall  perry was interviewed on monday by snapchat s peter hamby on  good luck america   hamby argued that the wall is  not going to happen  perry  who is a trump supporter agreed  well  it s not   perry said  explaining   it s a wall  but it s a technological wall  it s a digital wall  perry  who is supporting trump  commented   there are some that hear this is going to be   miles from brownsville to el paso   foot high  and listen  i know you can t do that   source  politicoit s not the first time perry has criticized the idea of the wall  in january  he said that the wall  will take literally years  i don t care how good of a builder you are  the cornerstone of trump s campaign has been the wall  and it s never been a digital wall  whatever that might be  this  from an october debate  is pretty much how trump has been talking about the wall from the very beginning  we re going to do a wall  we re going to have a big  fat beautiful door on the wall  we re going to have people come in  but they re going to come in legally   trump said at the third republican debate  hosted by cnbc  mexico s going to pay for the wall   he said   i love the mexican people  i respect the mexican leaders  but their leaders are much sharper  much smarter and more cunning than our leader  source  cnbcthis is how trump describes the wall  it doesn t sound digital  so you take precast plank   trump said   it comes  feet long   feet long   feet long  you see the highways where they can span    feet  even longer than that  right  and do you a beautiful nice precast plank with beautiful everything  just perfect  he added   i want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they ll call it the trump wall  source  the washington postlet s not give perry credit for being smarter than trump just because he knows the wall is unrealistic  a  digital wall  is just as ridiculous as the monstrous wall that trump is proposing  in a very misguided way  it seems perry is still vying for trump s vp slot  although contradicting the billionaire is probably not the way to do it featured image of rick perry by michael b  thomas at getty images   featured image of donald trump by john sommers ii at getty images
