a male idaho republican with five daughters made some creepy and outrageous claims during a hearing on an abortion bill on thursday according to the spokesman review  the bill  would require women seeking abortions to be given a list of providers of free ultrasounds  and to be told they have a right to such a procedure and to hear a fetal heart monitor  and does not include exceptions for rape and incest victims during the hearing  a crisis pregnancy center employee was testifying when gop state rep  pete nielsen made cringe worthy remarks reminiscent of former missouri rep  todd akin  who in  claimed that women have natural defenses to shut down the reproductive process if she is going through a  legitimate rape  now  i m of the understanding that in many cases of rape it does not involve any pregnancy because of the trauma of the incident   nielsen said when the cpc employee claimed that her organization had already persuaded two rape victims against having an abortion   that may be true with incest a little bit   nielsen continued here s audio of nielsen s remarks via youtube after the hearing  nielsen doubled down on his remarks  claiming that pregnancy  doesn t happen as often as it does with consensual sex  because of the trauma involved  in fact  a study conducted in  found that around   rapes result in pregnancy every year the spokesman review also did some digging and reported the scientific consensus on the issue is that rape is as likely to result in pregnancy as consensual sex  and some studies suggest the rate of pregnancy is higher in rape  a  study that appeared in the scientific journal  human nature   for instance  found that the rate of pregnancy from rape exceeded the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex by a  sizable margin  but nielsen  who is not a doctor  said  that s information that i ve had through the years   and then admitted   whether it s totally accurate or not  i don t know  in other words  nielsen has no clue what he is talking about  but decided to make the remarks anyway women do not have a natural ability to halt the reproductive process any more than men do  all it takes is one sperm to reach and join a woman s egg to result in a pregnancy  the reproductive process makes no distinction between consensual and non consensual sex but nielsen couldn t stop talking and made a really creepy remark about why he believes rape and incest don t cause pregnancy  i read a lot of information  i have read it several times    being a father of five girls  i ve explored this a lot  yeah  he really said that planned parenthood in idaho legislative director hannah brass greer expressed outrage that nielsen  or any lawmaker for that matter  could make such a claim  that s obviously  medically  scientifically inaccurate   she said   that type of comment we ve heard before  when politics get in the way of medical care  it s harmful on so many levels  indeed  not only are such remarks harmful to women and science  it s proven to be especially harmful to republicans during an election year  as you ll recall  todd akin went on to lose his senate race to claire mccaskill  other republicans who spoke about rape such as richard mourdock in indiana also lost their bid for public office  republicans also lost in the presidential race that same year because they couldn t stop talking about rape  which caused women to flock to the democratic party it is an issue that has absolutely shredded republicans in recent years  so it will interesting to see how republicans  especially those who are running for president in   respond if they are asked to comment on nielsen s remarks  and if anything  it demonstrates that republicans still have not learned to keep their mouths shut and that they still hold inaccurate beliefs about rape and the female reproductive system featured image via raw story
