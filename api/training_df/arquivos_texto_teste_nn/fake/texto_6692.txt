women make up over  percent of this country  but are grossly underrepresented in just about everything  in the united states congress  more than  percent of those representing the people are men    percent in the senate   percent in the house on the supreme court  only three of the nine justices are women and yes  even in the progressive obama administration  only  out of the  individuals who have served in his cabinet have been women    percent it is no secret that washington d c  is still a hard place for a woman to find her voice  even though it s been proven statistically that when women take charge of the operations and debates in d c   stuff gets done quicker in a more bipartisan manner  still  women aren t taken seriously but hillary clinton  while shattering that glass ceiling herself  wants to shatter it in all aspects of d c   starting with her cabinet  should she win the presidency in an msnbc town hall monday night  clinton told viewers that she intends to have her cabinet reflect the demographics of america well  i am going to have a cabinet that looks like america  and  percent of america is women  whether it s in a vice president or members of a cabinet or in the white house staff  i want as broad a set of experiences that i can possibly draw together  because i m someone who likes to listen to people who come at problems from different perspectives while donald trump accuses her of playing the  woman card   clinton is setting in motion a push to make women more equally represented in american society  something trump would never consider should clinton win  she not only is responsible for her cabinet  but also her appointments to the supreme court  which could produce two vacancies in the next four years but it s this particular election that could be a driving force for women in congress  democrats have the opportunity to get out and elect women  from california to maryland  from new york to florida if women are fifty percent of our population  then they deserve equal representation at every level  and clinton seems to definitely be on board with making sure that happens if she were to become president featured image via justin sullivan getty images
