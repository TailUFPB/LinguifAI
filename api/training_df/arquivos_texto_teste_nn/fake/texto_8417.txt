apparently  male tennessee republican lawmakers are so sleazy and horny that the female house speaker has warned interns to stay far away from them in the wake of state gop rep  jeremy durham resigning his position as majority whip after getting caught creepily sexting female interns  house speaker beth harwell is instructing the director of the internship program to institute new rules to keep interns safe from the wandering eyes of male lawmakers  as a precautionary measure  i have instructed the director of the internship program that interns are not to attend receptions or events related to the legislature  and they are not to give their cell phone numbers to members   she announced on monday harwell also announced the formation of a committee to review the  year old sexual harassment policy that somehow hasn t been changed over the years  if any personnel have suggestions for improvement  i urge them to give the committee their recommendations   harwell said   at the conclusion of this review  the members will go through sexual harassment training  but talking points memo reports that democrats are criticizing the new rules because they appear to be blaming the female interns for the behavior of male lawmakers instead of focusing on keeping the lawmakers in check  signaling out one group of women and asking them to change their behavior is a completely inadequate and inappropriate response to a problem with alleged behavior by a lawmaker   rep  mike stewart said stewart does have a point  at the very least  new restrictions could be instituted regulating how lawmakers interact and behave around female interns  instead of focusing on just the interns  focus on the lawmakers equally as for durham  harwell and other gop leaders have called for him to reign his seat entirely  if the rumors i continue to hear regarding representative durham are true  representative durham needs to focus on his family and receiving the help he needs   harwell said gop chairman ryan haynes also called for durham to step down  in light of these recent revelations  i do think it is important that representative durham step down from his position as a member of this body so that the legislators can continue to focus on the important work that tennesseans expect us to focus on  seriously  tennessee  you need to get your act together because this is just embarrassing  featured image from twitter
