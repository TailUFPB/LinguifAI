mark cuban is much richer than donald trump  he is also sane enough to see that donald trump is a lunatic who would destroy the country  that is why cuban has endorsed hillary clinton  he also devoted his saturday afternoon campaigning for her in his hometown of pittsburgh  pennsylvania while taking the stage in front of more than   people  cuban immediately lit into trump  even going so far as to call the real estate tycoon turned wannabe politician a  jagoff   which is apparently a local term to describe an incompetent jackass like trump  cuban said  you know what we call a person like that  you know  the screamers  the yellers  the people who try to intimidate you  you know what we call a person like that in pittsburgh  a jag off  is there any bigger jag off in the world than donald trump  this  of course was greeted with cheers from cuban s hometown crowd  in an interview with cnn  cuban said that he was doing all he can to get clinton elected because he is afraid of donald trump  cuban said  initially  i really hoped he would be something different  that as a businessperson  i thought there was an opportunity there  but then he went off the reservation and went bats  crazy  cuban isn t the only prominent american who thinks trump is nuts  the democratic national convention stage was littered with republicans and independents who want hillary elected in order to save the world from trump  this list includes former new york city mayor and billionaire michael bloomberg  and former reagan white house official doug elmets other republicans really need to listen to cuban  bloomberg  elmets  and other people who are trying to save this great nation from this dangerously unqualified demagogue  swallow your pride  forget about politics  and think of the bigger picture  folks  the future of the country and the world depend on electing hillary clinton and defeating donald trump watch the video of cuban s stump speech below featured image via video screen capture
