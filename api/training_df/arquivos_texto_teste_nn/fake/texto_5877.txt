president obama is pissed off and he took republicans and their nominee to the woodshed on tuesday for inciting hate against all muslims and insisting that describing terrorists using certain words will make the threat disappear ever since the mass shooting in orlando  republicans and donald trump have suggested that president obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t said the words   radical islamic terrorism  apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit  president obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the treasury department  what exactly would using this language accomplish  what exactly would it change  would it make isil less committed to try and kill americans  would it bring in more allies  is there a military strategy that is served by this  the answer is none of the above  calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away  this is a political distraction   obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military  the men and women who put their lives at risk and the special forces i ordered to get bin laden and are now on the ground in iraq and in syria   they know full well who the enemy is  so do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots  and protecting all americans  including politicians who tweet  and appear on cable news shows  they know what the nature of the enemy is  so there s no magic to the phrase  radical islam   it s a political talking point  clearly  obama was taking aim squarely at donald trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet  but president obama had more strong words to say to republicans and trump on the subject of discriminating against all muslim for the actions of one in orlando  we are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be   obama said in reference to trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all muslims from entering the country   we re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting  where this can lead us  are we going to start treating all muslim americans differently  are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance  are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith  we ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign  do republican officials actually agree with this  because that s not the america we want  it doesn t reflect our democratic ideals  it will make us less safe  here s the video via youtube president obama has rarely displayed flashes of impatience or anger in response to the republican party  but after trump and the gop have started to suggest that obama is helping the terrorists  it appears president obama is done taking shit from them at a time when he is busy trying to take out isis leaders even as republicans continue to refuse to do their part by declaring war indeed  if republicans believe terrorism is such a big threat  one would think they would take the step of declaring war so that president obama can use all the tools at his disposal to destroy the terrorists and present a united white house and congress to the american people on this serious issue but trump and republicans would rather play partisan games instead of doing their jobs to protect the american people featured image  screenshot
