we know that donald trump appeals to what he calls the  poorly educated    just take a look around any of his rallies   but there is a disturbing number of  highly educated  voters who are also backing the candidate whose platform includes building an  ft tall cement wall and tracking muslim americans in a database one such couple  who describe themselves as  affluent americans with postgraduate degrees   wrote a letter to the financial times that lays out their support for trump  it s as baffling as it is terrifying noting that they are  socially liberal and fiscally mildly conservative   the couple  identified as jon and elsa sands  say they are  well aware of  vulgarity and nous deficiency  and yet are tempted to vote for him anyway electing the standard bearer of the democratic party seems purposeless  the neanderthal republicans barely respected the legitimacy of bill clinton s or barack obama s election  let alone that of hillary who would arrive tainted with scandal and the email lapses hanging over her head  we would get four years of gridlock and  hearings   the republican tribunes  ted cruz and marco rubio  are backward  foolish and inexperienced  john kasich  a moderate with extensive governmental experience and a willingness to compromise  is an also ran the logic  if it can be called that  is that republicans in congress won t let democratic presidents do anything so you might as well go all in on a republican outsider like trump  this seems to fly directly in the face of president obama s actual accomplishments  an ever growing list that is proof that an intelligent  driven democratic president can easily outsmart the party of no if he puts his or her mind to it no matter  say the sands  they are going with trump that leaves the donald  really a moderate in wolf s garb  who would owe nothing to either party and might strike deals  for instance on tax reform  yes  we could be like the good citizens who voted for a  tameable  hitler in  to get things back on track  but the alternatives look worse trump  who advocates for bringing back torture and killing the families of terrorists  is what the sands consider a  moderate in wolf s garb   okay but even if trump turns out to be as bad as he freely admits he will be  voting for a democrat  they say  is worse than knowingly voting for hitler  needless to say  this affluent white couple believe they will be safe from the programs of racial and religious of institutionalized bigotry trump is sure to institute  because if it doesn t affect you  then what s a little dash of war crimes and racism when trump will stand strong on  giving you tax breaks while the temptation is to blast this couple for their terrifying support of trump  the scarier thing is  they aren t alone don t laugh at the  sure  maybe he s hitler  but  argument in ft  ive heard that many many times from otherwise reasonable people this cycle  asawin suebsaeng     march    must never be ignored that trump s victories in every primary state so far has been coming from both low income and high income  white people  and  poorly educated  and  highly educated   white people   the sands represent the beginning pangs of those looking to excuse trump s worst attributes so they can support the dictator they want and still sleep at night as the sands themselves bring up  a lot of  good people  voted for adolf hitler in   believing him to be an antidote to the dysfunctional german government at the time  he brought change   but not the kind many people would have liked to see featured image via darron birgenheier flickr
