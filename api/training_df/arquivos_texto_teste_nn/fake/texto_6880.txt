ben carson  who was once one of the more promising republican presidential candidates before his insanity and outlandish remarks ruined his campaign  is sounding more and more like front runner donald trump as the days go by in an interview with andrea mitchell on msnbc  the former candidate and loyal trump supporter complained about the republican national committee  rnc  convention rules   a predictable move considering how much trump himself has been whining about them ever since he lost every single colorado delegate to his rival  texas senator ted cruz mitchell appropriately brought up the discussion  reminding the retired neurosurgeon that the rnc had been rather transparent about their nominating process  and that those rules had been in place for quite a while  mitchell pressed carson  the rules surrounding the delegate selection have been clearly laid out in every state and territory and while each state is different  each process is easy to understand for those willing to learn it  take note  donald trump is the ps  unspoken  let s keep in mind that trump has no one to blame but himself for not being prepared  and he made it easy for cruz to win the state  yet  trump s team and his supporters are still crying foul  and carson has been jumping on every bandwagon ever since trump bribed him with a job in return for his endorsement and unwavering loyalty  in trying to criticize the guidelines  carson made a startling comparison between the gop s nominating rules and jim crow laws  implying that the delegate process really was crooked and  rigged  against trump  carson said  during the jim crow era  those were the rules too  they were written everybody knew about them  didn t make them right  and i m not saying this is the same  but  you know  i think you get the point  just because rules are there  just because they re written by somebody doesn t mean that they re right  it doesn t mean you can t review the system  there s some things we need to look at from a historical perspective  why do we need the electoral college anymore  stop and ask yourself  why was that put in place and do some same circumstances apply  actually  they do not  we need to look at a lot of different things  you can watch carson make this idiotic comment below for carson to compare trump s completely fair colorado loss to what african americans were forced to endure under jim crow is absolutely despicable  and yet  it might as well be expected of trump and anyone who supports him  carson isn t the only one to make this jim crow comparison  another one of trump s die hard fans  alex jones   also attacked the delegate  selection process in a similar manner  jones said that colorado s selection process  makes jim crow look like a blessing  featured image via alex wong   getty images
