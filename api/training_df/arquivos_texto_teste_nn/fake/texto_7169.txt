two avid democrats took to twitter this week to bring a little more public exposure to an issue far too many people are beginning to ignore  party infighting  susan sarandon and deborah messing  women well known for being champions of liberal causes  ended up in a twitter battle that could only be referred to as unfortunate the incident occurred when sarandon  in an interview with msnbc  seemed to come out in support of the  bernie or bust  movement that has huge numbers of bernie sanders supporters vowing to either stay home or support donald trump if sanders loses the democratic nomination susan sarandon backing bernie sanders is no secret  and certainly there s nothing wrong with it  unfortunately  the growing movement inside the sanders support base to take such a harsh stance of another democrat to the point that you would cut off your own nose to spite your face by allowing a republican   especially donald trump   into the white house just doesn t make sense  the language sarandon used seemed to say she would go so far as to support donald trump  which fellow actress jamie lee curtis just couldn t let slide i respect but disagree with  susansarandon  a possible support of trump over  hillaryclinton is dangerous  women  minorities   immigrants   jamie lee curtis   jamieleecurtis  march    cleared that up immediately  tweeting back of course i would never support trump for any reason  if you watch the interview you ll see that s not what i said  https   t co   susan sarandon   susansarandon  march     it isn t  what she said is that trump would cause a revolution  and when asked what she would do is bernie lost  she said she would  wait and see   deborah messing  another avid democrat and political activist  chimed in at that point and engaged in a back and forth with sarandon that highlights the democratic party s issues with unity  something we re supposed to be better at than republicans susan sarandon muses tht trump prezcy wud b better  the country thn hillary wonder if she d say that if she were poor gay muslim or immgrnt  debra messing   debramessing  march    that i would ever vote trump  https   t co pnenmgmbvm  susan sarandon   susansarandon  march    what kind of revolution   a wall    imwithher but if it s bernie trump i will absolutely support bs  https   t co nqpgcdstcx  debra messing   debramessing  march     the idea that susan sarandon wud say that not supporting hillary in a hrc trump race is a legitimate choice for democrats  is insane   debra messing   debramessing  march     there are people who need protections  and b bernie or hillary have that as a priority  trump does not  https   t co olueahcaue  debra messing   debramessing  march    be fair  messing makes excellent points  but is she attacking an ally  from the video it seems that sarandon is only an ally if bernie sanders wins  but she again clarifies her position   debramessing if it weren t for sanders   whose interests hc doesn t represent  it is a dilemma       susan sarandon   susansarandon  march    again messing fires back  you are not a first time voter your position as a life long advocate  the underepresented is what matters to me  https   t co olueahcaue  debra messing   debramessing  march    your voice is powerful and influential  you not clearly disavowing trump implies that u consider him  vs hillary  https   t co olueahcaue  debra messing   debramessing  march     there are people who need protections  and b bernie or hillary have that as a priority  trump does not  https   t co olueahcaue  debra messing   debramessing  march    of the democratic candidates for president have loyal followings  sarandon is suggesting that bernie supporters aren t necessarily democrats but independents and even republicans  her support for her candidate is unwavering  it s unfortunate that she felt the need to attack secretary clinton the way she did  but she is entitled to her opinion  messing was also sticking to her convictions  which seem to be more consistent with putting a democrat in the white house regardless of the nominee  bernieorbust is perhaps the most absurd political movement considering if the senator loses the primaries he will undoubtedly throw his support behind clinton  clinton has already proven what she will do if she loses when she not only supported barack obama in  but called for a quorum call nomination at the democratic national convention that both ended the voting and united the party around a single candidate the candidates will continue their battle because that s what candidates do  their supporters will continue to support them because that s what they do  if hillary clinton should win the nomination and bernie sanders supporters make good on their promise to stay home  polish off your passport  you ll have a brighter future in canada featured images by alberto rodriguez and bravo getty images
