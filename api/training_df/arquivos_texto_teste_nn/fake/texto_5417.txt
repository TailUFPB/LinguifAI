yesterday  on the first day of the republican national convention  which turned out to be a complete disaster   donald trump introduced his plagiarizing wife  melania  to the tune of queen s  hit rock ballad  we are the champions  the choice of song sparked outrage on social media  and rightfully so   freddie mercury  lead singer of queen  was gay and  for a portion of his life  stricken with aids  this year s republican platform is the most anti lgbt in the party s history  and their vice presidential nominee  indiana gov  mike pence  is a notorious homophobe who curtailed vital hiv aids resources in indiana so the question was asked  given how hostile the gop and trump pence are to lgbt rights  why on god s green earth would queen allow one of their most iconic hits to be played at the parade of hate well  it turns out  queen never authorized the use of their song  in fact  the rnc actually went against their wishes an unauthorised use at the republican convention against our wishes   queen  queen   queenwillrock  july    s to hoping that the iconic band sues the hell out of the deficit stricken rnc  although queen is against their music being used  the right to use it doesn t come from them but rather the performing rights organization broadcast music inc  which the iconic song belongs to for distribution however  it remains to be seen if bmi authorized its use knowing the trump campaign and the stupidity of the rnc  it may actually be highly unlikely that they did  and no one would be shocked if it slipped their minds countless celebrities and musicians alike have banned republicans from using their music   including rage against the machine  heart  foo fighters  the rolling stones  and adele  queen apparently was on th list  but republicans chose to ignore their wishes  i wonder how long it will take them to blame hillary clinton for their mistake featured image via alex wong getty images
