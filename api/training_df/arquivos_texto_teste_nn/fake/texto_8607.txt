folks  violence is never the answer  certainly not in situations like the one that you re about to read about and watch two peaceful  and silent  protesters attended the infamous donald trump and sarah palin rally in tulsa  oklahoma on tuesday  as you ll be able to see in the first four seconds of the video  a trump supporter pushes them when all they were doing was standing there  for one  that s not their job  let security be the dicks   secondly  it was completely uncalled for no matter who it was  even if it was security that did it later in the video  a guy in a cowboy hat attempts to drag them out around the same time a uniformed cop arrives  instead of being retaliated against in a violent nature  the protester knocks the guy s cowboy hat off  it wasn t exactly the most professional response  but hey  he was being dragged out by a man who had no business putting his hands on him  he could have responded in a whole host of other ways that would not have been preferable  such as throwing a fist  in any case  the cowboy deserved it the cop that showed up didn t get violent and merely escorted the two guys out  that  for once  was the correct way to do things  kudos to that man  it s possible that the guy in the cowboy hat was  in fact  affiliated in some way to the event  but we re not sure as of this writing  if he was  he certainly wasn t dressed for it just to show the ignorance of trump supporters  you can hear a guy nearby say that the protester was the  violent  one for merely flipping off the guys hat  it s absurd  and everyone that watches the video will know better  here s what he had to say  in full  good job  buddy  you f cking idiot  get this mother f ker out of here  he s violent  he must not have been paying attention until the very end  somehow we highly doubt that  trump s supporters aren t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed   this is just further proof featured image via screen capture
