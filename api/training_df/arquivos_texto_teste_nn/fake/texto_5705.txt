the supreme court sided with women on freedom and the right to choose today with their ruling on texas  restrictive abortion law  in a   ruling  they said that the arguments that the law merely protects women s health are actually just a substantial burden on women seeking abortions  since abortion is a constitutional right  no matter what the right wing thinks  texas  law was deemed unconstitutional justice stephen breyer wrote the majority opinion  and said  there was no significant health related problem that the new law helped to cure  we agree with the district court that the surgical center requirement  like the admitting privileges requirement  provides few  if any  health benefits for women  poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions  and constitutes an  undue burden  on their constitutional right to do so  he was joined by justices ruth bader ginsburg  anthony kennedy  sonia sotomayor  and elena kagan  ginsburg wrote her own concurring opinion  where she said  when a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures  women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners  faute de mieux  at great risk to their health and safety  the   decision isn t just a victory for women and women s rights  but it also shows that the supreme court would have struck the law down even with a full bench  and a staunch conservative in scalia s place  anybody who thinks that a full bench would have stopped this is living in fantasyland even so  anti choice conservatives are still busy trying to convince people that the law actually protected women  nothing could be further from the truth  which is why this case went all the way to the supreme court  yet  here they are  in all their righteous anger about it  claiming that today is a sad day for women all across the country texas governor greg abbott said  all emphasis from the new york times   the decision erodes states  lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women  and subjects more innocent life to being lost  texas  goal is to protect innocent life while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women  senator john cornyn seems to agree with that  he said  today s ruling sets a dangerous precedent for states like texas  which the constitution makes clear should be free to pass laws that are in the best interests of our citizens  common sense requirements that abortion clinics be held to the same standards as other medical facilities put the health of the patient first  and today s decision is a step back in protecting the well being of mothers across our state  you two just keep telling yourselves that of course  national right to life can always be counted on to provide total ignorance masquerading as sane  logical reasoning on the issue of abortion  how shabby are these abortion clinics that they cannot meet the minimum standards other outpatient surgical centers are required to meet  and just how bad are these abortionists that they can t get admitting privileges at a local hospital  as we saw with kermit gosnell in philadelphia  it s clear that the lucrative abortion industry is not able or willing to police itself and allows filthy  deplorable conditions to go unchecked  ah  yes  invoking kermit gosnell  as if he s the norm and abortion doctors who are actually ethical and competent are the exception  don t they have more evidence than that  oh  wait  no they don t  one case is more than enough for them to think they can justify destroying a woman s right to choose what she does with her own body over on twitter  many are celebrating this as the victory for women it is  but there are still anti choicers rearing their ugly heads with the same twisted logic  spinning this as a grave mistake endangering thousands of women  or they re making the argument that this violates states  rights  or doing both   oh please hillary should pick kermit gosnell as her running mate     scotus
