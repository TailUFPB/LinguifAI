two months before the winter olympics in seoul  south korea  olympic gold medal skier lindsey vonn claimed she would be representing the united states  but not president trump  when she returned to the winter games vonn  who won a gold medal in the women s downhill competition in  in vancouver  skipped the  sochi games because of knee injuries  i hope to represent the people of the united states  not the president   vonn said this week amid the buildup to the  games in pyeongchang  south korea   fox newsvonn s ridiculous and unnecessary comments threw her into the middle of a nasty controversy on social media  unfortunately  with one hateful statement  vonn managed to alienate a large number of fans who were rooting for her to bring home the gold for the united states  if she didn t already know  someone should have told vonn that u s  olympic athletes are supposed to be representing the united states of america  and not the president of the united states  only three days after vonn s statement about boycotting president trump s invitation to the white house  she suffered a back injury that caused her to lose the world cup race  as she placed  in the competition yesterday  vonn    lost her first olympic race in eight years after a late mistake that cost her a medal  americans responded to her loss on social media  reminding her of her desire to make her race about her hate for donald trump instead of about representing america here s how vonna responded to her loss on twitter frustrating to be so close to the podium and to have made such a big mistake but

can t understand i have different views with i m super happy she doesn t come home with medal   michelle rachford   mikkimichelle  february    vonn responded to foudy  who again defended vonn  the only problem is  vonn forgets that she is the person who started the controversy  she decided to make the race about politics  not president trump and certainly not his supporters vonn tweeted   it s
