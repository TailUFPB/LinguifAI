republicans may have done everything they could to destroy the iran nuclear deal  including dabbling in light treason  but president obama was just vindicated for sticking to his guns   and in a huge way in the first election held in iran in the aftermath of the landmark nuclear deal  the iranian people flooded to the polls in record numbers to support the warming relations between the two countries  for anti american hardliners in tehran  this was a very bad day  according to the washington post iranian reformists appear have won all  seats representing the nation s capital in parliament  a definitive rebuke to the hard liners opposing president hassan rouhani s efforts to increase economic openness and cooperate with the west in the first elections held since last year s nuclear deal  none of iran s three main political camps   reformists  conservatives and hard liners   is expected to win an outright majority  but early results indicate the best reformist showing in the  seat parliament in more than a decade it was also a bad day for anti iranian hardliners in america  for months  republican lawmakers have been attempting to destroy the merits of this international agreement under the premise that iran will not abide by its agreed upon terms and that the country will never reform  both theories have now been refuted  the united nations recently announced that iran had successfully fulfilled its obligations towards dismantling its nuclear program  now even the government seems to be changing in a direction towards diplomacy and building international relationships iran seems on the verge of a monumental change  perhaps for the first time in decades  years of threats from america moved the country very little  but the cooling tensions has allowed iranian moderates to push for greater economic and social reforms  as a sign of the changing times  it is reported that more women than ever before ran and were elected to office reporters are predicting as many as  women could win seats in    historic  record breaking figure https   t co woisklluzu  golnar motevalli   golnarm  february    does not mean to say that everything is perfect  the country still hosts a number of appalling human rights violations against its own people  it also doesn t quite love america  at this point  the two countries merely talking to each other is a pretty huge deal but no one outside of the republican party ever thought demanding immediate and unconditional surrender would ever work  instead  obama s strategy has always been to  trust  but verify  that the agreements he and secretary of state john kerry were hammering out were being fulfilled  the stakes are high  greater prosperity for the iranian public and a lesser chance of all out war between the united states and one of the biggest countries in the middle east none of this is likely to silence obama s worst critics  they are beyond the point of rational thought about iran  the results of this cognitive dissonance can occasionally be quite humorous  just a day before iranians went to the polls  and at the risk of looking like a complete jackass  conservative writer eli lake penned an anti nuclear agreement rant for bloomberg that predicted moderates would get demolished  alas  it didn t pan out that way  it was an unmitigated  karl rove moment  and one that should serve as a reminder for other would be critics to at least wait for the polls to come back before thinking up new ways to attack the president s deal with iran something tells me they won t listen featured image via twitter
