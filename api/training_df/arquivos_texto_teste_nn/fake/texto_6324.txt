mike webb is a conservative christian who is running for office in the hopes that he can represent virginia s  district in the united states house of representatives as an independent  just days after webb s announcement  his career may already be over due to a careless screenshot that he took and posted to his campaign s facebook  that s because webb accidentally left a couple of porn sites open in his browser which can be seen in the image he shared here s the screenshot that webb shared here s a closer look at the screenshot the story gets even more hilarious  considering that webb was already involved in another controversy  webb had failed to file his fec report on time  which he claims that he could not do because of a virus that had infected his computer the post has been up for  hours at the time of this writing  since webb posted the screenshot  he has made two more posts to his facebook page  in the first one  he writes a very long letter of condemnation towards those mocking him  he begins the post by writing   see how dirty you are  in the post  webb writes after that one is far more bizarre  he begins the post by saying  thanks for the tab check  ranger buddies   this is followed by a bible verse  for the lord is good  his mercy is everlasting  and his truth endureth to all generations   psalm   post is accompanied with a screenshot that shows his page s reach  that s because he is proud of the negative attention he has received  webb goes on to write that the  the lord  has lifted him up  apparently  in webb s mind jesus has the same mentality as a public relations agent who holds true to the theory that no publicity is bad publicity featured image from screenshot via mike webb s campaign site
