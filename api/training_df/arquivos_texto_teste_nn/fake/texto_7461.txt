as we all remember last year  pope francis made a historic visit and was beloved by pretty much everyone he came in contact with  however  there was a very dark cloud that hovered over his visit once it was discovered that he would be meeting with kim davis  the controversial kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples well  it looks as though the ambassador who set up the visit  and apparently kept pope francis in the dark about the whole thing  is about to be replaced  according the advocate  italian archbishop carlo maria vigan  will leave the position of apostolic nuncio  the equivalent of an ambassador  and will be replaced by archbishop christophe pierre  a french born clergyman who is currently the nuncio to mexico  catholic magazine america reports  citing sandro magister  a blogger who covers the vatican the vatican is not expected to confirm the news until the obama administration has agreed to the new nuncio s appointment  the magazine notes  but it adds that  reliable sources  expect an official announcement before easter  which falls on march  this year  back in october after the visit with davis  the vatican released an official statement declaring that pope francis  meeting with the county clerk  should not be considered a form of support   also stating  the brief meeting between mrs  kim davis and pope francis at the apostolic nunciature in washington  dc has continued to provoke comments and discussion  in order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired i am able to clarify the following points the vatican clearly went into crisis mode to very clearly clarify that pope francis was not supporting kim davis and her bigoted ways  as was originally construed  now  with the replacement of the man who set the whole meeting up  it has been made extremely clear that this sort of thing isn t about to happen again kim davis is a symbol of hate and bigotry  so to see pope francis  who has all too often been a shining symbol of hope and love  meet with davis  it honestly broke a lot of people s hearts  and while the pope is still not in favor of same sex marriage  it s definitely a positive development to see that the responsible ambassador will be replaced  pope francis was clearly not pleased featured image via wikipedia wikipedia wikipedia
