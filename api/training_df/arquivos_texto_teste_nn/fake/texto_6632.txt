all the months of speculation that the modern day kkk does indeed endorse donald trump can be confirmed as the terrorist organization s rebel brigade knights grand imperial wizard endorses the gop frontrunner on live national television when asked by reporter chris thomas who would be the best one for the job of president of the united states  the wizard answered  i think donald trump would be best for the job  the reason a lot of klan members like donald trump is because a lot of what he believes in  we believe in  we want our country to be safe  under the guise of now being a  political  group  the word  safe  has now become synonymous with xenophobia  islamophobia  racism and bigotry   all tenets  still  of the kkk  no matter how they want to word it and they re pretty much endorsing donald trump to make it even better  the klan has  apparently  had success in recruiting since president obama has been in office   and it has nothing to do with being black  so says the grand wizard   it s merely a difference in politics  totally and if that wasn t strange  and stupid  enough  the grand wizard also admitted should trump lose the nomination  they would back kasich  not cruz  for president  why  because ted cruz wasn t born on american soil  in their eyes  he s a foreigner who isn t fit to be president  even though they share a lot of the same views again  this is purely political and absolutely nothing to do with being a racist  xenophobic bigot so now that there seems to be plurality of kkk members rushing to embrace trump  is to fair to say he s the candidate for racist america let s see how long it takes him to disavow this endorsement  it took clinton one day to disavow the phony koch  endorsement   if it s any indication  his rejection of david duke took two weeks and much consideration i wonder how much consideration this will take featured image via john sommers ii getty images
