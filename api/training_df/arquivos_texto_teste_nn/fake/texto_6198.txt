now that donald trump has more or less sealed the republican nomination  democrats see a very real possibility that he could be president and that is scaring people to death  thanks to trump  last minute democratic voter registrations in california are up   way up in the first three months of the year  california added   million new voters through the end of april   double the number of new voters added during the same time period in   and the total number of registered democrats increased by nearly   people between the beginning of january and the beginning of april   compared to a gain of just   registered republicans  according to an analysis from political data inc   a california based voting analytics firm  what s interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among democrats and latinos on those days where donald trump is kind of dominating the conversation   said mitchell  a former democratic consultant who has analyzed california voter registration from day to day and by party affiliation since january source  politicoof course  this is bluer than blue california  trump won t win the golden state  but the state is heavily latino  and that could mean a lot for the general election in november  in fact  it reflects a pattern that s been happening throughout the primaries while republican turnout is at an all time high  democrats have been almost as busy turnout has nearly been just as intense on the democratic side  where   percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots  the highest percentage since  other than the year barack obama was first elected president in  several media outlets have recently reported large swaths of legal hispanic citizens are registering to vote in swing states across the country with the express purpose of casting their ballots against the unapologetic trump  the outspoken new york real estate magnate launched his campaign by deriding mexican immigrants as killers and rapists  we ve seen more people this year that want to become citizens and specifically because they want to vote against trump   said mi familia vota executive director ben monterroso  whose group is among those leading a nationwide effort aimed at getting more latinos to the polls source  latin postthe latino vote represents more than   of the entire voting populace  latinos are also the fastest growing demographic in the country  even before trump called all mexicans  rapists  or blathered on about his  big  beautiful wall   that he would have mexico pay for  the republican party has been on the losing end of the electoral sea change  the last time a republican wont the majority of the latino vote was in   and that was george w  bush  who spoke span gl ish and said he d prioritize comprehensive immigration reform  yes  george w  bush was a disastrous president  but his immigration stance was still much better than trump s the reality is  that without the latino vote  yes  he did win the latino vote in nevada  but only the very small republican latino vote  the vast majority of nevada latinos are democrats   trump has a very tough road ahead of him  there is no president that can get the white house without having the latino vote   mr  monterroso told the latin post   you have key states that without the latino support  the candidate is not going to win  and if those key states don t vote for the president   they re not going to make it  the data backs him up  by most political scientists  estimates  the eventual republican nominee needs between  and  percent of the latino vote to win in a general election still  there is a chance trump could find an issue that appeals to enough latinos that he could siphon off a few votes from the democratic nominee  it s doubtful he ll win the latino vote anywhere  but he doesn t have to win it  he needs about  percent of the latino vote  is that possible  well  romney received  percent in  and he wasn t anywhere near as divisive  if california  and the primary so far  are any indication  things look good for the democratic nominee  assuming the party isn t too divided featured image via david mcnew at getty images
