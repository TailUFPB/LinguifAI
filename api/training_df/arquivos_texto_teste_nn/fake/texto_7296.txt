two african american women who went for what they hoped would be a fun night out at a karaoke bar in fresno ended up in a scene from a  s after school special about racism  the women had ordered some drinks already and were waiting to sing  waterfalls  by tlc when the bartenders began treating them like they were the only two black people in a bar full of racists as it turned out  they were the only two black women in a bar full of racists  according to the women  a bartender told them they couldn t sing karaoke unless they ordered drinks  which they had already done  another rather large bartender got right in their faces and screamed  buy drinks  at them  ultimately the women were asked to leave the bar  which is described as a  dive  on facebook  unfortunately bit off more than it could chew as the two women turned out to be lawyers for the american civil liberties union  abre  conner and novella coleman  the two women treated so horribly  wrote an article on the aclu blog describing their experience let s recap  four white employees at a bar in fresno called the police to kick out two black women  who happen to be aclu attorneys  and who appeared to be the only black people there these kinds of signs have been illegal in california since the unruh civil rights act in  and nationally since a  u s  supreme court ruling outlawed segregation when the police arrived  several customers explained to the officers that the bar staff were enforcing the rule against us only  some told the police that a one drink rule did not exist  others even tried to buy us drinks  but the bartenders wouldn t let them  and still  the police forced us two black women in the bar to leave  police departments are supposed to enforce criminal laws and threats to public safety  not enforce personal biases the bartender and police claimed to be exercising the business  supposed  right  to refuse service  this sounds too much like when the country still had  colored  sections and racially segregated water fountains  but this happened in march  oh those poor  dumb racists  by now they have to be aware that they messed with the wrong people  ignorance is bliss until it turns into a giant bigoted snake and bites you in the ass featured image from twitter
