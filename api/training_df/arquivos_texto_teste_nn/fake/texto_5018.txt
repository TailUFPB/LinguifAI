a fox host engaged in some seriously f cked up wishful thinking on tuesday and every american should be outraged bill o reilly s original goon with a punchable face jesse watters smiled during an episode of the five as he relished the idea of a terrorist attack in october that would scare voters into flocking to donald trump s campaign  if there s one more terror attack  maybe in october  this is gonna make trump s plan look a lot more appealing   watters claimed yeah  that s right  a trump supporting fox host just gave isis an idea for how they could seriously interfere with our democratic process  watters literally talked about this evil october surprise as if it would be a good thing because it could help the republican nominee beat hillary clinton in november fellow host juan williams was disgusted by watters  remark and slammed him as  anti american  for thinking of such a thing  oh my god  what wishful thinking   williams responded   anti american  that s unbelievable  of course  watters then played the victim  why would you say that that s what i m thinking   he asked   how dare you  williams demanded to know why watters would put such a thought out into the world  especially since isis is likely watching  how dare you   watters whined again   it s prudent political analysis   he claimed  oh that s what it was  i see   williams replied   i thought it was desperation  no  i know about october surprises   watters arrogantly claimed here s the video via youtube this is about as despicable as it gets next month will be the  anniversary of the september  attacks in which nearly   americans perished  and as isis continues to commit attacks around the world  jesse watters is thinking about how great it would be for trump if only a terrorist attack could happen in this country specifically in october with the goal of affecting the outcome of the presidential election  it s one thing to talk about an october surprise  but watters got specific and he smiled about it because he thinks it s an opportunity for trump  this went beyond simple political analysis terrorist attacks kill people  they are bloody and violent  there is nothing funny or happy about a terrorist attack  especially at a time when trump is calling for assassinating hillary clinton and claiming that the election is rigged  this election is tense enough as it is without watters throwing the thought of a possible terrorist attack into the mix jesse watters is sick and he should apologize to every american who has lost a loved one because of an act of terrorism  and he should apologize to america as a whole  because what kind of american  what kind of human being smiles at the idea of a terrorist attack so that their political party can gain an advantage  this is unforgivable and fox news should be ashamed for letting a prick like watters step foot inside their studio featured image via screenshot
