the gop s anti science stance is helping them do nothing but spiral ever farther out into the stratosphere  while people who actually understand and trust science are still firmly grounded  the supreme court struck down texas  restrictive abortion law  but they didn t make that ruling without taking a lot of facts into account  many of those facts were science   something the gop absolutely abhors the ruling attacked texas lawmakers for their sorry lack of those facts  the dissent from justices clarence thomas  john roberts and samuel alito seemed to focus more on defining the word  right   and the definition of  undue burden  than it did on whether the law actually had a negative effect on texas women thomas even went so far as to say  moreover  by second guessing medical evidence and making its own assessments of  quality of care  issues  the majority reappoints this court as  the country s ex officio medical board with powers to disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the united states   that isn t what happened  there s this thing called  expert witnesses   and they testified on this case  expert witnesses exist because judges can t be expected to know everything about everything  breyer s opinion cited data  along with expert testimony  as the reason for why the court voted to strike the law down as for where some of those experts came from  a team of researchers from the university of texas has been looking hard at the effects of that law since it went into effect in   they studied everything from abortion access in rural areas to twitter traffic  and they found that the law did  indeed  restrict access to abortion  that just makes women decide to try and end their pregnancies themselves  and all this research points to that actually happening in texas the texas gop didn t like that at all  one of the reasons the gop is so anti science is because science often contradicts their policies  making them look like the dogmatic morons they are  texas even went so far as to pressure their head of health research to resign because of this  texas republicans often said the researchers  math didn t check out  when one unflattering study in february suggested that funding cuts to planned parenthood restricted access to women s health care  the state s head of health research resigned under pressure from gop lawmakers  who questioned his contributions to a  deeply flawed and highly political report   to fire a state official for cooperating with scientific research that leads away from what you think  you re working to bury the research  that s what this was when conservatives say   i m not a scientist  and neither are you   they re really just dodging the issue entirely  sometimes  they re even shirking responsibility for the effects of  oh  say  a bad law like this one   i m not a scientist  and neither are you   is nothing more than cowardice the sheer volume of research that came out of texas doesn t exist in other states  and pro choice groups have been jumping on this for obvious reasons  but conservatives are increasingly anti science and anti education  they wouldn t have tried to bury this if that weren t true featured image by pete marovich getty images
