donald trump has shown throughout the presidential campaign a repeated habit of lying again and again about every issue under the sun  trump seems to be so enamored of lying that he often does so without any logical reason behind it   even for a politician the associated press did some digging into yet another trump claim and it turns out that he s lying  this time about children attacking government funded universal pre k programs  trump said that he favored programs administered by private businesses  instead of the government  as an example he cited programs supposedly utilized by his own businesses he said   they call  em trump kids  another one calls it trumpeteers  if you can believe it  i have  em  i actually have  em  because i have a lot of different businesses  but it turns out those programs aren t for trump s employees but the two programs trump cited    trump kids  and  trumpeteers    are programs catering to patrons of trump s hotels and golf club  they are not for trump s employees  according to staff at trump s hotels and clubs across the country  trump kids  is described on the trump hotel collection website as  a special travel program designed to help make your next family vacation a big hit   its offerings include  kid friendly amenities like kiddie cocktails  coloring books and no tear bath amenities  the trumpeteer program  is described on the website of trump national golf club in charlotte  north carolina  as  a program created specifically for our youngest members  ages three to twelve  which offers daily and evening child care  monthly newsletters and weekly events  ap also interviewed trump employees and asked if they provide child care  they said no  the ap also checked out employee handbooks from trump s business  and none of them mention child care services  when they asked the campaign about the candidate s lie  they responded with a stock statement and avoided answering the question directly it s just one more example of how trump and his campaign is trying to lie its way into the white house  luckily  it doesn t seem to be working featured image via flickr
