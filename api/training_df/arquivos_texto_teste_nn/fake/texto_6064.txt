fox news host greta van susteren saw an opportunity to use nasa to take a jab at  big government  that is equal parts confused and stupid  it did not go well nasa recently released some incredibly stunning photographs of pluto  captured by the new horizons spacecraft during its once in a lifetime flyby of the  dwarf  planet in   the tiny spacecraft took close to ten years to arrive to pluto and now heads out even deeper into what is called the kuiper belt  a collection of  ancient icy mini worlds  at the far reaches of what we would consider our solar system only the technical feat and stunning photographs weren t good enough for van susteren  she was upset that nasa took so long  and seized the opportunity to rail against nasa using american tax dollars while not delivering its photos into greta s inbox faster than the speed of light why did they wait until now to release these  pics taken in  and we pay their salaries in tax dollars https   t co hhxxrfswer  greta van susteren   greta  june    s clear that van susteren didn t bother to read the article she linked to  or she may have found her answer  it wasn t a vast government cover up to hide images of pluto from the taxpayers  it was the fact that pluto is really  really far away and the data takes a very long time to trickle in though the encounter took place more than  months ago  new horizons is still beaming flyby data home  and likely won t be done doing so until this coming fall  mission team members have said van susteren s goal seemed to be to slam the obama administration for cutting nasa s budget  a critique that is both laughably off base and not the issue  as one twitter user patiently explained to van susteren  demanding a low power spacecraft to send high resolution images back faster is like getting  women pregnant in the hopes of making a baby in a month  that s not how any of this works   in any case  the new horizons spacecraft launched in   three years before obama sent fox news into a rage frenzy about  responsible  government  there s no question that nasa has been hamstrung by its dwindling budget  but its financial woes have nothing to do with obama  republicans in congress  eager to kill anything that even smells like it could support climate change  have repeatedly tried to dismantle the space agency s budget over allegations that the data it collects is biased against climate deniers  this death by attrition has meant the shuttering of the manned space shuttle program  as well as cutbacks in cutting edge research  instead  republicans have told nasa to focus more on space   a vague directive if there ever was one   and not on earth  and like any good hostage taker  to show they were serious  the house committee on science  space and technology  a misnomer considering how anti science the committee is  went ahead and slashed an additional   million van susteren s network has  of course  acted as the republican party s cheerleader through all of this  routinely  fox news will feature thinly veiled hit pieces on science and research in order to  prove  that spending government money on such endeavors is a waste  much better  they argue  to waste that money on fighting a losing legal battle for the right to discriminate against transgender children  or on fighter jets that don t work however at this rate  getting a person like greta van susteren to see the hypocrisy in her jabs at nasa and obama might take longer than a trip to pluto and back featured image via brendan hoffman getty images
