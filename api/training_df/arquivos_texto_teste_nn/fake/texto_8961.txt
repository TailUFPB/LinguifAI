even the crankiest section of america s right wing is starting to sense that the armed take over of the oregon refuge is creating some bad press for their movement  but instead of questioning the values that led them there  right wing nut jobs have created a conspiracy theory that lays the blame at the feet of just one  liberal black man  president obama leading conspiracy nut alex jones issued a youtube rant on monday  outlining his theory for who is really behind the oregon attacks  according to jones  federal plants funded by billionaire liberal george soros and the southern poverty law center are manipulating events in oregon in order to steal our guns  ladies and gentlemen  don t let obama be successful when it comes to starting civil unrest and riots in this country   jones said   they will use that as a civil emergency to bring in a type of soft martial law  but jones is not alone right wing watch reports that mike vanderboegh  the leader of the three percenters militia group  issued a blog post over the weekend which laid out a similar conspiracy theory to jones  he argued that the militia group responsible for the armed takeover of a federal building in oregon consists of federal provocateurs  sociopaths and idiots with a john brown complex    vanderbough foresees an even darker end to the stand off than jones though  claiming the militants have  written a check that they expect the rest of us to cash in our own blood in a ghastly civil war  however  despite his criticisms of the group  vanderboegh states that he and his militia would have no choice but to join a civil war against the federal government and all agencies and individuals acting on its behalf in short  a group of armed white men take launch a terror attack on u s  soil  and blame any future fall out on a liberal black guy who favors more effective gun control and every step of the way  the craven mainstream media is helping the militia group along  it is utterly breathtaking that african american s affiliated with the black lives matter movement have been branded  domestic terrorists for non violent protests over police brutality  yet these white militia men can seize a federal building  call any enforcement of law an act of civil war   and they are called  protesters  it is little wonder that these gun wielding lunatics have such a sense of entitlement  they are able to flout the law and threaten extreme violence  while facing zero consequences  while  year old tamir rice was shot dead   seconds after cops found him playing with a toy gun  these men have been able to seize a building with the force of real arms and none suffered so much as a bruised ego  something is wrong with this picture america feature image via cubsinsider
