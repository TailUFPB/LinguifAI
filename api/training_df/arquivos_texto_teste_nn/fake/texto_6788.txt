stephen colbert hit the nail right on the head and surely touched on some conservative nerves when he did a little ditty on the us treasury s announcement they d be putting harriet tubman on the   bill  colbert starts by pointing out that to do that you first have to remove  indian stabber ummm native american stabber  andrew jackson jackson  who was considered a  kind  slave owner because he gave the nearly  human beings he kept shackled and owned a place to sleep and food and allowed the women to have children  the last one is a no brainer if you own people   babies are just free slaves  jackson s rise to the presidency was also the beginning of the democratic party that opposed lincoln and ultimately seceded from the union colbert does quite a bit of poking fun at the founding slave owners  because  well they owned people  jackson  in particular  was all about preserving the   of a person slaves were counted as for census  which gave the south s big plantation enormous blocks of voting power within their state  and just how will tubman feel being carried around next to the likes of washington and jefferson colbert also brought up the gender pay gap  noting that the   bill with a woman on it will now only be worth    yet another dig at the conservatives who are at this moment trying to put out fires in racist back country congressional districts where they don t like to be left out of the decision making process for such important things as denying african americans and their heritage any role in american history  remember  these are the same people who oppose black history month  because why should  they  get their own month when whites only have the other  racism  plain and simple  will be the thing people will remember most about tubman s debut on the   bill  sad but true featured image via screen capture
