at this point in the election  republican front runner donald trump has said enough stupid  offensive  hateful and dishonest things for us to form a highly negative opinion of not only the candidate  but his loyal supporters  staff and voters anyone who could wholeheartedly stand behind trump   and there are unfortunately a lot of conservatives who can   is a threat to the future of the country  while that s pretty scary  there s something that might be even creepier  if one of trump s minions wants to volunteer for trump s campaign phone bank  they re required to sign a six page binding contract that says they will never insult trump  or his family members  businesses or campaign  for the rest of their lives  should they use their constitutional rights to speak poorly against him  trump will sue given how sensitive trump is to insults nowadays  remember the fuss he made when former rival marco rubio insulted his hands    it s not really shocking that trump would make volunteers sign a loyalty oath  that  and the fact that trump is absolutely egotistical and power hungry last week  nbc reported that trump was actually forcing campaign volunteers to sign contracts before they could begin helping him get elected after a strange email came to light  nbc said  in a thursday email inviting supporters for phone banking at trump tower  the campaign tells supporters to attend a briefing and then sign your nda before volunteering begins  here s a screenshot of that email via nbca few days ago  the daily dot was able to obtain one of these free speech violating contracts  and yes  the contents are just as ludicrous as they sound  promise and agree not to demean or disparage publicly the company  mr  trump  any trump company  any family member  or any family member company or any asset any of the foregoing own  or product or service any of the foregoing offer  in each case by or in any of the restricted means and contexts and to prevent your employees from doing so  part of trump s contract  via daily dotalso in the contract are guidelines that volunteers are basically legally bound to trump   they re prohibited to volunteer for any other presidential candidate  should they suddenly become sane and change their minds  there s no end date to these contracts  so trump is pretty much making these people sign their lives away to him  talk about making a deal with the devil the daily dot dug deeper and asked davida perry  an employment lawyer in new york city  if these contracts would actually be respected in court  perry said that they wouldn t  and added  i guess  doesn t know about the first amendment  this is really shocking  he s apparently so afraid that people would say something bad about him after spending some time on his campaign that they have to sign some sort of agreement  i don t see how this stands up  i don t see how a court enforces this  well  trump actually knows tons about free speech  but only acknowledges those rights when it will benefit him  previously  trump has threatened to sue the media for using their first amendment rights to run unfavorable news against him  featured image via gage skidmore
