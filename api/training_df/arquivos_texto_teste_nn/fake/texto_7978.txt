according to polls conducted in november by cnn  nbc news and gallup   percent of latino voters now say they see the gop as  hostile  compare that to responses from november   when the same polling organizations found that  percent of polled latinos held the same views over the past three years the number of latino voters who say they view the republican party as  hostile  has more than doubled even more telling  more than three times as many young latino voters have a negative view of the party today  the recent polls show that  percent of latino voters  between the ages of  and   now see the republican party as  hostile  toward them this is bad news for the republican party  which cannot win the general election without latino voters according to gop election strategists  in order to win the white house in   republicans need at least  percent of the latino vote republican party strategist whit ayres broke it down nicely  in march of last year  as ayres points out here clearly that s not going to happen when the party frontrunner is donald trump  a man whose entire platform is built on racist hate and religious bigotry while it s tempting to single out trump as the  culprit  behind the numbers  if trump is to blame for anything it s the fact that he s brought the party s long existing racist undertones into the spotlight the gop has been using dog whistle politics to rile up their racist  religiously bigoted base for decades  the trump campaign is simply the predictable progression of the southern strategy but as addicting info explains here and here  in catering to race hated and right wing religious extremists  republicans have created a no win situation the party has built a base that only responds to dog whistles  that means that the only way to motivate regular gop voters is by scapegoating immigrants  minorities and people who do not subscribe to the doctrine of right wing christian fanaticism at the same time  every time republican candidates spew the kind of racist  anti immigrant rhetoric that appeals to their base  they further alienate voters outside of their base how do you bring new people into a political party that is united by the idea of keeping other people out you don t demographically speaking  however  there just aren t enough angry  bigoted white people left in america to keep the republican party going  for these reasons  and many others  the republican party is on its way to oblivion  which is exactly where it belongs featured image  from wikipedia  public domain
