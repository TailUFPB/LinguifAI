in a complete  degree turn  a church that was the site of numerous mind boggling anti gay rants will now be home to a shelter designed specifically to help at risk lgbt youth  how s that for karma reverend james david manning has become notorious for the awful sermons he delivers from his harlem based atlah worldwide church  outside  he frequently puts up massive signs denouncing homosexuality and anyone who supports gay rights  one sign claimed supporting same sex marriage would give a person cancer or syphilis  another declared obama had released  homo demons  to attack black men thankfully  manning s time being able to spew insane garbage from the pulpit appears to be over  manning  busy as he was spreading hate  seems to have massively mismanaged his finances  his church is reportedly over   million in debt and the property it sits on will now be auctioned off enter the ali forney center  an organization dedicated to providing help to homeless and at risk lgbtq youth  since hearing about the recent vacancy they have been fundraising to buy manning s old church  in just  days they raised over     it s likely they will soon be able to acquire it  we re confident we ll be able to go into the auction with a partner that will allow us to have not just an entry level bid   said carl siciliano  the center s founder and executive director  because the building is historic  it is subject to zoning laws that make it almost impossible for the lot to be used to erect something like luxury housing or office buildings  if the building still manages to fall into the hands of a developer  siciliano and his colleagues have a back up plan  they will try to rent space there for    a month hilariously  manning seems to be in pure denial that his church is being sold  he insists he s not leaving  in a disturbing video  manning took aim at his  enemies  that want to take him down just because he hasn t paid over a million dollars in taxes  he does  however  appear to be dimly aware that his church will soon be a homeless shelter for lgbtq youths  all kinds of stuff is being spread around  they re going to turn this church into a bathhouse  how they re going to turn it into a homeless building for the sodomites  it s mainly the sodomites  the soulful minded people aren t doing anything  it s not  soulful  people or  sodomites  doing this to manning   it s the government  in december  a judge ordered the foreclosure after over a decade of manning s church deliberately not paying his taxes  records show that he has a whopping nine separate tax liens against him  some going as far back as  manning is always quick to point out parts of the bible that speak against homosexuality  but he seems to have overlooked the parts that condemn greed  maybe he should have paid more attention feature image from youtube
