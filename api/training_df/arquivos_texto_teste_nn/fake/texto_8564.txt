on january   in response to an emergency order issued by the united states environmental protection agency  epa  over the flint water crisis  michigan s department of environmental quality  deq  director  keith creagh  wrote that the state is questioning whether the epa has  legal authority  to  order a state and its agencies  to act to protect the health of its citizens the order  issued by the epa on thursday  states  the safe drinking water act  sdwa  provides the us environmental protection agency with the authority to order actions when an imminent and substantial endangerment exists and the actions taken by the state and or local authorities are inadequate to protect public health  epa has determined that the city of flint and the state of michigan s responses to the drinking water crisis in flint have been inadequate to protect public health and that these failures continue  as a result  the epa is issuing this emergency order to make sure that the necessary actions to protect public health happen immediately  under the order  the state of michigan is required to  promptly  provide the public with  necessary information   in a  clear and transparent way to assure that accurate  reliable and trustworthy information is available to inform the public and decisions about next steps  that includes an order to create a public website where the state is required to post all reports  sampling results  plans  weekly status reports and  all other documents required under this order  as many people already realize  the snyder administration is not fond of transparency  michigan is one of only two states in the country in which the governor is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act  emergency managers and other members of snyder s administration have conducted business behind closed doors throughout snyder s two terms as governor  leading to repeated battles over violations of the state s open meetings act aside from releasing relevant information to the public  the epa order requires the snyder administration to provide the flint epa task force with all of the information it has been trying to get from michigan officials since november  you can view the long list of items that the state has refused to turn over to the task force here  the state now has ten days to produce all of that information the snyder administration must also bring in qualified professionals to deal with the situation  something else the state was instructed to do  but has not done  the state has  days to comply the epa s order provides a detailed overview of the ongoing failures of the state  snyder appointed emergency managers in flint  and snyder appointed officials at the deq as addicting info reported here  the state supplied the epa with documents that were altered and test results that were purposely skewed to make it appear that the water in flint was fine during the annual state of the state address  michigan s governor snyder told the citizens that he was very sorry for poisoning the residents flint he went on to say  you deserve accountability  you deserve to know that the buck stops here with me  creagh s unbelievable two fold response to the epa order can be read as  we haven t done anything wrong   followed by  you don t have the authority to make us do anything right  how s that for accountability creagh states in his response to the epa that the state will comply with the epa s order  but intends to  fully outline the state s legal and factual concerns  as to whether or not the epa has the  authority  to issue the order on wednesday the state of michigan received   million from the federal government  in addition to the   million that was granted to the state earlier this month  following the declaration of state of emergency in flint  so every u s  taxpayer is now paying the bill for snyder s corruption and incompetence yet the snyder administration has the audacity to claim that the epa doesn t have the authority to tell the state what to do it s disgusting and infuriating that snyder s administration has to be forced to do what it should have done months ago  these are basic things  like getting the necessary information to the public  cooperating with the epa task force and bringing in trained and qualified professionals who can address the situation  these are things the snyder administration should have done without an order from the federal government  but they did not in the midst of all of this  the people of flint are struggling to cope with a crisis that most of us cannot even fathom featured image credit  duncan creamer via flckr cc
