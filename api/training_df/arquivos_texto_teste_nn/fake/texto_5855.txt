as debate rages on over whether to ban assault rifles  pass stricter background checks  and ban potential terrorists from buying guns  the american medical association is demanding one thing  research into american s gun obsession calling the epidemic a  very public health crisis   the ama s president  dr  steven stack  told reporters at an annual meeting in chicago that the time is now to fund research  which has been stonewalled for years by congress and the powerful lobbying efforts of the nra  but now  the ama is fighting back  pledging to actively lobby congress  with approximately   men  women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools  movie theaters  workplaces  houses of worship and on live television  the united states faces a public health crisis of gun violence  even as america faces a crisis unrivaled in any other developed country  the congress prohibits the centers for disease control and prevention from conducting the very research that would help us understand the problems associated with gun violence and determine how to reduce the high rate of firearm related deaths and injuries  thanks to gop obstructionism  a lift on the cdc s investigation into gun violence was stalled when senate republicans blocked funding for the research  stack stressed the importance of allowing such research  saying that figuring out why the epidemic continues is  vital so physicians and other health providers  law enforcement and society at large may be able to prevent injury  death and other harms to society resulting from firearms  and before the nra nuts accuse the ama of unconstitutional activism  it should be noted that the only stake the ama has in this research is  the safety of firearms and their use  and reducing and preventing firearm violence  that s all there is to it  doctors wanting to save lives  wow  what a concept  these people aren t politicians  they re health advisors  and america s violent obsession with guns is a threat to the safety and health of everyone this is the first time the american medical association has taken such a firm stance on a political issue on this magnitude  perhaps republicans  who go on and on about doctors and obamacare  should listen to what the doctors are saying featured image via justin sullivan getty images
