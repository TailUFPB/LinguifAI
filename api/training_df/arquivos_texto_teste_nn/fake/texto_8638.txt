representative justin amash  r mich   thinks that providing disaster relief to the people of flint  michigan is unconstitutional  full disclosure  amash is my current representative   amash is a libertarian  and a constitutional originalist  that means that he takes the extreme view that the constitution should be interpreted as the original framers would have  he s besties with rand paul  and a darling of the tea party  i have been to many of his speaking events  no matter what the topic is  his supporters mostly only want to know the latest news on benghazi amash s extremist view  that is shared with the likes of justice scalia  has led him to be very vocal in his opposition to giving federal assistance to the people of flint  here is amash s reasoning for his opposition  while the u s  constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one  the state of michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of flint  the residents who were harmed deserve an independent  nonpartisan investigation  and the persons responsible for this crisis must be held accountable  michigan needs federal assistance  that s the bottom line  it is estimated that it will cost    billion dollars to fix flint s water system  it is tragic that republicans can rail against the government  working to dismantle the effectiveness of its apparatus on every level  only to have their failed schemes be bailed out by the government  however  we are the united states  we come together in times of crisis  man made  or otherwise   people have already died from legionaries disease  people need help now there is absolutely no constitutional argument against providing disaster relief to the people of flint  outside of the mad imaginings of what these loons think the constitution is  fortunately  amash and similarly minded people in congress don t have the collective political power to actually prevent disaster relief funds to places that need them that s why the hurricane sandy spending package of    billion dollars was approved of  despite amash s and other republicans votes against the package  in   yeah  he voted against disaster relief for those hurt by hurricane sandy too  at least amash is consistent in his world view  even if that world view is a complete departure from reality by gage skidmore from peoria  az  united states of america  justin amashuploaded by albertherring    via wikimedia commons
