infamous donald trump spokeswoman katrina pierson has once again proven just how pitiful and ridiculous the donald and his entire team is  in speaking about president barack obama s recent endorsement of hillary clinton  pierson revealed that she actually thinks that supporters of bernie sanders are going to switch sides and vote gop  actually  she said   with full confidence   that she thinks half of sanders  fans are going to switch over to team trump it doesn t get any more idiotic than this  and it s almost hard to believe  when jake tapper asked pierson how many sanders supporters will jump ship to avoid voting for clinton  pierson said  i think the polls are showing  one in four  maybe  i think it s going to be half at some point  there is a transition happening  not just in this country but globally  the consciousness is definitely changing  and younger voters want to see the status quo busted up  that is absolute madness  and pierson has mocked the intelligence of bernie s followers by saying they would vote for a racist  misogynistic republican  first of all  trump has insulted their chosen candidate several times  referring to him as  crazy bernie  he s also encouraged violence against sanders supporters that dare to attend his rallies  another thing trump is in denial about is the fact that sanders will probably be giving clinton his endorsement soon  and urge his supporters to throw their support behind the former secretary of state as well now  sanders fans might not be happy that clinton is leading the democratic party  but most of them know that trump needs to be stopped by any means possible  according to a recent poll  the real numbers reveal that less than a quarter of sanders voters might switch over to trump  the polls also revealed that  percent of sanders backers would choose clinton over trump   but when has the trump campaign ever really been concerned with facts you can watch pierson spew this pro trump nonsense in the video below featured image is a screenshot
