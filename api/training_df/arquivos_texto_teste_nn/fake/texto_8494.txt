in a recent candid interview with the washington post  democratic candidate bernie sanders opened up about his religious faith in a way that many will probably find refreshing  christian conservatives  on the other hand  might want to have a seat speaking with reporters frances stead sellers and john wagner  sanders made it clear that not only is he not going to try to get votes by playing the religion card  he would rather politicians keep their faith out of politics altogether  as for himself  he freely admits he isn t interested in organized religion  i am not actively involved with organized religion   sanders said in a recent interview sanders said he believes in god  though not necessarily in a traditional manner  i think everyone believes in god in their own ways    he said   to me  it means that all of us are connected  all of life is connected  and that we are all tied together  in other words  sanders is describing himself as a humanist in an earlier interview with jimmy kimmel  sanders spoke about how his fellow man  and not a holy book  make him want to be a positive force in the world  well  you know  i am who i am  and what i believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we re all in this together  that i think it is not a good thing to believe that  as human beings  we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people in classic sanders fashion  he went on to pivot from spiritual musings to railing against wealth inequality  once again  we were reminded that when sanders claims he would rather talk about the issues that face the country rather than his faith or lack thereof  he means it this is a radical deviation from how most american politicians approach voters  for many  particularly on the right  religious pandering is front and center to their campaign strategy  for proof of that  one need only to look at how many republican candidates have held rallies at christian universities  several even launched their campaigns at one how singularly focused on religion are republican politicians  consider this  trump  a man whose history of divorces  intolerance  and greed would make even jesus strain to turn the other cheek  has managed to score a key religious ally by grovelling  evangelical leader jerry falwell jr  he couldn t wait to brag about it great honor  rev  jerry falwell jr  of liberty university  one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation  has just endorsed me   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    to compete  ted cruz found his own religious leader to endorse him  pastor mike bickle  unfortunately  the man turned out to be a raging anti semite who claimed hitler was sent from heaven to kill jews  the lord says   i m going to give all  million of them the chance to respond to the fishermen  and i give them grace   and he says   and if they don t respond to grace  i m going to raise up the hunters   and the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named adolf hitler  oops ironically  sanders commitment to avoiding religion in the public square falls more in line with what the founding fathers had in mind when they laid out the constitution that republicans claim to adore  while many   but not all   of the founders were religious  they were deeply skeptical of letting religion dictate secular society and vice versa  religion was a private matter  politics  a public one  mixing the two diminished both politics aside  it s clear that bernie sanders is defying every rule that christian conservatives insisted a politician must have  far from being hurt by his openness about his lack of organized religion  sanders is doing just fine by sticking with the issues  it seems that a genuine drive to make things better for people really does matter more than being able to say you pray really hard  on the flipside  politicians who are deeply religious  don t seem to have a better track record  famously  george w  bush said he spoke to god about the invasion of iraq   either god has a sick sense of humor or the voice in his head was  in fact  dick cheney s feature image via flickr
