over sixty gop national security buffs have taken a pledge to work  energetically  and do whatever it takes to stop republican front runner donald trump from becoming the party s nominee for president this colossal promise was released late wednesday via an open letter signed by several different foreign policy experts who sincerely feel  along with the rest of us  that trump s vision of america is  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle   in the letter  the concerned gopers warned that if given the chance  president trump would  make america less safe  and  diminish our standing in the world  the letter  in part  reads  mr  trump s own statements lead us to conclude that as president  he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make america less safe  and which would diminish our standing in the world furthermore  his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the united states as committed and loyal republicans  we are unable to support a party ticket with mr  trump at its head  we commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office  the letter was organized by former state department official eliot cohen and former mitt romney adviser bryan mcgrath and was published by national security news site war on the rocks as the gop reached a record high panic after trump s success on super tuesday  cohen said of the letter  this is really drawing a bright moral line and saying that if we re going to keep our souls we can t cross it  the letter is  words long  with signers blasting trump for his  expansive use of torture   his  hateful  anti muslim rhetoric   and his not so subtle crush on russian president vladimir putin  trump s proposal to make mexico build a wall on its border also came under fire  as did his suggestion that japan pay for military protection  stating that trump was more like a  racketeer  than an ally max boot  a foreign policy adviser to mitt romney s  campaign and one of the letter s signers  said  i would sooner work for  north korean dictator  kim jong un than for donald trump  i think donald trump is objectively more dangerous than kim jong un and not as stable  by refusing to support the republican ticket if trump is the party s nomination  these   signers are waiving any possibility that they would obtain a high level position with the trump administration  mcgrath stated that this open letter didn t necessarily mean that the signers would be voting for a democratic president  but noted that some of his colleagues said they had no other choice  featured image via gage skidmore
