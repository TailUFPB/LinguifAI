this is either really funny or a dangerous escalation  a group of armed  patriots  that have been showing up to mosques to terrorize muslims going to pray were scared off by a larger group of armed african american counter protesters racial tensions in south dallas almost exploded at an anti mosque protest saturday afternoon before quickly dissolving when the protesters retreated a few hundred south dallas residents  mostly black  flooded martin luther king jr  boulevard to oppose a planned demonstration by a mostly white group that routinely protests outside mosques both sides were armed the mosque in question was a predominately black one and the counter protesters were chanting  black power  at the  murikan protesters unfortunately  the counter protesters included members of the new black panther party  if that name doesn t ring a bell  it s a group of pretenders to the legacy of the black panthers that spread anti white bigotry  something the black panthers did not do  much   this is why a counter protest to protect a mosque became racialized  while i have no doubt most of the protesters were racist as well as anti muslim  shifting the focus away from the religious bigotry to racism doesn t help muslims in the long run  it does  however  help the nbpp and their message of anti white hate but although i don t approve of the bigotry  i do approve of the counter protest  ammosexuals have been terrorizing people for far too long and it was nice to see them show their true colors when their victims have guns  too  liberals have been not exactly joking that black people need to start carrying rifles to push back against the targeting of their communities and  unsurprisingly  it worked the problem is that fox news and right wing media is going to explode over this  nothing gets ratings like scary black people threatening innocent whites just defending their country blablabla  the racism will flow thick and heavy and  some people  will ask if this is the beginning of sharia law in america and the isis takeover the original protesters   bair   the bureau of american islamic relations  a silly play on cair  a muslim group  is going to scream  persecution  and beg for help  fighting  the evil muslims scary black people  the next protest will be far larger  with more guns and filled with people just aching for a gun fight to break out  the potential for bloodshed will be a nightmare for the police keep an eye on texas  this could get real ugly  real quick here s the video featured image via screencap
