every year without fail  the first major snowstorm to hit the northeast is greeted by fox news as  proof  that global warming is a myth  it doesn t matter that the claim is nonsensical  it s picked up and mindlessly repeated by their viewers and reinforced by republicans in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry  but this year might be a little different as scientists announced that  is officially the hottest year on record  not just beating the record set in   but smashing it scientists reported wednesday that  was the hottest year in recorded history by far  breaking a record set only the year before   a burst of heat that has continued into the new year and is roiling weather patterns all over the world in the continental united states  the year was the second warmest on record  punctuated by a december that was both the hottest and the wettest since record keeping began  one result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the mississippi river watershed those floods have negatively impacted millions and killed dozens  if not more  and don t forget the bizarre spat of unseasonable winter tornadoes that have been ripping through parts of the country  destroying communities and costing more lives  but it s going to snow this weekend so everything is a ok unfortunately  it doesn t matter what we do now  we re locked into some of the worst effects of climate change for the next couple of centuries  our children and their children will be thanking us for the gift of wild and unpredictable weather  even worse  doing nothing will guarantee that the planet will become completely incapable is sustaining human civilization as we understand it  yet  republicans are still fighting even the mildest of measures tooth and nail in pursuit of the short term profits of their fossil fuel masters let s hope that future generations will have the luxury of examining the past and not be forced to focus on simple survival in a climate rendered inhospitable to human life featured image via the new york times
