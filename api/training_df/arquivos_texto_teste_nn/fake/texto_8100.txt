presidential candidate senator ted cruz  r tx  visited a south carolina church on sunday and in a message broadcast to several other houses of worship  made an argument for a government based on the principles of the religious far right  rather than the american constitution echoing middle eastern extremists who believe that the law of god trumps existing laws  cruz told the crowd what they wanted to hear about where a candidate like himself would take america cruz  an avowed evangelical  made his case in front of a packed house of nearly   churchgoers his sermon  titled  faith in action   pressed a range of conservative hot buttons  from religious liberty to abortion rights to the second amendment cruz warned that a  radical   left wing majority  on the supreme court could result in  unlimited abortions on demand across this country   with taxpayer funding and no parental notification  he called the high court s decision to legalize same sex marriage nationwide  fundamentally illegitimate  lawless  unconstitutional and wrong  cruz has previously demonstrated that he believes religious faith trumps the law of the land  with his support for rogue clerk kim davis in kentucky  cruz was among the woman s most vocal supporters as she refused to grant marriage certificates for same sex couples  even after the supreme court had ruled that same sex marriages were legal in all fifty states and the district of columbia over his campaign  cruz has tried to appeal to the faction of conservative republican voters who have a view of the role of government that is similar to middle eastern  sharia   where religious texts and beliefs have more sway than the written rule of law  cruz found success  when those voters backed him in the iowa caucus and led to victory for his campaign  he had a setback with new hampshire s less religious and more independent primary voters  where he finished in third place  cruz is hoping that more religious extremist voters in south carolina will allow him to regain the momentum he may have lost featured image via youtube
