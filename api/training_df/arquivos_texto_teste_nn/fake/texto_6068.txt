bill gates is the richest man in the world  unlike donald trump  there has been independent verification of his net worth  which is currently estimated to be about   billion  also unlike trump  gates made his money by selling actual products to people and not on the sort of smoke and mirrors flim flam that is currently being exposed at trump university at a recent event  the topic of trump s claim that he donated to veteran s charities came up  and gates   who heads one of the largest charities in the world   made a dig at the presumptive republican presidential nominee gates took the jab at trump during an interview alongside his wife  melinda  at a panel discussion hosted by the news outlet recode  he hasn t been known for his philanthropy  he s been known for other things   gates said to laughter  when asked if the presumptive gop presidential nominee had been approached to sign a pledge to give away at least half of his wealth to philanthropic causes trump was shown to only cut checks to veteran groups after the washington post asked him to back up his boasting about donating   million months ago on the same day he boycotted a fox news debate  arguing that moderator megyn kelly had been mean to him by comparison the bill and melinda gates foundation already has   billion at its disposal  thanks to the couple parting with some of the money generated from microsoft  it has made major investments around the world in education  health  and more gates and his wife melinda are also part of a group of the super rich who have signed  the giving pledge  in which they promise to give more than half of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes  or in their wills  several real life billionaires have signed the pledge  including warren buffett  mark zuckerberg  larry ellison and others  but they haven t approached trump yet melinda gates  with a smirk  said the couple has not approached trump  adding that they are still working their way down fortune s list of billionaires  we don t have any immediate plans to approach him   she said   i think we should probably let this cycle play itself out before we do anything related to that  gates may just be being polite  previous reporting has indicated that trump may not even be worth   billion  far less than the   billion he has been claiming  he has refused to release his tax returns  which some believe proves he is hiding that he is a millionaire and not a billionare featured image via flickr
