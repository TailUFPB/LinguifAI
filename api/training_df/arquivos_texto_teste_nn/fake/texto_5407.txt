tuesday night  retired neurosurgeon and former gop presidential candidate ben carson delivered an  unusual  speech at the republican national convention in cleveland carson  one of trump s biggest  and worst  supporters  arrived on stage with far more energy than he usually has  he actually looked awake  and launched into a predictable attack on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  he encouraged republicans to dispel  the notion that a hillary clinton administration wouldn t be that bad   and said  it won t be four or eight years because she will be appointing people who will have an effect on generations  and america may never recover from that  but then things got really weird  carson accused clinton of idolizing liberal radical saul alinsky  who according to carson is  somebody who acknowledges lucifer  in his book rules for radicals  of course  no republican s speech is ever complete without some bizarre  over the top religious reference  so it probably wasn t too shocking that carson said  are we willing to elect as president someone who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges lucifer  if we continue to allow  secular progressives  to take god out of our lives  god will remove himself from us  we will not be blessed and our nation will go down the tubes   we don t want that to happen  if that accusation seemed strange or out of place  that s because it wasn t supposed to happen  carson had derailed and gone completely off the teleprompter for that part of the speech  according to several reporters at the convention carson s main point  somewhere within his baffling rant  was that america shouldn t be standing behind a presidential candidate that loves satan  and further proving to america that he s still batsh t crazy  carson actually tried to make the argument that trump could be america s savior because he understands that the blessings of this nation come with the responsibility to ensure that they are available to all  not just the privileged few  you can watch the speech below  courtesy of cnn featured image via screen capture
