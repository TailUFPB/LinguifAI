when donald trump stepped on the stage in iowa monday night  we almost thought he might behave like an adult after being defeated by ted cruz  he gave a very  very short speech  a strange breath of fresh air after rubio s   and stayed pretty upbeat and positive   until tuesday the day after his loss trump started tweeting whining about losing  in one tweet he claimed that the people of iowa didn t appreciate that he hadn t taken money from super pacs  he even implied that he was wasting his money by self funding his campaign on wednesday morning  trump continued his temper tantrum and tweeted that cruz  stole  the caucus  ted cruz didn t win iowa  he illegally stole it  that is why all of the polls were so wrong any why he more votes than anticipated  bad  shortly after the tweet went out  he deleted it and posted one that left the word  illegally  out ted cruz didn t win iowa  he stole it  that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated  bad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    he couldn t leave it at just one tweet  he kept going during primetime of the iowa caucus  cruz put out a release that  realbencarson was quitting the race  and to caucus  or vote  for cruz   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud  also  cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter grade of f  and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz  fraud  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    and finally  cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers  voters  that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and  choice    a total lie   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus  either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    butthurt is so strong there he is acting exactly the way we thought he would act if he lost  only it s even more pathetic than we could imagine  instead of behaving like an adult and moving on  he is literally acting like a raging toddler  ted cruz came out on top because the republicans in iowa are  ber conservative   trump is not  perhaps he also lost because of his brilliant dumbass decision to skip the last debate  over more hurt feelings  whatever the reason  voters are not going to look at his recent behavior and think  yep  this is the guy we want with the nuclear codes  this meltdown is just solidifying the fact that he definitely doesn t belong in the white house  featured image from rolling out
