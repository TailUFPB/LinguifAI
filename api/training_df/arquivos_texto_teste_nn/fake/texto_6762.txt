media matters reports that on friday morning  joe scarborough made a total ass of himself by comparing donald trump  the racist  sexist  knuckle dragging buffoon  to the artist now and forever known as prince donny deutsch  trump voters  we all know right now  are so sticky  they re not going anywhere joe scarborough  host   yeah deutsch  everybody who s voted for hillary  well  i guess hillary  number two  he can go to the left and right of hillary and pretty much put portfolio of issues together he s behind nicolle wallace  because he doesn t really care that much  i mean  he s so nimble deutsch  and to the point  to this last point  scarborough  and by the way  i ll give you the last point in a second  but just on this other point where you said he s so flexible  he s like prince  a shape shifter  new york times top left  election    trump s views on gay issues set him apart on the gop  i mean  trump on social issues  on planned parenthood  when he was in the middle of the fight in south carolina  it wasn t like he was hiding things  and so hillary is going to be up against a guy that not only says we re not going to cut social security  i m with you on social issues  and by the way  we re going to kill isis in two weeks joe scarborough is so far up trump s ass that he probably thought this was a compliment to prince  but let s be honest  prince was an artist  a priceless cultural treasure that elevated his field  he influenced an entire generation of musicians and his presence will be sorely missed trump  on the other hand  is a con artist  a tacky cultural eyesore like his ugly buildings  his influence is a net negative for society  and that was before he got into politics  trump s candidacy is not about the lowest common denominator  it is the lowest common denominator  when he loses in november and eventually fades away in disgrace  no one will miss him but racists and misogynists scarborough was trying to compare their  shape shifting  in a favorable way but prince constantly re invented himself while holding on to the core of his genius  trump has no core other than   will it make me money and or more famous   this was a sad display  even for a hack like scarborough here s the video featured image via screencap
