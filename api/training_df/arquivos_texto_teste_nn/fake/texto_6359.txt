well you really have to hand it to trump  now that he s destroyed every establishment candidate  the gop is left with him as the presumptive nominee  although some in the gop establishment continue to kick and scream at the thought of the billionaire businessman being crowned the new king of the party  many are now coming to grips and even defending the demagogue in public and that s quite hard to do given trump s rhetoric and history in a sign that the gop is surrendering to the new face of the gop  republican national committee chairman reince priebus defended trump  even going as far as saying that  people just don t care about trump s alleged terrible treatment of women watch video here during an interview  fox host chris wallace asked priebus about a  new york times report that found  repeated instances of trump insulting women and making unwanted advances even in the workplace  priebus  response was odd given that he is the rnc chair  he said   well  you know  a lot of things bother me  and obviously  i m the wrong person to be asking that particular question   wallace quickly pounced on the chairman  saying   wait a minute  why are you the wrong person  you re the chairman of the party  this is your nominee  and they re saying he has mistreated women  priebus  response was ridiculous  he said  people just don t care  i think people look at donald trump and hillary clinton and say   who is going to bring an earthquake to washington  d c    i don t think donald trump and his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying   wow  i m surprised that he s had girlfriends   that s not what people look at  chris wallace quickly interjected saying  whoa  forgive me  sir  it s not whether or not he had girlfriends  the question is whether or not he mistreated women  whether he made unwanted advances  whether he humiliated women in the workplace  it s disturbing to see that the republican moral compass is non existent  they would rather support a sexist megalomaniac who disrespects women and minorities than say the truth  donald trump is not the right choice to be president of the united states featured image via video screenshot
