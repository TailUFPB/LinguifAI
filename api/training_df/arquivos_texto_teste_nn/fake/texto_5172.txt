senator kelly ayotte  r nh  is fighting hard to keep her seat  but now it seems that donald trump is busy destroying her chances  her opponent  democratic gov  maggie hassan  is leading her by a full ten points now  when before the two were virtually deadlocked  ayotte was swept to power in the disastrous tea party wave of   but her support for trump has now made her look like a fool to be sure  ayotte is no fan of trump  she supports him in the name of  party unity   though  her lack of a formal endorsement doesn t seem to sway the voters  who increasingly view trump and his supporters as  well  really horribly bad people  that includes ayotte  as one of the pollsters involved in this particular poll says  there s a very close relationship between the votes for kelly ayotte and donald trump  their support is sort of locked together  and with the direction that donald trump seems to be heading in  kelly ayotte s task is to somehow decouple those two  trump s stock has plummeted in new hampshire  where hillary now commands a  point lead  she has also gained solid leads in pennsylvania and michigan   two other crucial battleground states  if trump s support is locked together with ayotte s  then as he falters  so does she democrats said just three days ago that ayotte is too much of a coward to stand up to trump  despite the fact that she defended the khan family against trump s childish  classless tirades  they re right  but  predictably  her campaign said that s not true  she s merely focusing her attention on keeping her seat  and trump is irrelevant to her race then they dropped this gem  which isn t going to help her in the slightest  it s just not good manners to attack the nominee of your party  oh please  when the nominee of your party is as dark and dangerous as one donald trump  attacking him may well be the only way some of these republicans keep their seats ayotte is one of three republicans that trump has refused to endorse  and he bashed her over the weekend while inexplicably and laughably saying   i m leading her in the polls  i m doing very well in new hampshire   just  what  it s amazing she doesn t know how stupid her support for trump makes her look if trump can t get himself under control  then there are several republicans that are done  alas  it s impossible to call that a heartbreaking conclusion featured image by mark wilson getty images
