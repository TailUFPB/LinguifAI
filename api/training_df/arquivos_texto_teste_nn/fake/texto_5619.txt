donald trump s fired campaign manager corey lewandowski has found a new home on cnn  in which he shills for trump    so  it comes as no surprise that lewandowski is defending the indefensible  and saying that there was nothing wrong with trump s using a star of david in an image where he is calling hillary clinton corrupt  as if that weren t bad enough  a huge pile of cash completes the clearly anti semitic imagery lewandowski went on cnn  though  and insisted that the backlash his former boss faced over the tweet is  political correctness run amok  the bottom line is this is political correctness run amok  if this were to be a star next to hillary clinton without the cash behind it  no one would be questioning this here is video of that exchange lewandowski  criticism of trump s star tweet is  political correctness run amok  https   t co   cnnsotu https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  july    the thing is  though  it s not political correctness  it s calling out bigotry  and this is just the latest incident in a very long line that suggests that donald trump is a world class bigot  here are just a few things he has done since this national embarrassment of a campaign started we could go on forever when it comes to the stunningly bigoted statements and incidents that have surrounded donald trump and his campaign  the thing is  though  everyone knows that trump is dog whistling white nationalists and other racists with this tweet and everything else he s done  the man is courting bigots  there s more than enough evidence to make that case  it shouldn t be surprising to anyone  though  because at the end of the day  the gop s base is riddled with bigots of every stripe imaginable  and they have absolutely no problem with trump s activities  quite the opposite  in fact  as donald trump just made public bigotry okay again featured image via al drago cq roll call getty images
