when the bundy moron militia decided to illegally occupy the malheur federal wildlife reserve in oregon  one of the things some people wondered about was what the government s response would have been had the perpetrators been black  as it turns out  there is a precedent for that very situation if you go back in time to  the nitwits in oregon are where they are under very different circumstances  they re taking a stand in a place where nobody wants them against an oppression that doesn t exist  in   a group of  african americans took a stand at a wildlife refuge in georgia under very different circumstances in   the federal government took a tract of land given by eminent domain to freed slaves in georgia after the civil war by a wealthy plantation owner  they came with bulldozers and destroyed churches  schools  factories and homes  paying black residents and landowners far less than whites were paid  giving them three weeks to leave the town was called harris neck  and while it served as a military base during the war  it was never returned to its rightful owners  it was instead turned into a wildlife refuge  in   the  protesters  descendents of families ousted nearly  years earlier  staged a protest at the property  it was almost like the protest the bundy a  holes are engaged in  with a few notable differences they showed up with backpacks and tents  they didn t destroy any property or break into any buildings  they were unarmed  their protest was actually about something that affected them  not a desperate cry for social media attention  and last but certainly not least  they were black the government responded a bit differently than they have to the bundy debacle  they didn t leave them alone with free utilities to enjoy the comfort of a taxpayer funded rebellion  they went to court and got an order to remove them   within  hours of their arrival  all but four of the protesters left when served with the court order  the government moved in and removed them by force the bundy terrorists are armed and have broken law after law  and still the feds haven t so much as cut their power  the circumstances are certainly very different  but still it doesn t seem very fair  does it here s a video of the struggle over harris neck  which is still going on today featured image via sott net
