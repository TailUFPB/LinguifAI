first of all  the picture of president trump that s behind pelosi is as funny as it gets  could that be what got pelosi all sad during her interview with joy reid house minority leader nancy pelosi was clearly disturbed by the comments and questions from liberal hack joy reid this morning  she made a face when asked about those in the democratic party that want to see her step down from her leadership position msnbc s reid discussed with pelosi the goals of the democrats in   she mentioned winning back a majority in the house of representatives  pelosi smiled at the remark but then things went downhill from there reid then took a veiled swipe at pelosi and you could see pelosi s face fall   there is still a contingent on the left side of the democratic party  that would like to see you ousted as leader  pelosi is clearly hanging on to her leadership by a thread and continues to deny the rift in the party  delusional oh boy  then reid asked  if the democrats were to retake the house  do you foresee a challenge to your leadership  pelosi disagreed and defended her continued leadership   with all due respect  i disagree with your characterization  i have overwhelming support of my caucus  there are some people there who disagree with me  and that s ok  but i would not say that it s a challenge from the left  because i am on the left  it gets better she takes a swipe at any challengers to her leadership by saying it s about others   ambition yikes  she s not going down without a fight several democrats have called for pelosi to step down and msnbc called the situation an  ugly divide  in the party we think her time has come and gone but we re with president trump keep her  she s great for the gop here s another recent mention to pelosi about stepping down  wow  nancy pelosi can t keep a train of thought going for more than a few seconds  she stumbles over her own words and can t remember what she just said  she gets really irritated with meghan mccain who pointed out there s a divide in the democrat party  she claims that   this is our turn  she s bananas meghan mccain  co host  the view   there s a fracture in your party  like mine  there were people like tim ryan that were calling you to step down and asking for new blood  i don t think it s gender  look at the bernie supporters versus hillary supporters pelosi  let me  with all due respect  disagree with you  there is not a fracture in our party similar to what s happening to the republican party  it s always been a dynamic party  that s the vitality of it  you name people that want me to step down  and i can name you people in my caucus that want me to stay  if hillary had won and dealt with things like medicaid  medicare and affordable care act i had an important role in passing that i had a responsibly to protect that  i feel very confident in what i m doing and the support i have  please don t think it s anything like the fracture that is in the republican party mccain  it hasn t stopped us from winning  president trump is in the white house  there s a break down someplace pelosi  this is our turn  this is the first time since  when we won the congress  and i was the leader at the time  this is the first time the house  congressional   chuck and i  we are the ones communicating with the american people on this  we have a better deal  better jobs  better future for the american people  we feel comfortable with that  we have to get the message across  it s one thing to have a message  it s another thing to connect
