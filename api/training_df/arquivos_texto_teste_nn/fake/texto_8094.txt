ever since the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia  pretty much everyone has chimed in with an opinion of what should happen next  republicans want president obama to hold off on nominating anyone  they are skillfully maneuvering their language to say that the nation should wait for the next president  while everyone with common sense and a basic understanding of the constitution understands it s the president s job to pick someone new the next question would obviously be   who should that someone be  well  as it turns out  justice scalia often voiced his opinion on this matter  as president obama s senior adviser david axelrod pointed out on cnn  after justice souter announced his retirement  scalia knew exactly who he wanted as a replacement axelrod sat with scalia during a previous white house correspondents dinner  and as they sat  they discussed who scalia would like to see on the court  scalia told him  i have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation  but i hope he sends us someone smart  but he wasn t done  continuing  he said  let me put a finer point on it  i hope he sends us elena kagan  seemingly surprised by this pick  axelrod wrote on cnn  i was surprised that a member of the court would so bluntly propose a nominee  and intrigued that it was kagan  the former harvard law school dean who was appointed solicitor general by obama to represent the government before the supreme court  though she had worked on policy in the clinton administration and had a reputation for pragmatism  kagan plainly would be a liberal in the context of the court  and although obama went on to pick justice sotomayor  later when justice john paul stevens retired  kagan got her chance  and undoubtedly scalia was pleased justice scalia was a conservative through and through on matters of everything policy  however  he was able to maintain very close friendships with those whom he worked with and was close to  even those whose leanings were far more liberal  axelrod even pointed out  during her confirmation meetings with senators  kagan had vowed to go hunting to allay their concerns about her cultural awareness on the issue of guns  when she joined the court  she asked her friend  scalia  to take her  the two  who occasionally shot intellectual darts at each other on paper  became regular  if unlikely  hunting partners  thus proving that no matter how opposite some may be on matters of policy  those on the highest court in the land were still able to hold friendships and work together despite their differences  a lesson many in washington probably still need to learn it s also surprising that scalia would talk about who he wanted with the president s senior adviser  he clearly wanted kagan as his pick  otherwise he probably would ve kept it to himself  this definitely shines a new light on scalia  a man whose decisions have ranged from racist to homophobic to misogynistic to sometimes outright cruel  however  he clearly favored balance in the court  and for that  he needs to be respected featured image  flickr
