on wednesday  republican house speaker paul ryan called for an end to protections found in the affordable care act that prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on pre existing conditions reuters reports that ryan told students at georgetown university that he is in favor of scrapping the protections found in the affordable care act that prevent insurers from charging higher rates for sick people in favor of creating subsidized  risk pools  on a state level  less than  percent of people under  are what we call people with pre existing conditions  who are really kind of uninsurable   ryan said   let s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage so that they can get affordable coverage   he said   you dramatically lower the price for everybody else  you make health insurance so much more affordable  so much more competitive and open up competition  less than  percent of people under   is a deceptive way to describe approximately  million people  a report released in  from the department of health and human services found that half of the u s  population has some sort of preexisting condition  that study includes those who are aged  years or older  the term  preexisting condition  is broad and different studies can provide wildly different figures on the number of people who have a preexisting condition  depending on how the term is defined in the study support for the affordable healthcare act as a whole has run mostly along partisan lines  republicans strongly are in favor of scrapping president obama s healthcare reforms altogether  however  out of all of the individual provisions found in the affordable care act  protections for people with preexisting conditions have consistently received support from people in the u s  across the political spectrum  a survey conducted in   just before that year s presidential election  found that   of respondents supported provisions set in place to prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on preexisting conditions that makes ryan s choice to vocally oppose those protections a major political gamble  ryan  along with the rest of the republican party has failed to offer any solid alternatives to the affordable care act during their now nearly decade long opposition to healthcare reform package  republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place when trying to define an alternative to the affordable care act  with the exception of the individual mandate  polls show that people tend to support key aspects of the healthcare act than they do when asked if they support the act in its entirety you can watch ryan s speech in full below featured image via win mcnamee getty images
