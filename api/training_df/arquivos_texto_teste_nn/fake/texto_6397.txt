quick thinking trolls have taken a novel approach to shutting down george zimmerman s disgraceful gun auction for the weapon he used to murder  year old trayvon martin  bid absurdly high and make it all but impossible for zimmerman s racist fans to get a legitimate number enter user  racist mcshootface   who took it upon him or herself to  pay  a whopping   million for the murder weapon  only he or she never intended to actually pay  instead  zimmerman s auction has gone haywire  after mr  mcshootface was deleted  another user named  tamir rice  after the  year old boy who was killed by cleveland police  jumped into the fray  others have joined in as well screengrab via gawkerzimmerman has had an extremely difficult time selling the gun he used to shoot trayvon with  his initial auction was suspended after major outrage swept nearly every corner of the internet  his second auction was also deleted  now his third is being systematically destroyed from within by trolls hoping to make it impossible for  real  bidders to get the gun sadly  it s not for lack of trying  as gawker notes  at least one bidder appears to be legitimate and he has already tried to pay    for the gun zimmerman sickly refers to as  american history   that paragon of morality angrily lashed out at the trolls who kept derailing the auction  at one point saying that he hoped their children got murdered  a desire which  for a man prepared to spend    on a gun used to kill a child  seems believable since being acquitted for the murder of trayvon martin  who was walking home with a bottle of iced tea and a bag of skittles when he was accosted by zimmerman who assumed he was up to no good  zimmerman has had nearly endless run ins with the law  at times nearly broke  zimmerman has quite literally cashed in on the murder that made him infamous  by selling anything he can to his disturbed supporters  while appalling  it was almost inevitable that zimmerman would get around to selling his murder weapon to the highest bidder thankfully  the internet has a nearly endless capacity to troll assholes like george zimmerman featured image via joe burbank pool getty images
