monday s hearing on voter suppression and election fraud in arizona s presidential preference election revealed a slew of failures  which took place at virtually every level of government  all of which contributed to the state s march  election fiasco at the top of the list of people to blame is the state s legislature  which failed to provide funding for arizona s presidential preference election in the state s  budget  although the legislature made promises to fix the budget  that fix never happened in maricopa county  where voter suppression issues were the most obvious on election night  the number of polling places was slashed from  in   to  in   but in   maricopa county recorder helen purcell slashed that number again  leaving just  polling sites open for an area that has a population of more than four million people but it wasn t just the lack of polling locations that contributed to the tremendously long lines  the locations that were open were inappropriately small  some with as few as six voting booths on site worse  as thousands of voters waited in line outside the polling locations  half the voting booths were purposely left empty by poll workers  who trickled voters in as slowly as possible during the hearing  angry maricopa county residents told stories of being forced to wait more than six hours to cast a ballot in the presidential preference election  some talked about how the incredibly long lines and lack of accommodations for people with disabilities made it impossible for them to cast a ballot at all a poll worker testified that the system in her district attempted to force her to give republican ballots to democratic voters throughout the day  to her credit  she gave those voters paper ballots and recorded every person that was impacted by the supposed system failure secretary of state michele reagan testified about what she claims were multiple unintended failures which occurred on the secretary of state s website those  mishaps  ranged from the system s failure to identify registered voters when the information was entered in lower case letters  to the system  accidentally  showing  percent reporting  along with patently false election results  at least six hours before the last vote was cast one of the most important things to come out of the hearing  however  was secretary of state reagan s acknowledgement that voter registration information was tampered with when asked if there was any truth to the widespread allegations that the party affiliation of voters was changed ahead of the election  reagan immediately responded by saying  yes  she then told the election committee  this is something that i know happened  and i know it happened to people in this room  it is not hearsay  it happened to someone in my own office  watch this video clip from her testimony below on monday  anonymous released the preliminary results of their own investigation into arizona election fraud so far the group has confirmed  voters whose party affiliation was altered ahead of the arizona primary  of those  anonymous has verified that  republicans   democrats and one voter of unidentified party affiliation were impacted the group further confirms that of the  democrats they have identified thus far  two were hillary clinton supporters   were bernie sanders supporters and  were of unknown preference anonymous is trying to determine if the voter database was hacked during the hearing  geoff woods of phoenix rising media testified that his organization is aware of at least   people whose party affiliation was changed secretary of state reagan stated that her office handled more than   calls on election day  while acknowledging that the lack of staffing at her agency likely resulted in many calls going unanswered after the arizona legislature made the decision to shut down the hearing  in spite of the fact that many more disenfranchised voters had waited for hours to have their turn to speak  the hearing ended in chaos at least one person was arrested  as hundreds of citizens looked on in disbelief   is this america   one man shouted fox  in phoenix uploaded the entire hearing to youtube in two parts  watch part one here  and part two here the citizens of arizona are demanding a federal investigation into the may  election fiasco image credit  video screen capture via fox  phoenix on youtube
