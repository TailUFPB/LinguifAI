earlier this week after the death of mrs  reagan was announced  the gop  including trump  came out to show their full support for ronald reagan s spouse  it s customary  for sure   and trump was no exception  he  of course  had nice things to say calling her   the wife of a truly great president  and  an amazing woman  he s fighting to win the republican nomination   he has to say these things yet   in a bombshell new report that was just dug up by politico and obtained from the archives of columnist liz smith s off the record interview with trump in  from the university of texas at austin  trump made some truly nasty comments about her  and   you can bet there s no way he can show his face at her funeral now  if he was invited  he was just uninvited the transcript runs  pages long  but here are the parts of the interview that are truly damaging for trump smith  i ve been invited to go to ronald reagan s funeral  i m debating about going trump  do you like her smith  i did  i do like her  i think she s  trump  you know  i respect that she was so loyal smith  she s  i don t think she was terribly smart  she s not a smart person trump  i never heard that statement that you didn t think she was that smart smith  i don t believe she s very smart trump  that s very interesting smith  she had really trivial  trump  she was never very beautiful  that s for sure smith  no  she wasn t great  she was pretty  but not great why trump thought it was necessary to comment on the former first lady s appearance is beyond us  but her looks somehow seemed to matter  this is revealing for how trump views women in general and their worth  despite what he said about mrs  reagan  though  he had nothing but good things to say about mr  reagan s appearance  president reagan  on the other hand  was truly a handsome man  even though trump is trying his best to invoke ronald reagan s name to gain influence with potential voters  it s probably important to note that mrs  reagan herself wasn t a fan of donald trump  it s been reported that one of her last words were   do not vote for donald trump   if true  the voters aren t listening  and   it s one reason why the gop has splintered into two and is in the disarray that it s in now according to a nurse  identified as althea thoone  she said  she watched all the  debates  she was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events  especially about the election  she said no true republican would cast a vote for donald trump she was not happy at all because i don t believe she thought donald trump was a real republican  she took a turn for the worse after the  debate when he started talking about his private parts  and all that other nonsense about mitt romney getting down on his knees  so  nasty comment or not  it doesn t look like trump would have made a very good guest at the funeral  hillary clinton  however  will be there  what does that tell you featured image via wikimedia
