after the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia  many have been left wondering who will fill his staunchly conservative shoes  republicans have made it their mission to prevent any person president obama appoints from getting anywhere near the supreme court  even going so far as to say they won t remotely consider anyone until a new president is in office  however  president obama knows that it s his constitutional responsibility to appoint someone into the role  and it s a responsibility he takes very seriously in a post to the prominent scotusblog  president obama lays down why he s still going forward and appointing someone  why he ll be appointing them  the qualities he s looking for in a justice  and expects republicans to follow through with their constitutional duty as well he writes  the constitution vests in the president the power to appoint judges to the supreme court   it s a duty that i take seriously  and one that i will fulfill in the weeks ahead it s also one of the most important decisions that a president will make   rulings handed down by the supreme court directly affect our economy  our security  our rights  and our daily lives needless to say  this isn t something i take lightly   it s a decision to which i devote considerable time  deep reflection  careful deliberation  and serious consultation with legal experts  members of both political parties  and people across the political spectrum   and with thanks to scotusblog for allowing me to guest post today  i thought i d share some spoiler free insights into what i think about before appointing the person who will be our next supreme court justice first and foremost  the person i appoint will be eminently qualified   he or she will have an independent mind  rigorous intellect  impeccable credentials  and a record of excellence and integrity   i m looking for a mastery of the law  with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the court  and provide clear answers to complex legal questions second  the person i appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary s role  who understands that a judge s job is to interpret the law  not make the law   i seek judges who approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda  but rather a commitment to impartial justice  a respect for precedent  and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand but i m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the supreme court in which the law is not clear   there will be cases in which a judge s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective  ethics  and judgment   that s why the third quality i seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory  nor some footnote in a dusty casebook   it s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom  experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise  but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people s lives in a big  complicated democracy  and in rapidly changing times   that  i believe  is an essential element for arriving at just decisions and fair outcomes a sterling record   a deep respect for the judiciary s role   an understanding of the way the world really works   that s what i m considering as i fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court   and as senators prepare to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the person i appoint  i hope they ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the court can continue to serve the american people at full strength  president obama will be doing his job  hopefully republicans will choose to do theirs as well featured image  flickr
