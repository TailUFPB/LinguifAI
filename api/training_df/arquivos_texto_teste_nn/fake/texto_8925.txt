professor larycia alaine hawkins upset administrators at wheaton college when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the muslim community in the wake of anti islamic sentiment across the country  wheaton college  which touts itself as a christian school  also had a problem with hawkins when she said that muslims and christians worship the same god  quoting pope francis   in a statement  wheaton college initiated a termination for cause proceeding against professor larycia hawkins on tuesday  saying hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues here is the facebook post that wheaton found problematic     i don t love my muslim neighbor because s he is american  i love my muslim neighbor because s he deserves love by virtue of her his human dignity  i stand in human solidarity with my muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay  descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in sterkfontein  south africa that i had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in   i stand in religious solidarity with muslims because they  like me  a christian  are people of the book  and as pope francis stated last week  we worship the same god  but as i tell my students  theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all  thus  beginning tonight  my solidarity has become embodied solidarity  as part of my advent worship  i will wear the hijab to work at wheaton college  to play in chi town  in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti sharia laws  read  unconstitutional and islamophobic   and at church  i invite all women into the narrative that is embodied  hijab wearing solidarity with our muslim sisters for whatever reason  a large scale movement of women in solidarity with hijabs is my christmas    wish  this year  perhaps you are a muslim who does not wear the veil normally  perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable  perhaps you are a catholic or protestant christian like me  perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship  but not a hijab  i would like to add that i have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent muslim organizations in the united states  the council on american islamic relations     cair   where i have a friend and board colleague on staff  i asked whether a non muslim wearing the hijab was haram  forbidden   patronizing  or otherwise offensive to muslims  i was assured by my friends at cair chicago that they welcomed the gesture  so please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity  human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic  sentiment  the statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and islamophobia by firing this courageous woman  professors also have the right to academic freedom  one can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues  one of the most cherished aspects of the american way is the right to freedom of speech  wheaton college has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor  a petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor here is what illinois committee a on academic freedom had to say about wheaton s actions  there can be no doubt that wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for muslims is an attack on academic freedom  but what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the christian values of loving thy neighbor that wheaton pretends to embrace  the administration at wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for  they are also betraying the values of wheaton college itself  here is professor hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her   show your support for professor hawkins by signing and sharing this petition featured image  screegrab
