donald trump s rally are a hotbed of bigotry  and that was proven at his latest event in rock hill  south carolina  a muslim woman  rose hamid    attended  and she says she had some predictably horrific encounters before trump s goons finally threw her out for no reason other than the fact that she is muslim  speaking to cnn s don lemon  hamid said  one guy was saying   get out   do you have a bomb  do you have a bomb   i said   no  do you have a bomb   they were saying ugly  ugly things  one guy was saying   god is great   i said   yeah  god is great  though hamid wore a shirt that expressed peaceful intentions  she and another man were escorted from the event by a police officer  to make matters worse  trump himself seized the opportunity to stoke the fires of hate and bigotry in his ignorant base  saying as they were removed by a cop  there is hatred against us that is unbelievable  it s their hatred  it s not our hatred  hamid summed the experience up perfectly when she told don lemon that trump s repeated islamophobia and hate speech is a vivid example of what happens when you start using this hateful rhetoric and how it can incite a crowd  lemon asked hamid what most folks would ask a person who goes into a lion s den of hate deliberately  some people would say   why even put yourself in that position  rose  to be around those people  hamid s response was one of wisdom and bravery  because i don t want to think of them as  those people  i think that s what the problem is  that we look at people and we categorize them as  those people  who are bad people and  these people  are the good people  i believe that people in all camps are decent people as we get to know them  well  she has more faith in humanity   and especially in donald trump supporters   than i do  hopefully  on some level  rose hamid is right and i am wrong watch video of the interview below featured image via video screen capture from raw story
