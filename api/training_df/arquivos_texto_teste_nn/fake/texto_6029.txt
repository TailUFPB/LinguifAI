when you think of anti trump people  south carolina s governor  nikki haley  is probably not the first person to come to mind  haley is anti government  anti choice  anti civil rights and anti regulation  in other words  she is the perfect republican  but she s no fan of donald trump in the past  haley has said that trump  has definitely contributed to what i think is just irresponsible talk   sure  that s not exactly an endorsement  but then  she certainly seemed to leave other options open on thursday  though  haley minced no words whatsoever  she compared trump to dylann roof  who is accused of killing nine black churchgoers in what was clearly a racist attack  these comments are possibly worse than any of his opponents have dared levy against him south carolina gov  nikki haley said thursday she wishes donald trump communicated differently because bad things result from divisive rhetoric  as evidenced by last june s massacre in charleston the republican governor said divisive speech motivated dylann roof to gun down nine black parishioners at historic emanuel ame church  police have said the white  year old charged with their killings wanted to start a race war the confederate flag that roof was seen brandishing in photos had to be removed from the statehouse grounds  she said  and she supports sending the rebel flag in the citadel s chapel to a museum too  but she opposes renaming buildings or monuments associated with the state s racist past haley  who endorsed then candidate marco rubio ahead of south carolina s primary  said she has vocally criticized trump because  i know what that rhetoric can do  i saw it happen  source  crooks and liarshere is the video haley is right  since trump began running for president  hate crimes against muslims have escalated  he inspired at least one hate crime against a latino man  trump is certainly winning with the white supremacist voting bloc none of this is exactly new and in fact  trump may be more of a symptom than a cause  according to the southern policy law center  extremist groups have been growing  and that started before trump announced his run for the presidency the timing doesn t excuse trump from blame  though  like any good marketing person  and we have to admit that trump is that  if nothing else   trump saw the insidious trend and ran with it  it didn t hurt his cause that he was already very comfortable with racist  xenophobic rhetoric  it didn t hurt his cause that he s probably sincere in his hatred  but as the splc notes  it s the job of our leaders to act like adults  after seeing the bloodshed that defined   our politicians should have worked to defuse this anger and bring us together as a nation   mark potok  editor of the report  wrote   unfortunately  the carnage did little to dissuade some political figures from spouting incendiary rhetoric about minorities  in fact  they frequently exploited the anger and polarization across the country for political gain  source  ps magthat is the most dangerous kind of cynicism  it s clear that trump doesn t care if a civil war breaks out  hell  he d be cheering people on  trump has one goal and only one goal  and that is to become dictator in chief  it doesn t matter who is killed along the way featured image via video screen capture
