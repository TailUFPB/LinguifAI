fox news host judge jeanine pirro appeared to endorse the summary execution of muslims suspected of links to isis related terrorism without due process under the law pierre asked her viewers if the u s  should apply the death penalty for isis related violence  there was no real definition of what scale of violence or links to isis would apply  and the u s  already lists  crimes as capital   meaning they are punishable by death   including murder  assassination  espionage  treason  and death resulting from aircraft hijacking  it is not supposed to matter what religious  racial or other motivation a suspect has of committing these crimes   the court is only interested in whether they committed the acts or not in short  there is no need for a new capital crime specific to muslims  unless of course  you re a fox news blowhard with an axe to grind the responses from her viewers began as expected a viewer named josephine raged  they aren t afraid to kill us  so why should we be afraid to give them the death penalty  while kevin wrote  we ve got a few guns down here in texas  and more than happy to handle it   pierre reads this out with a grin reaching from ear to ear as if she s about to break out into a  happy birthday  song or something   when she is infact  calling for the summary execution of muslims she reads out al s comment with the same hysterical smirk on her face  why waste taxpayer money holding them in prison  they d kill us in a heartbeat  adding her own snarky reply  hey al  and if we held them in prison obama would let them out  but even amongst the viewership of fox news  there are some people who have a respect for law and order   and the need to actually investigate a person suspected of committing a crime  rather than arbitrarily killing them  one such viewer  named kimberly  said  don t get ahead of yourselves  everyone deserves a fair trial  let the courts decide  this sent pirro into a rage induced tailspin of a rant in which she saw fit to lecture kimberly  hey kimberly   she snorts   i drafted legislation all the time to increase sentences for punishment  the courts are the ones that implement the laws that we draft  here we have a fox news host openly endorsing the summary execution of muslims  presumably muslim americans  who are even suspected of isis related violence  a channel which calls it unconstitutional to ask a white christian to register his gun  thinks it s totally appropriate to summarily execute a muslim  fair and balanced  not a chance featured image vis screengrab
