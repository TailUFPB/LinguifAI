a canadian couple is facing charges after their plan to avoid  harmful  medicine in favor of maple syrup and other home remedies failed to cure their young son of his meningitis  the  month old died after two weeks of rapidly worsening illness without medical attention the couple  david and collet stephan  are mormons who run a nutritional supplement company in the united states  they were charged with the death of their child and face up to five years in prison if convicted sadly  the death of this toddler didn t come from ignorance  but from the malicious anti vaccination movement  which deliberately spreads false information about medical practices and advocates in favor of unproven  natural  cures that alternate between the effectiveness of a placebo and down right harm  tapes played for the court featured collet stephan telling officers that a nurse friend pleaded with the couple about their son s illness  telling them it was a life threatening case of meningitis  rather than heed the nurse s warnings  the couple opted for home brew concoctions in a bid to boost his immune system  the couple gave the boy who was lethargic and becoming stiff   various home remedies  such as water with maple syrup  juice with frozen berries and finally a mixture of apple cider vinegar  horse radish root  hot peppers  mashed onion  garlic and ginger root as his condition deteriorated court heard the couple on tape explaining to the police officer that they prefer naturopathic remedies because of their family s negative experiences with the medical system perhaps most disturbingly  the couple continues to maintain that they did nothing wrong  on social media and in comments to the court  the stephans have shown nothing but contempt for the judicial process  in the aftermath of his son s death  david has accused the government of attempting to force families like his to vaccinate their children  the fact that the child died because the government didn t force him to vaccinate his children is a point that seems to have eluded him as other cases have done in the past  the plight of the stephans and the victimization of their children  yes  they have other   unvaccinated   children still living with them   reminds us that this is not just an intellectual exercise or an example of the government overstepping its role  the anti vaxxer movement  and its supporters  are putting the lives of real children at risk when they opt for maple syrup remedies over scientifically tested medical care  no child should have to die because of their parents bad decision making  and the parents should be held accountable for those decisions as well featured image via cbc facebook
