there are a lot of crazy republicans out there  trump supporters  alex jones disciples  hell   alex jones himself  but then there is the one who might be the pinnacle of clinically insane republicans   and that is robert morrow morrow is the brand new chair of the republican party in travis county  texas  where the state capitol of austin is located  sounds like an important guy  right you might think that he is some party insider with a track record of qualifications for such an important position in what is such a traditionally republican state  that thought would be instantly destroyed once you read this guy s twitter account it s hard to explain how this individual won the election  with the stuff he says online  it isn t a troll account  it isn t some work of performance art or an impersonator that hacked his twitter  it s really him and it is  for republicans  an embarrassment to say the least remember this is an elected republican chairman of one of the most important counties in the largest republican state in the country the following tweets are not exactly safe for work  much of the bush family should be in jail  rick perry is  was  a rampaging bisexual adulterer  https   t co   robert morrow   robmorroliberty  march    bush  cia drug smuggler  s  homosexual pedophile involved with franklin pedophile ring  october surprise  https   t co   robert morrow   robmorroliberty  march    do all your sexual fantasies about hillary clinton involve  snuff films   probably not good for most of you bill to answer that question  robert morrow   robmorroliberty  february    simply astronomical amount of fully insane conspiracy theories  vulgar references  homophobic  misogynistic  bigoted  racist and otherwise generally offensive things on his twitter are impossible to describe with mere words  if you are particularly brave and have some free time  you can entertain yourself by reading it here morrow goes on to say hillary clinton is a  bull dyke   that she has had more female partners than bill  an obvious dig at bill s alleged history of affairs   and that chelsea clinton is actually some other man s daughter  morrow is an equal opportunity offender  though  and accuses marco rubio of attending  gay foam parties   and said he  needs to be in gay underwear advertisements   in fact  he compared the entire republican national committee to a  gay foam party  the rnc is a gay foam party https   t co   robert morrow   robmorroliberty  february    sure george w  bush can suck a dick better than hillary clinton https   t co   robert morrow   robmorroliberty  march    a totally heterosexual republican  this guy thinks about gay stuff more than actual gay people  morrow also had a now deleted facebook page  where he posted many grossly offensive things about hillary clinton  just one example is below hillary clinton masturbation fantasy update   hours  minutes  seconds  what is wrong with me  i am i getting old  losing the passion  no matter how much i sniff hillary s panties which i bought off of ebay  i can never seen to be able to last more than  hours choking the chicken while thinking about her  source  media mattersi am not going to be adding more of the facebook posts because the one above is probably the tamest out of all of them  if you really want to see more you can follow the link to media matters above  remember  i warned you about them surprisingly  other texas republicans seem to be suddenly shocked by this and are now vowing to force morrow out of office morrow s vice chairman  matt mackowiak  had this to say  we will explore every single option that exists  whether it be persuading him to resign  trying to force him to resign  constraining his power  removing his ability to spend money or resisting any attempt for him to access data or our social media account   mackowiak told the tribune   i m treating this as a coup and as a hostile takeover  source  latestmorrow s response to the texas tribune regarding the threat was  tell them they can go f ck themselves  mackowiak commented further on the situation  we have someone who ran here who absolutely has no intention of serving the republican party with leadership and faithfulness   mackowiak said   his social media account is something that no child should see  he is a total disaster  source  texas star tribuneall i have to say is this  republicans asked for it  ever since  when obama won his first election  the entire republican party on every level from local to federal has embraced the worst of the worst of the worst of their ultra right wing fringe lunatics  it guaranteed them an easily motivated and manipulated voting base  however  now they have to deal with the mess they ve wrought and in many cases  they are simply powerless to do so mackowiak has said he and other county legislators are even considering forming a republican splinter cell in travis county  to form a new organization to usurp the existing one if they have no options to force morrow out of office morrow will assume his post in june  if you re a liberal in travis county  tell a republican friend  told ya so  featured image via youtube
