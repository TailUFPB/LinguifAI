it s come to this on tuesday  msnbc announced that it would be organizing a live   prime time  event exclusively starring donald trump and hosted by trump s personal friends joe scarborough and mika brzezinksi  needless to say  both political insiders and msnbc s viewers are shaking their heads in disbelief the decision to give trump free promotional airtime on the network was announced by morning joe s senior producer jesse rodriguez news  joe   mika will moderate a town hall with donald trump airing in prime time tomorrow at   msnbc  jesse rodriguez   jesserodriguez  february    republican front runner will seemingly get the stage to himself  msnbc has so far not announced a single other candidate would be appearing  nor did they suggest any were invited  he will be met with questions lobbed to him by scarborough  who has used his influence to shill for trump and may even be helping his campaign from behind the scenes  recently  trump thanked scarborough  one of msnbc s few conservative pundits  for  supporting  him when the rest of the media had attacked him when not preparing to question trump on a  prime time  spectacle  scarborough spends his time online promoting trump as a strong leader perceived strength in the face of perceived weakness from america s leaders  what do you think  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  february    donald trump s strength is strength    joenbc on  morningjoe  could it be that simple  huge sc poll  s today  pic twitter com   suzy welch   suzywelch  february    obvious bias has led many fans of msnbc to wonder what on earth the network is thinking  it also has reporters  used to covering candidates with some semblance of objectivity  scratching their heads cnn will have all six gop candidates appear at town halls on wed and thurs  meanwhile  msnbc s joe and mika hosting one wed with just trump   michael calderone   mlcalderone  february    this primary season    not quite the same thing as free airtime for trump   kasich on eve of sc primary https   t co   alex burns   alexburnsnyt  february    trump  https   t co cybcdwwben  dylan byers   dylanbyers  february    depressing and petty as it sounds  msnbc may have chosen to promote trump to spite their archenemy  cnn msnbc has spent the last few weeks desperately trying to defend scarborough amid accusations that he is too cozy with trump  things came to a head when cnn reporter dylan byers outed scarborough as having celebrated trump s new hampshire victory with the candidate in his hotel room  notably  cnn plans to run a town hall event featuring two of trump s biggest rivals  ted cruz and marco rubio  on wednesday  so this may be an alliance between msnbc and trump to hurt cnn s ratings by hosting their very own special sadly  that means trump will get carte blanche to spew his vile hate speech to a gushing scarborough  it s unlikely that trump would have agreed to appear on the left leaning network if he thought there was any chance he was going to be pressed to answer difficult questions for their part  msnbc says they will balance trump s  prime time event  with something they call  long form interviews  with other candidates  they point to one they will be airing with kasich on the same night as trump s town hall  but they haven t specified when they plan on airing other interviews candidates  nor if those interviews even exist cable networks aren t required to give equal time to each candidate  a situation trump has routinely exploited   but holding a prime time glorified donald trump campaign ad is a very bad look for a network that is hoping to appear neutral  it also seems to skirt the line between a campaign donation  in a race where buying television ads can cost a campaign millions of dollars  how fair is it that msnbc just handed over an hour or two of their most valuable ad space to trump s campaign there are already rumblings of a potential boycott  and msnbc may just discover that there are limits to what its viewers will tolerate feature image via msnbc
