donald trump is becoming a liability to the republican party  so gop leaders are backing away from their nominee and aligning themselves with president obama s condemnation of his muslim ban ever since trump became the nominee  republicans have been torn between kissing his ass and distancing themselves from his hateful rhetoric  but ever since the orlando mass shooting  republicans have been finding themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place trump renewed his call to ban muslims from entering the united states and expanded the idea by calling for banning anybody from a nation that has a history of terrorism against the united states  that could technically mean japan and germany as well as many other nations that are now our allies trump also claimed that president obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t used certain words to somehow make isis magically disappear in response  president obama took trump to the woodshed  what exactly would using this language accomplish   obama angrily asked   what exactly would it change  would it make isil less committed to try and kill americans  would it bring in more allies  is there a military strategy that is served by this  the answer is none of the above  calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away  president obama also strongly condemned trump s proposed ban on muslims  are we going to start treating all muslim americans differently  are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance  are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith  we ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign  do republican officials actually agree with this  because that s not the america we want  it doesn t reflect our democratic ideals  it will make us less safe  and in a stunning move  many republicans have joined president obama to condemn trump  i do not think a muslim ban is in our country s interest   house speaker paul ryan responded   i do not think it is reflective of our principles  not just as a party but as a country  traditionally  it is a time when people rally around our country  and it s obviously not what s occurred  and it s very disappointing   said senator bob corker   it wasn t the type  of address  that one would expect a person who is wanting to lead the greatest nation in the world to make senator lindsey graham also expressed a lack of confidence in trump s leadership qualifications  i don t think he has the judgment or the temperament  the experience to deal with what we are facing   he said gop rep  adam kinzinger also condemned trump perhaps more strongly than his gop colleagues  i guess i appreciate mr  trump s fieriness in talking about it  but you don t do it by alienating the very people that we need  and those are moderate muslims  we have to use the folks that frankly are not radicalized  which is the vast majority of muslims  to win this war  kinzinger would know since  unlike trump  he served his country by fighting in iraq and afghanistan as a pilot  he knows that it s important to have muslim allies on the ground feeding intelligence and offering support to our troops arizona rep  jeff flake also criticized trump and pointed out that he has to do better if he wants to get enough votes in november  he s won  million votes total so far  he s got to get  million or so to win the general election  which includes a lot of independents and republicans that don t feel as he does  he can t win the general election talking the way he is  and these reactions are just the tip of the iceberg  yet somehow  many of these republicans still support trump as the nominee and standard bearer of their party but that doesn t change the fact that for the first time republicans and president obama have united in agreement on something  donald trump is dangerous and he is unqualified to be president  it s just up to republicans whether or not he remains the nominee  but if they continue to support him  it will be up to the american electorate to make sure he never becomes president and that the republicans who continue to support him are thrown out of office featured image  pete souza
