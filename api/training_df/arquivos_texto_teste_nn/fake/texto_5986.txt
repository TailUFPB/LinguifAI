the cops should leave this woman  and all of her people  alone unless they ve done something really wrong  and swerving all over the road because she s driving while intoxicated doesn t count  why  because  driving while rich  is apparently a thing in manhattan  on par with  say  driving while black in liridona selimaj s apparently warped mind a former real estate broker  selimaj is one of manhattan s more affluent residents  and she claims that the cops just pick on her and other rich people  they pulled her over because she was driving a new range rover  according to the bizarre claim  assistant district attorney christopher mills read off her full statement at her arraignment  you re picking on me because i was driving an expensive car  you make no money  and you re poor   you re picking on rich people  i had one drink  i m not taking your test  so take me to jail  i ve been through this before  that s right  she thinks the nypd specifically went after her and arrested her because they re jealous of her status and money  she does have a prior dwi from   and another arrest that s sealed  so she has  been through this before   and she probably thinks those were just due to jealousy  too  in all her righteous anger  she also allegedly said  how can you say i was swerving  i m not drunk  i wasn t doing anything you were saying i was doing  i was swerving because it was a new car  the police report says she had bloodshot  watery eyes  was unsteady on her feet  was slurring her speech  and had alcohol on her breath  she was  in a word  sloshed  driving while rich   the stupid  it burns  if anything  the police are more likely to leave wealthy people alone and target poor people  especially poor minorities  it s the same with the courts  what selimaj just did was show herself to be the perfect example of how the affluent expect special treatment  even when they ve broken the law it s also an insult to all the people particularly poor minorities who are wrongly targeted by the police  don t tell her that  though  remember  she s just a victim  all rich people are just victims of the law featured image by spencer platt getty images
