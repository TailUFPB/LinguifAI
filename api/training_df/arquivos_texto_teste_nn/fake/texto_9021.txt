it s been just about seven years since the official founding of the tea party movement  weird  it seems like much  much longer  but there it is  seven years since tri corner hats festooned with tea bags became the national symbol of incoherent  far right outrage over the ascendancy of an african american president tasked with lifting the nation out of a devastating great recession not of his own making the tea party emerged as an unofficial sequel to the angry mobs that formed outside various mccain palin rallies during the  campaign  complete with viral video messages warning of emerging communism   hussein  sleeper cells and rev  jeremiah wright goddamn america hating  a general profile of each group showed considerable overlap  white  christian  conservative  older americans who were both shell shocked by the financial impact of the recession and that the obvious cultural shift taking place in politics  potentially leaving them behind  the president was no longer a twangy  southern good ol  boy or a congenial  plain spoken old man  this new president would be a northern intellectual   an african american man with an  exotic  name and an allegedly suspicious background  a flaming cocktail for inciting white conservative fear fast forward to the months following the january   inauguration coinciding with congressional debate over the new president s stimulus package  the movement proudly adopted as its namesake the boston tea party  with  tea  carrying the bonus  taxed enough already  acronym  both meanings contained within the name of the movement were hilariously ironical given how the stimulus would eventually contain  as a total dollar amount  the largest middle class tax cut in american history as well as the fact that the boston tea party was a protest against a corporate tax cut feel free to spring this one on your conservative friends  you ll render them speechless rewind to  and the passage of the tea act  the british law which ultimately sparked the infamous boston tea party the east india company  an  century corporation   the mcdonald s or amazon of its era   was in serious financial trouble  and being so closely tied to the economy of great britain  it was too big to fail but rather than bailing out the corporation  king george and lord north decided that if they just cut the export duty of the company to zero  allowing it to sell directly to the colonies  the east india company would easily be able to unload its tea to colonial consumers at a discount   boosting sales and rescuing the near bankrupt mega corporation  plus  they reasoned  the colonists would embrace the british monarchy for the cheaper tea  and tensions between the empire and the colonies would be ameliorated  at least temporarily so in may    parliament passed the tea act  the long form subtitle of the act read as follows  an act to allow a drawback of the duties of customs on the exportation of tea to any of his majesty s colonies or plantations in america  to increase the deposit on bohea tea to be sold at the east india company s sales  and to empower the commissioners of the treasury to grant licenses to the east india company to export tea duty free  several months later  the east india company attained the proper clearances and set off to various colonial sea ports with its duty free tea to repeat  the rationale for the tea act was that lower taxes meant lower prices  which meant the east india company could sell a hell of a lot more tea  suffice to say  the smaller colonial tea distributors weren t happy   not to mention smugglers like samuel adams  close confidant john hancock  colonial retail prices would be severely undercut by the tax free tea  potentially shoving the smaller importers  and smugglers like hancock  out of the tea business it was your basic free market precursor to supply side reaganomics in action  in other words  the british government s solution to the east india company s financial crisis was  in effect  a massive tax cut   a tax cut to zero consequently  political activists and  most famously  the sons of liberty  proceeded to intimidate and raid   with orders to tar and feather the pilots   any east india tea ship landing at various ports from philadelphia to sandy hook to  naturally  boston  and later that year  on december     when east india vessels  the dartmouth  beaver and eleanor  were docked in boston harbor  the sons carried out their famous protest  dumping hundreds of crates of tea into the water all because of a tax cut  not only that  but the tea party republicans  while comporting themselves as cheap knock offs of the sons of liberty  have instead embraced the tax cutting  supply side policies of the british monarchy whoops boiled down  it appears as though the tea party movement is in favor of tax cuts  while embracing a historical event that was violently opposed to a massive tax cut  in the interim  the tea party has vocally objected to the notion that something like  percent of americans don t pay federal income taxes  who is the  percent  forbes broke it down   percent includes students  people with disabilities or illnesses  the long term unemployed  and other people with very low taxable incomes  also included would be people like our soldiers in foreign wars who are exempted from paying income taxes while they are on active duty in a war zone   percent of people who did not pay federal income taxes in  are people aged  or older who have modest incomes  and do not have earnings    percent are working people who pay payroll taxes but are not paying income taxes it s important to highlight that these  percenters do  in fact  pay state  local  sales and other taxes  so the tea party appears to be in favor of higher taxes for families  seniors and disabled americans  while also being in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations  the latter being the exact opposite of the sons of liberty  you d think the tea party  which has apparently been  taxed enough already   would support the idea that nearly half of us don t pay federal income taxes  but they don t  weirdly obviously the tea party s organizers failed to read about history before inappropriately horking the  tea party  moniker  and  indeed  they re more than a little confused about taxes  both modern and historical   the issue upon which the entire movement is based whoops again anyway  happy seventh anniversary  you magnificent bastards  hopefully in honor of this occasion  someone will give you the gift that keeps on giving  some high school level history and economics books featured image via wikimedia commons
