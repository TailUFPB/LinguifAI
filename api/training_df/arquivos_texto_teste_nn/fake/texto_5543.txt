virginia s trump campaign chairman politicized the dallas shootings in one of the worst ways imaginable  he didn t use it to call for more guns on the streets  he didn t use it to claim reverse racism  he tried to make it all about the  election and hillary clinton  and it s really sick corey stewart said  in a post that s since been deleted like joe effing walsh  stuart has forgotten that the internet never forgets  and this will follow him and king donnie for awhile  despite spokeswoman hope hicks  attempt to mitigate fallout from this  corey does not speak for the campaign and this is not something we agree with  the vice president of trump s virginia campaign  john fredericks  echoed that empty sentiment with an empty sentiment of his own  that statement by corey stewart is his and his alone  oh  really  they better tell that to their overlord  while donald the trump didn t come right out and blame hillary for the deaths of those officers like stewart did  he did go after her for taking  softball questions  about her emails on cnn on a day of national tragedy  because hillary can totally control what cnn decides to ask her isn t it sad that on a day of national tragedy hillary clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on  cnn   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    t it sad that on a day of national tragedy donald trump and his campaign decide to make the whole thing all about hillary  this is how you politicize a tragedy   by bringing up your opponent in a damned political race and using the tragedy to attack them it is truly hypocritical that our wannabe white supremacist in chief would say something like that when he and one of his campaign officials are busy politicizing all of this in the sickest way imaginable  calling for more  good guys with guns  would be less political than this  it just goes to prove that all trump really cares about his himself and his campaign  and that he hires people who will help him with that  neither trump nor stewart really care about those dead officers  or all those dead black people featured image by libandjustice  licensed under cc by sa   via commons
