picture this  someone decides one of their leaders is a  traitor  over her support of staying in the european union   shoots her with a homemade pistol he built with instructions he received from a far right group and stabs her  during the attack  he shouts  britain first    an ugly phrase that is very similar to donald trump s  america first  rhetoric  this was how british mp jo cox died at the hands of tommy mair  or  death to traitors   as he prefers to be known in court  this was a horrific crime committed by the sort of person who would support donald trump in the united states  a white supremacist   and the murderer s fascination with everything the far right has to offer hits very close to home for many of us after robert lewis dear s horrific attack on a planned parenthood facility last year  naturally  as britain is our ally and as ms  cox worked on the barack obama s campaign in  before she became mp for batley and spen  the president called her husband to offer his condolences  president obama offered his sincere condolences on behalf of the american people to mr  cox and his two young children  as well as to her friends  colleagues and constituents   the white house said in a statement  the president noted that the world is a better place because of her selfless service to others  and that there can be no justification for this heinous crime  which robbed a family  a community  and a nation of a dedicated wife  mother  and public servant  most people would see the most powerful man in the world taking a few minutes of his time in the wake of a deadly far right terrorist attack we are dealing with at home as  at minimum  a nice gesture  some would consider it downright benevolent  but after scrolling through the comments on their report on the topic  none of those people read fox news the comment section quickly erupted with a slew of racist statements  with some calling the president a  chimp  and others opting for  monkey  or  n    r   some snarkily remarked that britain is a  gun free zone   completely ignoring that the gun was homemade with the help of white supremacist literature  others began demanding that obama call the families of quite literally anyone else who has ever died  ever   police officers  the families of various far right icons  snoopy  who knows  mothers debated whether he is simply  black trash  or  half black trash   all in all  it s a complete mess in there        obama did not have to make that phone call   but that s the sort of person he is  while he cannot reasonably be expected to call the families of every single person who dies  he is the kind of guy who will absolutely take time out of his overloaded schedule to offer comfort to the family of one of our allies  legislators after someone very trump like viciously murders her for no better reason than he s a racist   especially with  america first  being chanted at trump rally after trump rally this horrific murder serves as a reminder that far right extremists are not limited simply to the united states  though they seem to be more vocal and unashamed of their racist opinions here than in other places   it is absolutely baffling that they are unwilling to allow the president to do so much as make a phone call without going full blown  insane racist on him all of these people will be voting in november  make sure you head to the polls and vote blue   after all  they ll be voting for someone whose rhetoric is very close to that of cox s murderer featured image via screengrab getty images  pool
