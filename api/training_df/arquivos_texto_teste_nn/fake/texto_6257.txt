on thursday  the california state legislature passed a series of legislation described as  the most ambitious action ever taken to protect communities from gun violence  according to the san francisco chronicle  the legislation includes nearly a dozen bills designed to protect the state s communities from devastating acts of violence like the mass shooting that occurred in san bernardino in december of   the attack  which left  people dead and another  injured  was the second worst mass shooting in california history in response to the shooting  democratic lawmakers passed a comprehensive series of bills designed to reduce gun violence a total of eleven bills were passed  not surprisingly  nearly all of them were passed without support from republican members of the state legislature the package included a bill which requires people selling ammunition to obtain a license  as well as mandatory background checks for those purchasing ammunition another bill outlaws the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines   would ban magazines that hold more than  rounds of ammunition the only bill to gain republican support    would make it a felony to steal a gun or purchase a stolen gun  regardless of the value of the weapon  under current state law the felony charge of  grand theft firearm  only applies to stolen guns that are valued at   or more other measures require owners of homemade guns to obtain a serial number and register such guns with the state  and mandate that owners of lost and stolen guns report the theft to the police within five days of discovering a missing firearm while the legislation still has to wind its way through the state house for approval  the los angeles times reports that special measures have been taken to try to get the bills approved before june if the bills fail to pass the house before that time  voters will likely have the opportunity to approve the same measures through a  ballot initiative california is leading the way in common sense gun control legislation  in spite of nra propaganda  these measures are not  the first steps toward the government taking away everyone s guns  the bills approved by the california senate are good examples of sane gun control legislation  this kind of legislation is both reasonable and necessary no one is naive enough to think that these measures will prevent all incidents of gun violence  on the other hand  few people are stupid enough to think that doing nothing about america s epidemic of gun violence is a reasonable response to the problem  featured image via  wikipedia public domain
