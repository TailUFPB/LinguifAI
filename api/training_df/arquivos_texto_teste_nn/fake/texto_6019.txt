finally  the media is giving donald trump the critical eye they should  the stories about the trump university lawsuits and his refusal to release his tax returns are proving to be troublesome to the gop frontrunner s campaign  but one of the most damaging might be the missing money that was supposedly pegged for veterans things are about to get a whole lot worse on the veteran front  the huffington post reported that trump actually discriminates against veterans because they spend too much time serving their country in at least three cases  trump s companies have either fired  or refused to hire  military reservists because of the time commitments demanded of them by their service in the armed forces  the veterans involved have sued trump for violating the laws meant to protect them from precisely these types of penalties  and in all three cases  trump and his companies have settled the suits the huffington post already reported on the first two of these cases   one involving an air force senior master sergeant fired from the trump institute in   and one an army staff sergeant fired from her job at trump university that same year these two cases  however  have a predecessor  on may     united states air force col  charles beattie submitted orders to his bosses at eastern airlines  where he worked as a pilot for trump  it seems  it s cheaper to pay fines for this clear violation of the law than to follow the law  trump is an egomaniac  the fact that he doesn t like to employ people whose priority is our country should be all the proof we need that trump has no desire to serve our country  he never has  beginning with the fact that trump avoided the draft it s doubtful that trump actively dislikes veterans  but it s clear he doesn t care about them  he would happily and haphazardly send them into war zones  perhaps because a world leader hurt his feelings the fact that he doesn t like vets working for him is only the tip of the iceberg  for a man who has planned on running for president for at least a few years  he s done little to beef up his image as a patriot  the republican party is supposedly the party of veterans  of course  we wouldn t know it by how they vote  but they think they love the veterans   but trump gave zero of his personal money to veterans groups  and his foundation donated a paltry     as forbes magazine notes  trump once demanded that cnn give veterans   million for trump to appear at a debate  they didn t  but that would be     than his foundation has given as i said  the media is finally beginning to look critically at trump  but it s time they start calling these things what they are  scandals  they might even qualify for a  gate  featured image via christopher furlong with getty images
