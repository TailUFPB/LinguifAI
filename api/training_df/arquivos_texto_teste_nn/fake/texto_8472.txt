donald trump only has himself to blame for this one rather than watch what he says on twitter  the billionaire republican presidential candidate retweeted an obviously photoshopped image of megyn kelly posing with saudi prince alwaleed bin talal  who owns a stake in fox news  and his sister      drudgereport  realdonaldtrump pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    has been acting like a petulant child ever since he learned fox news would be including megyn kelly as a debate moderator once again  even though he didn t like her tough questions in a debate last year that touched off a bitter feud between the two but trump apparently never learned to not bite the hand that feeds him  because his tweet came back to bite him on the ass on thursday prior to his rogue event running at the same time as the gop debate he declined to attend in an epic response to trump s tweet  prince alwaleed fired back with a revealing tweet of his own reminding trump of those two times back in the  when trump needed a financial bailout and alwaleed came to his rescue  trump you base your statements on photoshopped pics i bailed you out twice a  time maybe  https   t co  https   t co           alwaleedtalal  january    to buzzfeed  when trump was   million in debt in   it was prince alwaleed who purchased the donald s trump princess yacht for   million in   alwaleed would save trump s ass again by purchasing new york city s plaza hotel from him for a whopping   million in short  donald trump is an irresponsible businessman who has incurred massive debts and declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions  his decisions have been so bad that he needed to be bailed out by a saudi national and you have to wonder how trump would deal with america s debt  the last thing americans need is to watch as their president sells the country off piece by piece to solve a debt that was created by republican fiscal policies in the first place  and frankly  it s not hard to imagine that trump would at least consider that option prince alwaleed has previously called upon trump to withdraw from the presidential race  and now he has given us even more reason to demand it as well featured image  youtube
