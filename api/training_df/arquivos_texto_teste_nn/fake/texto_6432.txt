an arizona gun nut has been charged with  multiple crimes after he decided to shoot at two men who shoplifted some stuff from a chandler  arizona walgreens location in march according to john haag    he was at walgreens when he saw two men running from the store  haag asked the store employees if they d been robbed and they told him yes  so he decided to take the law into his own hands  instead of calling the police like an intelligent human being  haag got into his car and chased the suspected robbers   news obtained a video that shows haag pulling up to the u haul the men were driving and firing his gun at the vehicle  after shooting at the suspects  he drove away according to officials  the people who haag shot at weren t robbery suspects at all  instead all they had done was shoplifted from the store  police said that this crime would not justify the level of force  used by a man who said he wanted to  be a hero  cops were able to find the idiot after he posted  just witnessed a robbery at walgreens again  this time  i had my gun true story  on facebook speaking to   haag said  i feel i had good intentions  i meant the best  i meant to disable the vehicle  first of all  he completely missed the vehicle that he was firing at   clearly he should not be shooting a weapon when his aim is that bad  secondly  he discharged the firearm in the middle of traffic and that bullet could have ricocheted and killed someone  haag went on to say that he thinks more people should try to be heroes  most people are scared  tons of people nowadays are in fear of what will happen to them and that s not cool  that s why we have more crime  he s right  i do fear what will happen to me  my family and my friends  but not because of shoplifters  i am way more concerned that i or someone i love is going to be killed by a dumbass like him who thinks it s okay to fire a gun in traffic  i worry that my son is going to be second amendmented to death by gun nuts  i worry about things like that because it is obvious that we have millions of gun owners in this country and many of them do not have the common sense given to a squirrel haag has been charged with aggravated assault  unlawful discharge of a firearm and drive by shooting  hopefully a judge rules that he can never own a gun again watch featured image via video screenshot
