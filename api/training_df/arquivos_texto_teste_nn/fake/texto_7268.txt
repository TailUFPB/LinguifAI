on march   cody lee miller  a homeless man who calls the streets of seattle  washington his residence  climbed to the top of an eighty foot tree over the next  hours  the city of seattle watched anxiously as miller refused all attempts by authorities to coax him down from his perch at the top of the giant conifer people snapped pictures and took cell phone video  posting to twitter under the hashtag  manintree the seattle times  washington post  detroit news  usa today and other media outlets around the country covered the story as it unfolded image credit   vixenrogue via twitterat various times miller threw pine cones and tree branches at rescue workers  as they attempted to coax him down watch the video from usa today on youtube below at other times  his behavior seemed even more reckless image credit  rt america via twitter toward the end of the day  he built a makeshift bed among the branches where he apparently fell asleep for the night  image credit  seattle times via twittermore than a day later  a crowd of onlookers cheered as he finally made his way back to the ground below here s video of miller finally coming down from the tree  courtesy of usa today on youtube once he was safe on the ground  miller was taken to harborview medical center where he underwent a psychiatric examination  he was then taken to jail  where he was booked on charges of criminal mischief what prompted miller to climb the tree in the first place aside from obvious mental health issues  komo reports that three days before miller was taken into police custody for the crime of  sitting on the sidewalk  near a starbucks on east pike street his criminal record suggests it was not the first time he d been arrested for the crime of having nowhere to go  he was arrested more than once in oregon  the charges included things like criminal mischief  obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct  charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness if you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk  if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space  where can you go maybe you d try to climb a tree  hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist of course that s not how it played out in miller s case  climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention some  including the police  turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation  though many twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues  as well as for those who are homeless as komo reports  at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation janice wilson  who was in town from crescent city  california  to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles  said she was once homeless herself   years ago she repeatedly shouted up to the man   we love you  come down safely  i heard people out here laughing   she said   if somebody s in crisis to the point of putting himself at risk of suicide  what s to laugh about  as of november   there were more than   homeless people in the united states the city of seattle is just one of many american cities that declared a state of emergency in   due to the number of homeless people who reside there while the number of homeless people in seattle is on the decline  thanks to an increase in wages in the city  for people with physical and mental disabilities  getting a job and  pulling yourself up by your bootstraps  isn t always the answer with proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal  productive lives once the condition is treated  but a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment according to new york daily news  miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs  it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated  along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the united states featured image via video screen capture komo
