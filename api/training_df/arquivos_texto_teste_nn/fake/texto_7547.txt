on friday  donald trump canceled a rally in chicago because he was embarrassed that seemingly more people showed up to protest him than to stroke his ego  the night had already been bloody  with an event in st  louis  missouri almost becoming a total race war earlier in the evening  in chicago  trump has not even arrived when the incredibly white attendees began attacking  hurling insults at  and geerally being complete racist d ckbags to black people and anyone else who dissented   just like trump taught them to  after all  he says he will pay their legal fees if they brutalize a black man in his name  the donald says he was forced to cancel his rally because he didn t want anyone to  get hurt    though he was perfectly willing to call into fox news to whine about how somehow his first amendment rights had been stripped away by protesters  once again proving that not a single republican anywhere understands the first amendment  according to the billionaire  hopeful  the blame for violence at his rallies lies with two entities  the protesters his fans attack  and barack obama shortly after  rachel maddow took a moment out of her show to absolutely and utterly destroy any claim trump could make that he doesn t want violence at his rallies  that he just wants people to be safe as he claims  it s becoming more intense at donald trump rallies   maddow said after playing a clip of the numerous beatings we have seen at his campaign events throughout recent history  there have been instances in the past where he has encouraged or at least praised the idea of violent actions by his supporters  when he s spoken wistfully about how great it would be to beat people up at his rallies  or he s told people that he would pay their legal fees if they beat up a protester on his behalf  but this sort of bloodlust  this kind of half tongue in cheek mostly serious call for a  tougher america  where there are more beatings  and where anti trump protesters should fear for their lives as he heads into these tinderbox cities today and tonight  i just want you to watch how that part of candidate donald trump s rhetoric has escalated  maddow rolled numerous clips of trump calling for his violent  racist  and  poorly educated  fans to harm others   with date stamps included  in other words  she left trump in a completely indefensible position  not that it matters to him or his followers   if you want to see the deliberate act that created what happened tonight in chicago  watch where it came from   she said  noting that all the calls for violence culminated into the chicago incident  and it really is something like we have never seen in mainstream american politics before   maddow told viewers  recalling that she used to see these events unfold at white supremacist rallies in the  s  the difference  of course  is that it is now happening in mainstream republican politics at events hosted by their frontrunner  anybody who tells you that there s no connection between the behavior of the mob at these events and the behavior of the man leading the mob at these events is not paying attention to what he s saying at the podium   she said after the clips rolled  but the most damning clip she rolled was of trump in st  louis earlier that evening when he complained that  part of the problem is no body wants to hurt each other anymore  that s right   he complained that there was not enough violence at his events to put protesters in their place   there used to be consequences   he whined just before st  louis erupted into violence   these people are bringing us down   he whined   these are the people that are destroying our country  that s the way donald trump has been talking about protesters at his events  that s the way he has been directing his supporters at events  that was today   maddow said after the damning st  louis footage rolled   if you want to know what led up to chicago tonight that was donald trump s display of leadership and calming the waters   then she dropped the bomb  american presidential politics isn t like this for anyone else  american presidential politics did not get this way on its own  this is the workd of an american presidential candidate who deliberately made this happen  and the republican party is about to nominate him for president  watch maddow tear trump a new orifice below featured image via screengrab
