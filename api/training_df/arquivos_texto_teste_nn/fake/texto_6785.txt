once again  states run by conservative republicans have provoked international embarrassment for america  this time  it is because our british allies now have to warn their lgbt citizens about traveling to southern states that recently passed anti lgbt laws britain has issued a new warning for lgbt travelers visiting parts of the united states  be wary in an update to its u s  travel advisory  the british foreign office highlighted the anti gay laws recently passed in north carolina and mississippi  the u s  is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards lgbt people differ hugely across the country   the advisory stated   lgbt travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of north carolina and mississippi  before traveling please read our general travel advice for the lgbt community  north carolina and missippi have lost revenue due to businesses  paypal  pepsi and many others  canceling plans to open facilities there and musicians like bruce springsteen and pearl jam deciding to cancel concert dates in those states   all because a minority of anti lgbt bigots have decided to pass laws based on the myth of transgender bathroom predators the so called bathroom bills are laws correcting a problem that doesn t actually exist  in order to make conservative politicians look good to their base by attacking a group of americans  it is what the right has devolved to and is part of their desperate attempts to keep so called  values voters  perpetually on the edge and consistently voting for conservative republican political candidates in response to the british foreign office  the human rights campaign issued a statement noting   it is both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation s staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks of traveling to north carolina and mississippi because of anti lgbt laws passed by their elected officials  it s even more bizarre that the supposedly pro business right would push these laws  since the states who pass them will suffer economically  being bigoted like this in  is bad for business featured image via flickr
