nothing pisses me off more than a republican professing their undying love for israel and the jewish people  i m old enough to remember the distant past of the early  s when the phrase  the goddamn jew media  and  those fucking jews in hollywood  were bandied about by conservatives  why  i even recall a time when the front runner for the republican primaries actively courted the kkk and neo nazi vote  oh wait  that s happening right f cking now as a jew myself  i find it amazing that conservatives can keep a straight face when praising israel  especially southern republicans that were raised on a steady diet of antisemitism  should israel ever elect a liberal government  we d be right back to republicans despising jews  even sheldon adelson s billions wouldn t be enough to hide their disdain for us but in the meantime  we re witness to the spectacle of not only republicans pretending to love jews  but republicans having the balls to call some jews  self loathing  earlier this week on  the joyce kaufman show   rep  louie gohmert criticized president obama and his jewish supporters over a wall street journal report about the administration s approach to the israeli palestinian conflict  dismissing the president s jewish allies as self hating the texas republican said of obama   he s never been able to stand israel  he s never been able to get along with people who actually stood for israel  now he gets along fine with the israel haters   he continued   but  and it breaks my heart  but there are some children of israel who just apparently seem to be self loathing when it comes to israel   but yeah  those folks he gets along with fine  i have repeatedly anointed myself the world s jew  i eat bacon  i celebrate christmas  i mix meat and dairy  i literally only know passover is coming when the supermarket puts matzoh bread on sale  yet  the idea that i am a self loathing jew because i don t support the murderous right wing regime turning israel in a full fledged apartheid state is deeply offense  it s even more offensive coming from a person pretending not to hate jews in the first place the conflation of  israel  and  jew  is a deliberate and calculated move to shield israel from criticism by leveling accusations of antisemitism  but that doesn t exactly work on the millions of jews like me around the world that are appalled at the violence and hatred perpetrated by israel s government  so people try to label us self loathing jews but i say that the only jews who truly despise themselves are the ones that are rushing to embrace the same genocidal rage that brought us the holocaust in the meantime  louie gohmert can choke on a matzoh ball featured image by gage skidmore
