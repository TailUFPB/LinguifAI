can you imagine if republicans interrogated every constituent about their sexual activity  well  these kids don t have to imagine it  they experienced it during a visit to the offices of several lawmakers on teen lobbying day  a group of students chaperoned by planned parenthood employee rachel todd were absolutely stunned when washington state rep  mary dye interrogated them about whether or not they are virgins and began offering them unwanted marriage and sex advice the teens were there to advocate in support of expanding insurance to cover birth control  but when they got there  dye gave them an  unprompted  lecture instead about the choices she thinks teen girls should make  after she made the statement about virginity  all of my teens looked at me and i said   you don t have to answer that  you don t have to answer that   todd told the seattle times soon after  dye delivered a prepared apology  i shared with them that i did not support the issues they were advocating for  following a conversation they initiated on birth control for teenagers  i talked about the empowerment of women and making good choices   opinions shaped by my mother and being a mother of three daughters  in hindsight  a few of the thoughts i shared  while well intended  may have come across as more motherly than what they would expect from their state representative  if anything i said offended them or made them feel uncomfortable  i apologize  todd  who is an education specialist with the women s health organization  said that she has never witnessed such inappropriateness during a meeting  i ve never been in any type of meeting  especially with teens where an adult  especially an adult legislator  was so incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate   she said one student in the group  alex rubino  thinks dye was insane  it seemed kind of insane for her to say that  especially on the record  to constituents   he said indeed  lawmakers should be acting like lawmakers instead of trying to parent other people s children  these teens came to talk to her about a serious issue and ended up being questioned about their sex lives and told what choices they should make considering dye is an anti birth control conservative  it s assumed that she preached about the virtues of abstinence only as the only choice these teens should make when it comes to sex  however  it is increased access to and knowledge of birth control that is responsible for the dropping teen birth rate and abortion rate across the country perhaps dye and other republicans should stick to facts and reason next time they meet with constituents instead of prying into their private lives and giving out unwanted opinions featured image  cspan
