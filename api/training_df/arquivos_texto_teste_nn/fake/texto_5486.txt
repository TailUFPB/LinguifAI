the islamic state terrorist group  also known as isis  is beginning to admit that the military strategy authorized by president obama and executed by the united states and its international allies is destroying its grip on the middle east the admission is a validation of the president s strategy  which has faced never ending criticism from the republican party and the conservative movement isis has declared for years a  caliphate   or a sphere of influence and control across several countries   including syria and iraq  with the eventual goal of a  worldwide caliphate  but now  after u s  led bombing runs  drone strikes  and engagement on the ground by forces trained and armed by america and its allies  the caliphate is weakening in public messages and in recent actions in syria  the group s leaders are acknowledging the terrorist organization s declining fortunes on the battlefield while bracing for the possibility that its remaining strongholds could fall while the death tolls are horrific and the loss of human life unacceptable  recent suicide bombings from those associated with isis are more evidence that it is losing in the territory it gained at the same time  the group is vowing to press on with its recent campaign of violence  even if the terrorists themselves are driven underground  u s  counterterrorism experts believe the mass  casualty attacks in istanbul and baghdad in the past month were largely a response to military reversals in iraq and syria in   under president obama s orders  the united states launched operation  inherent resolve  in a release announcing the operation  u s  central command  centcom  explained the operation was in place to  reflect the unwavering resolve and deep commitment of the u s  and partner nations in the region and around the globe to eliminate the terrorist group isil and the threat they pose to iraq  the region and the wider international community  since then  american led fighter jet missions have been operating in iraq and syria to eliminate the isis threat  even as conservatives  republicans  and their presidential candidates like donald trump continued to attack obama as weak on terrorism according to the department of defense  as of july   the coalition has flown   airstrikes in iraq and syria against isis targets  of those    airstrikes were executed by american fighter pilots the department also reports as of may this year operation inherent resolve had destroyed or damaged   target under isis control  this includes  tanks    buildings  and   parts of the oil infrastructure that isis has been using to finance their missions the conflict isn t over  but isis is not expanding  it s getting smaller featured image via flickr
