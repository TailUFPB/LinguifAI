either donald trump doesn t ever look at who he is retweeting  or he does  and that s pretty damn frightening  not only did he just retweet yet another white supremacist twitter account  but now he s gone and retweeted an account that wants texas to be its own country and to re establish the confederate states of america   thesouthwasrite   nro cancelling my subscription  you people are idiots   realdonaldtrump will be our next president     rnc   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    owner of the twitter handle the republican presidential frontrunner retweeted quite literally wants to leave the united states of america  saying in their bio  texas alone could be its own country  let s re establish the confederate states of america  other states would join  as you can tell  this person clearly wants to split from the united states  and also clearly wants trump as president via twitterand as a person that is running for president of the united states of america  you d think  maybe  just maybe  he wouldn t endorse such a tweet with a retweet of approval  by doing so  it reaffirms the position held by the person he s retweeting and makes it appear as though he also wants the nation to once again be divided  so much for making america great again sure  the tweet itself was in regards to this person wanting to end their national review subscription  but holy sh t  trump couldn t have found a better person to retweet  who the hell is working his social media campaign what this really is indicative of is the sort of people responding to trump s racist rhetoric that he s been touting since the start of his presidential campaign  his white pride attitude is drawing all the racists out from their holes  and they are feeling perfectly comfortable being openly bigoted in public  after all  a major party frontrunner is saying these things  so why can t they the republican party needs to put trump in check or he will be their nominee  and if this is the sort of candidate they want to run  well  then we certainly know which party is the party of racism  and since you need the minority vote to win these days  thanks in advance from the democrats featured image  flickr flickr
