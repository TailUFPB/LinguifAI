democratic presidential martin o malley just got real about the response to the right wing domestic terrorists who are occupying federal land in oregon speaking to an iowa radio station  o malley  the former governor of maryland and mayor of baltimore  was blunt about the ongoing situation  this is not the way we act as americans and i dare say that the federal government s exercising a lot of restraint here   said o malley   it s hard to fathom or it s hard to imagine if the people taking over buildings by armed force were muslim or black  as some commentators have said  it would be the same reaction  so hopefully this will get resolved peacefully  they are not militia  they re acting in criminal ways  this is criminal behavior  since the militia members   led by the son of rogue rancher cliven bundy   illegally took over the federal facility  the mainstream media has fumbled over what precisely to call the men  first they were called  peaceful protesters  and  then they were called  armed protesters  in dispatches from abc news and the associated press even after one of the men  who are white  made a public statement that he would be willing to die while occupying the government land  the bulk of the mainstream media has been unwilling to apply the label of  terrorism  to their activities the kid gloves treatment being afforded to the gang   recently federal law enforcement said they could come and go as they please   has led people to compare the treatment to situations like  year old tamir rice  rice  who was black  had the police called on him while he played with a toy gun  instead of being  talked down  and negotiated with  he was shot and killed in the street and led by the prosecutor a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who did the deed in addition to the disparity in treatment  republican presidential candidates have condemned the specific gun wielding tactics of the occupiers while also heaping praise on the  principles  behind their gripes  which are complaints about the federal government collecting money for the use of land owned by the government these men and other militia affiliated groups have tried to argue that the government cannot own the land in question  and that they should be allowed to raise profit making livestock on it without paying anyone featured image via flickr
