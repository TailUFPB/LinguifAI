donald trump is pretty terrible  he s exactly the sort of person who would suggest that muslims be banned from entering the united states  he s the type of guy who would force any muslims in the united states to register in a national database and wear special badges  then throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure  trump has spoken openly about building a wall between the united states and mexico to keep brown people out  openly encouraged his supporters to beat african americans at his rallies  hell  he even has been known to keep a book of hitler s speeches by his bedside for light reading  he s repeatedly lied throughout his campaign in an effort to paint himself as the best option to serve as president of the united states  but the washington post has revealed yet another facet of trump s douchebaggery  he s also the type of guy who would pretend to be his own public relations  person so he can talk himself up the washington post has uncovered an old recording of what sounds like the donald talking himself up while speaking to reporters  the recording is from   and is between the now gop nominee   sorry   john miller    and a reporter from people magazine  sue caswell was covering trump s media circus of the time   his divorce from ivana trump  who says her former husband brutally raped her in just one of the many incidents that led to the end of their marriage as well as his relationship with marla maples the  spokesman  had some interesting insight into trump s personal life  telling caswell that he  really didn t want to make a commitment  to maples because he s  coming out of a marriage  and he s starting to do tremendously well financially   he assured caswell that trump is a  good guy  who isn t  going to hurt anybody  and  treated his wife well    you know  aside from the horrific abuse  and all  have you met him   he s a good guy and he s not going to hurt anybody   the one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense   he is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well   i mean  he paid his wife a great deal of money   he did it in a very bad period of time and  ultimately  that was settled   there were those that say that that was even put that way   i don t know if you heard that but that trump became poor until he got his divorce   and then all of a sudden  he s been doing very well and i guess you probably heard that  too but he treated his wife well and he treated   and he will treat marla well   he s somebody that has a lot of options  and  frankly  he gets called by everybody  he gets called by everybody in the book  in terms of women  trump explained that he is  sort of handling pr because  gets so much of it   and that he was simply doing the pr gig  part time   and even took the time to regail caswell with a tale of the time he met madonna other reporters say they received similarly suspicious calls from  miller  or  john barron   and those reporters all say trump was the person behind the calls  in fact  some of his top aides and trump himself have confirmed that he was doing his own pr work  in   people reported just two weeks ago  though  ms  maples was not even taking the donald s calls  not after a people reporter played her a tape on june  of a man saying that he was a trump publicist named john miller  a shocked  devastated marla identified the voice as that of trump himself  he announced  among other things  that he d traded in his georgia peach for an italian model  carla bruni    when i heard his voice on that tape saying those things  i said   whoa  uh uh  no more     says marla   if he could say all that stuff and act like it s cool to have this playboy image  then oh my gosh  all i could say was   baby  you re on your own    so she packed a bag  ducking the press as well as the donald s persistent appeals to reconcile  and took refuge at the greenwich  conn   home of her close friend  morning talk show host kathie lee gilford  there she talked  prayed  she and kathie lee are both devout christians  and came to a donald less conclusion   i realized i was not going to die without this person in my life  meanwhile a penitent don juan ald had come to the opposite conclusion  the john miller fiasco he called a joke gone awry   what i did became a good time at mar la s expense  and i m very sorry   says the newly humbled tycoon  as for his wandering eye   i d felt that i needed space and freedom after the divorce  so i took the opportunity to go out with other women  but i kept coming back to marla  i realized  why go looking for something when you already have exactly what you want  despite all of this  on friday trump denied that he was the guy behind the calls  i don t know anything about it   trump said during an appearance on nbc s today  i have many  many people that are trying to imitate my voice  and you can imagine that  this sounds like one of these scams  one of the many scams  it doesn t sound like me  it was not me on the phone   he rambled   and it doesn t sound like me on the phone  i will tell you that  it was not me on the phone  hear that folks  it wasn t him on the phone  it wasn t him with a bone  it wasn t him on a train  it wasn t him on a plane  it wasn t him on a boat  in a moat  or you get the idea  sure  he may have admitted it in the past  but he s running for president now  why tell the truth  this was so farcical  that he pretended to be his own publicist  here was this so called billion dollar real estate mogul  and he can t hire his own publicist   carswell said upon listening to the tape for the first time in more than two decades   it also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story  and i can t believe he thought he d get away with it  unfortunately  he keeps getting away with things  despite his horrific remarks  his repeated lies  and his generally awful attitude  the donald has managed to land himself the spot as the  gop nominee  republicans have repeatedly given him a pass no matter what he says or does because he represents all that is terrible about our society   bigotry  hatred  racism  xenophobia   and that is exactly what appeals to them compared to trump s numerous other lies this is a small one  but it does show how important it is to him that he controls the narrative listen to the call below featured image via getty images isaac brekken
