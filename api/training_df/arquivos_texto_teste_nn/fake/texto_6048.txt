if you ever needed any more proof that conservatives are hypocrites  this is it michael tassone is an anti obama restaurant owner who turned his diner into the perfect place for racist conservatives to eat out his  american diner  in liverpool  new york  which has been featured in a story on fox news  even has a menu filled with items that make it clear how much he hates president obama and the first family there s a meal called  dictator obama  that sells for    but comes with a   tax  and then there s the  anti michelle obama don t tell me what to eat or feed my kids burger   which is probably loaded with the most calories and fatty foods than anything else on the menu the decor includes gadsden flags and signs and  of course  and tassone is vehemently pro gun and allows open carry of firearms in his establishment  probably because he thinks the government is coming for him here s a video about his restaurant it s a paradise for hungry conservatives to convene and whine about how much they hate mulsims  hispanics  and welfare recipients but as it turns out  tassone is a hypocrite just like his fellow conservatives over the course of two years from  to   tassone committed welfare fraud by getting medicaid benefits he was not supposed to have  and ended up owing the onondaga county department of social services over    senior assistant district attorney michael kasmarek told syracuse com that tassone committed fraud  it was medicaid fraud  they had failed to disclose income on their application  as a result they obtained medicaid benefits they weren t entitled to  from may    to april      he said tassone was arrested in  and the judge told him to pay up if he didn t want his case to end up in front of a grand jury in the end  tassone paid up but thinks he was unfairly  targeted  because of his extreme conservative views  guys like me are a target   tassone said   because i speak the truth  funny  he didn t speak the truth when he lied about his income on an application for aid but as usual  conservatives think only they are entitled to welfare and if they get busted committing a crime they claim they are being targeted because of their political views featured image via syracuse com
