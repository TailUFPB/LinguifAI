thirteen years ago  the united states went to war against iraq s dictator  saddam hussein  while the war ended up being a costly and deadly mistake  propelled by lies  republicans have long held on to the belief that getting rid of hussein was a huge bonus for the world  donald trump  the gop frontrunner for president  though  disagrees  to trump  saddam hussein should have been praised  saddam hussein was a bad guy  right  he was a bad guy  really bad guy  but you know what he did well  he killed terrorists  he did that so good  they didn t read them the rights   they didn t talk  they were a terrorist  it was over   trump said as many in his audience of about   laughed on tuesday evening   today  iraq is harvard for terrorism  you want to be a terrorist  you go to iraq  it s like harvard  okay  so sad  source  independent ukhere s the video republicans aren t at all happy  he was one of the  century s most evil people  he was up there  he committed mass genocide against his own people using chemical weapons   ryan told fox news  megyn kelly when asked for his reaction   saddam hussein was a bad guy  this isn t the first time trump has said something similar  back in october  trump said if both muammar qaddafi and saddam hussein were still in power  the middle east would be a more stable region he related the situations in both of those countries with what is currently happening in syria and seemed to endorse a stronger bashar assad  even while admitting that he is  probably a bad guy    you can make the case  if you look at libya  look at what we did there   it s a mess   if you look at saddam hussein with iraq  look what we did there   it s a mess   it s  going to be same thing   the real estate mogul said source  msnbctrump isn t alone in having that belief  many democrats  including bernie sanders  share his opinion  yes  things were more stable during hussein s regime  but think progress makes the point that the arab spring  which caused the ousting and death of muammar qaddafi  would have still happened  and it would have affected iraq the current state of countries like iraq  syria  and libya has been influenced by foreign involvement and regime change  there is no denying that  but even more constructive in the current chaos is a surviving legacy of political repression and brutal torture  sanders  cruz  paul and the like may be using the premise of stability to argue that the middle east would be better off under such dictators  yet under such despots  security is fleeting and chaos follows closely again  there s no legitimate defense of the iraq war  and perhaps the region would have less terrorism now if we hadn t overthrown him  although much of the terrorism is related to our occupation  and not to the overthrow of the government   this can all be debated  and will be debated  for possibly decades however  the most frightening aspect of trump s comments is his obsession with dictators  not only has he praised hussein and qaddafi  he s also praised vladimir putin and kim jong un  that s a frightening hint at how he plans to run the nation featured image via sara d  davis at getty images
