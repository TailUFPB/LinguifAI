scott walker emerged from the ashes of his failed presidential campaign this week when the primaries came to wisonsin  but msbnc host chris hayes gave him a further headache  by managing to destroy walker s biggest lie  in just  brutal seconds walker is trying to pass tough voter id laws which are likely to effectively disenfranchise the members of the community least likely to vote republican  all in the name of preventing a voter fraud problem which doesn t actually exist  walker tried the argument on msnbc host chris hayes this week  and got destroyed  alright  let s look at the facts   hayes said   there s the fact that despite dire warnings of voter fraud  a wisconsin federal district judge ruled that the law s defenders   and i m quoting    could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in wisconsin at any time in the recent past  the ruling took just  seconds to recite  but if the law passes regardless  more than   people  largely people of color  and people in poverty  will be unable to vote in the primaries  it is the continuation of the gop s plans to effectively rig the vote  by disenfranchising people least likely to vote for them minority and poor communities are already hit by felony disenfranchisement   as the sentencing project reports nationally  an estimated   million americans are denied the right to vote because of laws that prohibit voting by people with felony convictions  felony disenfranchisement is an obstacle to participation in democratic life which is exacerbated by racial disparities in the criminal justice system  resulting in  of every  african americans unable to vote image via the sentencing projectthe no nonsense crushing shines a light on just how far the conservative media is failing its readers and viewers  by failing to do the most basic factcheck on these issues  whether conservative or liberal  we deserve a media which holds politicians and lawmakers to account when they lie  instead  we see the media playing partisan   if our friends said it it s true  it our enemies said it  it s a lie  the american public deserve better here s the video featured image via flickr creative commons screengrab
