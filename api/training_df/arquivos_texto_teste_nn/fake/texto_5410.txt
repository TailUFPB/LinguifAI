democrats and a lot of republicans are scratching our heads trying to figure out the appeal of the braggadocios billionaire  democrats say that the appeal is very basic  his message of nationalism  xenophobia  sexism and racism makes aging white people feel like they are losing all their power  trump voters say it s something different  they say it s the economy  unless it s their economy  while obama has apparently screwed up the economy  they think their local economies are doing just great it s not terribly surprising  to hear trump speak  we are in some sort of post apocalyptic hellscape that only the orange one can take us out of  you know he s trying to justify the economy  it s the slowest recovery in our history  and it s not a recovery   he said source  the hilltrump calls the economy a  disaster  trump even repeats the bogus claim that the unemployment rate is over  percent  that would be apocalyptic now  delegates are supposed to be  supposed to be  a cross section of the american people  if anything  they should be a little smarter than the average bear  at least the average republican bear  but even they seem to excel at compartmentalizing  they are individually very happy with the economy  but they also believe trump when the billionaire tells them they are suffering  actually  we re doing great   says donna gottschall  a human resources consultant in greenville  s c   employment s up  housing s up  everything s green in greenville  oh  yeah  unemployment is way down   says al baldasaro  a state legislator and retired marine from londonderry  n h   obviously  it s gotten better  things are wonderful in our town   says ranae lentz  a republican county chair from bellefontaine  ohio   we can t fill all the job openings  source  politicowhile it s unlikely that any trump supporter would credit obama with anything at all  some do credit bush tina harris  a longtime realtor in palm harbor  florida  told me the housing market is  booming   but she argued that this was a troubling data point  because buyers were liquidating their  k  accounts and taking money out of the  real economy  to purchase homes   have you checked your  k  lately   asked her friend nancy riley  another veteran realtor in the st  petersburg area  i said i hadn t  but i did know the stock market had just hit an all time high  and i didn t see why jobs in construction and real estate like theirs shouldn t count as the real economy  i m not saying everything is horrible   harris said   but it was george w  bush who put in the policies that got the economy going  obama did nothing  strangely  even trump himself has accidentally given a thumbs up to obama s economy  in announcing his running mate  indiana s governor  mike pence  trump bragged that the unemployment rate has gone from   percent to  percent  well  under obama  the nation s unemployment rate has gone from  percent to under  percent no one is claiming the economy is perfect  thanks in part to republican policies  like refusing to raise the minimum wage  wages have been stagnant  and also thanks to republican policies  the income gap has only grown  there s still a lot of work to be done  but trump s policies won t do it  in fact  the chief economist at moody s predicts that trump s protectionist platform will lose us   million jobs featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
