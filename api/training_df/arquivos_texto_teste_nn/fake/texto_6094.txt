how does the old saying go  the more unapologetically defensive you appear  the more guilty you probably are   or something like that  that at least seems to be the case with donald trump any time he is scrutinized on  well  pretty much anything  however  when it comes to his claim that he s raised money for veterans  even though many are saying he s grossly exaggerating the amount  he really doesn t like being called out on the discrepancy during a press conference on tuesday  trump was asked by abc s tom llamas  mr  trump  writing a one million dollar check is incredibly generous  but the night of that iowa fundraiser you said you had raised   million  clearly you had not  your critics say you tend to exaggerate  you have a problem with the truth  is this a prime example  trump responded  no  i raised almost   million  some of it didn t come through  but more money is coming through  the number is probably is going to be when we finish it probably going to be over the   million  trump then proceeds to blast the media  and then at one point called out llamas directly  even calling him a  sleaze  for having the audacity to point out facts  trump said  but what i don t want is when i raise millions of dollars  have people say  like this sleazy guy right over here from abc  he s a sleaze in my book  you re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well  ironically  llamas does seem to know the facts well  and trump doesn t like being called out on the fact that he s been exaggerating llamas took to twitter shortly after saying trump just called me a  sleaze   should be an interesting week   tom llamas   tomllamasabc  may    sort of person running for leader of the free world behaves like this  trump is completely thin skinned and bullies anyone who dare question him  if he can t handle being scrutinized  how the hell is he going to lead the nation  or for that matter  work in our diplomatic world interests across the globe  truth is  he wouldn t be able to  he s remarkably unqualified and we need to make sure he gets nowhere near the oval office watch trump lose his damn mind here featured image via video screen capture
