ana navarro is a well known republican strategist  but thanks to trump she s having a hard time defending her support of the gop in this election  this couldn t have been more apparent when the cnn contributor sat on a panel and slammed trump for his horrendous attacks on khizr and ghazala khan  the gold star parents who gave a speech at hillary clinton s democratic national convention as john avlon started a discussion about how the republican party would never be able to unify around trump thanks to the onslaught of controversies their nominee has created for himself  navarro couldn t hold back and went off  she called his campaign a  train wreck  whose  wheels are coming off   and bashed him for being such a disgrace that the gop and media have been forced to ignore any possible smears on hillary clinton because trump s hateful feuds with innocent people like the khans were dominating everything  she said  listen  hillary clinton had a disastrous interview on fox on sunday  we should be talking about that  but the trump surrogate  mr  trump himself  have chosen to continue a fight with the gold star family and parents of captain khan  and that has put all my focus  all my outrage  i have no more outrage to give this week  i am so offended by the idea of an attack on the mother and father who buried their son because of service to country and sacrifice to country  navarro even went on to say that her many of her colleagues would not be voting for trump in november  she said  it s not panic  it s sadness  it s resignation  it s heartbreak  later in the interview  navarro commented on the fact that trump has refused to endorse prominent republicans like paul ryan  john mccain and kelly ayotte  likely because they have called him out and distanced themselves from his disrespectful comments  navarro praised these gopers for not getting trump s support  calling it a  badge of honor   thank god trump is not endorsing them  that means they won t owe him a thing   as far as i m concerned  trump    good for them  badge of honor  you can watch navarro go off on trump s most recent campaign disaster below by the way  navarro s twitter feed is definitely worth checking out   she regularly rips trump and it s hilarious twittertwittertwittertwitter featured image via video screen capture
