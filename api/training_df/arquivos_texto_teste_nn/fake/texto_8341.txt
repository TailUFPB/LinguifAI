whenever someone has been generous enough to give republican presidential front runner donald trump the benefit of the doubt  they re always met with disappointment  in a new video from the young turks  an african american teen decided to volunteer at one of trump s campaign offices in west des moines on caucus day to see if the candidate and his supporters were really as bad as the media makes them out to be high school junior james patterson explained his reasoning  i just wanted to make sure i wasn t critiquing out of ignorance  i saw what he said on tv  but i also know how the media works  so i wanted to see it for myself  as part of his volunteer work  patterson spent his time making phone calls for trump s campaign in an office of about  people  it didn t take him long to see the obvious  he was the only black person  through his interactions with trump s other supporters and volunteers over the course of the day  their overall attitude toward minorities became clear   their racism is quiet  but it s still very much there  patterson said  nobody used any racial slurs  nobody called me  the n word   nobody called me  coon  or anything  but it s  for lack of a better word  it s micro aggressions  you know  the way they look at you  the way they talk about foreign policy and how they talk about oppressed groups when they don t think you re listening  overall  patterson felt that trump s supporters were normal people who have these resentments towards minorities  not able to voice them because thankfully we have policed language to the effect that that s not acceptable  but they still hold these   patterson believes that supporting trump is  their way to show that  patterson also said that he found his fellow staffers and volunteers unnerving because while they were  very friendly   he couldn t ignore the fact that they support trump s disgusting rhetoric  you can watch the young volunteer talk about his experience below overall  his stint as a trump volunteer did not turn patterson into a supporter  he said  sure  everybody has the right to say whatever they want  however  there is something called respect  and trump is not respectful  and there is something wrong with our society when we can glorify somebody openly that condemns minority groups like mexicans and muslims patterson feels that trump has targeted his message to appeal to fundamentalist christian  white  middle class americans that feel like their power is being taken  because minorities are making strides   he added  when he speaks to that  there s no way he can be pro black or pro hispanic or pro minority  and have that campaign  smart boy  patterson isn t the only one who has tried to give trump a real chance and found the experience severely disheartening  last november  an african american woman attended a trump rally to see if the donald was really as hateful  racist and horrible as she d heard  it didn t take long before she realized she d made a horrible mistake and decided to turn her presence into a protest in the most beautiful way featured image is a screenshot
