there s often much debate about the use of the n word in any of its forms  you hear in rap music  or just among black folks as a term of familiarity in some black culture circles  this debate has been brought to light once again by larry wilmore s comedy routine at the white house correspondents  dinner  the comedian finished his bit by saying directly to president obama  yo  barry  you did it  my n gga  well  there was one member of the black media who did not appreciate wilmore s remarks  and he went on cnn with host don lemon to say so  siriusxm host joe madison said of wilmore  can you imagine if the k word would have been used to describe bernie sanders   the thing is  though that is not an accurate comparison  most people don t even know what the k word is  for the record  it is an anti jewish slur  the word is  kike   jewish people have never included this word in their own culture without it being a million percent offensive in any context  the same cannot be said for the n word  now  do i use it in any context  no  absolutely not  i m black  but i despise that word for my own reasons  however  i do understand that there are contexts within black circles where it is a term of endearment and is completely appropriate  this one of them madison went on to say that it was a sad occasion that after  years of this dinner  that s the last word that this distinguished group of people will hear in relation to this president  the second guest in the debate  april reign  said that madison was misguided on this one  she put it perfectly when she said that black folks need to stop worrying about the  white gaze  in response to such things  the thing is  worrying about what white folks think will get you far in life  because we live in such a racist society  however  playing that hand is  in and of itself  racist  reign also went on to point out the obvious  which is that president obama appreciated what larry wilmore said  i am sure he did  people do not like to admit it  but almost every minority you can think of has its own culture where its people are more comfortable  i know that i am  for example  much more comfortable in a gay bar than i could ever be in a straight club  know why  because those are my people  they get it  they get the experience  the same goes for how i feel with a bunch of black folks versus being with a bunch white folks  i am sure president obama appreciated the cultural significance of what larry wilmore said  because for the last eight years he s not be able to be with his own people joe madison and everyone else taking issue with wilmore s routine really need to see themselves for what they are  uncle toms who want to distance themselves from black culture  which is seriously just a damn shame watch the video below https   youtu be  image via video screen capture
