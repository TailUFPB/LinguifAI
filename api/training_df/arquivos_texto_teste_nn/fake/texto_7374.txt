donald trump is proving  yet again  that he is terrified of strong women  not to mention the fact he s also got the thinnest skin around when it comes to being able to take criticism thrown against him  he also can t help but throw insults  especially at women  because when you have nothing to arm yourself in a battle of wits  throw insults after being just absolutely pummeled by elizabeth warren on twitter monday morning  trump was asked what he felt about her calling him a  loser  etc   and trump being trump responded as such  who s that  the indian  you mean the indian  and then follows it up by claiming that country is so divided and it s the fault of people like warren  the problem with the country right now  it s so divided  and people like elizabeth warren really have to get their act together because it s going to stay divided  of course  sliding in there that maybe he s to blame as well  but really this diversionary tactic is typical of trump to get the topic away from him being called out so tremendously well and turned back onto the person who threw down the gauntlet against him trump cannot take criticism and warren knows this  how he responds makes him look juvenile and weak  so hopefully warren as well as all others who are trying to prevent him from getting into the oval office continue to put him on the defense  because he really just can t handle it    realdonaldtrump takes a shot at elizabeth warren  https   t co  pic twitter com   politico video   politicovideo  march    image via video screen capture twitter
