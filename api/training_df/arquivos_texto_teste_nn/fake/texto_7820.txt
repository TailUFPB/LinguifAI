the united nations reports that iran is in full compliance with the treaty brokered by the obama administration  much to the chagrin of republican warhawks  iran s failure to break the treaty is also an unwelcome reality to the corporate media which had been agitating for a new war to boost ratings tough luck  fellas the international atomic energy agency s first assessment since the accord came into force on january  showed that iran was meeting its main commitments as agreed  iran  has not pursued the construction of the existing arak heavy water research reactor  and has  not enriched uranium  above low levels  the iaea report said iran s stockpile of low enriched uranium  material which can be used for peaceful purposes but when further processed for a nuclear weapon  has not risen about the agreed level of  kilos   pounds  i know peace can be boring  what with the lack of explosions and flag draped coffins  but that s no reason that this should not be a large national story  just one year ago  it looked like there was just no way to avoid going to war with iran  the republicans said so  the corporate media said so  conventional wisdom was that war was the only way to dismantle iran s nuclear weapons program that was only weeks away from developing a bomb just as a quick note about iran s  nuclear weapons program   it doesn t exist  it didn t even exist before the treaty  it hasn t existed for decades  all of our intelligence agencies as well as israel s intelligence agencies  which are quite good  said  unequivocally  that iran didn t even have a process in place to even discuss developing a nuclear weapons program  that s how far it was from their minds but you wouldn t have known that listening to the republicans and the  liberal  media  both of whom were salivating for a new war  according to them  we had to invade before it was too late so obama did what grownups do  he used diplomacy and got the exact same results without firing a single shot  oh  and he undermined the power of opec and russia by allowing iran s oil to flood back into the market  lowering the price of oil  which  as a predictable byproduct  also helps our green energy sector continue to flourish which lessens the impact of climate change but none of that makes for an exciting story so don t expect to hear too much about it on the evening news featured image via ai archives
