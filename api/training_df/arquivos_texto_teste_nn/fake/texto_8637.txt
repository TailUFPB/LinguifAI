the gop never ceases to amaze with its consistent insanity  this time the insanity has to do with the water contamination issue in flint  michigan  a michigan republican said that the flint water crisis may be overstated and another said that it s actually a  hoax   l  brooks patterson  an oakland county executive said that the water crisis had been  vastly overstated  however  blood testing of flint s children has found dangerously high levels of lead after the cash strapped city stopped buying water from detroit and instead drew corrosive water from the flint river beginning in april    despite the tests  patterson is skeptical  he made the statement after  gop political analyst bill ballenger had opened a debate on the issue during a radio interview   i think  well  that s the other side   patterson said   let s wait and see what the facts show  on the radio show  bill ballenger said that tests on his own blood had found no elevated levels of lead  this has been a vastly overblown crisis  perpetuated by a lot of politicians with an axe to grind and  for that matter  the news media  and some national figures  some political  some entertainers who don t know what they re talking about  i had my blood tested just yesterday  and i have no elevated blood lead level   it s way down there  the idea that the entire population of flint has been poisoned and that we all have elevated blood levels because of this is just a total canard  it s just a crock  and for this to be perpetuated as a story is doing a lot of damage to flint as a community  the evidence or lack of evidence cited in ballenger s rant has given patterson reason to doubt whether the children of flint  who don t have any access to fresh drinking water  were contaminated despite the tests that were done  patterson said that ballenger was  adamant that he lives in flint  he drinks the water  he showers in that water   ballenger even described the water crisis as a  hoax  ballenger s evidence is at best anecdotal  whether he drank flint s water or not  it s children who are much more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults  eden wells  michigan s chief medical executive  said that all children who drank the city s water since april of  have been exposed to high levels of lead  that is at least   children  the long term effects of elevated blood levels can lead to many health complications  the long term effects of elevated blood lead levels in children may include slow development  reduced intelligence quotient  iq  scores  learning disabilities  hearing loss  reduced height and hyperactivity  very severe lead exposure  blood lead levels greater than   g dl  can cause coma  convulsions and even death  it boggles the mind that the republicans would rather talk about isis or repealing obamacare  while they dismiss an unfolding tragedy in an american city that s affecting thousands of american kids feature image via screengrab
