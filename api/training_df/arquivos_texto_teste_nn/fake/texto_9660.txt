the hill  and it s a doozy  will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt  anti american  self serving and lying players  not providing information on a corruption scheme before the russian uranium deal was approved by u s  regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine u s  national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them  the russian efforts to manipulate our american political enterprise is breathtaking     former house intelligence chair mike rogers  r mi the hill   before the obama administration approved a controversial deal in  giving moscow control of a large swath of american uranium  the fbi had gathered substantial evidence that russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery  kickbacks  extortion and money laundering designed to grow vladimir putin s atomic energy business inside the united states  according to government documents and interviews federal agents used a confidential u s  witness working inside the russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records  make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as  that showed moscow had compromised an american uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act  fbi and court documents show they also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the u s  designed to benefit former president bill clinton s charitable foundation during the time secretary of state hillary clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to moscow  sources told the hill the racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks  one agent declared in an affidavit years later rather than bring immediate charges in   however  the department of justice  doj  continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years  essentially leaving the american public and congress in the dark about russian nuclear corruption on u s  soil during a period when the obama administration made two major decisions benefitting putin s commercial nuclear ambitions the first decision occurred in october   when the state department and government agencies on the committee on foreign investment in the united states unanimously approved the partial sale of canadian mining company uranium one to the russian nuclear giant rosatom  giving moscow control of more than  percent of america s uranium supply when this sale was used by trump on the campaign trail last year  hillary clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the state department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any  matter  in   the administration gave approval for rosatom s tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to u s  nuclear power plants in a partnership with the united states enrichment corp  before then  tenex had been limited to selling u s  nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled soviet nuclear weapons under the  megatons to megawatts peace program  the russians were compromising american contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats  all of which raised legitimate national security concerns  and none of that evidence got aired before the obama administration made those decisions   a person who worked on the case told the hill  speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by u s  or russian officials the obama administration s decision to approve rosatom s purchase of uranium one has been a source of political controversy since  that s when conservative author peter schweitzer and the new york times documented how bill clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while hillary clinton presided on the committee on foreign investment in the united states the obama administration and the clintons defended their actions at the time  insisting there was no evidence that any russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the uranium one deal but fbi  energy department and court documents reviewed by the hill show the fbi  in fact  had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that vadim mikerin   the main russian overseeing putin s nuclear expansion inside the united states   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in  then attorney general eric holder was among the obama administration officials joining hillary clinton on the committee on foreign investment in the united states at the time the uranium one deal was approved  multiple current and former government officials told the hill they did not know whether the fbi or doj ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered spokesmen for holder and clinton did not return calls seeking comment  the justice department also didn t comment mikerin was a director of rosatom s tenex in moscow since the early   where he oversaw rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the united states under the megatons to megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries  in   mikerin was dispatched to the u s  on a work visa approved by the obama administration to open rosatom s new american arm called tenam between  and january   mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine  conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct  delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity  enriched uranium  in commerce by extortion   a november  indictment stated his illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness  an american businessman  who began making kickback payments at mikerin s direction and with the permission of the fbi  the first kickback payment recorded by the fbi through its informant was dated nov      the records show  the investigation was ultimately supervised by then u s  attorney rod rosenstein  an obama appointee who now serves as president trump s deputy attorney general  and then assistant fbi director andrew mccabe  now the deputy fbi director under trump  justice department documents show on august      the washington times questioned deputy attorney general rod rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on president trump in his investigation in the trump russia investigation  the special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the department of justice  and we don t engage in fishing expeditions   mr  rosenstein said on  fox news sunday  in his first sunday show interview  mr  rosenstein added that special counsel robert mueller  understands and i understand the specific scope of the investigation and so  it s not a fishing expedition  mr  rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into mr  trump s finances unrelated to possible russian interference in last year s election mr  rosenstein played down the reports   that s not anything that i ve said  that s not anything director mueller has said  we don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are  both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible  but still unproven collusion between russia and donald trump s campaign during the  election mccabe is under congressional and justice department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s virginia state senate campaign accepted in  from now virginia gov  terry mcauliffe at a time when mcauliffe was reportedly under investigation by the fbi the connections to the current russia case are many  the mikerin probe began in  when robert mueller  now the special counsel in charge of the trump case  was still fbi director  and it ended in late  under the direction of then fbi director james comey  who trump fired earlier this year bringing down a major russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the u s  and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap but the justice department and fbi took little credit in  when mikerin  the russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged the only public statement occurred an entire year later when the justice department put out a little noticed press release in august   just days before labor day  the release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals the lack of fanfare left many key players in washington with no inkling that a major russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered on dec      the justice department put out a release stating that mikerin   a former russian official residing in maryland was sentenced today to  months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than    million ronald hosko  who served as the assistant fbi director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway  told the hill he did not recall ever being briefed about mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged  i had no idea this case was being conducted   a surprised hosko said in an interview meanwhile  julian assange is jumping on the bandwagon  as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that russia routed millions to
