jut when you didn t think the hosts on the fox news channel couldn t get any more despicable  they do  on tuesday s edition of fox and friends  the hosts of that silly show decided to take aim at a high school athlete who just happens to be transgender  they misgendered her and called her a boy  and also said that she was  gender bending   and  confused   the athlete is a track star at her high school  and instead of praising this brave young woman as they should have the hosts said that she was confusing kids who are already pretty confused in this culture   they went on to wonder  are girls who identify as boys  are they going to be the running backs for the football   is that going to work out well  how s that going to work out  here is the transcript of the conversation  via media matters steve doocy  co host   laura  we talk about popular culture and society  how about this story this morning  there s a high school track athlete who was born male  identifies now as female  laura ingraham  no doocy  competed with the girls  track team  and finished i think third at the state competition  i think we could have seen this coming  what do you make of this ingraham  well  it s another first  right  we re all into firsts so that s a first  then it will be the first field hockey player and pole vault star  let me just say this  and brian will love this story  i was in field hockey in glastonbury  connecticut  and at the end of the season one season we had the boys  soccer team play us  we were ranked number one in the state so the boys decided they were going to pick up sticks  the soccer team and play against us  well  sadly for us the boys  who have never played field hockey  creamed us  okay  they killed us  we were number one in the state  they were faster  they were stronger  and they   i mean  it made me really mad  but they had better hand eye coordination and never picked up a stick before  so is this fair to the other girls competing  i mean  i don t think it s really fair brian kilmeade  co host   of course it s not ingraham  and i think it s just more gender bending  this is gender bending   this is the next frontier until there s another frontier that the   you know  those who want to mix up the traditional social mores want to take us to  so it doesn t surprise me  it s not fair  until parents make their views known  this is just going to keep getting worse kilmeade  hey  laura  in an environment where people are taking performance enhancing drugs to do better in sports you know we re going to be in the situation where  well  we d like to win our first state championship so let s let a few men   excuse me  some boys play with the girls  team and then take the controversy and also take the trophy ingraham  hey brian  do you think it will go the other way though  are girls who identify as boys  are they going to be the running backs for the football   is that going to work out well  how s that going to work out  let s go the other direction and see how successful that works out  i mean it s just  i have no   i really have  kilmeade  i just shrug my   i don t know what to say ingraham  well  it s only the current conversation  but remember we ll be on to the next issue and then the next and the next  this is a current litmus test  you re not a human being with real feelings and empathy unless you re cheering this on and bowing down to this new movement  look  that s the way they want to frame it  it s up to the regular americans to say  look  i m a good person  but i don t think this is fair and i think most people don t develop their understanding of their own  you know  sexuality until frankly later in life  you know  i think it s   i think it s confusing kids who are already pretty confused in this culture kilmeade  i m confused  and i m a grown up  laura ingraham  i pretty much have reached my maximum in maturity  laura  thanks so much this is really just too much  even for the imbeciles at fox and friends  they can have their opinions  sure  no matter how absolutely ignorant they may be  but attacking a private citizen  a high school student no less  on national television over her gender identity is truly beyond the pale  these people need an education  not a platform to spread ignorance watch the video below  again via media matters featured image via video screen capture
