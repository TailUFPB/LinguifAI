we all know how much conservatives love to whine about how persecuted they are for their mainstream beliefs  and continue promoting their completely skewed perception of what it s really like to be discriminated against on saturday during a speech in iowa  republican presidential front runner donald trump revisited his previous comments where he d proposed that all muslims be banned from coming into the united states  offering up a completely out of touch alternative scenario  trump actually had the audacity to say that he would have had  less difficulty  if he had suggested a ban on christians from coming into america instead of muslims  the business mogul said to his audience at dordt college  a christian school  if i said that about christians  and if i said  banned   i m telling you i would have had less difficulty  and that s pretty sad  because we re christians  i m protestant  i m presbyterian  trump s faith has been questioned before   especially since he d recently said he doesn t like asking god for forgiveness  now doing damage control  he s embracing the religious right full force  he said  i m a true believer  and you re many true believers   i hope all   is everybody a true believer in this room  i think so  but christianity is under tremendous siege  the donald also lamented that christians weren t using their full power and political influence in the united states   and that they should step it up  the nonsense he s spewing is actually pretty terrifying  the power of our group of people together  i mean  if you add it up   it could be    million  and yet we don t exert the power that we should have  now  i think some of the churches are afraid of their tax status  to be honest but you know the fact is that there is nothing the politicians can do to you if you band together  you have too much power  but the christians don t use their power  we have to strengthen  because we are getting   if you look  it s death by a million cuts   we are getting less and less and less powerful in terms of a religion  and in terms of a force  trump pulled out all of the stops  even touching on one of the far right s biggest religion based complaints   the supposed  war on christmas   complaining that big department stores were not using  merry christmas  during the holiday season  he said  when they don t want to say  merry christmas  in department stores anymore  i won t shop at places that don t say  merry christmas   guess what  i don t too much shopping  no  no  it s true  when i see these stores  and they have a red wall and they have nothing on it  they don t want to say  merry christmas  anymore  i say   why don t you say merry christmas   i ll tell you one thing  i get elected president  we re going to be saying  merry christmas  again  just remember that  and by the way  christianity will have power  without having to form  and as if trump being president wasn t terrifying enough  his promise to giving christians more power should have everyone running out to the polls to prevent this nightmare from actually happening  he added  because if i m there  you re going to have plenty of power  you don t need anybody else  you re going to have somebody representing you very  very well  remember that  featured image via gage skidmore
