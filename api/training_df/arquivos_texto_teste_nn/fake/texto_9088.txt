everyone suspected the sketchy steele dossier was what corrupt fbi and doj officials used to get the october  fisa warrant against trump  fbi and doj officials refuse to answer that question publicly rep ron desantis  r fl  said in a statement  we now know that the so called steele dossier was paid for by the democratic party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then candidate trump  what the american people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by steele on the democrats  dime was used by the obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against trump associates  the fbi has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of congress  the trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against trump or his associates  immediately after his inauguration  president trump came out swinging over the  fake  russian dossier  he even went as far as to blame the intelligence community   president trump was immediately criticized for his comments  and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory  as it turns out  he wasn t too far off the mark ct   despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question  and despite numerous on camera questions to fbi and doj officials about the  fisa process  no one had definitively confirmed the christopher steele  russian dossier  was the underlying evidence for the  fisa application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate donald trump  until now senator lindsey graham just confirmed the sketchy steele dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the fisa court  brian kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious  but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it  watch at starting at the   mark  the back story to the fisa warrant is the cornerstone  the back story contains both the fbi and the doj scheme  expose it  remove it  and the entire  muh russia conspiracy  collapses under the weight of sunlight this is critical and important because the specific use of the steele dossier underpins the big ugly and exposes the entire top tier apparatus of the fbi counterintelligence division  peter strzok  bill priestap  james baker  andrew mccabe  and the doj national security division  john carlin  stuart evans  mary mccord and sally yates   as well as doj bruce ohr and fbi lawyer lisa page directly to  conspiracy  charges the  fbi counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the trump campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a fisa warrant  sold as a defense of u s  democracy from russia  which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etc the doj involvement surrounds legal arguments  processing of fisa applications  and use of the legal system to support the fbi operation with actionable legal framing  against trump   the doj national security division carried out that collaboration with the fbi tablet mag did a deep dive into the fusion gps connection to the creation of the steele dossier  and more specifically how fusion gps head glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the white house prior to the doj and fbi applying for the fisa warrant   see here tablet mag outlines how mary jacoby even bragged about getting the  russiagate  narrative started a tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now famous dossier suggests that central elements of the russiagate scandal emerged not from the british ex spy christopher steele s top secret  sources  in the russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from russian government control but from a series of stories that fusion gps co founder glenn simpson and his wife mary jacoby co wrote for thewall street journal well before fusion gps existed  and donald trump was simply another loud mouthed manhattan real estate millionaire understanding the origins of the  steele dossier  is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the united states  in a facebook post from june     that tablet has seen in screenshots  jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for russiagate   she has not replied to repeated requests for comment    it s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what glenn s role was in exposing putin s control of donald trump   jacoby wrote   let s be clear  glenn conducted the investigation  glenn hired chris steele  chris steele worked for glenn  this assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride  it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the  steele dossier   on which the russiagate narrative is founded   read more the tablet mag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished steele dossier entering into the white house and how president obama likely saw and reviewed the content however  missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefarious remember  previous media reporting  in conjunction with clinton campaign admissions  have confirmed the dnc and clinton campaign financed fusion gps through their lawyers within perkins coie  fusion then hired nellie ohr the wife of doj deputy bruce ohr who thereafter sub contracted with retired british  agent christopher steele to write research provide credibility for  the dossier  the dates here are important because they tell a story the origin of the clinton effort with fusion gps was april   that s the same month fusion hired nellie ohr  wife of doj deputy bruce ohr  to gather opposition research on candidate trump  it would be most likely that nellie ohr was in contact with christopher steele  doj deputy attorney bruce ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with christopher steele and fusion gps founder glenn simpson in october   the same month the fisa warrant was granted however  there was another event in this april  timeline which enhances the trail of the dossier origination   check this out in april  mary jacoby shows up on white house visitor logs meeting with president obama officials  in april  the clinton campaign and dnc hired fusion gps to organize the russia research  that later became known as the  steele dossier   link to white house logs the wife of glenn simpson  fusion gps   mary b  jacoby  with years of russia angled reporting  including donald trump  visits the white house in april   at the same time as the dnc and clinton hire fusion gps to conduct the opposition research on donald trump  surrounding russia this timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidental expand slightly and consider april  mary jacoby  wife of fusion gps founder glenn simpson  visits the white house  the clinton campaign and dnc then hire fusion gps to conduct  opposition research   with a russian emphasis  fusion gps then hires nellie ohr who specializes in russian centric counterintelligence  nellie ohr then contacts  agent christopher steele to write a russian dossier  a month later  may   nellie ohr s husband inside the doj  bruce ohr  is then working with fbi counterintelligence head peter strzok  by june   peter strzok  bruce ohr  and doj attorney lisa page then apply for the first fisa warrant this timeline is so transparent it s deafening  simpson and jacoby had id d manafort as a world class sleazeball and they were right  a slick georgetown law grad running in gop circles since the reagan campaign  manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people  i would only add here that  in my personal experience  journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written  especially stories with a character like manafort at the center so when the trump campaign named paul manafort as its campaign convention manager on march     you can bet that simpson and jacoby s eyes lit up  and as it happened  at the exact same time that trump hired manafort  fusion gps was in negotiations with perkins coie  the law firm representing the clinton campaign and the dnc  to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the trump campaign they had started for the washington free beacon   more mary jacoby and glenn simpson   fusion gpsif the counterintelligence fisa warrant was obtained through deception  misleading manipulated information  or fraud  and that warrant is what led to the wiretapping and surveillance of candidate donald trump and general flynn  and that warrant was authorized by fisa court judge contreras  who was the judge in flynn s case  and is now recused  the entire tenuous fbi and doj operation begins to collapse and the outline of a  conspiracy  becomes clearly evident the back story to the fisa warrant is the cornerstone  the back story contains both the fbi and the doj scheme  expose it  remove it  and the entire  muh russia  conspiracy fraud collapses under the weight of sunlight go here to see the entire fascinating investigation compiled by the conservative
