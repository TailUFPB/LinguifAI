to hear conservatives  including those in the republican presidential race  tell it  president obama made america look weak by talking to iran in order to get  detained u s  sailors  rather than  say  immediately ordering carpet bombing of tehran  some right wing media outlets were even more despondent  breitbart  america s preeminent dumping ground of right wing hysteria  devoted several articles to framing the incident as a humiliation for obama however  as much as conservatives would love to have this story be about obama s weakness  the facts simply do not support that conclusion for one thing  the entire duration was less than  hours  u s  sailors had a gps malfunction near the border of iran  when they floated into that country s sovereign territory  they were picked up by iranian military ships  by all accounts  they were treated well during their  captivity   secretary of state john kerry worked tirelessly with the iranian government  who sent them back with their boats the next day  no missiles were launched  no wars were started  no lives were lost getting no bloodshed  a perversely disappointed republican party were left instead to squabble over the details  at issue was whether obama  apologized  to iran for encroaching into their territory  this  republicans said  was a serious blow to america s reputation  according to these warmongering blowhards  to apologize is to surrender there are just two problems with this narrative  first  the obama administration never apologized to iran  and secondly  back in   george w  bush absolutely did apologize to another of america s economic foes  china  when he was faced with a similar situation  nobody thought offering an apology was a sign of america s crumbling power when bush did so in april of    us air force members were  captured  by the chinese government after crashing on a chinese island  it was  without a doubt  a colossal screw up  america had been flying spy planes into china s territory  and one of those spy missions wound up crashing into a chinese plane  killing the pilot  for  days  the u s  soldiers were held in china while diplomats from both countries scrambled to figure out what to do  but then george w  bush said he was sorry the letter delivered today to china s foreign ministry by the us ambassador  joseph prueher  said mr bush and the secretary of state  colin powell  expressed  sincere regret  over the loss of the chinese plane and the missing pilot  mr wang  please convey to the chinese people to the family of pilot wang wei that we are very sorry for their loss   said the letter the document letter appeared to be a complex linguistic compromise a chinese language copy of the letter released by the us embassy did not use the term chinese officials had insisted on    daoqian   a formal apology that admits blame even worse   if you re a writer for breitbart   bush went on to apologize for entering chinese airspace  the same might be expected of obama when two of america s ships entered iranian waters we are very sorry the entering of china s airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance  but very pleased the crew landed safely  we appreciate china s efforts to see to the well being of our crew while the situation was extremely tense at the time  and although the bush administration was reluctant to say  i m sorry   they eventually backed down   note  the bush administration would go on to repeatedly insist this apology was not an apology  take that for what it s worth   america didn t become the laughingstock of the world  nobody felt like anyone had lost any respect  instead  the two sides moved on  the american soldiers got to return home unharmed as we ve seen time and again  the republican party  infuriated that they have no legs to stand on in complaining about obama  create mountains out of molehills  a diplomatic issue that could have led to a very bad situation for  u s  service members was resolved in less than  hours by two governments which strongly dislike each other and conservatives think that s what losing looks like  are they crazy  no  just extremely disingenuous or as the saying goes  there are lies  damned lies  and the right wing media  up is down  cold is hot  and  soldiers getting to come home to their families safely is a  loss   george w  bush might want to have a talk with his colleagues featured image via flickr
