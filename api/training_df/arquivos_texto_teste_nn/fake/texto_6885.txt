israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has always advocated for the ethnic cleansing of palestinians  but has dressed himself up as someone who wants peace  all the while continuing to steal palestinian land for jewish settlements and to deny palestinians their civil and political rights on lands in which israel controls  in a november   speech  netanyahu said  israel should have exploited china s suppression of the demonstrations   at a time when the world s attention was devoted to events in that country  in order to conduct mass expulsions of the arabs  of the occupied territories  however  to my sorrow  they  didn t support the policy i espoused and whose implementation i continue to recommend  most of the world knows netanyahu is not a peace maker  yet  israeli apologists will argue that if only israel would elect someone from other  moderate  parties in israel  then he she would take a softer stance on palestinians and thus peace could be achieved  however  those who believe this nonsense are naive  israel has a deep rooted culture of ethnic cleansing that dates back to the early zionists and it is at the very core of today s israel when the first zionist delegation came to palestine from europe in the  century looking to colonize the country and create their jewish state  they declared that the  bride is beautiful but she s married to another man   meaning that there was already an existing people and culture in the country   the palestinians  however  that didn t stop the zionists from pursuing their agenda of wanting to create a jewish state despite the fact that   of the population wasn t jewish  we must keep in mind that the ideology of zionism advocates not only for a jewish state but the state must be majority jewish  thus  a major dilemma for the zionists was how to create a majority jewish state in a country where the majority of the population wasn t jewish  the answer was to bring european jews to the country on the one hand and to pursue the policy of ethnically cleansing palestinians on the other that zionist culture of ethnic cleansing came into fruition in   despite massive european jewish immigration into the country for  years  the jewish population never reached a majority  accounting for about   of the population  thus  in order to attain the majority jewish state  david ben gurion  who would later become israel s first prime minister  unleashed operation plan dalet  a campaign of ethnic cleansing that saw the destruction of hundreds of villages and the forced expulsion of close to a million palestinians out of the country  today  they and their descendants number in the millions in   israel conquered the remaining   of palestine  taking the west bank and the gaza strip  despite the fact that close to   palestinians were ethnically cleansed  the majority managed to remain on their lands and today the west bank s   million palestinians are a thorn in the side of the zionists who have been building settlements in the heart of palestinian communities throughout the west bank and thirst for more palestinian land  the united nations considers israel s presence in the west bank and gaza to be illegal and their building of settlements to be in violation of the fourth geneva conventions  yet  israel continues building  confiscating lands  blowing up palestinian property to make way for israeli expansion and then killing palestinians when they complain and labeling them as terrorists when they resist calls for the ethnic cleansing and genocide of palestinians continues to this day  while netanyahu is currently the prime minister  a new generation of israelis have called for the violent removal of palestinians  the calls for crimes against humanity are thus not isolated to a few politicians in israel but are at the very fabric of the ideology of zionism and its adherents  featured image via wikimedia commons
