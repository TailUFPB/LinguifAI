a strange answer offered by governor chris christie during the republican presidential debate showed how deeply hostile the conservative base is towards women asked to name  one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all  in order to cut spending so that the budget can be balanced  christie made a strange reach and called for cutting off funding to planned parenthood christie was then pressed on whether he d cut  anything bigger than that   since planned parenthood receives just   million annually  a miniscule sum compared with the kind of cuts needed to balance the budget  when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb  i can t think of anything bigger than that   he said in response the current budget deficit is a projected   billion  the funding for planned parenthood accounts for    of the deficit and an even smaller    of the    trillion budget for the country  considering the women the organization helps  and their families  christie should be praising the value taxpayers get for their spending on the organization his follow up response  designed to elicit sympathy from conservative  christian  voters in iowa  is even more ridiculous when you realize that planned parenthood is banned from spending any of its federal money on abortion services in the first place thanks to rules put in place by the right and kept there by democrats  none of the abortion services can be funded with federal money  and christie definitely knows this  he was just too busy pandering but the answer and the positive reaction to it by voters at the debate  shows how deep seated gop animosity towards women s reproductive health is  they would cheer for a candidate vowing to eliminate a group supporting women s health  whose federal receipts are less than a rounding error on the balance sheet  all to satisfy their ongoing desire to control a woman s body featured image via youtube
