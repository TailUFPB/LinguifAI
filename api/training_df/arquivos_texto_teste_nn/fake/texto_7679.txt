sarah silverman and bill maher destroyed the so called fox republican debates in what maher described as  completely fact free   they both wondered why hillary and bernie couldn t debate the republican candidates right now  this  they agreed  would at least inject some facts in the debates since the fox moderators refused to do so   megyn kelly  if you re such a serious person   said maher   ask one question about the environment  sarah silverman also let loose on the candidates and their supporters saying   only at a republican only debate can you be trying to win over the audience by saying i m going to cut education   she s right  it s something out of the twilight zone  where candidates are trying to outdo each other to see who s more likely to destroy the middle class it s also quite crazy that the candidates weren t asked why the republicans want to cut funding for the very water agency that could have stopped the water problem before the poisoning of the children of flint  michigan   the water poisoning of course was done under the watch of a republican governor  it s alarming that fox moderators didn t address this issue  especially since the debates were in detroit it seems as though the fox moderators showed little interest in fact checking and the idea that fox moderators are hard on trump or any other republican candidates is ludicrous featured image via screenshot
