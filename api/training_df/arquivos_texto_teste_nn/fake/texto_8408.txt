while having a third independent option for president is surely a democratic thing to do  the implications surrounding someone like former new york city mayor mike bloomberg jumping into the race are huge what would bloomberg running as an independent on the ticket mean  well  it would pull votes from a major party candidate  and in this election  that candidate will be the democratic one  because while bloomberg could appeal to wealthy conservatives  he s staunchly pro heavy gun regulations  which will turn the remainder of the republican base off in a heart beat  so  any votes he pulls will be from moderate to right leaning democrats  as well as independents who may be leaning towards the democratic candidate  this is especially true if bernie sanders is the nominee and people are apprehensive about a democratic socialist in the white house  however  it d be true of hillary clinton as well so with the center votes missing from the democratic candidate  and surely not enough votes for bloomberg taken from either side  this leaves the republicans with a clear path to victory  and with donald trump trouncing his opposition in the polls  we re looking at a trump presidency now  unless bloomberg has some secret  backdoor deal with trump that no one is keenly aware of  the former mayor of new york city needs to put his dreams of the oval office on the shelf  and likely keep them there for good  the last thing this nation needs is a president trump  a person  who as president  would alienate not only all the minorities in his own country  but would alienate the united states from the rest of the world  we d be an embarrassment  even more so than when george w  bush was president so  please  bloomberg  if you happen to read this  take all that was just said to heart and think about what you really  truly want for the nation  if you want president trump  then by all means  run  however  if not  please don t  not just for you and the nation  but for the entire world featured image  flickr flickr
