a highly exclusive  highly secretive club organized by and for hollywood s  relatively small  conservative community has spectacularly imploded   and like many bad things  this can be blamed on donald trump according to a recent announcement by  the friends of abe a club with members including clint eastwood  gary sinise  kelsey grammer  jon voight  and producer jerry bruckheimer   the group will abruptly end after reported in fighting and lack of enthusiasm caused irredeemable dysfunction  effective immediately  we are going to begin to wind down the   organization  bring the sustaining membership dues to an end  and do away with the costly infrastructure and the abespal com website   the executive director  jeremy boreing  told members in an email  a copy of which the guardian has seen  today  because we have been successful in creating a community that extends far beyond our events  people just don t feel as much of a need to show up for every speaker or bar night  and fewer people pay the dues that help us maintain that large infrastructure  as the guardian notes  one of the major reasons the celebrities can t get along is because of the question of donald trump  many of the members can be said to subscribe to the school of  never trump   but some of hollywood s conservative community has been warming to the candidate  now  as california appears to be the key primary state  the one which will likely decide whether trump slides easily into the nomination or if the clown show heads to a contested convention  things have gone nuclear  things only got worse after the group hosted both trump and his rival ted cruz at separate events  neither candidate  apparently  won over everyone the club itself has been around for a decade  but not a lot is known about its meetings  the members  an enclave of conservatives in  liberal  hollywood  adopted   and i m not kidding here   the first rule of  fight club   don t talk about the friends of abe  secrecy was strictly enforced  including a ban on pictures and tweets it s unclear where the battle lines are drawn  but jon voight seemed to throw some serious shade at the  never trump  club members when in an interview with breitbart  he said conservatives preventing trump from being president were suckers  there are many republicans fighting to keep him from winning the republican nomination  you know why  because he has no bull to sell  and everyone will discover the bull most politicians spew out is for their own causes and benefits  i pray all americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of america with the obama years  to please fight for donald trump  both gary sinise and kelsey grammer are die hard cruz fans in many ways  what happened in hollywood is happening all over the country  the republican party has been shredded over donald trump s rise and with an alternative as weak as ted cruz as the only other option  many long time republicans have been stumbling around in what can only be described as a catatonically despondent state  apparently  even holding a secret meeting with fellow conservatives at a bar became too much to handle as the primary season slouches towards its terrifying conclusion featured image via jason kempin getty images for warner bros  studio tour hollywood
