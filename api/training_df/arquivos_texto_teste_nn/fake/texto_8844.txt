the water crisis in flint is not just simply a man made disaster  it is the actualization of unconstrained republican policy  for more than a year  michigan governor rick snyder and the emergency manager of flint ignored the voices of all those who spoke out about the contamination of flint s water  now  michigan is forced to rely on obama and the federal government to rescue them in april   flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using detroit s water system to using the flint river for water  the decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city  it turned out to be a disaster  there is an unusual amount of salt in the flint river  the river is also extremely contaminated  so when the salt began to corrode the pipes of flint s water system  lead leaked into people s drinking water  one study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as   a day  now it is estimated that it will cost up to    billion dollars to fix flint s water system  there has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one  when evidence was shown that flint s water had become contaminated  snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act  that s why snyder is currently being investigated by the epa for those not in the know  an emergency manager acts as the feudal lord for cities that want to behave fiscally irresponsibly  the emergency manager law was implemented by snyder  when a local government fails to meet certain criteria  the governor appoints an emergency manager to replace the city government  the local government still exists  but those democratically elected officials do not have any real power  you might say that s just tough luck for michiganders who elected snyder  but you would be wrong  the emergency manager law was overturned through a ballot initiative in   snyder and michigan s republican controlled state government decided to replace the law  with an almost exact copy now as many as   people have been poisoned by reckless neglect  and republicans  unfaltering devotion to destroying effective government   this disaster was entirely preventable  the same way that the massive water shut offs in detroit  that have received international condemnation  are completely unnecessary at this point  there is no way that the flint water crisis can be solved without receiving financial aid from the federal government  snyder declared the disaster a state wide emergency last week  which makes it so that he can request financial aid from the federal government  snyder must call on the obama administration to fix his mess featured image credit  michigan municipal league via flickr creative commons license
