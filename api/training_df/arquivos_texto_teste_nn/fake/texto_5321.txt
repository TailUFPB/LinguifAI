okay  nobody can accuse bill o reilly of being a supporter of obama  but his show tonight was off the charts  he decided it would be a good idea to remind his audience just how president obama has made the world a really terrible place  to that end  he proceeded to use his show to blame obama for absolutely everything wrong with the world right now so just what is obama responsible for  let us count them alongside media matters for america o reilly says there s more  but his show is only so long so he probably thinks he can t list them  but he made some wild leaps of logic  like the following on terrorism and brexit  mr  obama s failure to destroy assad s air force in syria  when he could have  after drawing that red line over poison gas  has directly led to millions of refugees storming into europe  that crisis has profoundly damaged the region and perhaps even stimulated great britain leaving the european union  really  he s looking at a series of events and putting them together in what he must think is a totally logical way  without even trying to understand some of the underlying factors  like immigrants from eastern europe as well as a sense that britain had lost its sovereignty  it s really a wonder that billo the clown thinks his show is all about telling the truth the whole   race relations are worse now under obama   thing is misleading  and reeks of  oh  well  obama s black and liberal and his political correctness is responsible for deteriorating race relations   no  o reilly and his ilk need to pull their collective heads out of their collective asses before speaking of things they know nothing about  race relations were last this bad in   after rodney king  not the    and while this has happened under obama  he is not the cause of it frivolous lawsuits  o reilly used the word  charlatans  when discussing that  so he s very likely talking about people suing governments for promoting christianity  which is illegal under the first amendment  those aren t frivolous  but o reilly and his white  christian privilege are mired in a delusion from which there is no escape if he s talking about regular frivolous lawsuits  then he s way off  those have been around forever now there s too much to really address all of it  but suffice it to say that o reilly s pursuing a bit of a witch hunt against obama while talking up donald trump  he should stick to what he s good at oh wait  that s nothing  watch him lose his grip on reality below featured image by jamie mccarthy getty images for the rumble
