one of the largest environmental disasters in american history is happening right now  and there is a great chance that you never heard of it thanks to corporate owned media there is a colossal leak of methane gas currently pouring out of the ground in aliso canyon  california  at an astonishing rate of   pounds per hour  the fallout is intense   homes in the area have been evacuated so far  prompting many lawsuits to be filed against the corporation that owns the faciliy southern california gas company is the entity that s responsible for the disaster  which began in october of   a statement by scgc in december said that stopping the leak would take at least  more months below you can see video footage of just how bad the leak is the severity of this can t understated  this single leak is accounting for  percent of the entire state s methane emissions  and has been classified as the worst environmental disaster since the  bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico  methane is  times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas as well  marking this as a signicant ecological threat anne silva  spokesperson for scgc  made the following statement  our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful  so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well the relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late february or late march  source  motherboardthe part that is making it so difficult to deal with  is the fact that the well is   feet deep  this is preventing the normal disaster recovery method of plugging the leak with fluids from working  due to too much pressure coming up from underground  the hope is that the relief well will drain off some pressure from the main well  allowing the fluid plug to work as intended if you thought this was the only methane leak in california  you were wrong  the reality is far worse in pasadena   miles from the aliso canyon leak  investigators found a cluster of leaks at  miles or less from each other  below is a map of them  courtesy of earth defense fund image credit  edfwhere the hell is the accountability for this  the map above should be a criminal offense the story of southern california gas company is a pretty damning one  edf has found that more than  percent of the methane pipes that scgc manages are more than  years old  and  percent are made from sub standard materials prone to leaks and corrosion  over  million pounds of methane have been released by the leak so far  and that isn t counting the huge cluster of leaks shown above lets put this into perspective  if  families had to evacuate a california town because of volcano suddenly springing up  it would be everywhere in the media  there would be a nightly obsession over it on cable news  politicians on every level would be pledging to help  and doing everything they can to hasten relief efforts if we had a terrorist act that caused  people to have to evacuate an american town  we would already be invading multiple middle eastern countries that had nothing to do with it instead  we have  people displaced by an ecological disaster caused by a corporation  and the media response is  what disaster  featured image via flickr
