picking a fight with joy reid on live television is not smart  so of course a trump surrogate did exactly that and got his ass handed to him during her show on saturday morning  trump supporter carl paladino actually claimed that the republican nominee knows how to handle russia and vladamir putin better than our military  state department  and intelligence agencies  he also attacked reid directly  calling her a politically correct progressive who is not on america s side reid began by playing footage of former cia director michael hayden slamming trump s  erratic  behavior and suggesting that trump could very well be a  unwitting agent  for putin  furthermore  trump is unpredictable and dangerous  especially since he would have control of america s nuclear arsenal as president indeed  trump has various business connections with russian oligarchs who are aligned with the russian president  who has directed russian state media to support trump s campaign  trump also softened the gop platform stance against russia  trump s ties with russia are especially concerning to intelligence agents  who are worried about briefing trump because whatever he is told could end up being passed along to putin  you are pretty much fighting an armada of intelligence experts   reid told paladino  in your mind   paladino told reid   no  not in my mind   reid replied   actually in my ears because we re listening to them speak  then paladino proceeded to embarrass himself by going on a rant about reid  i think what s happened to you is that you ve been in a conditioned box  for a long time  of political correctness  political correctness and a certain way of doing things  and when a guy comes on the scene who shows real leadership qualities  who can talk to the america people  and they can find faith in him and confidence in him that he s gonna do the right thing   when that man comes on the scene  you guys just don t know what to do  clearly  paladino must have missed a poll that shows  percent of americans have a negative view of trump  with  percent feeling this way strongly that s probably what reid was thinking about when she smiled as paladino ranted  the progressives are gonna lose their influence and their power and their control of the american people s minds  and you re in a panic state right now   he continued before reid chimed in with sarcasm  oh yeah  were panicking   she said after accusing reid of  making crazy accusations   reid fired back with facts  i think if you look at the polling  most of the public is standing by the generals and intelligence professionals  at least as we stand now   reid said trump is currently being trounced by hillary clinton in the polls  clinton is leading by  points nationwide in one poll paladino then implied that reid is not on america s side   i know which side you re on  mam   he said but reid clobbered paladino and trump with a sharp retort   not on vladimir putin s side  and i like that stance  here s the video via youtube as usual  trump s people ignored the facts and stuck with personal attacks and they got burned featured image via creenshot
