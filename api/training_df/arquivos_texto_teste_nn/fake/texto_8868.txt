oregon public broadcasting just busted the bundy militia using government computer systems and accessing federal employee data within the malheur national wildlife refuge in a rather serendipitous occurrence  the blue tarp man himself   lavoy finicum   was leading opb reporter john sepulvado through the building on a tour  explaining what their plans were for the building  that s when finicum led him right into something none of the militia wanted anyone to see finicum led sepulvado into a computer room that was part of the wildlife refuge compound  he explained to sepulvado that the militia planned to convert it into a  media room  to house reporters who they expected to come to the site that s when it all went wrong for the militia sepulvado observed militants interacting with government computers in the compound that can only be accessed with employee badges  employee badges were also strewn about the room  laying out in plain sight  along with papers that had names and social security numbers on them finicum immediately realized how badly he screwed the pooch by allowing the opb reporter to see what they were doing  and for good reason  their activities likely will fall under the computer fraud and abuse act which carries some serious penalties  fines and up to  years in prison  for what they were doing finicum made a mad dash to pick up all the papers full of personal information and id cards and hid them away  shortly after that  ryan bundy entered the room bundy emphatically denied that anything had been touched since they began their occupation of the compound  no  we haven t touched a single personal item  we haven t touched any of the computers  we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything  we re not here to hurt people  not even the people who work here  this is where i call bullsh t  i ll bet any amount of cash that federal employees do not make a habit of having reams of papers  covered in very sensitive and personal information just laying about on their desks as a normal part of their workday  i will also bet that if they were to do something like this  it would be once in a blue moon and they would put it away before the left for the day  the same goes with the id cards  if they were the key to using a computer  there is no doubt that any activities would be tied to the card used to access a terminal  and any misuse would fall on the individual who was assigned the card  there s no way employees would leave them laying around like that the stupidity of the militia  bringing a reporter into what is essentially an ongoing crime scene  would almost be comical  except for one really serious detail law enforcement officials informed opb that prior to the occupation  federal employees and family members of local law enforcement had received anonymous threats  harney county sheriff david ward said that his own deputies and family members had been followed home by unknown individuals  photographed  and had property damaged in recent months there are  employees that work at the refuge  all of these people could have had their personal information  home addresses  phone numbers  emergency family contacts  and god knows what else stolen and disseminated by a group of militants with too many bullets and too few brains  up till this point  things were a good laugh  now  not so much featured image via opb
