if he had been black and the protesters had been white police would have killed him in a second tragedy unfolded in dallas  texas on thursday night as snipers killed  police officers during a black lives matter rally organized in protest of unwarranted killings of two black men by police in minnesota and louisiana even more people could have been murdered if donald trump fan michael strickland had fired his weapon and emptied the extended clip he loaded into it during a black lives matter march earlier that day in portland  oregon as protesters marched  strickland stood directly in front of them so he could somehow excuse his next action as just being out of fear for his life  he pulled out his gun and pointed it at the protesters at the head of the march and they quickly took cover  the other protesters farther away  however  didn t know this was going on so they continued marching toward strickland  back off   strickland screamed   hit the ground   the front protesters warned ben kerensa witnessed strickland s actions and continued marching   we just wanted him to leave   he said kerensa watched as strickland waved his gun back and forth and even saw him switch his normal capacity magazine for an extended clip  he swept the crowd a few times with the gun  i saw him take out the regular clip and slot in an extra capacity magazine  i saw him chamber a round  i feared for my life  that s why i pulled out my gun   strickland claimed  but kerensa says that at no point was strickland threatened  the fact is  he put himself directly in front of the protesters with the intent to claim that the protesters continuing to march toward him instead of altering their route constituted a threat to his life only after strickland had lowered his weapon and walked away did police finally bother to show up and arrest him here s the video of strickland being arrested via twitter police came in numbers and just arrested man with gun pic twitter com   andrew dymburt   dymburtnews  july    protesters in portland were incredibly lucky  but this is the atmosphere donald trump has created around the country  trump has openly encouraged violence against black people at his rallies and conservatives across the nation hate the black lives matter movement that has only grown in response to police officers killing unarmed black men  many of whom did nothing wrong to justify killing them meanwhile  white gunmen like strickland are able to actually pull out their guns and fire at will without fear of being shot and killed by police  in fact  it seems like police will go above and beyond the call of duty and display extraordinary patience to make sure a white person is taken alive even if they are killing people and threatening the lives of others  including the police themselves  that kind of patience is not even remotely shown towards an unarmed black person when police show up  they re just shot and killed for no reason and that is precisely why there are protests in our streets  and sadly  why five dallas police officers are dead this morning  those officers should not be dead  and all the unarmed black people who have been unjustly murdered by police should not be dead either  all of this could have been prevented had police simply treated black people the same way they treat white people  just doing that alone would mean more people would be alive today featured image  screenshot
