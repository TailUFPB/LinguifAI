it s a pretty well known fact among those who use their brains to make rational decisions that both donald trump and ted cruz are equally repugnant  but for different reasons  and some of the same reasons   they are both extremely bad choices for the united states  and neither should ever set foot in the oval office  both are war hawks  both are anti immigrant  which is ironic considering ted cruz is and immigrant and so is trump s wife  and both men don t have any real plans to put in place that would actually be good for the nation trump is a bully with zero experience  and cruz is a smarmy salesman with the bare minimum of experience  so  when watching a trump supporter confront ted cruz in indiana  it wasn t exactly a meeting of the minds  it was cruz going after trump  and trump s supporter shouting short bursts of propaganda that have been continuously repeated by the trump campaign the video is extremely awkward to watch  but at the same time you can t look away  it truly is that much of a disaster my favorite line from the whole skirmish is when cruz says  with all respect  donald trump is deceiving you  playing you for a chump  it s funny  because it s true  but also ironic  since cruz is also playing everyone for a fool as well  cruz s remarks were met with a bunch of random  lyin  ted  shouts from the trump minion  along with  indiana don t want you  and  where is your goldman sachs jacket   clearly unaware he s supporting a big money tycoon himself here s a quick highlight from the unsettling confrontation   tedcruz asks  realdonaldtrump supporter to name  thing he likes about trump  debates  https   t co  https   t co   cbs news   cbsnews  may    if you really want to watch the whole thing  you can check out the near nine minutes here all in all  it makes for great tv  but it s horrifying that this is what the republican party has come down to  no matter who  vote blue featured image via video screen capture
