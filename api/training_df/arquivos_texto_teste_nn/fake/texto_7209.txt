republicans were handed a harsh reminder of how our country s judicial system works when the supreme court deadlocked in a   tie over a crucial union dues ruling  the court s non ruling serves only to affirm the lower court ruling that teachers who enjoy union benefits are required to pay union dues the case involves public employee unions only  an increasingly sharp thorn in the sides of republican governors embroiled in battles over  right to work  laws  which translate to  right to fire people for trying to organize   this ruling  or lack thereof  strikes a serious blow to republican lawmakers looking to scrape money from education and public works budgets to give to their corporate cronies as rewards for doing business in their states contibuting to their campaigns that s the immediate result of a   tie that probably would have happened anyway  since it s unlikely that a nominee would have been confirmed this quickly  but it highlights the kinds of issues that not just republicans but all americans will face as the branch of government given constitutional authority to decide in all cases of equity and law sits broken that s just about where the silver lining on this particular cloud ends  while the case was almost certain to fail had scalia not passed away  the absence of a definitive ruling on the matter also means an absence of precedence  had the ruling come before a full court with a new liberal or even centrist judge like merrick garland on the bench  the lower court s decision on the matter could have been affirmed and erased all right to work laws under the  amendment  the u s  supreme court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers  school bus drivers  cafeteria workers  higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession   said national education association president lily eskelsen garc a  the court  unsure if they will see a  justice any time soon  hasn t called for the case to be re heard featured image via getty images
