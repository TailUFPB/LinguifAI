democratic senator dianne feinstein told a federal judicial nominee on wednesday that reading her past speeches revealed how the catholic  dogma lives loudly  within her  we kid you not  she was downright nasty to notre dame law school professor amy coney barrett watch  sen  feinstein to appeals court nominee amy barrett   notredame law prof  catholic mother of    the dogma lives loudly within you   pic twitter com mpdgnzgrsa  jason calvi   jasoncalvi  september    feinstein is a ranking member on the judiciary committee  she got really nasty during a confirmation hearing for  barrett  when you read your speeches  the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you  and that s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for  for years in this country  barrett had already stated at the beginning of the hearing that it is  never appropriate for a judge to apply their personal convictions  whether it derives from faith or personal conviction  is there a trend to block trump nominees by targeting their religion this line of questioning is disturbing and isn t the first time recently that a senator has berated a nominee for his religion in june  bernie sanders got really nasty and snarky with nominee russell vought   voight was president trump s nominee for deputy director of the office of management and budget  just like barrett  voight had written about his christian faith and was drilled by a relentless sanders bernie sanders decided to go after the religion of a nominee for deputy director of the office of management and budget this was a vicious attack on russell vought who has strong christian beliefs that have absolutely nothing to do with what he was being questioned about  religious beliefs aren t budgetary concerns  this was a personal attack on a devoutly religious man who had written an article years past defending his christian college part of the exchange between sanders and vought sanders is quoting from an article that vought wrote   muslims do not simply have a deficient theology  they do not know god because they have rejected jesus christ  his son  and they stand condemned   do you believe that that statement is islamophobic vought  absolutely not  senator  i m a christian  and i believe in a christian set of principles based on my faith sanders  forgive me  we just don t have a lot of time  do you believe people in the muslim religion stand condemned  is that your view vought  again  senator  i m a christian  and i wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at wheaton college sanders  i understand that  i don t know how many muslims there are in america  maybe a couple million  are you suggesting that these people stand condemned  what about jews  do they stand condemned too vought  senator  i m a christian sanders  i understand you are a christian  but this country  made of people who are not just i understand that christianity is the majority religion  but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world  in your judgment  do you think that people who are not christians are going to be condemned vought  thank you for probing on that question  as a christian  i believe that all individuals are made in the image of god and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs  i believe that as a christian that s how i should treat all individuals sanders  do you think that s respectful of other religions i would simply say  mr  chairman  that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about  i will vote  no  can the us government impose religious tests for public office the constitution says the u s  government can t impose religious tests for public office  but scholars say sen  bernie sanders can without consequence apply his own religious rubric in opposing a presidential nominee who believes non christians risk going to hell the vermont independent  who is jewish but  not particularly religious   grilled russell vought  nominee to be deputy director of the office of management and budget  on wednesday  focusing on an article he wrote that said muslims  do not know god because they have rejected jesus christ his son  and they stand condemned  sanders asked if that view was islamophobic  and if jews also stand condemned vought responded that he is a christian   in your judgment  do you think that people who are not christians are going to be condemned   sanders asked  vought began to answer before sanders interrupted  asking if that viewpoint was  respectful of other religions  national review columnist david french writes that sanders was  imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of article vi of the united states constitution  and that he was objecting to  entirely orthodox christian beliefs  about access to heaven constitutional scholars say sanders  who said he will vote against vought  may violate the spirit of the constitution  but arguably not article vi  which states   no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states  no senator should vote against a nominee based on his or her religion  it would violate the spirit if not the letter of the constitution  but senators can vote against nominees for any reason or no reason at all  there would be no legal consequence  and the nominee would have no forum for complaint  allan vestal of drake university law school says the constitution s religious test ban  does not provide a mechanism for inquiring into the motivations of individual senators and representatives in the votes they cast  there is no constitutional constraint on yea or nay votes  so yes he can do it   agrees richard epstein  a new york university law professor so now trump nominees will all be attacked for their religion  this is really dangerous territory read more  us news
