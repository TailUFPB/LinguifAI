ever since donald trump s rallies have become violent dumpster fires with a heavy neo nazi and white supremacist presence  his campaign has tried to paint the protesters as secret bernie sanders supporters engaging in a conspiracy to make the candidate look bad  they argue that any person  say  seen giving the nazi salute while wearing a trump t shirt is a bernie  operative  secretly antagonizing people to get a reaction  they have exactly one example of this and it was debunked within a matter of minutes according to donald trump s son  the aptly named donald trump jr   as well as trump supporters like ann coulter and james woods  a woman whose nazi salute at a trump rally went viral is a bernie sanders supporter named portia boulger  they immediately sent out tweets naming her as the  nazi  and accusing her of being a paid stooge image via wcmh tvthe problem  the woman in the picture only held a passing resemblance to boulger  the photographer who took the picture identified the subject as another woman  birgitt peterson  and boulger wasn t even near the chicago trump rally the photo was taken at  it wasn t her despite this massive screw up  and the sheer awfulness of telling millions of people that an innocent woman is a nazi  trump jr  not only didn t apologize  he never even corrected his original tweet  for days  trump fans sent the picture around the internet  working themselves into a frenzy over this bernie sanders  operative  who was undermining their candidate  a lack of apology isn t surprising for followers of the trump campaign the blowhard republican frontrunner has built his entire platform on the shaky premise that he can never be wrong  he s infallible  and that he s  tough  enough to never take back anything he ever says  likewise  his cronies like ann coulter and james woods  also make a habit of smearing innocent people and never bothering to find out if the information they pass along is true  however  there is one way to get a trump to listen to you  money boulger announced that she was demanding a public apology for the smear campaign against her or she would file a lawsuit against trump jr boulger says even though it s been proven the composite photo wasn t of her  she doesn t feel safe  she believes she was targeted and intimidated because of her support for bernie sanders now she wants an apology  no one should be able to threaten me or make me feel uncomfortable for exercising the freedoms that i have by living in the united states of america   she says boulger says her attorney is negotiating with trump s to get that apology  she says she wants it via twitter it apparently worked  in the greatest irony in history  the trump family   known for their lawsuit threats   got played by a woman threatening a lawsuit  poetic justice trump jr  gave her the tweet that she wanted  announcing to his followers that he had screwed up and that the photo of the nazi salute was  in fact  one of his dad s fans and not of boulger hilariously  trump jr  s fans praised him for his  integrity  for having the guts to apologize  they didn t seem to acknowledge the very real defamation lawsuit he would have faced if he didn t  how s that for integrity featured image via  ethan miller getty images
