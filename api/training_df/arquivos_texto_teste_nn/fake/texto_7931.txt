there seems to be a definite double standard when it comes to how republicans in congress want to go about investigating terrible governors  when it came to investigating former oregon governor john kitzhaber  d   republicans like rep  jason chaffetz  r ut  were fast and furious with their requests to obtain the information they wanted in regards to a scandal surrounding oregon s health insurance exchange  however  when it comes to going after republican governor rick snyder of michigan over the horrendous flint water crisis  those same republicans so adamant at going after a democratic governor  failed to send requests to investigate flint rep  elijah cummings  d md  is not about to let them get away with this hypocrisy whatsoever in a letter sent by cummings to chaffetz  who is the chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform  cummings points out the clear double standard of the committee going after kitzhaber  but not snyder in the same regard  and while cummings does give them some credit for called snyder before the committee in march  it is clear that they are not going after snyder with the same vigor  cummings wrote  during our meeting last week  you explained that you had spoken directly with governor snyder  and you suggested that one reason not to request documents from him is because he might claim that his communications about the flint water crisis are protected by executive privilege  although i was not a part of your conversation with governor snyder  any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the governor s own promises of accountability to the people of michigan  cummings also wrote  i believe that the committee should apply the same standards for requesting documents to all governors  regardless of whether they are democrats or republicans  by declining to send any document request at all to governor snyder  the committee is creating the perception of a double standard in which it has requested documents from a democratic governor  but not from a republican governor  he then goes on to give the example of former oregon governor john kitzhaber it is simply woefully irresponsible to so blatantly neglect going after gov  snyder  especially considering the flint  michigan water crisis is so irreversibly severe causing lifelong health issues to those affected  not only should they be investigating snyder to the fullest extent  but they should be pushing for his resignation  as is what happened with kitzhaber cummings sums it up best when he states  the committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation  and we should not do so now  governor snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision making process that led to the poisoning of flint residents  and the committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation  snyder needs to be held responsible and party politics need to be checked at the door  end of story featured image via youtube
