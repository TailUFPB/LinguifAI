donald trump has cleared the republican presidential field of all the credible  and not so credible  challengers  and is now the presumptive nominee for the same party that produced teddy roosevelt  abraham lincoln  and ronald reagan  it is amazing but in picking trump as their nominee  the republican party has chosen a candidate with a binder full of negatives  so many negatives in fact that it is highly unlikely he can overcome enough of them to win the presidency here are  of the reasons  percent of women in a recent gallup poll have a negative view of donald trump  that s because trump has a long record   including in this campaign   of attacking women  he s called them pigs  talked about their bathroom habits  complained about their periods  and on and on women are the majority of american voters  and republicans have lost that demographic for years  even when they have won the presidency  they ve lost with women and while it isn t all she is  hillary clinton will obviously be the first major party nominee to be a woman  so far  trump has not reacted well to this  accusing her of playing  the woman card   with her candidacy  a sexist comment that echoed with millions of working women voters  the clinton campaign was able to raise over   million just by highlighting trump s comment and giving donors a  woman card  to mark the moment mitt romney was pilloried over his comment that he had  binders full  of women  and he never was half as sexist as trump has been on an average day donald trump is most unpopular candidate for a major political party basically since polling was invented  trump has an average of   percent disapproval that is unheard of going into the party conventions  where candidates are usually a blank canvas before attack ads start to fly in the fall  but trump is one of the most well known people in america  and what america has seen   it doesn t like president obama nearly coasted to national electoral victories in back to back elections with a diverse  young  electorate  and while hillary clinton has had trouble connecting with younger voters in the democratic primary  donald trump is the best positioned candidate to motivate the obama coalition against him he polls poorly with women  minorities  and in a recent poll younger voters indicated that despite their reservations about clinton  they have near to no interest in trump at this point in the  election  president obama was   percent ahead of mitt romney in head to head national matchups  by comparison  clinton leads trump by an average of   percent  and that includes a poll from conservative pollster rasmussen who got the  election completely wrong most other recent polls show clinton with leads of        and    the new york times  nate cohn explains why this is unlikely to change much there have been  point shifts over the general election season before  even if it s uncommon  but there isn t much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as mr  trump and mrs  clinton  a majority of americans may not like her  but they say they re scared of him  to have a chance  he ll need to change that unlike president george w  bush in   president obama is unlikely to be a drag on the ticket  in addition to the unusual image of a sitting president campaigning for his party s nominee  reagan was too ill to do it in   the gore campaign pushed clinton away in   and mccain did his best to hide from bush in    president obama s approval ratings have inched back up over the last year  often above or near  percent additionally  the unemployment rate is at  percent  after hitting almost  percent in the bush economy  and gas prices have come way down  polls now show americans feel good about the economy  after obama s policies have gotten the country out of the great recession  without republican help  that s good for the party in power  which means it s good for hillary clinton  and bad for donald trump featured image via flickr
