it s being dubbed the  rare boycott that actually worked   in today s age of endless cycles of outrage and amnesia  rush limbaugh probably assumed that listeners would forget and forgive after  in a fit of characteristic rage  the conservative radio host called a georgetown law student sandra fluke a  slut  on air  for the crime of using birth control  no less   instead  it may have finally cost limbaugh his job it s been four years since limbaugh lashed out at fluke  but the damage is finally being felt  for one thing  his show   which is still a go to source of batshit crazy   has been dropped by an ever growing list of advertisers and affiliates who  understandably  have no interest in being associated with limbaugh s sickening brand nor care about appealing to his vicious  toxic listener  making matters worse  limbaugh s   million a year contract is expiring and as negotiations begin  suddenly the thought of paying a man tens of millions of dollars a year to call a college student a slut doesn t seem like such a good investment much of this is due to david brock and his liberal watchdog organization  media matters for america  according to politico  the company has spent over    on organizing the limbaugh boycott that may finally take him down the anti limbaugh faction came up with the social media friendly slogan  flush rush   the group s efforts met considerable success in the months that followed  dozens of companies  including netflix  jcpenney and sears  announced they would boycott limbaugh s show  most have yet to return  and the increasing popularity of platforms like twitter  which can be used to stoke outrage and promote boycotts  makes it highly unlikely they ever will the sandra fluke incident  did a lot of harm to talk radio   darryl parks says   thirty eight percent of revenue disappeared overnight   and the damage was not limited to limbaugh  he hurt all of talk radio  including even some liberal hosts  certain programs michael savage  for example  and in an earlier era  bob grant had always been considered  toxic  by some advertisers  but after the fluke incident  entire stations or indeed  the entire format of talk radio were deemed no go zones by blue chip brands compare this boycott to those frequently half heartedly kicked off by the right and it s easy to see why the outcome was different  unlike  say  the attempt to boycott starbucks because they made their holiday cups red  the  flush rush  boycott is on firm moral ground  what limbaugh did  and continues to do  to the people who happen to catch his ire is pathetic and wrong  while the color of a coffee cup might be  controversial  to some  listening to limbaugh label a young woman a slut because she doesn t want to get pregnant is deeply repugnant regardless of your political leanings featured image via youtube
