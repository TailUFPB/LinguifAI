in a facebook post on wednesday  mitt romney discussed the fact that donald trump has vowed that he won t release his tax returns before the election  romney insists that trump must have a  bombshell  in his tax returns and that they might reveal something really nefarious and  disqualifying  this statement was in response to the bombshell trump dropped on voters on wednesday  in which he said he wouldn t release them  trump has previously said that he would release his tax returns once the irs is done auditing them  this claim is bizarre on its face  here s trump during a debate talking about the alleged audit tax experts are dubious an audit by itself would not prevent trump from releasing his tax returns  said david cay johnston  a pulitzer prize winning tax author  it is up to an individual whether to disclose his or her tax return to the public  a lender or anyone else who wants to see it audits are rare  overall  fewer than   of all individual returns are audited  although the rate is closer to   for tax filers with incomes over   million  the irs says it expects to conduct   million individual audits this year  the lowest level in  years source  cnn moneythe irs agrees  federal privacy rules prohibit the irs from discussing individual tax matters  nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information   the irs said in a statement released to nbc news source  nbc news originally  the speculation was that trump s tax returns would show that he s worth far less than his claim of   billion  or whatever he s saying today   but apparently romney feels that it could be something much  much worse  and that trump might have ties to the mob  of course  that s not a huge leap to make  especially since trump is in the construction business and in the casino business  both industries are known for mob connections  that doesn t mean he has the mob connections  or more importantly  that he benefits from the mob connections  but it s not surprising that romney could draw that conclusion the irony  though  is that the tables have done a complete  from  to now  four years ago  romney hadn t yet released his tax returns and it was trump calling for transparency  here s romney being asked about his tax returns trump did eventually endorse the multi millionaire  but not after saying this about romney s tax returns i think mitt was hurt really very badly by this whole thing with the income tax returns  i believe he should have given them april   but i didn t think going into a little bit of detail without going into a lot of detail was positive thing  he ll come back  he has proven to be very resilient guy  he has been hurt a number of times by number of different things  he comes back  he really seems to be very tough and resilient  you have to hand it to him source  fox newsit s somewhat surprising that trump won t release his tax returns  he has famously said that he could shoot someone from the middle of fifth avenue and his followers would still love him  sadly  that s probably true  a few billion less on his tax return can t make a difference  right  it s doubtful that even mob connections could damage him politically  even white supremacist connections make his followers say  meh   it could be that trump s tax returns have something much worse  for him  they could point to illegal activity  this could be mob related  or it could be something else featured image via ethan miller  getty images
