in the closing days before the iowa caucus  the very first primary of the  election  ted cruz is having a bit of a panic moment  having enjoyed high polls in iowa for months  his disastrous last debate performance and general unlikability have him falling fast  in his desperation to win  his campaign decided to try to lie and shame voters into showing up for him   and absolutely nobody is happy about it this week  iowans began waking up to find a scary looking note in their mail  on yellow paper made to look like a ticket  the letter reads  voting violation  and creepily names the homeowner and their neighbors  the instructions are even more pathetic you are recieving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area  your individual voting history as well as your neighbors  are public record  their scores are published below  and many of them will see your score as well  caucus on monday to improve your score and please encourage your neighbors to caucus as well  a follow up notice may be issued following monday s caucuses in other words  cruz s campaign is trying to scare unknowing iowans into voting  preferably for him  by threatening to make them look bad in front of their community  what s more  cruz s name only appears in small print at the top of the envelope  and no where on the  ticket  at all   it would be easy to open this up and see  voting violation  blaring at you in read and think you were actually in trouble how scummy is this tactic  so scummy  in fact  that one of cruz s biggest endorsers actually swore cruz would never do something as low as this  he didn t know it at the time  but cruz s campaign had already confirmed that it had  yes  they really are that desperate it now appears that cruz s underhanded tactics have even caught the eye of iowa s state government   and they weren t amused  iowa s republican secretary of state  paul pate  released a statement strongly rebuking cruz s campaign for trying to pull something like this  he has a personal beef with it too  because cruz s campaign   in all of its hubris   decided to name his office in the mailer  it implied that iowa s state government was complicit  today i was shown a piece of literature from the cruz for president campaign that misrepresents the role of my office  and worse  misrepresents iowa election law  accusing citizens of iowa of a  voting violation  based on iowa caucus participation  or lack thereof  is false representation of an official act  there is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting  any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and i believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the iowa caucuses  it is  of course  important in a democracy that people vote   ironically  cruz has been instrumental in preventing people from voting  but only the ones he doesn t like   however  there are any number of reasons why a person would have a  low score  in these ridiculous fliers and still have contributed to the voting process  some may have been out of state residents who vote by mail  others may have simply decided to not participate in a republican primary in which all candidates don t seem to represent their values  in any case  it s not up to ted cruz and his desperate campaign to shame a person for not doing what he would like  worse  making it appear as if the mail recipient is in violation of a law  can make people even more fearful of the voting process cruz s campaign has long been built on lies and smears  but it s becoming clear that in his frenzy to catch up with donald trump  he s lost all sense of perspective feature image via jamelle bouie flickr
