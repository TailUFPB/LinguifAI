when the story broke on wednesday about donald trump saying women should be punished for getting an abortion  i was  honestly  confused by the outrage  people were talking like no one has ever been so far off the deep end  as if punishing women for having an abortion wasn t a central pillar of republican ideology  all i could think was   but that s what republicans have been trying to do for years  why are people shocked  apparently  i m not the only person to have noticed that planned parenthood executive vice president dawn laguens said presidential candidate donald trump had exposed the real views of many republicans  a plan to punish women who seek abortion in this country is not news  it s actually the republican party platform  they re horrified to have been outed for what they do every day  which is punish women who seek abortions  to back laws that tell doctors they must lie to women  to work to shut down clinics  to ban certain procedures that doctors say are important for women s safety and health   she said thursday morning during an appearance on cnn   i mean  all of these things  that s what their agenda is day in and day out  they do punish women  yeah  pretty much  but it s worse than that  republicans have proposed laws that would make it legal to kill abortion providers  they ve criminalized pregnancy in several states which has resulting in a growing trend of women being arrested for miscarrying  the idea of punishing women is not at all a new idea for republicans  laguens is exactly right when she says the problem other republicans have is that trump is saying it out loud this has been the main objection to trump from the gop the entire time  he s not sophisticated enough to use dog whistles or anything resembling subtlety  he just says what republicans actually think and want without the veil of respectability they ve built  while it excites a base that s tired of being unable to wear their racism on their sleeve  or their pointy white hood   it s made moderate republicans and independents recoil in disgust as long as trump continues to expose the core of republican ideology to the world  he s an enormous threat to their agenda and he s primed to not just lose in november  but lose big keep up the good work  donald featured image via getty
