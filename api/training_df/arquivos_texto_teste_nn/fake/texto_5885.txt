pope francis  while appearing at the united nation s world food summit  slammed the united states  and the rest of the world  over its obsession with guns after the terrorist attack in orlando left  people dead and another  wounded  calling the obsession brazen   the pope chided world leaders for their  strange paradox  over the politics of food and international aid  but not guns it makes no difference where arms come from   they circulate with brazen and virtually absolute freedom in many parts of the world the pope also chastised the world for numbing itself to people s pain  saying  we are bombarded by so many images that we see pain  but do not touch it  we hear weeping  but do not comfort it  we see thirst but do not satisfy it  hours after the brutal attack  the holy see released a strongly worded condemnation of the attacks  calling his  homicidal folly  and denouncing those responsible the terrible massacre that has taken place in orlando  with its dreadfully high number of innocent victims  has caused in pope francis  and in all of us  the deepest feelings of horror and condemnation  of pain and turmoil before this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred   we all hope that ways may be found  as soon as possible  to effectively identify and contrast the causes of such terrible and absurd violence which so deeply upsets the desire for peace of the american people and of the whole of humanity the condemnation is exactly what the united states deserves  especially when some right wing politicians  the same one who do nothing about gun violence  proclaim that we are a christian nation  but how can we claim to be when we allow ourselves to become so numb to the epidemic that is gun violence perhaps the faux christians should listen to the pope  yet again  and lead by example featured image via flickr
