it s memorial day weekend so  along with last week being fleet week in new york city  the tonight show with jimmy fallon had to come up with something to celebrate all those troops being in town  fallon s tribute  a song called   i ve got friends on all bases   which he and adam sandler sang to an audience full of service men and women from all five branches of the military fallon began the song with  well i ll tell you the truth  i love all the troops  protectin  the land  sea and air  sandler chimed in with  now you re back in town  keepin  us safe and sound  from that crazy ass elmo in times square  they both sang that they have friends  from the navy  up to the air force aces  the army greens  coast guard and marines   being absolutely certain to include everyone in their comedic piece of music  it s especially fitting since we still have lots of troops in the middle east  and may send a lot more there  and everywhere else  if donald trump gets elected in november but while the song itself was amusing  to say the least   it was the troops  reaction to the song that was the real treat of the evening  watch below  via the tonight show with jimmy fallon  i ve got friends on all bases  is a parody of garth brooks   i ve got friends in low places   which fallon and sandler clearly had a lot of fun with  however  it s a good bet that their audience of soldiers had even more fun than they did featured image via screen capture from embedded video
