never has a movie role so perfectly described a person as stacey dash s character in  clueless  describes her  dash  the newest token multi racial person hired by fox news  was asked for her opinion on the current controversy over the lack of minority representation at the academy awards and the oscar boycott by prominent black actors and directors working for fox news means you have to be a total sellout  and dash is no exception  it s clear that the only reason she s being asked her opinion on the issue is to persuade the  year old white men who dominate the network s demographics to believe that racism has in fact been cured in america  and here s a black woman who proves it dash goes on a tirade about the difference between segregation and integration  asserting that the only reason america sees any racism or segregation at all is because bet and the essence awards exist  she takes it one step further into absurdity by declaring we shouldn t have black history month these are all the typical arguments of institutional racism  of course  and fox must be awfully proud to be able to drop a woman of color in a chair opposite steve doocey to declare such myth as fact  the arguments are so transparent and weak  if white people had their own network  black people would lose their minds  white television dominates the networks  from the major players right down to field and stream tv  where the only black person you ll see is during a commercial break for black people to hold their own awards show is reverse racism  have you considered that there s a possibility that black people feel as though they re excluded from oh  say the oscars  it s pretty obvious that all those poor white actors who are discriminated against by the jerks at bet have a show or two they can clearly call their own the most ludicrous is dash s contention that black history month is somehow promoting segregation  yes  february   the shortest month of the year  mind you    is set aside to honor the contributions of african americans  to racists and clueless idiots like stacey dash  that somehow gives fox news hosts license to proclaim an unfair advantage to the black community  which is perhaps the most laughable sentiment of all time  april is autism awareness month  are we somehow discriminating against people with down s syndrome by prioritizing autism for  days  how about march  march is women s history month  are we being disrespectful to half of the population because we decide to celebrate the achievements of women it s ludicrous  where s the outrage over italian american heritage month  how about polish american heritage month  why are they not on the radar for a good shellacking at fox news i think we all know why  racism is not an issue america has solved  not by a longshot watch stacey dash make the standard arguments of institutional racism below https   www facebook com andrewramostv videos  featured image via screen capture
