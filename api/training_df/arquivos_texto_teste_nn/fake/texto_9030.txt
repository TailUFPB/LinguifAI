it s the beginning of the new year  and the iowa caucus is about a month away  with it comes some big time pandering from the presidential candidates scurrying to gather up as many votes as possible  a big win in iowa could mean the difference between gaining momentum for the remainder of the race  proving the legitimacy of your candidacy to voters everywhere  or just plain calling it quits  for some  it s iowa or bust  carly fiorina is one of those people so  with that  it s probably no surprise that carly fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal   poll numbers  get a load of this  though  she tweeted on friday that she wanted the iowa hawkeyes to beat her alma mater stanford during the rose bowl pic via twitter how stupid does she think iowa voters are  in any case  not only did it not work  but it ended up backfiring on her   twitter absolutely roasted her for it   even though most of the world already knew she had no backbone and is fake as you know what  this just further proves it pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter pic via twitter those tweets aren t even the half of it  all it took was eleven simple words  and all pandemonium broke out  a natural explanation would be that people just like picking on politicians  but the truth is carly brought this on herself  you should never root against your own alma mater to pander to votes  never  ever  ever  ever  people would actually have more respect for you if you stuck to your guns  people aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them  at least  we certainly would hope not we have more faith in the american people than that  even though  quite honestly  it s pretty low now given how people like donald trump can lead in the polls  we ll give you that much   all this proves is that carly thinks republicans in iowa are dumb enough to fall for something like this  and  as much as we d like to disprove it  we simply don t have any evidence that they re any smarter featured image via flickr
