trevor noah brilliantly unmasked donald trump as a fascist  and everyone needs to see it on monday night  the daily show host began by talking about hillary clinton trouncing bernie sanders in south carolina over the weekend and briefly mentioned that super tuesday is upon us but for all of those who are tired of democracy  noah introduced fascism as an alternative noah explained to the audience that he has heard the word his entire life but he  didn t really know what it was   so he looked it up and discovered some of the traits of fascism including  a cult of action  celebrating aggressive masculinity  fear of outsiders  intense nationalism  intolerance of criticism  and resentment of national humiliation  as it turns out  donald trump embodies all of these and all we have to do is listen to him talk to know that it s true noah then played various clips of trump demonstrating each of these traits one by one  afterwards  noah let out a nervous laugh as the audience seemed to be in complete disbelief about what they just heard and witnessed  an actual american presidential candidate really did just spout stuff out of the fascist playbook before their eyes  i m shitting myself   noah said   it all lines up so perfectly  doesn t it  it almost stops being funny as you re watching it  it s funny for me because i have a back up plan country   noah quipped before telling the audience that they can rest easy because they are invited to live in south africa if trump does become president noah also pointed out that trump retweeted a quote said by fascist italian dictator benito mussolini  which you can view below      it is better to live one day as a lion than  years as a sheep      realdonaldtrump  makeamericagreatagain  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    first  noah conceded that perhaps trump didn t know that it was a mussolini quote  but it soon became clear that trump knows exactly who mussolini is and proceeded to stand by the tweet during an interview with chuck todd on nbc  trump even awkwardly paused after being asked if he wants to be associated with a fascist noah also noted that another trait of fascism includes a deep hatred of journalists  and then he played a clip of trump vowing to make it possible to sue the media over negative stories about candidates  which noah pointed out would mean he could be sued for informing everyone that  donald trump wants to bang his daughter  and then it was time to mention trump s endorsement by kkk leader david duke  after playing footage from trump s interview with jake tapper on cnn in which he claimed to  not know anything about  duke  noah and the daily show team dug up a clip from  years ago of trump calling duke a bigot and racist that people don t want in their party  the irony is i think there s a lot of republicans saying that now  too   noah concluded here s the video via comedy central this was a brilliant segment by noah and the daily show team  but they did miss a few traits  fascists also disrespect women  and we all know donald trump has done that repeated during this campaign  furthermore  fascists are obsessed with christianity and corporate power  and donald trump isn t exactly the only republican who flirts openly with fascism  it s basically part of the gop s dna at this point to read more about fascism  click here  featured image via screenshot
