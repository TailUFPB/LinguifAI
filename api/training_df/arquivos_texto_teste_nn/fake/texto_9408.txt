in one of his regular appearances on the imus in the morning radio show  dan rather was asked by imus in   if he had any idea why nbc news was sitting on the story about the rape charges against bill clinton by juanita broaddrick    rather responded that the reason they were  sitting on the story  was  pretty obvious   first  rather clarified that they don t call to tell him why or why not they choose to hide a story from their news channel  but suggested   i think it s pretty obvious that they re nervous about  number one  whether this information is accurate  whether it s really true or not  and number two  even if it does turn out to be true  it happened a long time ago  and number three  they ve got to be figuring that maybe  just maybe the american public has heard all that they want to hear about it and they re saying   next   let s move on to the next thing  imus went on to say that he read an article in either the leftist propaganda newsweek or time magazine that  even the woman herself  juanita broaddrick said she hoped that this thing went away this week  and even she was sick of hearing about it   and it s her story   dan rather then busted out in laughter and agreed  saying   well let s hope she gets her way with that   more laughter imus then revealed that  someone from nbc news told me that she wasn t clear about when exactly this thing happened  but then her son called me and he s an attorney someplace  in  i guess in arkansas  and he wanted me to know  why he called me god knows  but he wanted me to know that that was not the case  that she knows exactly what it was  and there was some other reason they were sitting on it  instead of responding to imus  comments  rather deflected by making an embarrassing play to stroke imus  ego and distract him from the reason nbc hiding the clinton rape story  rather continued   but i just don t know if this is going anywhere  you know  i d have to bet for the moment that it isn t  the washington post gave it a pretty good ride on saturday  and there wasn t much pick up from it  so unless there s some new and sensational information developed out of it  my guess is that it probably dribbles away
