some people have a passion for writing or for music and the arts  others make sure they stand up for human rights for all and or the impacts of climate change on our global economy  then there are the folks who you already thought were creepy and just became a lot more creepy when you find out that they re  obsessed  with murder and the death penalty enter  republican presidential candidate sen  ted cruz while it was thought that cruz took a particular interest in the death penalty because his mentor s father was killed by a carjacker  he also obsessed over the details  as a supreme court clerk he was preoccupied with the details of murders  many say so that he could push for the death penalty  and while some were impressed that his passion was deep for this form of justice  others felt very differently according to the new york times  other clerks  however  had a less admiring view of his interest  in interviews with nearly two dozen of mr  cruz s former colleagues on the court  many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices  but also several from conservative chambers  depicted mr  cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment  some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges  in cruz s own words within his book  a time for truth   he wrote  i believe in the death penalty   and he thought it was his job to  describe the brutal nature of the crime   because  liberal clerks would typically omit the facts  it was harder to jump on the moral high horse in defense of a depraved killer  his obsession with the death penalty derived from his passion for conservative judge j  michael luttig  and came through the death of luttig s father  the new york times describes their relationship as such  judge luttig engendered enormous loyalty from his clerks  who sat behind him as he wrote multiple drafts of an opinion over  hour days  but the ideological and intellectual connection between mr  cruz and mr  luttig also had an emotional element  the emotional element was intensified by cruz s reaction to the murder of luttig s father via carjacking  a carjacker who was  in fact  executed in  for his crimes cruz brought his passion to the supreme court when he began his clerkship for chief supreme court justice at the time  william rehnquist  it was there that he schmoozed his way through and got his feet wet in the world of national politics  his ardor for the death penalty continued and according to the ny times  mr  cruz usually reserved his enthusiasm for his unsparing death penalty memos or the late nights when a prisoner from the appeals circuit under chief justice rehnquist s oversight was slated for execution  on those nights  when he was responsible for addressing the flurry of  hour motions from defense lawyers  he would rouse the chief justice at home  give his recommendation  get the chief justice s vote and then write up a memo that explained why the chief justice had voted to deny an emergency postponement of the execution  one would think  as the supposed christian that cruz says he is  he would err on the side of compassion and responsibility to ethics and reasonable doubt instead of pushing so hard for people to die  after all  according to the bible  jesus was killed via the death penalty his passion for the death penalty is one that may show more than just his supposed love for justice  but rather about his character  it s odd  to say the least  concerning  to be brutally honest  is this the sort of person the united states needs as a commander in chief  one that is so eager to rush to judgment and push for people to be killed in some form of vengeful act  it truly explains his fervor for war and  carpet bombing  the middle east to make the islamic state  glow in the dark  to answer those questions  no  we don t need that sort of unstable person in office making critical decisions about foreign policy and national security  it wouldn t only be devastating for the nation  but for the entire world featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
