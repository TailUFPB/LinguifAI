blowing himself up so he s clean when he enters heaven  traditionally  muslims purify corpses by washing the skin and nails and sometimes by shaving the pubic hair  but suicide attackers are deprived of a proper burial since there are usually no remains  to compensate  the attackers shear themselves ahead of time  both to guarantee some level of cleanliness at the time of instant incineration and to prove extreme devotion to personal purity  some scholars offer an alternative explanation  they believe that suicide terrorists adopted the no hair practice from the pashtun tribesmen of afghanistan  who shave their bodies before going into battle hair removal is mentioned in islamic law as a method of maintaining personal hygiene  in addition to nail clipping  the sunnah instructs muslim men and women to shave or trim pubic hair regularly and to remove underarm hair  men must also clip their mustaches  in some circumstances  muslims are encouraged to shave their heads  for example  al bukhari  a ninth century muslim scholar who spent years collecting hadith  quotes the prophet as saying  may allah bless those who shaved  during the hajj  pilgrimage   and the quran states that  ye shall enter the sacred mosque  if allah wills  with minds secure  heads shaved  hair cut short  and without fear  here are the facts we know from texas leo and fbi press conference
