this is truly shocking  roy moore takes a commanding lead in the alabama senatorial race as the allegations against him by the left and the rino republicans collapse  check this out yesterday  the spread between the two leading candidates was  today  it s     while the internal polling for the moore campaign had the spread at  points  it s looking really great for a moore win in alabama new witnesses refute the accuser s story the witnesses say they ve shared the information with news outlets but to no one s surprise  the outlets refused to run the story  the employees who came forward offered details about the restaurant that refute the claims by the accuser  the calls for the arrest of allred for the crime of forgery are getting louder  see the interesting discrepancies with the yearbook below roy moore s campaign sent the following in a press release gadsden  ala    on monday evening  the moore campaign unveiled statements from key witnesses that completely bust the story of beverly nelson and gloria allred and further reveal an unconscionable bias on the part of state and national press to hide the truth from alabama voters who will undoubtedly see through the  fake news  and elect judge moore for the man that they have always known him to be rhonda ledbetter  a retired public school teacher who is currently the senior choir director at a baptist church and teaches children at a local  church sponsored day care center  was a waitress at olde hickory house for almost three years from    she was a college student at jacksonville state university at the time and worked varying shifts at different times of day  multiple days a week during the time of her employment  she said in a statement   when i heard beverly nelson s story  there were several details that were different from what i remember  i was nervous at coming forward because of all the attention this story has gotten  but as a moral and ethical person i had to speak up about what i know to be true  i was a waitress at olde hickory for almost three years from    and i never saw roy moore come in to the restaurant  not one time  and i would have noticed because most of our customers weren t wearing suits  especially not at night  many customers worked at goodyear next door and would stop in on their way to and from work  and i don t remember anyone from the courthouse coming in at all  that just wasn t our crowd    a few things stuck out to me  first  nelson said she was  years old when she started working there but you had to be   i don t remember her from my time there  and i don t remember any  year olds working there at all  second  nelson said the restaurant closed at  p m  but i know the earliest it closed was   though i believe it was midnight  i m certain of that because goodyear employees came in to eat after their shift ended at   p m   so there s no way we would have closed at that time  third  the area wasn t dark and isolated as she described  rather  the building was right off the busy four lane highway and people and cars were always around  the restaurant had a wrap around porch  like the ones at cracker barrel restaurants  and there were lights all around the sides of the building  so it wasn t dark and anyone in the parking lot was visible from the road  fourth  the dumpsters were to the side of the building  not around back and there sure wasn t room to park in between the building and the dumpsters  people from the kitchen would take trash out of the side door and throw it right into the dumpsters  we were always told to park on the side of the building  because there just wasn t much room behind it  i don t remember there being an exit from the back of the parking lot  there would barely have been enough room to turn a car around  i came forward because from what i ve seen  the media is only interested in reporting one side of this story  in fact  dixon hayes from wrbc in birmingham asked for former employees to contact him but never responded when i told him i never saw roy moore come into olde hickory house during the three years i worked for  two other news outlets in the state asked to interview me and i agreed  but neither one has aired my interview and i have to wonder why they don t think the people of alabama deserve to hear anything that counteracts the accusations against judge moore  it s not for me to say whether or not something happened  i can only tell the truth about factual details that i know for sure  i think all alabamians deserve to have all of the facts so they can decide for themselves what the truth is  despite what the national media and people in dc might say  alabama voters are intelligent and have common sense  we don t need anyone to tell us how to vote or to explain to us what really happened  we will make that decision and i just wanted to do my part in sharing the truth on some of these important facts  i  like all alabama voters  want any and all information that can shed light on the truth  johnny belyeu  sr  is a former police officer with over two decades of experience with the etowah county sheriff s department and the gadsden police department  he said in a statement   i was an officer with the etowah county sheriff s department in the  which means i worked in the courthouse and knew who roy moore was since he was the deputy district attorney at the time  i was a regular customer at olde hickory house  and i never once saw judge moore come in there  if he had i would have immediately recognized him  i also never met beverly nelson during any of the many times i frequented the restaurant  and i can t say that she even worked there  renee schivera of huntsville  alabama stated   i was a waitress at the olde hickory house during the summer of   before my senior year of high school  when i heard beverly nelson s story the first thing that stuck out to me was that i don t remember roy moore ever coming into the restaurant  i also don t remember her working there  the other thing that struck me as odd is that from my best recollection  the dumpsters were to the side of the building  i just know they were visible from the road  and not back behind the building  but the main thing is that if someone came in almost every night we knew who there were  and i never saw roy moore there  as a christian woman  i wouldn t lie for anyone and i am only sharing what i know because it s the truth  the days of unbiased reporting are over   moore campaign strategist  brett doster said   the liberal media will dodge any source and refuse to air any interview that doesn t square with their effort to land a liberal democrat in the senate seat  the moore campaign is committed to presenting factual truth to the people of alabama and looks forward to victory on december    the moore campaign unveiled statements from key witnesses that completely bust the story of beverly nelson and gloria allred and further reveal an unconscionable bias on the part of state and national press to hide the truth from alabama voters    alsen pic twitter com   judge roy moore   mooresenate  november    moore tweeted about the yearbook that lawyer for accuser won t turn over good morning  alabama day  of new york attorney gloria allred s refusal to turn over her fake yearbook for third party examination  alsen  judge roy moore   mooresenate  november    to arrest allred gloria allred is in some hot water over her effort to stop candidate moore with salacious allegations and very flimsy evidence  the moore campaign offered to have a handwriting analysis on the yearbook the accuser said he signed but allred hasn t offered the yearbook up yet  the two things that came up about the signing of the yearbook are that it s in two different colors of ink and moore was not a da the year of the signing  the moore signature says   roy moore da  swamp creatures like mitch mcconnell should be called out along with the washington post and other political operatives  mitch mcconnell should be ashamed of his dirty politics against moore this is backfiring on him big time
