donald trump got his ass handed to him by a texas treasure while many  including myself  focused on elizabeth warren and bernie sanders at the democratic national convention on monday  eva longoria delivered a smackdown of donald trump we all missed the actress  who is of mexican american heritage  took aim at the republican nominee for his racist attacks against latinos  particularly mexicans  whom trump called  rapists  and  criminals  like many of you  this election is very personal to me   longoria said during her speech   i m from a small town in south texas and if you know your history  texas used to be part of mexico  now  i m ninth generation american  my family never crossed a border  the border crossed us  according to pbs the longoria family s roots in texas run back to a time before texas even existed  lorenzo longoria  eva s first ancestor to arrive in the new world  sailed from spain in   through the generations  lorenzo s descendants moved north to the modern us mexico border  in   pedro longoria  eva s  great grandfather  received almost  acres along the rio grande in a land grant from the king of spain  this land stayed in the family for over a century  enduring even the influx of anglo settlers in the aftermath of the civil war in short  eva longoria s family has been in america far longer than donald trump s  his grandfather frederick trump immigrated to this country in   longoria s family could have retreated south to stay in mexico if they had wanted to do so  but they chose to stay in america and that is where their allegiance has stayed ever since speaking of trump  longoria dedicated the next part of her speech to ripping him a new one for insulting just about everyone  when donald trump calls us criminals and rapists  he s insulting american families  my father is not a criminal or rapist  in fact  he s a united states veteran  when trump cruelly mocked a disabled reporter  he was also mocking my special needs sister lisa and many like her  when he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing  he not only insulted me  he insulted my mother who worked as a special education teacher for  years and raised four children while being a wife  here s the video via youtube that s right  donald trump characterizes a man who fought for this country as a  criminal  even though he himself dodged the draft during the vietnam war  pathetic has anyone else noticed that donald trump is getting his ass handed to him on a regular basis by a lot of strong women  because if that trend continues it means he s going to have a seriously bad day on election day featured image via screenshot
