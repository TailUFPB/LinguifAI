after being embarrassed on live television saturday night when john dickerson fact checked his lie about supreme court history  ted cruz showed no shame as he repeated the same line on sunday the gop debate started off on saturday night with dickerson asked cruz about whether or not president obama should be able to name a successor to supreme court justice antonin scalia  who died earlier that day cruz claimed that a supreme court nominee named by a lame duck president has not been confirmed by the senate in  years  dickerson  however  pointed out that former president ronald reagan s nomination of justice anthony kennedy to the bench in  was confirmed by the senate in   the final year of reagan s presidency  thus  dickerson caught cruz lying  which stunned the candidate into silence as the crowd booed the moderator for bringing up pesky facts during an appearance on abc s this week  the texas senator told george stephanopoulos the very same lie and then blamed democrats as the reason why kennedy was only confirmed in   claiming that it would never have happened if they had just automatically confirmed universally despised nominee robert bork instead of rejecting him and his extremism  george  the senate has not confirmed a nominee that was named in the final year  an election year  in  years  this is a lame duck president  and  by the way  the only reason anthony kennedy was nominated that late is that democrats in the senate had gone after and defeated two previous nominees  robert bork  which set a new standard for partisan attacks on a nominee  and doug ginsburg  so it was the democrats that had dragged it out for many months to make it that late  and right now  the court is exquisitely balanced  the fact is  however  that there is a process to supreme court nominations and confirmations  many presidents have had their nominees rejected by the senate  so it s not like reagan was the first to have a nominee fail to be confirmed  the bottom line is that cruz is still wrong on his supreme court history but cruz wasn t done  upon being asked if he would filibuster anyone president obama nominates to fill scalia s seat  cruz replied  absolutely   and said that the people should decide who fills the seat by electing the next president  this should be a decision for the people  george  we ve got an election  and  you know  democrats   i cannot wait to stand on that stage with hillary clinton or with bernie sanders and take the case to the people  what vision of the supreme court do you want  let the election decide it  if the democrats want to replace this nominee  they need to win the election  here s the video via abc  abc breaking news   latest news videosthis is a particularly hard argument to make since americans elected president obama for a full four year second term in  by five million votes  president obama has nearly a full year left in office  so it is absolutely absurd  not to mention an admission that republican will refuse to do their constitutional duty  to suggest that president obama should force america to wait a full year or more before the supreme court is functioning with a full nine member bench again  president obama earned the right to nominate a supreme court justice when he won the  election  ted cruz and his republican comrades need to get over it and do their damn jobs  featured image via video screen capture
