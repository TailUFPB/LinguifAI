the center for biological diversity just announced that they have won a major lawsuit against the bureau of ocean energy management  the lawsuit was settled in the u s  district court in los angeles  the lawsuit will put a moratorium on fracking that is occurring off the coast of california  it may have future importance in determining the fate of off shore fracking in the gulf coast  this halt to offshore fracking is a huge victory for california s coastal environment   said kristen monsell  a center attorney   offshore fracking is a dirty and dangerous practice that has absolutely no place in our ocean  the federal government certainly has no right to give the oil industry free rein to frack offshore at will  a lot of attention has been paid to the fracking that is going on in people s backyards  that s under stable  anyone who has seen the infamous fire faucet from gasland  or heard about the increased number of earthquakes fracking related activity is causing  should be concerned about their back yard  be that as it may  there has been a huge boom in offshore fracking that is putting north america s coasts in danger  until now  america s coast has been a virtual free for all for the fracking industry the fracking industry has permission from the federal government to dump  billion gallons of waste water from fracking operations into the ocean  that wastewater comes from their  oil platforms that are found off the coast of california  that waste water contains chemicals from the fracking process  unfortunately  most of the chemicals commonly used in fracking process are considered  trade secrets  making it so that the public is not able to find out what chemicals are being used  every offshore frack puts coastal communities and marine wildlife at risk from dangerous chemicals or another devastating oil spill   monsell said   once federal officials take a hard look at the dangers  they ll have to conclude that offshore fracking is far too big of a gamble with our oceans  life support systems  they ll have to stop authorizing it for good  it might be a bit optimistic to say that settlement will lead to a complete end to federal authorization of offshore fracking  however  the new requirements that the fracking industry will have to go through in order to get authorization are substantial  this is a major paperwrench to the fracking industry  that will in the very least delay new offshore fracking operations featured image credit  by ken lund   via wikimedia commons
