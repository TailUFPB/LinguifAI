as they say  desperate times call for desperate measures  and as all the right wing lunatics of the republican party seem to be drifting towards donald trump  ted cruz knew what he had to do   go full right wing lunatic himself after president obama announced his common sense executive actions for gun reform and a safer america  many republicans were outraged  after all  fewer guns in the hands of the mentally ill means fewer massacres  which in turns means people won t be as scared and in turn go out and buy stockpiles of unnecessary firearms  republicans  bought and paid for by the gun lobby  want to make sure people stay scared and have as many guns as possible well  senator ted cruz  doing all he can to fear monger his base of voters too stupid to realize they re being manipulated  decided he would have some fun with photoshop and scare people into supporting him  he sent out this to entice people via tedcruz orgor from a mobile device  via tedcruz orgmind you  president obama said nothing of taking guns from anyone  or wanting anyone s guns  he s done nothing to  in any way  go against the second amendment which calls for citizens to be well regulated  obama is simply trying to make sure existing laws are followed and the wrong people don t have access to buy firearms now  unless these right wingers are terrified that they are going to be labeled the ones who are mentally ill  none of this effects them whatsoever  in fact  it strengthens the second amendment and the rights of law abiding gun owners however  cruz  knowing his supporters are paranoid idiots  is preying on this fear for support and sends them an image of a militarized president obama with the very false and simplistic phrase   obama wants your guns   perfectly catering to the fear these simple minded  myopic voters have we could say   shame on you  to ted cruz for doing this  but to his credit  this sort of fear mongering  albeit utterly inaccurate and unethical  works for republican politicians  they have perfectly wrapped up the terrified conspiracy theorist vote  and this imagery play perfectly into that narrative that being said  shame on you  cruz  this is just pathetic featured image  tedcruz org flickr
