pope francis has once again infuriated conservatives after he washed and kissed the feet of christian  muslim  and hindu   but most importantly muslim   refugess on thursday  in the ceremonial re enactment of the foot washing ritual jesus performed on his disciples before he was crucified  the pope again broke from the tradition of simply washing the feet of twelve catholic men in   francis washed the feet of women and muslims at a juvenile detention center   a violation of longstanding rules he changed in january to allow all  people of god  to participate in the ritual  this shift from the patriarichal norm was not well received by the american right  but this year the pope did something that sent conservatives into an irrational rage  to the pope  who recognizes that christians  jews  and muslims all worship the same god  this means anyone could be chosen to participate in the ritual this year  four women and eight men participated  the women included an italian catholic and three eritrean coptic christian migrants  the men included four catholics from nigeria and three muslims from mali  syria  and pakistan  and a hindu man from india  if this broad mix wasn t enough to cause the right to seethe with hatred  the pope s words helped ensure it would happen that s the sort of claim that has been known to get a muslim woman removed from teaching at a christian university  right there  it s a completely sensible statement   allah  is simply the arabic translation of the word  god   unfortunately  combined with the fact that francis performed an expression of humility with regard to muslims caused the right to flip the f ck out  conservatives flocked to the washington post s facebook page to unleash their anger  frustration  and stupidity            there are manufacturers  arms dealers who want blood  not peace  they want the war  not fraternity   the pope said after condemning the brussels attack in statements prior to the ceremony  you  we  all of us together  of different religions  different cultures  but children of the same father  brothers   and there  those poor people  who buy weapons to wreck fraternity  today  at this time  when i do the same act of jesus washing the feet of twelve of you  let us all make a gesture of brotherhood  and let us all say   we are different  we are different  we have different cultures and religions  but we are brothers and we want to live in peace    he added   a message of unity that has been warmly embraced by all who do not believe that hatred is the way to go about living  but has managed to somehow irritate conservatives watch this deeply humble action  below featured image via screengrab
