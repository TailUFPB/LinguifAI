native new yorker and republican front runner donald trump made his first ever visit to the   memorial and museum on saturday afternoon  and ended up p ssing everyone off in the process with his third wife melania at his side  the business mogul took a  minute tour through the museum  making the press wait outside for him to finish  while trump might have enjoyed his little run through of the museum  not everyone was happy about it   and many of them took to social media  o blast him for it one instagram user  joshandew  posted a photo of the candidate and captioned it   ugh a trump sighting in nyc    notrump  instagramtwitter also blew up with insults directed at the gop candidate  many bringing up the fact that trump has been the most anti muslim candidate  and criticizing him for using the museum visit as a campaign stunt twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwitterthis tweet  in particular  nailed trump s fake personality so well twitternothing that trump does is genuine  or without some sort of benefit in it for him  in the years between the opening of the museum and the start of his campaign  trump was apparently too busy to pay his respects to the thousands of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks   even though he himself said that he  lost hundreds of friends  at the world trade center but now because he s running for president  trump is suddenly making it a priority to seem more appreciative of  new york values  than his rival ted cruz  who recently offended new yorkers  it s obvious that blasting cruz was part of trump s plan all along when you read the end of this statement from trump s campaign this statement comes just a day after trump blasted cruz at a rally  saying  remember when he started lecturing me on new york values like we re no good  we all know people who died  and i ve got this guy standing over there looking at me and talking to me about  new york values  with scorn on his face  with hatred of new york  trump had also made a    donation to the museum  which never received a cent from trump s charitable foundation before he was running for president  actually  there isn t one   related nonprofit group that trump made a contribution to until now  despite the fact that trump feels so passionately about the rescue workers and survivors of the terror attacks  trump doesn t give a damn about the victims  survivors or families affected by     he only cares about making himself look better  featured image via josh andew instagram
