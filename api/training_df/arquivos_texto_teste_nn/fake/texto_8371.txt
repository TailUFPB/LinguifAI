after republican presidential candidate donald trump suffered a truly embarrassing second place loss to rival ted cruz in iowa  the internet was quick to humble the usually overly confident front runner on tuesday morning  the website loser com joined those trolling trump by hilariously redirecting its domain name to trump s wikipedia page   clearly rubbing it in considering trump had been especially cocky about winning the iowa caucus for several months trump s wikipedia pagebrian connelly has been the domain s owner since  and has routinely been using it to mock whoever happens to deserve it based on current events in the news  this particular redirect  as almost anyone with half a mind would agree  was certainly well earned licking his wounds  trump was also busy on the internet on tuesday  he went into recovery mode by spending his entire morning reaming and blaming voters for his loss in iowa  shaming both voters and media alike  trump tweeted  i don t believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign  the only one  i will keep doing  but not worth it  the media has not covered my long shot great finish in iowa fairly  brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history  in all honesty  trump s loss to cruz was so much celebrated by the internet and social media  that one of trump s own tweets from  was repurposed for an entirely appropriate revival trump twitterand brilliantly enough  one other website has joined in the redirecting fun after the caucus  the website nobodyrememberswhocameinsecond com is now leading people to a particularly unflattering youtube video of trump this devastating loss in iowa has definitely had an effect on trump  now moving onto the new hampshire primary  trump s previously unshakeable confidence seems to be somewhat deflated  clearly missing half the ego he used to speak with  trump said  i think we re going to be proclaiming victory  i hope  featured image via gage skidmore
