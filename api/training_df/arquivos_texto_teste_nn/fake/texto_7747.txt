last night  hillary clinton won the democratic nomination  yes yes yes feel the bern  debbie wasserman schultz is evil  superdelegates are unfair  hillary must have cheated  etc  etc  etc  aside from all of that  it s clear clinton has kept the obama coalition more or less intact and that s going to land her the nomination  without the support of the black community and non millennial voters  bernie s path to victory is extremely narrow and that s before you factor in the superdelegates  if you don t believe me  then you should believe nate silver s fivethirtyeight com  which has been the gold standard in political statistical analysis for the last several years so sanders should just quit and go home  right  good lord  no  even though he s losing the primaries  he s winning the debate and the democratic party still needs him  badly love him or kind of like him  no one really hates him on the left   sanders is correct when he says the democratic party is a little too cozy with big money  the problem is that while the corporate media loves loves to pretend that democrats are just as far to the left as the gop is to the right  that s total bullshit  the democratic party is comfortably to the left on social issues but center left  and just barely  when it comes to economics  this is a serious issue when it comes to making the necessary compromises with republicans to get anything done  any middle ground sits squarely to the right  which  of course  was the entire point of republicans go so far to the fringe in the first place  what bernie does  and does brilliantly  is drag the entire process to the left   and the democratic party with him  he ll never say it out loud  of course  but bernie never really intended to win the primaries  his entire campaign is designed to influence politics on the left  this is heresy to the bernie true believers but let s be honest  bernie has kept the democratic party at arm s length for decades  constantly poking at them like a gadfly  winning the superdelegates necessary to win the nomination was never an achievable goal and he s not even trying  why  because winning the election was not the goal  showing the democratic party that they can openly embrace democratic socialism and not be immediately burned at the stake was and it s working  very very well in case you haven t noticed  bernie sanders openly advocating socialism has not sent the country into shock  the corporate media keeps trying  poorly  to attack sanders over this but he s so persistent and consistent with his message that the media s you re a commie   nonsense is getting drowned out  on top of that  the negative connotations of socialism are completely lost on millennials  aka  the group of people that will be controlling politics in a decade or so bernie will continue to fight tooth and nail for every state he can because the higher his delegate count  the stronger his message is despite the lead clinton has and will continue to hold even without the superdelegates  when he concedes sometime in the summer  and he s got the war chest to go that far with ease   he will urge his followers to support clinton and the democratic party but to continue to hold their feet to the fire  clinton will have campaigned further to the left that she would have normally and for long enough that moving too far back to the center in the general election will hurt more than help like obama  sanders is playing a long game  he may not even be around to see the seeds he s planted take root but as long as he pulls hillary and democratic politics to the left  and he has   he s already won even if he s not the nominee featured image courtesy of michael vadon via wikimedia commons
