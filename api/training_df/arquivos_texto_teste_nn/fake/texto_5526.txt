during a press conference in spain sunday morning  president obama spoke out against  overgeneralizations  that some people are making towards police officers  at the same time  obama praised the first amendment and the right to protest  this follows the shooting in dallas  texas last week that claimed the lives of five police officers he urged those involved with the anti brutality and criminal justice reform movement to extend an olive branch to those who might be allies  president obama then went on to say that the black lives matter movement is a part of a  long tradition  of positive change in the united states  if we paint police in broad brush  without recognizing the vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people and do so fairly and without racial bias  if our rhetoric doesn t not recognize that then we re going to lose allies in the reform cause   he explained   in a movement like black lives matter  there are always going to be people who say things that are stupid or are imprudent or are overgeneralized or are harsh   obama continued  saying  and that is sometimes messy and controversial  but because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech  america overtime has gotten better  president obama then went on to admonish those who are blaming protestors and others within the black lives matter movement for the shooting  and i don t think that you can hold well meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest  but i think the overwhelming majority of people that are involved in the black lives matter movement  what they really want to see is a better relationship between the police and the community so that they can feel that it s serving them  president obama has decided to cut short his trip in spain in order to return to the united states  he will be in dallas sometime this week where he will speak out against violence and propose policies to combat the  persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system  according to a statement you can watch president obama speak at the press conference below featured image from video screenshot
