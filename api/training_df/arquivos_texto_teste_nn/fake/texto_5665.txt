donald trump s campaign might be close to broke  and he might be doing highly illegal things to try and keep it afloat  but evidence has also been mounting that he s using this election as a means of profit  the   million worth of debt the campaign has is apparently personal loans he made  and he can convert them to donations  effectively wiping out the campaign s debt he d have to file paperwork with the fec  though  and so far  that hasn t happened  nbc wasn t able to get much out of his campaign about this  with spokesperson hope hicks saying they re going to file it with the next scheduled fec report  she had originally said that they were going to file it last week until that paperwork is filed  though  this is another way for him to line his pockets with pieces of silver  while that loan is still a loan  he can use new campaign donations to reimburse himself  the law gives him until august to do this  so he can milk this for all it s worth and nobody can do a thing about it trumplestiltskin is such an upstanding candidate gop donors are squirrelly about this because they want assurances that their money isn t going into trump s personal coffers  the problem is  until he files that paperwork  there can t be any assurances  and his royal crookedness will find other ways of funneling those donations to his not inconsiderable bank accounts anyway earlier this week  usa today  which seems to have made it their mission to scrutinize every single thing trump does  reported that just two percent of the gop donors that supported mitt romney four years ago have contributed to trump in any way  some blame his late start in courting gop donors  but the truth is  many of them are just too hesitant to give money to him all he has to do is file a signed statement and reflect the change in accounting on his next filing  it s not like it s that hard  trump s campaign said that this was a done deal and yet  it isn t  why wouldn t they just tell the truth from the get go  and say that they ll do it with the next monthly filing  instead of a special statement  the answer s pretty clear  given what trump has been doing with his businesses and his campaign finances  he s in it for the profit  and he will profit in any way he can featured image by drew angerer getty images
