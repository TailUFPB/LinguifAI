donald trump ignited a firestorm on wednesday when he told msnbc s chris matthew s that abortion should be banned and women should be punished for having them  when he realized that people were flipping their lids  he backtracked and said he meant doctors should be punished  now his campaign spokeswoman  katrina pierson  is adding to the controversy after she yelled at cnn anchor alisyn camerota thursday morning for repeating trump s words   verbatim during the interview  pierson became visibly angry when camerota asked her about trump wanting to ban abortions  she told the host that her boss  never called for a ban on abortion   actually  he did  several times during his interview with msnbc  and camerota pointed that out by repeating his exact words  he said   i would ban it   katrina  you are mincing words here  pierson responded  this is a misspeak  alisyn  no alisyn  there was a misspeak here  and you have a presidential candidate that clarified the record  not once  but twice  although he did  clarify  his abortion position  his clarification was just as   confusing  first  he said it should be up to the state  then he said at this point pierson completely lost it  cutting the host off  she shouted  no  they weren t confusing  because the first thing was about a ban  that s correct and that s correct  it should be down to the states because that s what the potential ban was talking about  unfazed by her anger  the cnn host continued to repeat trump s words back to her  demolishing her  it was about the states  talking point  she also muses that it is a  window  into trump s mind and asks the spokeswoman if he has even bothered to sit down with policy advisors and discuss this issue  after about a minute of back and forth with the cnn host refusing to let pierson glass over the fact that he said women should be punished if they terminate a pregnancy  the trump puppet repeated  it was a misspeak  how many times do i have to say that  this was a complete misspeak during a conversation over a hypothetical concept and there was a clarification issue  here s the problem with this  it was a misspeak  nonsense  trump has obviously never considered the ramifications of his  pro life  stance and matthews shone a glaring light on that  the entire point of the question was to see whether or not the blustering  tough guy  had actually sat down and laid out a concrete agenda on the issue of women s rights  his response showed that he clearly has not  furthermore  trump and his people can say that he isfurthermore  trump and his people can say that he is pro life all they want  but nobody actually believes that  he did not just change his mind this year  he has always been pro choice  but he isn t saying that because he wants to appease the right wing s base  it s actually pretty ironic  someone who puts on this big show of not caring what other people think and refusing  to be politically correct  is too afraid to stand up for his own beliefs  and if he can t do that for himself  what makes republicans think he could do it for the country watch the interview below  featured image via video screenshot
