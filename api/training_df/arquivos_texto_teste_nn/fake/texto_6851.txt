when running for president of the united states it s important to remember that you can t get anything you want to get done accomplished alone  having great ideas means nothing if you don t have a congress to back you up  that s why it s so incredibly important to make sure that we not only get a democrat in the white house  but also turn the senate and house of representatives blue with that in mind  there is really only one candidate running for president on the democratic ticket that is taking this into account  and that person is hillary clinton  while sanders is clearly out raising clinton in small donations  which is amazing in and of itself  in the first quarter alone of   hillary has brought in   million for the democratic national committee and state democratic parties to make sure democrats win across the board knowing how important it is to have a democratic congress to get anything done is actor activist philanthropist george clooney  he fully recognizes that bernie sanders has it right that we need to get big money out of politics  but that he has it wrong when it comes to doing little to support down ticket candidates  only recently has sanders begun raising money for congressional candidates  and only for those who have endorsed him on meet the press  clooney told host chuck todd why it s so important to also raise money for down ticket democratic races  it s going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back congress  and the reason that s important  and the reason it s important to me  is because we need   i m a democrat  so if you re a republican  you re going to disagree  but we need to take the senate back  clooney also made the very important point of noting that we need to take back congress so that we can actually get a supreme court justice who will help overturn citizens united and get big money out of politics  so while yes  he did agree with sanders that we need to get big money out  it s not going to happen unless there is support of democrats nationwide  including monetarily  keep in mind  clooney remarks that what sanders has to say is very important  including that he really likes the vermont senator  and if he were to get the nomination he will do whatever he can to get him elected  but as for now  he s supporting hillary party strength is  quite literally  everything  without it  you have nothing  you have a mighty platform to say things  but no means to get anything done  those who seek to divide the democratic party don t realize how dreadfully horrific their unintended consequences will be  that sort of myopic thinking  while in an ideal world would make no difference  it very clearly does in modern day politics  and it s not about to change overnight kudos to clooney for making this point be clearly known  and also for voting blue no matter who here s the video featured photo by kevin winter getty images
