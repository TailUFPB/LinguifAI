elizabeth warren is a strong advocate for justice on behalf of regular americans  particularly when it comes to financial issues  she often speaks passionately about ideas she feels very strongly about  but she rarely gets visibly pissed off  however  one particular republican stooge managed to accomplish that feat  as you will see in the video below senator warren was speaking during a hearing that was intended to discuss covering the  costs  to banks if they were regulated  in an effort to prevent them from completely imploding the american economy again  republicans produced a  star witness  leonard chanin  who is one of the people most responsible for the  financial crisis  to testify that banks should not have regulations places on them  as you may have already figured out  that was a bad idea  senator warren pointed out how his personal inaction  as well as that of the rest of the federal reserve  basically guaranteed a financial crisis mr  chanin  as sen  brown mentioned from  to  you held top positions in the federal reserve s division of consumer and community affairs  and in those positions you had both the legal authority and the legal responsibility to regulate deceptive mortgages  including dangerous subprime lending that sparked the  financial crisis  but you didn t do it  despite years of calls and even begging from consumer advocates and others asking you to act  instead  you did essentially nothing according to the dallas fed  that crisis cost the american economy an estimated   trillion  it cost millions of families their homes  their jobs  their savings  it devastated communities across america republicans simply do not give a sh t about how much it costs regular americans to allow banks to literally rob the entire middle class of everything they own  this was a point that was slammed directly in the face of chanin so when you talk now about how certain regulations are too costly or too difficult to comply with  you sound a lot like you did before the  crisis when you failed to act  so my question is  given your track record at the fed  why should anyone take you seriously now as if the severe embarrassment that she just laid on him personally was not enough  chanin went on to try to lie to senator warren s face  followed by refusing to answer even the most basic questions from her afterwards  that s when it all went wrong for the republicans  star witness  if the guy keeps his job after this embarrassment it ll be shocking watch what happens when you lie to elizabeth warren below featured image via video screen capture
