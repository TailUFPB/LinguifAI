in response to her male gop colleague s insistence that women s reproductive decisions be ridiculously regulated  a female kentucky lawmaker is fighting back democratic state rep  mary lou marzian is sick and tired of republicans attacking abortion rights in her state and she isn t taking it anymore  so she introduced bill   which would require men to seek permission slips from their wives and present the note to their doctor in order to get access to viagra  a little blue pill that gives men boners and that s not all  in addition to the note  men must also put their hand on a bible at the doctor s office and swear an oath that they are married and are only using the viagra so they can have sex only with their wives  that means  family values  conservative lawmakers would have to promise the lord that they want to have sex with their wives and not that pretty intern they ve been perving on for weeks sorry  republicans  not kidding  the bill literally requires a  man to make a sworn statement with his hand on a bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse  i want to protect these men from themselves   marzian told the courier journal about the legislation   this is about family values  she knows what she is talking about  too  marzian is a trained nurse so if she says this is about protecting men s health  then it must be taken seriously of course  republicans will never take this kind of legislation seriously until a women dominated legislature is in place ready to show men what it feels like to have their bodies and privacy attacked this isn t the first time a female lawmaker has fought fire with fire  many have introduced the same kind of bill in states across the country  including ohio state senator nina turner back in   her bill would have required men to visit a sex therapist  undergo a cardiac stress test  and get their sexual partner to sign a notarized affidavit confirming impotency in order to get a prescription for viagra and like turner s bill  marzian s bill is a direct response to an extreme anti abortion bill  senate bill   which kentucky republicans actually passed  forces women to obtain  informed consent  from a counselor  hours prior to getting an abortion  do we really want a bunch or legislators interfering in private  personal  medical decisions   marzian asked only male lawmakers do apparently  as long as the interference is in the private  personal  and medical decisions of women and not men featured image  tim reckmann wikimedia
