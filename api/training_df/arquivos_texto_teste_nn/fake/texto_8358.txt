on tuesday  lewis black appeared on comedy central s the nightly show to hype his abc special  madoff  but made sure to take the time to be his lovable  crotchety self  black says that the most surprising news that arose out of the iowa caucuses was that ben carson seemingly left all of his clothes in florida and had to fly home to get them  what s surprising is that ben carson flew from iowa to florida to get a change of clothes   black said   that kind of leads into the other thing   that someone really that batsh t crazy could score  percent in iowa  though black agreed with the rest of the panel that marco rubio poses the most severe threat to hillary clinton  but black questioned his ability to actually be president  noting that much of his time in office would be  on the job training  as with barack obama   but host larry wilmore disagreed  noting that republicans  racist opposition to every single one of the president s initiatives played a bigger role in stifling any progress obama may have attempted to make  it was absolutely that  but also it was dealing with   it s the same position of a guy who s in the senate who hasn t been in the senate long enough   but when wilmore pointed out that ted cruz  whose daughter recently snubbed him as he attempted to orchestrate a warm family moment for the cameras  had a similar background to rubio  it was on  black pointed out that both trump and cruz are bullies  but cruz is far too creepy to be recognized as just as big a bully as donald trump  here s what rubio s problem is right now   both trump and cruz are both bullies  so i think that they re going to kind of punch him  what i really find interesting about cruz  after everything else  is that people don t seem to have noticed that he is a bully  trump is an obvious bully  cruz is the bully who acts weird  and he s acting weird all the time  and so you end up doing what the weird guy wants you to do so he ll stop acting weird  trump is such an amazing overbearing asshole that we can t see how creepy cruz is   wilmore added  with black noting that there s a  touch of ferret  in cruz s family cruz is remembered as the creepy guy in school  his former college roommate  craig mazin  is almost addicted to telling people about it on twitter  noting that the presidential hopeful leaves behind a greasy film on whatever he touches  they even had a nickname for it    cruhz   he was also fond of hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe for reasons we would rather not imagine of course  it could be said that trump is creepy  as well  with his numerous remarks about how he wants to sleep with his daughter   and the insanely unsettling ways they pose for photographs  so cruz does have some competition in that department  at least cruz can say  completely honestly  that he doesn t want to sleep with his little girl watch black lay the smack down  below the nightly show with larry wilmore get more  the nightly show full episodes the nightly show on facebook the nightly show video archivefeatured image via screengrab
