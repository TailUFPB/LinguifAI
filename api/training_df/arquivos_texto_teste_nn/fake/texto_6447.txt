north carolina republicans should have listened when they were told there would be a backlash if they passed   now they are learning the consequences of being bigots as soon as the anti lgbt bill was jammed through the state legislature and signed by governor pat mccrory  outrage ensued corporations such as paypal and deusche bank cancelled projects that would have meant new jobs  entertainers cancelled concerts that would have boosted local economies  conventions were cancelled  has become the last straw for many north carolina voters  ever since republicans took control of the state government for the first time since   they have let the power go to their heads by passing every wet dream piece of legislation conservatives have ever wanted in just the last six years  republicans have used their power to turn a state that had been traditionally moderate into one of the reddest states in the nation  the list is incredibly embarrassing  but it includes looser gun laws  highly restrictive and insulting anti abortion laws  attempts to turn north carolina into a declared christian state  a war on food stamps  voter suppression laws  education funding cuts  and tax cuts for the wealthy perhaps no other state has been transformed as much or as fast as north carolina  but that s exactly what happened once republicans gained control  and north carolina has paid a heavy price  the progress it has made since the civil war and jim crow is being erased as conservatives take the state backwards but voters are now fed up  especially since they are now facing terrible repercussions from a single law that demonstrates once and for all that republicans are not the  small government  advocates they claim to be  along with being ridiculed for trying to be the bedroom police  republicans are now being slammed for trying to be the bathroom police it also doesn t help that they passed this law on a lie by claiming that it was needed to protect women and children from being sexually assaulted in bathrooms  as it turns out  the only men who have gone into a women s restroom were actually sent in there by a conservative  christian  group as a stunt in order to scare people when  in fact  there have been zero real instances of transgender people doing anything but using the facilities  in  states and over  cities that have transgender protections  there hasn t been a single instance of a person using the protections as a shield to excuse preying on women and children in bathrooms  a fact that even governor mccrory was forced to acknowledge during an interview with fox host chris wallace on sunday and now north carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding and perhaps more as tax dollars are spent by republicans in their effort to defend their bigotry in court all of this has put targets on the backs of every republican in the state legislature and state senate as well as governor pat mccrory  voters are angry and if republicans continue to defend  they will be fired in november and replaced with lawmakers who are not insane bigots republicans are already beginning to panic over the prospect of losing power for another  years  the reality is that  hurts   gop state rep  charles jeter told politico   it doesn t matter that i m opposed to it or that i ve called for its repeal   because the mailer to voters  is going to say that i was a part of the republican majority that passed the most discriminatory bill in the state   is going to have reverberations for our party no matter what we do  in november and probably beyond that  a republican strategist surmised that the gop could very well lose in november over the passage of   the question that will be answered in november is whether the republicans in the general assembly overplayed their hand  after feeling empowered by impressive gains in the last three election cycles  republicans could lose their veto proof majority in one or both  chambers  with a cloud of uncertainty surrounding the governor s race  and one republican even compared what could happen to republicans in november to the devastating  midterm election when conservatives successfully vilified democrats over the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  it s like obamacare with obama  which so defined everything about democrats who were in office when it passed in   and you saw what happened to them in   i think you always have concerns if perception boils down to one thing equaling another  in short  political doom is looming over the heads of republicans across north carolina and let s hope voters keep the gop from having power for at least another  years  after all  it could take that long to fix what republicans broke featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
