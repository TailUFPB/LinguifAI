if texas lt  governor dan patrick  r  thought he was going to get away with being a completely transphobic jerk regarding transgender students using the bathroom  he thought wrong after president obama announced that any public school that refused to let a transgender student use a restroom consistent with their identity would run the risk of losing federal funding  lt  gov  patrick lost his damn mind  he went so far as to say  i believe that it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in america since prayer was taken out of public schools   has put a policy in place that will divide the country  not along political lines  but along family values and school districts  he says he s going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy  well in texas  he can keep his  pieces of silver  we will not yield to blackmail from the president of the united states  yes  folks  he s that much of a bigot  letting transgender individuals pee in the appropriate bathroom has nothing to do with  family values  and everything to do with just letting a person pee  however  many republicans like to label anything that gives them the heebies jeebies as going against their  values   so this really shouldn t come as a surprise  they likely used to say the same stuff back when black people wanted to use the same bathrooms as white people  these people are bigots and they re not afraid to make sure everyone knows it  coded language and all well  the white house heard what patrick had to say about president obama s directive  and hit back  hard  white house press secretary josh earnest said  well i think this does underscore the risk of electing a right wing radio host to elected statewide office  patrick  of course  is also known as being a very far right conservative talk show host before being elected as lt  governor earnest also said  this is not an enforcement action  this is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and in some cases  even parents  who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge and the challenge here is not to isolate anybody  it s not to discriminate against anybody  it s not to make anybody unsafe  it s actually to ensure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can possibly be  he added that many schools would  welcome this guidance and implement it  in the year   you d think there wouldn t still be such backward  myopic thinking that can t embrace life outside a bubble of what one might think a person should be  however  there is  and because there is  the white house is very open to a dialogue to address concerns  after all  most bigotry and discrimination is the result of lack of knowledge and understanding dan patrick is being dan patrick  a man who likes to hear himself speak and doesn t seem to care who he hurts along the way  if he thinks the president asking schools to be inclusive and allow students to choose the bathroom of their gender identity at risk of losing funding is blackmail  then he s clearly a bigot who doesn t want to comply good on the white house for smacking his clear bigotry down featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
