sounds like they should call themselves the brownshirts  because that s what this group basically is at donald trump rallies across the nation  his supporters have committed violence against protesters with little or no restraint   or consequences for that matter one rally in north carolina last week alone saw two black men get physically assaulted by racist white guys who clearly didn t care if they were being filmed or not  but they attacked their victims anyway despite not being provoked to do so  they didn t do it in self defense  but out of hatred and entitlement rallies in st  louis and chicago have nearly sparked race wars between white racists and protesters  and trump has even led his supporters in a pledge that included the nazi salute trump claims that his rallies are not violent and that no one has ever been injured at one of his events so  it really comes as no surprise at all that a group of trump supporters are actually forming a militia to beat up protesters who they claim are  far left agitators  and the real culprits committing violent acts a group on twitter called  lion s guard   described themselves as  an informal civilian organization dedicated to protecting the safety and security of innocent  peaceful trump supporters from violent far left agitators  the group then tweeted out an invitation to other trump supporters who would like to  forcefully protect  rallies and referred to themselves as the real victims of beatings and violence  do you want to provide security protection to innocent people who are subject to harassment and assault by far left agitators  if so  you are welcome to join  that s the mission   to protect innocents who can t hire their own security guards  we are unarmed but willing to forcefully protect people if need be  we are  defensive    protective  of innocents who are being beaten and harassed for their political views  and then the page was taken down after the page owner received a threat  but they promised to create a website to coordinate actions the group takes here s a screenshot of the twitter page via rt image via rtagain  this group sounds like wannabe members of the brownshirts who served adolf hitler during his rise to power in germany  whose primary purpose was to provide protection for nazi rallies and assemblies from those they deemed socialists and communists  at one such assembly in november   hitler s brownshirt friends ejected hecklers by force by throwing them down the stairs  at another meeting in february   dissenters who tried to shout hitler down were violently removed  and in november   a melee broke out when the brownshirts attacked protesters during a hitler speech this is same kind of violence that is already occurring at trump rallies across the country and now a group of his supporters are taking it a step further by creating a group dedicated to  forcefully  taking down protesters if a trump supporter merely feels threatened trump has already been repeatedly labeled a fascist this month  and this new group only makes that label stick  featured image via imgur
