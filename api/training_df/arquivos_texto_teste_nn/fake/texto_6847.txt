what would you do if a gay couple requested that you bake a cake for them  probably bake it because you re not a bigot  but what if you were  would you take your battle to court  would you fight for a legal right to discriminate  well  saturday night live takes us on the journey of one bigoted baker s fight to prove that  god is a boob man  and would not approve of gay cakes this absolutely brilliant parody film promo points out the utter absurdity of the anti lgbt laws so many states have put forward  and they went about it the most hilariously honest way possible those seeking legislated discrimination seem to think that the lgbt community wants special rights and privileges by just ordering cakes from bakers  or that they want everyone to think that  god is gay  as pointed out in this video  these bigots fail to see that they re not the ones being persecuted  but rather the ones doing the persecuting lgbt money doesn t have cooties  despite what anyone may have previously told you  in fact  it spends just the same  and many gay couples often have a lot of it to spend since they re often dual income with no kids kudos to snl for hitting the nail on the head with this video  it s probably one of the funniest things they ve ever put out  https   www youtube com watch v   image via video screen capture
