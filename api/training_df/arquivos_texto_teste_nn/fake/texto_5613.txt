today is july   otherwise known as america s independence day  americans across the nation know this is the day our country came into being and we celebrate that by lighting fireworks and spending time with friends and family but disgraced former republican rep  allen west thinks something sinister is afoot for years  conservatives have been trying to make everyone believe that there is an imaginary war on christmas  such an idea has been very profitable for guys like mike huckabee and the folks over at fox news who constantly claim christmas is being destroyed by godless liberals even though the war is only occurring in their heads and now it sounds like west is trying to cash in on that concept by claiming that there is a war against july  in his blog on monday  west whines about how people simply refer to this day as july  instead of the   american independence day  i see something very disturbing happening today   he begins we ve become so damaged by the talons of political correctness that it now threatens the very existence of our republic  and i mean its very founding i ve been amazed at how people greet you with  happy  of july   as if we are celebrating a numbered date on the calendar  if this continues  there will be generations who will no longer know what happened on this day  other than we should have cookouts and shoot off fireworks today is our  american independence day  a significant day not just for america  but for the world really  just because people are greeting you today with  happy  of july  that makes you convinced that americans are forgetting what happened on this day  i see you still haven t had your head examined by a qualified neurologist  mr  west  you might wanna get that checked anyway  west goes on to urge people to read the declaration of independence  which is a good learning exercise  however  west uses that call to then attack president obama and liberals by comparing obama to king george iii and claiming that liberals are trying to subvert the holiday these are the stories we must teach our children and grandchildren  lest they go off following the failed messages of the progressive socialist left  this is why we must not celebrate the  of july  but american independence day   or else someone will tell you they re going to  fundamentally transform  your nation and you have no clue what that means this is why today  i implore y all to take the time to carefully read the entire declaration of independence and notice the parallels to the grievances then to today  such as   he has erected a multitude of new offices  and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people  and eat out their substance    think irs and other regulatory agencies or how about this one   he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution  and unacknowledged by our laws  giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation    sound familiar  consider obama s rule by edict and executive order antithetical to our constitution and i love this one   for imposing taxes on us without our consent    need i remind you there are twenty new taxes in obamacare but just as west was wrong to torture a man in iraq for information when he was a lieutenant colonel  he is woefully wrong now first of all  president obama was duly elected to his position by the american people  he is not a king and he his second term in office will be finished in january  and he will leave office  if he were a king  he would never leave president obama is not the only commander in chief to issue executive orders  every single president except for one has issued an executive order  including george washington  he issued  such orders  thomas jefferson  whom west brags about in his post  issued four  president obama has issued  executive orders  but reagan and george w  bush issued over  combined  and if we look at the number of executive orders issued per year  we find that president obama s average is the lowest in modern history  we have to go all the way back to grover cleveland to find a president with a lower average  if we go by west s logic  the only president who wasn t a tyrant was william henry harrison  who died one month after inauguration day  but even he would have likely issued some executive orders had he lived to complete a four year term so executive orders have a precedence that goes back all the way to the first president of the united states west also claims that the american people were taxed without their consent because of obamacare  this is also an outright lie by declaring our independence  americans were able to create their own government and had the power to vote for their representatives in congress  americans did this very thing in  when they sent a democrat to the white house and kept democrats in control of both chambers of congress the house voted in  to pass obamacare and all the taxes it contains by a vote of    the senate voted to pass it by a vote of    and that was right after the people elected president obama  and they would elect him again in   west is likely whining because our system of checks and balances between the three branches of government  also established by the constitution  has prevented republicans from repealing obamacare it should also be pointed out that if president obama were a tyrannical king  allen west s head would be on a pike right now because that s what real tyrants do it sounds like allen west is the one who needs to brush up on his history featured image via wikimedia
