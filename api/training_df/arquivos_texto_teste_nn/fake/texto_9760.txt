trump administration officials are mulling an executive order that would instruct federal agencies to review low income assistance programs  part of a coming effort to make sweeping changes to the country s welfare system the white house began circulating a draft order to federal agencies for comment last week  according to two administration officials  who were granted anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations one of the officials said the draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles  including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force the order also calls for streamlining or eliminating duplicative services and establishing metrics for holding agencies accountable for program performance  it also encourages greater cooperation with state and local governments   politicoif americans are serious about helping to raise up the lower and middle class in america  it must start with jobs  president trump has made a serious commitment to keeping american companies and manufacturing in america  if the us government continues to pay people to stay home  those jobs won t be worth fighting to keep here a study by the nbes shows a correlation between parents who are welfare dependent and their children who are more likely to also become government dependents  if parents become welfare dependents  the likelihood of their children eventually becoming welfare recipients also increases  specifically  when parents are awarded di  the likelihood that one of their adult children will participate in di rises by  percentage points over the next five years  and  percentage points over the next decade  these findings suggest that a more stringent screening policy for di benefits would not only reduce payouts to current applicants  but would also have long run effects on participation rates and program costs  the results underscore how important accounting for intergenerational effects can be when making projections of how participation rates and program costs may be affected by program reforms one of our favorite videos was made in the city of detroit that shamelessly glorifies the benefits of an ebt card  a government assistance program that was initially created to provide food for low income families  like most other government handout programs  the card is now used like a credit card for gas and other products unrelated to food  president trump is likely going to spur anger and hate like we haven t seen before if he pulls the plug on welfare assistance for americans who have been trapped in a government dependancy program in exchange for votes by democrats for generations when generation after generation of americans stop having the desire to earn a living  this is the result
