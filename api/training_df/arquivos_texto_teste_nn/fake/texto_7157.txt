maybe this is republican front runner donald trump s strange way of celebrating april fool s day or maybe he s just being his normal  childish self  but the donald has just posted a pretty hilarious video that boasts the fact that his gop rival  texas senator ted cruz  is highly unlikable cruz s unpopularity amongst not only the general public  but his republican colleagues as well  has been widely reported on during this campaign  so much so  that there was even an analysis done on the offensiveness of cruz s face  trump is using this to his full advantage in his new instagram video  which is so creatively entitled  nobody likes ted the short video goes through several instances where cruz s peers have insulted and spoken about how much they dislike him  testimonials from cruz s former college roommate craig mazin  old bosses like bill o reilly and fellow senators all get their fair share of the spotlight in footage that will surely take cruz s ego down several notches mazin s appearance in the video was no surprise   he s spoken openly about his disdain for cruz several times before  however  former republican presidential nominee bob dole is an interesting addition  as he suggests he might  oversleep  on election day if cruz is nominated  senator lindsey graham  who chose to endorse cruz s campaign over trump s  has previously made it perfectly clear that his endorsement in no way means that he likes cruz  and that he believes the texas senator is just as bad as president barack obama   if not worse   another hilarious part features bill o reilly telling cruz that former president george w  bush doesn t like him  at the end of the video  after cruz gets slammed by basically everyone he s ever been close to  the text reads  trusted  you can watch trump s video below does anybody like lyin  ted a video posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on apr    at   pdtnow infamous for his constant flip flopping  trump s certainly singing a different tune than he was in september  when he praised cruz and said   i like him  he likes me  he s backed me  percent  featured image is a screenshot
