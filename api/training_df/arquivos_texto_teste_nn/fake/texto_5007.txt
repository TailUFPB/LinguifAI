what just happened on cnn would be sad if it weren t so gosh darn funny it would seem it s not only donald trump who is in complete denial that he s losing because that denial has clearly spread to all his campaign surrogates while being interviewed by wolf blitzer stand in brianna keilar during a segment of cnn s situation room  trump surrogate michael cohen just made himself look absolutely foolish and kind of insane keilar was questioning cohen about the new shake up in the trump campaign where there is yet another new campaign manager  it seems the campaign is in emergency maintenance mode considering how dismal trump s poll numbers have been across the board  including in pretty much every single battleground state keilar reiterates the point that trump is down  which cohen must have been trained not to accept  because he replies fast with  says who  so  keilar quickly responds with  the polls  most of them  all of them  however  cohen clearly not grasping this reality into his head again says  say s who  and keilar again says  polls  i just told you  i answered your question  so cohen says  which polls  keilar again says  all of them  it was awkward to say the least  but really kind of funny  yet scary at the same time that trump is actually the republican nominee and this sort of stupidity has now become the norm watch the hilariously embarrassing moment here featured image via video screen capture
