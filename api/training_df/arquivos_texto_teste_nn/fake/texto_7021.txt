nikki haley  south carolina s republican governor  is hyperventilating with fear at the thought of the state republican legislature sending her a brand new anti transgender  bathroom police  law  the law would re segregate our restrooms and force the state to impose restrictions on what bathrooms transgender individuals are allowed to use the bill would require public restrooms to direct people to use the bathroom that aligns with their birth sex  and it would bar local governments from letting trans individuals choose which bathroom to use on their own let s pause for a moment and think about the first portion of that law  to enforce this law  you would need to staff public bathrooms with at least one security guard  who would require a birth certificate and visual inspection of the genitals of an individual before allowing them to use any restroom open to the public  that is literally the only way a law like this would actually be enforceable this begs the question  what is the criminal penalty going to be for using the bathroom  would it be a monetary fine  jail time or would it be a combination of both can you imagine the headlines  local resident busted in bathroom sting by law enforcement  gets  months in jail for peeing despite nikki s reluctance to sign this bill  the unfortunate part is that this isn t about new republican support for transgendered individuals  there is no reason to think this has to do with anything other than money   corporate money  to be exact  north carolina is seeing the massive corporate fallout from the passage of their own anti lgbt legislation  big money is pulling out of north carolina now  and nikki haley is terrified of the same thing happening in her state governor haley tried to sound benevolent about it  suggesting that protecting  religious freedom  and our public bathrooms were not necessary  this is not a battle that we ve seen is needed in south carolina  it s not something that we see that citizens are asking for  when we look at our situation  we re not hearing of anybody s religious liberties that are being violated  and we re again not hearing any citizens that are being violated in terms of freedoms  like it or not  south carolina is doing really well when it comes to respect and when it comes to kindness and when it comes to acceptance  for people to imply it s not  i beg to differ  source  tpmit s as if nikki haley forgot what party she belongs to  she actually is implying protections of  religious freedom  are not necessary  republicans will hate her for this one as usual  the republicans pushing for the bill say it s all about public safety  with the implication being that adult sexual predators would enter women s restrooms to prey on people s young daughters here s a context in which to view this whole thing  republicans want to pass an anti lgbt law that restricts the rights of lawful citizens  because of the actions of potential criminals when it comes to gun control  republicans whine constantly about how wrong it is to restrict the rights of lawful citizens  because of the actions of potential criminals  they also say no laws ever stop criminals from doing bad things  it s good to know that the only time restricting rights and preventing crime can happen is when it comes to bathrooms  and not guns the hypocritical pretzel twisting that republicans are having to put themselves into over this issue  and its associated negative consequences  would be hilarious if they were not trying to hurt people in the process  they have to answer to their corporate owners who hold the money bags  yet they also have to answer to their hateful bigoted voter base  it has to be increasingly embarrassing to be a part of their party featured image via youtube screen capture
