the white supremacist and former kkk grand wizard threw a temper tantrum during an interview on newsmax  and bragged about helping trump become the gop front runner even before the interview began  david duke cried foul because host steve malzberg introduced duke as a former kkk leader  duke whined that former west virginia senator robert byrd was also in the kkk but he was never introduced as such  accusing the  mainstream media  of being controlled however  while duke is right that byrd was in the kkk  byrd did repeatedly renounce his kkk ties later in his career  calling it a mistake that he ll keep apologizing for  over and over again  i know now i was wrong   byrd said in    intolerance had no place in america  i apologized a thousand times   and i don t mind apologizing over and over again  i can t erase what happened  in   byrd warned young people to steer clear of the kkk   don t get that albatross around your neck   he said   once you ve made that mistake  you inhibit your operations in the political arena  byrd became a staunch supporter of civil rights and redeemed himself over time this makes byrd far different from duke  who has not renounced his kkk past and his continued support of white supremacy  when asked about how he feels about jews and black people  duke had a hard time answering and then said that he is trying to turn the kkk into a political organization and fancies himself a  human rights activist   of course  the only human rights he cares about are those of racist white pricks like himself malzberg also challenged duke with his own words  asking him about what he said about rape laws in  according to the wichita sun duke said  white people don t need a law against rape  but if you fill this room up with your normal black bucks  you would  because n   ers are basically primitive animals  duke claimed he was taken out of context and that the sun made up the quote  only to later brag about how the republican party has adopted his stance against immigrants in the last part of the interview  duke continued to talk about himself and how great he is  even going so far as to scream that trump  jumped ten points in the polls  because he and  his people   white racists  to support him here s the videos via youtube trump has made it possible for white supremacists and their racist organizations to rise up in this nation once again  and should he win  those evil groups and their members will have an ally in the white house  which will only embolden them  at what point will americans say  enough is enough  and counter this hate by overwhelmingly voting against it  unfortunately  we will probably have to wait until november to find out featured image  screenshot
