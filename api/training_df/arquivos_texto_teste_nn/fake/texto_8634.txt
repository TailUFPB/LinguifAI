if you re one of the people who saw sarah palin endorse donald trump for president and thought to yourself   oh  god  she s back  with utter misery in your soul  you re most definitely not alone  she was the poison pill for john mccain s career  no  not just his presidential run in   his career  he will always be the guy who put palin on the national stage to torture all the world trump  being the bombastic person that he is  and not caring what anyone really thinks of him  even though he s obsessed with polls  thought it wise to bring palin back into the spotlight after her failed attempts at everything from being a governor to a reality star  and propped her up embracing her endorsement  however  the endorsement isn t even half of his plans for her  and we  as a nation  should be f cking mortified trump has now declared that there will be a role for palin within his administration if he were to win the white house this upcoming november  he doesn t think she d actually want a role  which may actually be true considering that would require actual work and follow through  but he said the door is open to the possibility  he told nbc today host savannah guthrie  she never made a deal  like so many people want to try and make deals  i mean  she just said  i really like what s going on  it s an amazing thing  i ve never seen anything like it in politics  trump even insinuated that he may consider her as a potential vice presidential running mate  saying  i haven t discussed it with her  no  i haven t discussed anything with her about what she d do  but she s somebody i really like and i respect  and certainly  she could play a position if she wanted to  the real estate mogul also took the chance to rub in the fact that he got palin s endorsement over other candidates when he said  it s such an honor  because as you know  very badly  so many people are so disappointed that she didn t support them  is it really  though  i mean  come on  look what she did to mccain however  to drive the point home that a trump win in november equals palin in his administration  he said  but certainly there d be a role in the administration if she wanted  and i m not sure that she does want that  but there d certainly be a role  if trump being the orotund racist with no policy experience wasn t enough for you to vote against him this november  his saying palin will have an open spot in his administration should be the icing on the cake  it s more important now  than ever before  to make sure a democrat wins the white house this fall would  realdonaldtrump consider  sarahpalinusa as a running mate  watch what he told  savannahguthrie  https   t co   today   todayshow  january    image  gage skidmore  flickr flickr
