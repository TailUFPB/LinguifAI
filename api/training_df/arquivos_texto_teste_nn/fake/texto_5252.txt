the presidential debate schedule is already out  and  true to form  donald trump is already throwing a livid fit about it  he doesn t like the fact that two of the debates are scheduled on the same nights as nfl games  which would be understandable if he wasn t busy saying hillary clinton is responsible for that  however  he crossed a major line in his accusations  and it has already come back to bite him hard in an interview with abc news  he made the following ridiculous claim  well  i ll tell you what i don t like  it s against two nfl games  i got a letter from the nfl saying   this is ridiculous  why are the debates against   cause the nfl doesn t wanna go against the debates   cause the debates are gonna be pretty massive  from what i understand  ok  and i don t think we should be against the nfl  now  aside from the obvious questions of why the nfl would be sending trump a letter about this  rather than the commission on presidential debates  it appears that this is one of trump s most blatant lies yet  cnn s brian stetler says the nfl responded by disavowing any contact with trump at all  while we d obviously wish the debate commission could find another night  we did not send a letter to trump  and there it is  most politicians who are given to lies will at least attempt to lie in such a way that it s hard to prove  even with a statement from whomever or whatever they re lying about  not trump  no he s so important that it doesn t matter that the debate schedule has been in place for a year already  agencies like the nfl will communicate to him first  because he s just that crucial to the whole process why is this significant  because it s not a gaffe  a gaffe is when a politician  pundit  or someone else heavily involved in politics accidentally lets loose what s really on their minds  romney s  percent comment four years ago is a gaffe  trump  however  commits gaffes and also tells outright lies  and because of that  it s virtually pointless to fact check him  because even with a statement from whoever he s lied about  he ll double down on it if nothing else  this lie  while seemingly stupid  provides a deep look into the psyche of the man who is donald trump  he ll say whatever he wants   he doesn t care  and if the nfl wants to take him down a notch or twelve by denying they even communicated with him  then he ll make sure they re sorry for making him look like the fool that he is  or he ll ignore them altogether his fa ade is coming down  and only the truly brainwashed voters  along with the white supremacist masses he s attracted  remain willfully blind to his lack of honesty  the nfl is a major organization  they just made trump look very bad indeed featured image by regine mahaux getty images
