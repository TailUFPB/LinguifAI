jared kushner  who is ivanka trump s husband and therefore king donnie s son in law  played the good son in law by stepping up and boldly defending his royal anti semite s anti semitic tweet against hillary  just like everyone else who thinks the whole brouhaha is just  political correctness run amok   the problem is  he did so by invoking his jewish grandparents  history in the holocaust  and now his family is rightfully livid at him for it because really  he s going to defend an anti semitic image by saying his grandparents are holocaust survivors so he knows better than the evil media what is and isn t anti semitic  where has he been living that he thinks this is okay  in a bubble that s under a rock  which is deep in a cave in the middle of the himalayas marc kushner  jared s first cousin  responded to this brown nosing butt fuckery with a link to jared s op ed  and this simple statement at the top  i have a different take away from my grandparents  experience in the war  it is our responsibility as the next generation to speak up against hate  anti semitism or otherwise  it was jacob schulder  another cousin  though  that really let loose on both jared and the anti semite in chief with a comment that appears to have since been deleted  but that politico still has  when an out of touch with reality nominee hires an out of touch with reality campaign manager  who is also a son  in  law  you get the bs jared wrote  i don t think trump is an anti semite  i think he s a lying idiot  among other things  with little to no experiences outside his teetering fiefdom of failed development projects  divorces  bankrupted sports leagues  fraudulent  universities  and golf courses  and the list keeps going   the very first thing a responsible campaign manager should do  i d think  and i mean the very first thing  would be to take away his father  in  law s twitter account  even joseph kushner would ve had the street smarts to figure that one out while living on boiled potatoes in the forest  schulder went on to explain exactly how the rest of us know that this was no  accident   and king dunce isn t the least bit sorry  so it ll probably happen again  that my grandparents have been dragged into this is a shame  thank you jared for using something sacred and special to the descendants of joe and rae kushner to validate the sloppy manner in which you ve handled this campaign  from the references to  palestine  at the aipac conference  which got donald jeered  to the justification of the itchy twitter fingers your father in law has  you ve managed to further prove what so many of us have known for many years  kudos to you for having gone this far  no one expected this  but for the sake of the family name  which may have no meaning to you but still has meaning to others  please don t invoke our grandparents in vain just so you can sleep better at night  it is self serving and disgusting  so what did he say that was so offensive  in an op ed posted to observer com on wednesday  kushner said  he worst that his detractors can fairly say about him is that he has been careless in retweeting imagery that can be interpreted as offensive  he then launched into a narrative of his grandparents  history of trying to escape the nazis in russia  and some of the horrors they endured while doing so  his grandmother did escape and joined a resistance cell  where she met his grandfather  who had been living in a literal hole in the ground for three years  trying to remain hidden from the nazis  then he said  i go into these details  which i have never discussed  because it s important to me that people understand where i m coming from when i report that i know the difference between actual  dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points  where he s coming from  oh  that s right  he s coming from his royal racism s rear end in the same manner as diarrhea  the thing is  using the star of david in the manner of that tweet  along with the fact that it originally came from neo nazis  is intentionally anti semitic  this was no accident of ignorance in any way  shape or form  and someone with family that survived the holocaust should know a lot better than this but kushner has drunk the kool aid mixed by king dunce himself  and is brainwashed into believing that the serial racist tweeter in chief can t possibly be that hateful and bigoted  with that explanation out of the way  the only one left is that the tweet was not anti semitic  and trump is just a little careless please of course  a source close to kushner says that he hasn t even spoken to these people in ten years  so they don t matter  that s a bunch of bull cookies right there  kushner may not have spoken to them in ten years  but he invoked his history  which is their history too  in a public forum  therefore  it matters  end of the entire campaign is rife with broad racism  which includes anti semitism  trump has a bad habit of retweeting white supremacists  including neo nazi groups  kushner shouldn t be telling anybody that the anti semitic tweet was a mere mistake  especially not if he s going to insult his own family  and their jewish history  in doing so featured image by neilson barnard getty images for finca
