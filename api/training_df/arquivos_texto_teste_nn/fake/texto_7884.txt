this is what it has come to following the passage of a republican drafted bill to force guns onto college campuses   whether the schools want them there or not   the university of houston has begun instructing professors to avoid literally triggering students who may be armed in order to avoid sparking a mass shooting  if that sounds ridiculously unhealthy  glad you could join us in   republicans in the texas legislature and governor greg abbott forced through an nra drafted bill that would make it mandatory for schools in the state to allow guns on campus  as much as it was adored by right wing gun lovers  educators and students were appalled  the implications are scary  students will be packed into classrooms with any number of weapons just waiting to go off by accident or by design schools are preparing for the new  guns everywhere  law that will take effect in august  and much of the preparation centers around getting teachers ready to deal with classrooms full of  year olds who brought a semi automatic handgun to campus along with their textbooks  in a recent discussion of the new state law  the university of houston displayed a slide that told faculty to  not  go there   on certain topics if they felt it might make some of their gun happy students upset slide from recent campus carry dialogue at uh  in response to faculty concerns about dangers from armed students  pic twitter com   jeff   jeffinthebowtie  february    today spoke with the university s faculty senate president  my slides are not university policy but faculty to faculty discussion points in a faculty senate led discussion group  they express the downside of having more weapons on campus and the chilling effect that has on academic freedom   university faculty senate president jon snow tells usa today college regarding his presentation ironically  many right wingers have accused schools of  censoring  free speech by being overly  politically correct  in the classroom  it s hard to imagine any school has gone as far as texas s republican led legislature  professors may be worried students could get offended by a lecture  but few schools have to tell their professors to avoid  triggering  their students or else risk being shot in their classroom needless to say  many professors are not okay with this new way of doing things despite republicans assuring the public that they are doing this to keep people safe  the students and professors themselves want nothing to do with this terrifying plan  it s led to demonstrations by students at schools like the university of texas at austin  and now  an unprecedented  professors from over  departments have signed a pledge that they will not take part in this bone headed scheme republicans have ignored their concerns entirely  instead  they are high fiving the nra lobbyists who put them up to it  so a few more kids might die in texas schools  it s a small price to pay for  freedom  featured image via twitter
