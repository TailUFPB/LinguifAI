it s no secret that there is little love lost between president obama and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  but this is ridiculous somehow unsatisfied by his pathetic use of an unprecedented speech delivered to congress at the behest of the republican party in an attempt derail sensitive iranian nuclear negotiations  netanyahu has found a new low  out of the blue  and with no official statement to the white house  netanyahu cancelled a trip to washington and a meeting with the president  the pope met with the president  the denver broncos met with the president  a  year old lady danced with the president  but netanyahu  a supposed american  ally  in the middle east will snub him in what is likely the pair s last opportunity to meet face to face netanyahu didn t even attempt to hide his contempt for obama  either  rather than do the respectable thing and give the white house a heads up  the president and his staff learned of netanyahu s snub from  media outlets like cnn the white house said israel had proposed two dates for a meeting between the leaders and the u s  had offered to meet on one of those days   we were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting   said ned price  a spokesman for the white house s national security council   we were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister  rather than accept our invitation  opted to cancel his visit  classy according to israeli news networks  insiders in the netanyahu administration told reporters that he was  unwilling to meet with obama   however  the israeli government publicly disputed those reports ironically  netanyahu s own defense for cancelling was so that he did not sway the upcoming u s  election   something he didn t mind doing in the past  for instance  netanyahu spoke with obama on super tuesday in   he didn t seem concerned that his actions would throw a wrench in the democratic process   or perhaps more accurately  he rather hoped it would  and two years later during the mid term elections  his love for republicans was so obvious  that it was discussed with casual openness in israel  here  for example  is a typical report from the time it s no secret that netanyahu and his aides are praying for control of the u s  senate to fall to the republicans  who already hold the majority of the house of representatives  based on recent u s  polls  there s a fairly good chance those prayers will be answered  however  netanyahu won t break open any champagne prematurely  he did that two years ago  before the presidential elections  only to see his favored candidate  mitt romney  lose to incumbent president barack obama unfortunately for the prime minister  he got his wish and still lost the battle  they really tried  but republicans were unable to stop the iranian nuclear agreement   even after skirting america s treason laws to try to elbow their way in it seems apparent that the israeli prime minister is still livid over the fact that obama went ahead with the iranian nuclear disarmament instead of listening to his calls for war  the two world leaders have never exactly seen eye to eye on the issue of iran or anything else  netanyahu  a right wing hardliner  has resented obama s calls for peace  including chastising israel for its policies towards palestinians  the fact that the united states still provides financial and military support to israel to the tune of billions of dollars a year doesn t seem to calm him down  either so rather than swallow his pride  netanyahu has resorted to shameful displays of pettiness  what that means for the future of u s  israel relations will be better known after the election featured image via flickr
