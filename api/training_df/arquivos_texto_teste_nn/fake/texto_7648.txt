the cnn debate between democratic candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders took place in flint  michigan on sunday   and it featured something truly extraordinary and refreshing the candidates spent their time presenting two compelling and different visions for america  based on aspirations and hope   and conducted a battle of ideas  not playground level personal insults  it was a perfect insight into what the republican party is currently incapable of offering the american public while the republican debates have featured donald trump raving about the size of his own penis  the amount his opponent marco rubio sweats  and how ted cruz is a liar   bernie and hillary kept it classy in terms of the topics discussed  the republican debates have so far centered around fighting against immigration  guns  equal marriage  women s reproductive rights  and each other  allowing candidates to respond to whatever personal attacks have been made that week  by contrast  the democratic debate was wide ranging  covering a number of social  economic and political issues just some of the issues covered on all of these issues  the candidates had compelling  and different  visions for america on flint  both candidates came out strongly on the side of the people  sanders saying  over the last several weeks  i had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of flint  had a town meeting in flint  and i have to tell you  what i heard and what i saw literally shattered me and it was beyond belief that children in flint  michigan in the united states of america in the years  are being poisoned  that is clearly not what this country should be about  and clinton adding  the governor should resign or be recalled and we should support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that  but that is not enough  we have to focus on what must be done to help the people of flint  in short  they didn t fight over the matters for which there was no principle at stake  they did not call each other liars or argue their care for the people of flint was disingenuous just to score a point but when it came to the issues that divide sanders from clinton  they went at it with everything in their arsenal for example  on money in politics  the sanders and clinton campaigns are markedly different  one candidate  sanders  relying on mass micro contributions and rejecting the influence of big money backers  and clinton  as the establishment candidate  doing the opposite  so when the matter arose  sanders made a simple but powerful point  one of us has a super pac  one of us has raised   million from wall street for the super pac  one of us has given speeches on wall street for hundred of thousands of dollars  conversely  on the issue of gun control   where clinton is in favor if stricter gun controls while sanders is more reluctant  it was clinton who could landed a blow   again  on the issue  not the personal attributes of the candidate whichever candidate more closely represents your vision for america  the debate gave you a chance to fully explore their ideas  their policies  and what they would mean for american schools  jobs  daily lives  the economy and the environment  it was a reminder that america can do grown up politics  at a time when the republican primary has disintegrated into a frat house brawl you can watch the debate in full below   featured image via screenshot
