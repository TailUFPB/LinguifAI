when the tense standoff between federal agents and a group of right wing extremists at cliven bundy s ranch ended in a stalemate  it was only a matter of time before we heard from the emboldened  patriots  again  on january   they showed up unannounced   and unwelcome   in oregon towing with them a large arsenal of weapons and vowing to die in a shoot out if police or federal agents removed them  cliven s sons ammon and ryan bundy seized a federal wildlife building and said they were prepared to stay there indefinitely until their demands   the unconditional surrender of the united states government and the ceding of federal land to ranchers like the bundy family   are met  it s clear that ammon bundy  the ringleader  wants to build an army  in a statement  he begged fellow anti government patriots to  stand up and come to harney county  we need your help and we are asking for it  and the bundy family made no secret of the violence underlining the  protest  i talked to ryan bundy on the phone again  he said they re willing to kill and be killed if necessary   oregonunderattack  ian kullgren   iankullgren  january    ammon has framed the issue as one of freedom vs  tyranny  the real reason they showed up was to protect two oregon ranchers  father and son dwight and steven hammond  like cliven bundy  the hammonds had gotten used to abusing public lands to feed their livestock on and felt that it was now their  right  to do so who are the hammonds  based on their actions  a pair of scumbags who were willing to destroy a large area of federally protected land just to protect themselves from being exposed as criminals in   they purposely set a series of wildfires on government land in order to hide their poaching activities  the fires turned into a raging inferno that nearly killed a few local residents  destroyed  acres of public land and killed countless animals that were meant to be safe the jury convicted both of the hammonds of using fire to destroy federal property for a  arson known as the hardie hammond fire  located in the steens mountain cooperative management and protection area   witnesses at trial  including a relative of the hammonds  testified the arson occurred shortly after steven hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on blm property   jurors were told that steven hammond handed out  strike anywhere  matches with instructions that they be lit and dropped on the ground because they were going to  light up the whole country on fire  these are the people bundy s armed militia group came to oregon to defend  they would set a deadly wildfire to protect themselves and ruin the land for anyone else because  freedom   if the definition of terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation to achieve a political goal  then let s call this what it is  terrorism ironically  the hammonds themselves want nothing to do with the standoff  their lawyer disavowed the group from the start  the hammonds are already facing jail sentences for their crimes  they ve correctly guessed that adding  stoking an armed insurrection  would only keep them in jail longer from interviews ammon bundy has given while in oregon  it s clear that he has an idea of himself as a right wing martyr  as such  he and his fellow group of anti government terrorists are clearly willing to die for their cause  they ve brought with them enough guns to see that they take down as many innocent people as they can before that happens so far  federal agencies and the harney county sheriff s department are taking a light approach the the occupation  not keen to start another waco  the authorities are trying to reason with the group rather than go in shooting  it remains to be seen whether a group that invaded a small wildlife reserve building while wearing camo fatigues and carrying rifles can be reasoned with feature image via cbc screengrab
