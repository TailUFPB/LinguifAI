if you haven t noticed by now that donald trump rallies have become white pride events then you are either willfully ignorant  or living under a rock  in fact  some of trump s most fervent supporters are members of white supremacist groups  including former kkk grand wizard david duke  it s gotten to the point where shouting  trump trump trump  is synonymous with shouting  white pride   and if you disagree with that sentiment  take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and think about why you disagree noticing how racist trump supporters are  along with the rest of the sane world  is none other than the folks over at saturday night live  they put together the perfect spoof campaign ad to attack these nincompoops head on  in a sketch titled   racists for trump  they start by showing what seems to be average americans working hard and simply loving what trump stands for  the commercial begins  the media s been saying some pretty negative things about donald trump  but what are real americans saying  trump was then labeled a  winner    authentic   job creator  negotiator   an  outsider   and above all else  the candidate who can  make america great again  it s at that point when it s revealed that all the supporters speaking are involved some way or another in a white supremacist organization  whether it be neo nazis  the kkk  or simply  white pride   snl does not hold back in slamming the hate and bigotry that s been spewing out of the trump campaign alongside his supporters but of course  all that hate is disguised in clever coded language to make it seem like we don t notice  but guess what  we notice bravo to snl  this is absolutely perfect  well done featured image via image screen capture
