the conservative media  quite literally having nothing better to do  decided rock bottom wasn t deep enough and dug a little deeper  what they found was that president obama will be moving to a house that s vaguely near an islamic center  surely this changes everything with obama s time in office coming to a close  the family announced that they would be staying in washington d c  after they left the white house so that sasha and malia could finish school there  the house they chose is one befitting a former president and was once owned by a senior adviser to bill clinton the move will put the obamas in one of washington s wealthiest zip codes  in a secluded precinct backing up to rock creek park that is home to diplomats and a focal point of the capital s cocktail party circuit  the home itself is luxurious  photographs posted by washington fine properties  which listed it when it sold in   show spacious rooms with hardwood floors  white marble countertops  his and her master bathrooms and a terrace with formal gardens conservatives  naturally  promptly lost their minds  the obamas  they reasoned  should not be allowed to live in a nice house  i ll leave the reasons why this particular first family can t live in a nice house or  say  eat in a fancy restaurant up to your imagination but the crack team of conservative airheads over at tucker carlson s the daily caller took another approach  a quick google maps search found that the obamas  new home is  wait for it  sort of near an islamic center here s how the daily caller s eric owens framed it the mammoth  multi million dollar mansion where president barack obama and his family will reportedly live after the first family exits the white house is located   feet from the islamic center of washington   one of the largest mosques in the western hemisphere what follows is hundreds of words devoted to painfully describing every detail about the islamic center and its function   hint  muslims do islam in there  if you can believe it   hilariously  owens also notes that the embassy of oman and the  former  embassy of iran are  close to obama s new mansion   this presumably means something it s hard to fathom that we are approaching president obama s final months in office and the right wing movement has yet to let the  obama is a secret muslim  conspiracy go  a quick scroll through the daily caller s comment section cesspool finds that a strong majority of readers truly believe this to be the case if you re curious as to why places like the daily caller are obsessing over obama s proximity to islamic centers and the number of bathrooms in his new house  it just might have to do with the fact that president obama is riding a wave of popularity  having used his second term to nail one legacy affirming accomplishment after another  obama currently enjoys a favorability rating that is higher than reagan s and a strong wind at his back as he closes out a presidency that people like tucker carlson and eric owens insisted would be a country destroying disaster but let s ignore all that because a thousand feet away from obama s new house is an islamic center  good grief featured image via the wire
