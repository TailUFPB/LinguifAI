it s alarming that so many people are lining up rank and file behind republican presidential front runner donald trump  it seems that no matter what he says or does  people will love and defend him  he not only lies  but he s incredibly dangerous with his rhetoric and is tapping into a part of conservative rage that can only be seen as desperate   but it s working now  during a taping of msnbc s townhall that will air on wednesday  trump was asked about his position on abortion  what he said shouldn t only disgust people  but terrify them msnbc s chris matthews asked trump  should abortion be punished  this is not something you can dodge  trump half ass answered  look  people in certain parts of the republican party  conservative republicans  would say   yes  it should  so matthews pressed him harder on it asking   how about you   trump responded  i would say it s a very serious problem and it s a problem we have to decide on  are you going to send them to jail  matthews pressing even further said   i m asking you   this is when trump decided to say  i am pro life  well  you go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places but we have to ban it  then being pressed further  trump says   there has to be some form of punishment  with matthews asking  for the woman   and trump responding in the affirmative declaring that the punishment would  have to be determined  all of this proving  beyond a shadow of a doubt  that we need to now  more than ever  make sure trump gets nowhere near the oval office  he  would have the ability to choose who goes on the supreme court  and that thought alone should terrify every woman to their core trump even said  they ve set the law and frankly the judges  you re going to have a very big election coming up for that reason because you have judges where it s a real tipping point and with the loss of scalia  who was a very strong conservative  this presidential election is going to be very important when you say what s the law  nobody knows what the law is going to be  it depends on who gets elected  people  please  if you re a liberal and your candidate doesn t get the nomination and you choose to sit at home or vote out of spite  your choice to do so will have national repercussions bigger than yourself  no matter who gets the nomination for the democrats   vote blue  this is beyond critical  and these latest remarks by trump prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt featured photo by spencer platt getty images   ht  bloomberg
