six years ago  the upper big branch mine in west virginia exploded and killed  men  investigations found a systemic effort to ignore safety regulations that directly caused the  accident  and that effort was directed by donald l  blankenship  usually in these cases  the company is slapped with an insultingly small fine  condolences are delivered and business continues as usual this time was different  felony charges were brought against blankenship and  unbelievably  he was convicted of deliberately violating the safety measures that led to  deaths  it was a shocking verdict even though the jury inexplicably acquitted him of the more serious charges but today  it s back to business as usual as blankenship was sentenced to a whole whopping year in jail and fined     that s  days and    for each life he stole away from the families and loved ones of the victims  that s what human life is worth these days  apparently oh  and he s completely unrepentant mr  blankenship said   my main point is wanting to express sorrow to the families and everyone for what happened   as he spoke  relatives of dead miners cried in the courtroom s gallery  and one wiped her face with a crumpled piece of paper mr  blankenship  however  was also defiant and told judge berger   it s important to me that everyone knows that i am not guilty of a crime  no  it s important that everyone know you are the very worst capitalism has to offer his lawyers are already hard at work getting his sentence reduced to probation and it s unlikely he ll serve a single day  oh  and blankenship is worth over   million so    really is just a slap on the wrist in a country that sends people to prison for decades for smoking marijuana in their home  this ridiculous sentence once again demonstrates that there are two different justice systems  one for you and me that locks us up for no reason so someone can profit  and one for the people who profit that never get locked up for any reason at all fuck this country featured image via alex wong getty images
