a lot of credit needs to be given to those who work in the media and have to put up with these presidential candidates daily  especially those coming from the clown car on the right   in particular  donald trump  the real estate mogul will literally say practically anything that suits him in the moment  it doesn t matter if he changes his tune five minutes later  his opinions sway with whatever is most opportunistic for him at any given time take  for instance  his tax returns that mitt romney and several others are calling for  now  during the latest gop debate he said he can t show his returns because they are currently being audited  and he cited that s what happens with most large businesses and business owners  so for that reason he can t show his returns yet until the audit is over  then after the debate  during an interview with cnn s chris cuomo  trump claimed he was likely being audited and unfairly treated by the irs because he s a christian  so  in the matter of about an hour  he tried pandering to business owners and then later to christians  after all  several supposed christians feel as though they are being persecuted for not being allowed to legally discriminate any longer  and trump knowing this selling line is already out there  uses it for his own purposes as well  he s not dumb   but he clearly thinks those who like him are  after all   he loves the poorly educated  cuomo  however  had to do his best to hold it together while trump was trying to claim he was being audited based on his christianity  trump said  i m always audited by the irs  which i think is very unfair  i don t know whether it s maybe because of religion or because of something else  maybe because i m doing this   when cuomo asked trump to further explain what he meant by  religion   trump said  well  maybe because of the fact that i m a strong christian and i feel strongly about it  so maybe there s a bias  this is when you can clearly see cuomo raise his eyebrows and hold his face together as best he can not to just laugh in trump s face  trump continued  you have many religious groups that are complaining about that  they ve been complaining about it for a long time  so wait  now trump is a  religious group    umm trump is clearly trying to dodge the need to release his returns  and he s trying as many lines as possible to see what sticks so he won t have to release them  kudos for the effort  but not all of us are as dumb as trump supporters and can spot this clear poppycock from a mile away this is the video of his entire post debate interview with cnn  but his audit malarkey begins at the   mark  featured image via youtube
