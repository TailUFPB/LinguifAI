by now  you ve probably heard that at a recent ted cruz rally  carly fiorina fell off the stage right after announcing the candidate and his family  she s fine  don t worry yet  leave it to donald trump to use this moment to his advantage in front of his band of merry morons trump told his crowd in carmel  indiana  carly s perfectly nice  by the way  she fell off the stage the other day  did anybody see that  and cruz didn t do anything  even i would have helped her  ok  basically saying   even i  the biggest jerk on earth  would have given her a hand  then he just kept going with it  because you know  trump  they just showed it to me coming in  i said   no  i didn t see it   they just showed it to me and i said   wow  that s really cruel   she fell off   she just went down  she went a long way down  right  she went down right in front of him and he was talking  he kept talking  he didn t even look like that was a weird deal  man  and then they were both talking  she was talking from the back and he was talking from there  they re both talking  no  it was weird  writing out a trump transcript is very unique  because he will literally repeat himself over and over and over as though you didn t get it the first time of course  trump is making a mountain out of a molehill  cruz likely didn t even see her fall  and she was back to the stage within seconds  all that aside  it is still wildly bizarre that carly fiorina is a  running mate  of a person who likely won t come near enough delegates to secure the republican nomination watch part of trump s diatribe here trump  even i would have helped fiorina up  https   t co  https   t co   politico   politico  may    photo via win mcnamee getty images
