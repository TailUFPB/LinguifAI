while at a campaign event in riviera beach florida  bill clinton was speaking about his wife  hillary  and letting everyone know why they should choose her in the upcoming election  however  from the crowd came shouts of protest from a lone donald trump supporter who stood with a trump campaign sign smirking and looking very proud of himself what this protester didn t realize was coming was the fact that the former president is used to being attacked from every angle  he will have a comeback and retort to everything thrown his way  so that protester soon had his condescending smirk wiped off his face by an epic verbal smack down that he likely was not expecting the trump supporter was shouting you took his money   in reference to the clinton s taking trump s money for their foundation  this is when clinton responded without even blinking an eye  i certainly did  i took his money for my foundation and used it better than he s using it now  however  the trump minion still stood there with his smug little smile waving his sign around for all to see  and as the crowd grew restless at this obnoxious display  clinton took on this creep head on  referencing trump  he said  i remember when he called me to say how terrible the republicans had been to hillary and me and how unfair they were and what a brilliant job hillary did as a senator  by the way  a lot of them called me about that  which is why they spent the last three years trying to tear her down because they know if they nominate her they are going to have to eat the words they said  however  the former president wasn t done  as the secret service finally led the trump lackey away  clinton said  if you want to build a wall along the rio grande and spend   million  then you should follow him like moses into the promised land  burrrnnn  clinton basically told the guy that trump is full of crap and is selling him on racist promises he simply won t be able to deliver the lesson to be learned from all of this  don t mess with the explainer in chief  he will shut you down watch here video featured image  youtube
