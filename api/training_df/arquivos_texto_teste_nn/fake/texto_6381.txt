stephen colbert got an exclusive interview on cbs  the late show when donald trump s  publicist  called in  the publicist has been in the news lately since it was revealed that trump pretended to be his own representative while dealing with the media in the  and  the washington post reported that trump often called up reporters who were covering him and pretended to be  john miller  and  john barron   trump then would use the fake identity to push stories about how he was purportedly dating models and celebrities like madonna trump denied that he behaved this way in an interview with the today show  but had previously admitted to it in court the presumptive republican presidential nominee also seemed to panic when reporters asked about it in a scheduled interview on friday then  friday afternoon  washington post reporters who were  minutes into a phone interview with trump about his finances asked him a question about miller   did you ever employ someone named john miller as a spokesperson  the phone went silent  then dead  when the reporters called back and reached trump s secretary  she said   i heard you got disconnected  he can t take the call now  i don t know what happened  trump s behavior is so odd and out of the ordinary that mainstream media reporters are often completely confused as to how to cover him  how do you address a narcisstic millionaire pushing xenophobia and racism who is woefully unprepared for the presidency  perhaps more mocking from comedians like colbert is the only rational way to deal with it certainly the late night comedy writers are getting almost as much raw material   maybe more   as they did when george w  bush was president  what s bad for the country and national political conversation is most definitely great news for the world of comedy  and they re not stopping any time soon featured image via youtube
