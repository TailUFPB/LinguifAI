at a press conference on tuesday  president obama could barely hide his frustration towards the would be obstructionists in the senate who say they will block any potential supreme court nominee he suggests for the remainder of his term when asked by a reporter what he thought about the political move by republicans to block the process until after the next election  obama didn t hold back  at times obama s normally calm rhetorical style gave way to more and more passion as his disbelief in how badly these senators were behaving became apparent  in the past  this has not been viewed as a question  there is no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years  that s not in the constitutional text  i m amused to hear when people who claim to be strict interpreters of the constitution  suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there  republicans have spent the days after supreme court justice antonin scalia s death arguing that obama should not be allowed to use the next year of his presidency selecting a new nominee  instead  they have feigned the belief that in the last year in office a president must sit on his hands until the election is over  as obama points out  this has never been a thing  notably  as recently as   president ronald reagan appointed a new justice during an election year and nobody batted an eye in a nice little dagger twist  president obama then put the spotlight back on republicans who vow to not do their jobs  rather than allow partisan point scoring get in the way of yet another democratic process  obama suggested this could  be a good moment to rise above that  and show america that congress isn t a complete and utter mess  this is the supreme court  the highest court in the land  it s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day to day politics  this will be the opportunity for senators to do their job your job doesn t stop until you are voted out or until your term expires  obama also used the time to make it abundantly clear that he isn t about to be held hostage by the republican obstructionists either  in one of the most crackling exchanges of the presser  a reporter asked the president if he would be nominating a moderate so that he might be able to appease republicans and get them to do their jobs  he was not amused  no  no  where did you get that idea  obama reaffirmed that he would be selecting a candidate based on their merit and on the belief that they would be the best person for the job  not on whether or not he thought a group of conservative politicians would like the pick as is typical in president obama s second term  this was a take no prisoners moment  having watched republicans openly vow to stop him from accomplishing anything  even if it meant harming the country as collateral damage  his new strategy is not to even try to work with them  instead  he has begun to call them out at every term  a name and shame scorched earth policy that is making it harder and harder for obstructionists to get a free pass to continue poisoning the political process it s fun to watch featured image via nbc news
