everyone thinks of people like the kkk when they think of white supremacists  indeed  it s no secret that the kkk s former grand wizard  david duke  loves donald trump  however  there are other white supremacists here who are far less obvious  and therefore  more insidious  than anything groups like the kkk could do  they appeared at the republican national convention in droves to cheer on their hero  donald trump this group is well heeled  well dressed  clean cut  and they want to remove everyone who isn t white and christian from this country  literally  they think trump will help them further their  rational  arguments in support of an actual ethnic cleansing of the u s  following trump s disaster of a speech at the republican national convention  richard spencer  a very prominent white supremacist  said  we ll help  go somewhere else  i m not a maniac i know in order to achieve what i want to achieve  you have to deal with people rationally  because expelling most of the u s   population is a completely rational position to have he is a maniac   he just can t see it after trump s thursday speech  spencer and others spoke to a member of the republican jewish coalition as well as an executive from another major jewish group  and these two were shocked at how cavalier he and his group were in totally dismissing their concerns out of hand  like they re second class citizens to these people  though  they are second class citizens  and these are the kinds of people donald trump draws to him  and only rejects them when the press pushes him on it  his campaign slogan is a magnet for white supremacists  in fact  spencer actually said  trust me  trump thinks like me  do you think it s a coincidence that everybody like me loves trump and supports him  he s not wrong  his royal whiteness has called for deporting  million undocumented immigrants  barring muslims from entering the country  and says he s the  law and order candidate  who will stop the  terrorists  that are black lives matter  it s actually not a surprise that white supremacists love him but don t call them  white supremacists   they like  europeanists    alt right   and  white nationalists   in other words  they use terms that couch their white supremacy in something that they think sounds less bigoted  so they can turn more people into bigots spencer is actually on the southern poverty law center s radar because he pushes aryan nation ideals so hard  he believes that the ethnic cleansing required to return  dispossessed  white people to their rightful place on high should be peaceful  but should definitely happen post haste  he s called martin luther king  jr  a fraud and degenerate  and he s said that immigration is a proxy war against white people whose grandchildren would find themselves in a country  alien and hostile  if action isn t taken the sickest part of this is that spencer not only thinks he and his positions are rational  but that trump will  cleanse  this country in a calm and rational manner  because if ethnic cleansing is just done right  it won t in unrest or violence and will put white people back into their ivory towers  these people are one of the primary reasons trump is so dangerous featured image via william thomas cain getty images
