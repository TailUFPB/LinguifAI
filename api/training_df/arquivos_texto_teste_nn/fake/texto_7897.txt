seth meyers destroyed republican presidential wannabe ted cruz on tuesday night for running a campaign of dirty tricks and lies the late night host brutally examined tricky ted during the  closer look  segment for the way he has used unethical maneuvers to smear his opponents and fool voters into casting their votes for him it all started in iowa when cruz s campaign put the word out that ben carson was dropping out of the race  which may have caused some carson supporters to switch their allegiance to the texas senator the stolen votes likely helped cruz capture victory in iowa but it hurt him in the media  forcing him to request a meeting with carson in an effort to make amends  the only problem is that instead of a meeting in a normal setting  the two chose a storage closet instead  which as meyers pointed out  is pretty ironic considering both men are anti gay  that s right  cruz and carson met inside of a storage closet  a moment i m sure both of them  as anti gay rights advocates immediately regretted when they realized that eventually they would have to come out of the closet  together   meyers quipped but cruz hasn t only played dirty tricks against ben carson  his new target has been marco rubio with ploys such as making it appear like rubio and president obama are alike or making up stories about how rubio trashed the bible in front of cruz staffers meyers also noted that even republicans have called out cruz for saying and doing anything to get elected  regaling the audience about how cruz took a pro fireworks stance on a local issue because staffers found  people who would vote for him if he took up their cause here s the video via youtube ever since he won iowa  ted cruz has not fared very well  new hampshire chose donald trump  and even south carolina couldn t stomach ted cruz as the nominee as evangelical voters abandoned him for the billionaire loudmouth  it even looks like he could lose in his home state of texas as newspapers in dallas  houston  and san antonio are endorsing anybody but cruz as the gop nominee  and now cruz is looking more and more like a desperate man whose dream of world domination is slipping further and further away  featured image via raw story
