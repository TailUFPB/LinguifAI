it s freaking awesome to be white in america  as a white person myself  i don t say this because i think white people are superior  no  i say it because white people don t have to deal with this kind of total bullshit on a daily basis in the video uploaded to youtube  a man identified by the free thought project as  year old charles harrell  can be seen on screen with a police officer on a bicycle following closely behind him  you can t be a black man and enjoy your morning  because the police are going to harass you in cincinnati  ohio   harrell explained   walking down the street  the cop just asked me if i have a problem  off camera the officer  identified as baron osterman  can be heard telling harrell that he crossed against the light on the deserted street  sir  you were scaring me  sir  i don t know why were following me  anyway   harrell replied   you were following me all the way down the street  if you watch the video  the cop was following harrell obviously looking for a reason to stop him  as soon as he crossed against the light  the officer leapt into action to deal with the dastardly crime of drinking coffee while black jaywalking  harrell is arrested because he had the gall to stand up for his civil right not to be harassed for no reason whatsoever here s the video  i m  years old and i have literally never been stopped by a cop while walking in my life except that one time i jumped a turnstile in high school  this is why it s awesome to be white in america  the cops don t see you as you go about your life and you don t see them  but if you re black  especially a black male  you have a giant neon sign over your head that says  caution  potential criminal  most white people don t understand this reality at all  even white people like me that do understand it only do so on an intellectual level  the closest i can get to understanding it on an emotional level is this you know that feeling of dread you get when you re driving and a cop car gets in your lane behind you  your heart rate goes up and you get nervous  did you forget to signal a turn  is one of your lights out  are you speeding  what does he want  what  what  now imagine the cop car is always behind you everywhere you drive and if you sneeze the wrong way  those flashing lights are going to turn on instantly  that s what i imagine it must be like to be like to be black in a heavily policed community  oh  and as a bonus  instead of getting a ticket  there s a good chance you ll get the shit beaten out of you  arrested or shot  or possibly all three  also  you ll be called a nigger thug  and smeared by the  liberal  media if there s even a single picture of you holding a beer until we stop pretending that black people bring all this trouble on themselves  america s race problem will never go away featured image via screencap
