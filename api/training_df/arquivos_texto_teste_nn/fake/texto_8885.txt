maine s republican governor paul lepage became a statewide embarrassment yet again this week when he decided to blame the problem of drugs on black drug dealers from out of state on the very same day state lawmakers were debating whether to file impeachment proceedings for lepage s previous offenses  and there are many   the tea party conservative was attending a town hall meeting where he decided to go way off script and float an outrageous theory about black people targeting maine s white women  these are guys with the name d money  smoothie  shifty  these types of guys  they come from connecticut and new york  they come up here  they sell their heroin  they go back home  incidentally  half the time they impregnate a young  white girl before they leave  which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road  the comments were so unbelievable that several news outlets quite literally refused to believe it had even happened  that is until maine s public access channel aired the video universally loathed   lepage has the distinction of being hated by both democrats and republicans who know him   and already facing a strong possibility that he will be kicked out of office for a series of offenses that span everything from calling obama a racist to verbally threatening a democratic colleague during a legislative meeting  lepage s seasoned team of spindoctors got to work trying to frame this as anything other than what it actually is  more so than ever before  the need to lie about what happened was dire  lepage s job is on the line his team offered up this nonsensical word salad  the governor is not making comments about race  race is irrelevant   steele said   what is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers  his heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood  too  we need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state  then lepage  getting truly desperate  went ahead and implied that he was not racist  just really  really stupid  i was going impromptu and my brain didn t catch up with my mouth   gov  paul lepage said  he said he meant to say  maine  girls and not  white  girls when he made the  slip up  it was not intended to be race   he added   it was intended to be maine  are you buying it  don t for one thing  the video makes it clear that saying  young white girls  was no slip of the tongue  watch it again  he didn t stumble over his words  he didn t misspeak  when he got on the topic of drugs  he immediately jumped to the poor  white girls  if lepage is guilty of any mistake it s that he accidentally said out loud what he clearly believes but knows better than to admit to  for a guy like lepage  who has spent his time in office viciously attacking the poor and making ugly racial comments  the idea that black drug dealers would be coming to impregnate his state s white women is a racist trope that fits right in to his worldview even members of his own party seem to recognize that this isn t a mere  slip up   but represents the acknowledgment of long simmering racist views that he uses to base his conservative policies on  one republican critic  lance dutson  didn t mince words   this is one of the most blatantly racist statements he s ever made  the scariest part  he said  one of
