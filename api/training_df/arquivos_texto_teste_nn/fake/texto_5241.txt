during an interview on abc s this week  republican presidential candidate donald trump was questioned by the show s host  george stephanopoulos  about russia s involvement with crimea  trump s answer is so completely ignorant that it definitively proves that trump has a childlike understanding of current foreign affairs while being questioned about vladamir putin and the gop s stance regarding ukraine  trump insisted that putin is not moving into crimea   despite the fact that putin had already moved into crimea in   he s not going into ukraine  ok  just so you understand  he s not going to go into ukraine  all right  you can mark it down  you can put it down  you can take it anywhere you want   trump said  well  he s already there  isn t he   stephanopoulos responded trump said  ok   well  he s there in a certain way  but i m not there  you have obama there  and frankly  that whole part of the world is a mess under obama with all the strength that you re talking about and all of the power of nato and all of this  in the meantime  he s going away  he takes crimea  trump then seemed to imply that russia had a greater claim to the crimean than the ukraine  i m going to take a look at it   trump said   but you know  the people of crimea  from what i ve heard  would rather be with russia than where they were  and you have to look at that  also   just so you understand  that was done under obama s administration  trump went on to say  and as far as the ukraine is concerned  it s a mess  and that s under the obama s administration with his strong ties to nato  so with all of these strong ties to nato  ukraine is a mess  crimea has been taken  don t blame donald trump for that  trump  at no point during the line of questioning stephanopoulos gave him regarding the ukraine  seemed to know what he was talking about  he appears to have no knowledge of one of the biggest events to happen so far in the  century you can watch the relevant part of the interview below   realdonaldtrump to  thisweekabc  putin s  not gonna go into ukraine  all right  you can mark it down    thisweek https   t co   abc news   abc  july    image via video screen capture
