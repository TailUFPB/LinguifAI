if donald trump captures the republican nomination  at least one gop senator is planning on doing the unthinkable in what would be a huge condemnation of the republican party  nbc anchor chuck todd reported on tuesday night that a sitting republican senator will actually endorse democratic candidate hillary clinton if trump wins the gop nomination just think about that for a second for years  republicans have shifted far to the extreme right  so much so that they have allowed candidates like trump  cruz  and rubio to rise to power within the party  they also hate and have refused to work with president obama  and have hated hillary clinton even longer republicans even launched partisan investigations of benghazi all in an effort to hurt clinton at the polls if anyone had told me a year ago that a republican senator will endorse clinton for president in   i would have had a good laugh for days but as super tuesday unfolded last night  chuck todd announced he had heard  real speculation today from very informed people that at least one republican senate incumbent  if given a choice  might publicly endorse hillary clinton  yes  you heard that right  the question of where have all the moderate republicans gone has now been answered  so terrifying is the prospect that trump could be president that republicans are seriously looking at hillary clinton as the only choice to prevent insanity from taking over the government todd continued by explaining that it must be a republican who is running in a blue state and that they may not really want to endorse clinton but they need to do so in order to distance themselves from trump and the disaster he represents for america and the gop  an incumbent senator  there s at least one that i ve heard that could end up doing that  making that choice  not because they want to  but because they need to send that message  look  there s a bunch of them running for re election in blue states  okay  that s what s going on here  and on the day that the republican front runner might cement his lead  here s the video via youtube in other words  republicans are beginning to understand that a trump nomination could spell doom for other republicans on the ticket  which means the senate and the house are up for grabs  the democrats could sweep to power in congress  not just because republicans are do nothing obstructionists  but because their candidate for president is an extremist who is hurling racism  sexism  and hate at every rally much to the amusement of the conservative base if a sitting republican senator is truly willing to support clinton simply for political survival  then it looks like the gop is about to get their asses handed to them in november like never before  and then they ll definitely have to change their ways if they ever want to occupy the white house again featured image via wikimedia
