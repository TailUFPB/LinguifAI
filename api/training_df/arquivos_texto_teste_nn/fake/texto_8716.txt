the occupation of the malheur wildlife reserve in harney county  oregon  has now reached the two week mark  and there are no signs of a coming resolution  many people want this over and done with  especially those whose lives have been disrupted by the presence of cliven bundy s sons and a bunch of other pathetic wannabe  patriots   well now  the founder of another militia group  the oath keepers  has a message for the authorities who are monitoring the situation stewart rhodes uploaded his warning message to the group s website  and insisted that the government better watch out because there will never again be a free waco   and if they aren t careful there will be  a conflagration so great  it cannot be stopped  leading to a bloody  brutal civil war  while rhodes and his group are deliberately staying out of the bundy situation  his message was no less threatening  in the piece  entitled warning to u s  military and federal leos  do not follow orders to  waco  ammon bundy occupation  or risk civil war  rhodes said  this situation  oregon occupation  must not be handled in a military or paramilitary fashion  using military assets  military rules of engagement  or otherwise attempting to end it suddenly by use of dynamic assault  resulting in catastrophic loss of life  as has occurred twice in recent american history  with horrific results  at ruby ridge in   and at waco texas in    if you do it  waco  style here  you risk pushing this nation over the edge into a civil war  because there are  no more free wacos  this is precisely why  frustrating as it is  these people are still being allowed to occupy this space unlawfully  the authorities have already suggested that another waco is exactly what these idiots want  rhodes went on to say  despite that reality of there being no emergency here  we have very good reason to believe that ideologue leftist bureaucrats within the obama administration   such as within the d o j   and their politically minded  perfumed prince  puppets within the d o d    are pressuring you to prepare to use military assets and military rules of engagement to conduct a dynamic raid  we hear things  we ll just leave it at that  after this warning  rhodes went on to attack the obama administration  as well as president obama  himself  we agree  and therefore we warn you to do this right  no matter what the obama admin overlords try to demand   do it right  or risk starting a conflagration so great  it cannot be stopped  leading to a bloody  brutal civil war  and do it right  because it is your duty to refuse those orders  under your oath to defend the constitution against all enemies  foreign and domestic  and that includes the domestic enemies now  occupying  washington d c  your brothers in heaven are watching   do the right thing   stand down  and refuse to obey evil  ghoulish sociopaths who salivate at the prospect of watching americans die on camera  like they watched during benghazi    he stated   tell them that if they want american patriot blood  they need to strap on a plate carrier  chest rig  and an m  and go do it themselves  that s what these numbskulls don t get  these people are not patriots  they are criminals  this occupation cannot go on forever  something will have to be done  while it is understandable that no one wants to see bloodshed  this cannot continue indefinitely then again  the oath keepers are a fringe group of lunatics much like these bundy idiots  only much more organized  which also makes them more dangerous  hopefully  the authorities aren t listening to a word they have to say  and will move to get these yahoos out of that wildlife refuge so that the local residents can get back to living their lives featured image via screen capture from raw story
