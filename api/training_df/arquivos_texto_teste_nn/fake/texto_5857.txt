normally mild mannered george takei is pissed at gun violence in this country  and he s planning to organize an lgbt army to do something about it in an op ed in the daily beast  the former star trek star and current facebook sensation is beyond upset about the brutal massacre at the pulse gay club in orlando  florida that left  dead and more than  injured  takei  and many in the lgbt community  took the attack personally  why wouldn t they  it was a terrorist attack  but it was also a very specifically targeted hate crime  it was an attack on all lgbt people  takei argues that they were not the only community targeted  though  nearly every casualty was also latino  those two communities is where takei sees opportunity  takei  a liberal  was very fair in his assessment  but he argues that the second amendment is in direct opposition to the first amendment  especially in situations like mass shootings for the average american  it is the first amendment that articulates many of our most basic and fundamental civil rights  freedom of speech and of worship  but also of assembly and association  on sunday  the latter two rights came under direct assault for the lgbt community  there is little doubt  for instance  that the killer targeted his victims out of hate  he intended to strike not just at people  but at a closely knit community  after all  if his goal were sheer bloodshed and horror  orlando boasts far more tempting and  some might even argue  more  sympathetic  targets  the killer apparently had issues with gay people  his father stated that  two weeks prior  his son  got very angry  at the mere sight of two men kissing in public  and even angrier that his own boy should witness it  at the same time  the killer was known to frequent the very establishment he attacked  suggesting that he may have deeply internalized the hate he heard from religious extremists takei didn t give isis a pass  he mentioned that they hate gay people and that the shooter claimed allegiance with the terrorist organization  but the fight to stop gay marriage and the fight to criminalize bathroom usage by transgender people pretty much shows that our attitudes aren t much better takei goes on to say that freedoms  even those guaranteed by the constitution  have limits but this is not so rare a circumstance  indeed  there is no freedom within the bill of rights that is absolute  even freedom of speech  a bedrock of our participatory democracy  has some established limits  i may not jokingly yell  fire  inside a crowded theater  precisely because the value of that speech is heavily outweighed by the danger to others who might panic  nor may i cavalierly libel others without fear of legal repercussions  this is because we have decided  as a society  that the cost of the injuries that might arise outweighs any benefit from the freedom to say whatever i want takei is done with the gun debate  he has no desire to get rid of the second amendment  but he sees no reason everyday american should have assault rifles  he s ready to take on that fight  with a little help from his friends and he feels the lgbt community has spent the past several decades getting ready now this latest and most deadly attack has targeted a group that has spent the last few decades learning how to organize  fight for  and protect its rights  perhaps  then  the next chapter of lgbt history might not be just about the struggle to gain equality for ourselves  but also how we might help lead this country towards a collective right to participate and live free of fear and terror  and ultimately toward a common sense  permanent ban on weapons designed for mass slaughter like it or not  this history and this obligation have been thrust upon us  and we must now rise to its challenge  for if there is one group in this country with more will  more experience  and more tenacity than the nra  it is the lgbt community you don t want to mess with us featured image via slaven vlasic with getty images
