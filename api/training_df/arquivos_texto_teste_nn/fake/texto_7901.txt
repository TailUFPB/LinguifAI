donald trump moved ever closer to securing the republican nomination for president of the united states this week with victory in the nevada caucus there s no way around it   trump thrashed his opponents in nevada  he won a massive    of the vote  knocking marco rubio into  place with just     and cruz in  on     it appears that the trump campaign is unassailable at this point  although a week is a long time in u s  politics graphic via guardianperhaps the darkest moment of the night was when trump actually said these words in his victory speech  we won with poorly educated  i love the poorly educated  there were whopping cheers and applause for this comment  which seemingly bore zero irony  he continued  we re the smartest people  we re the most loyal people  first things first  donald trump is not poorly educated  he attended the kew forest school until  grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the new york military academy  he later won a bachelors degree in economic from the wharton school of business at the university of pennsylvania  so  another total lie from this candidate one reason  poorly educated  might appeal to trump though  is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue  and to fact check arguments  it is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education  but it s an uphill struggle  it s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training  but you d put your money on the doctor every time so  now wonder trump would like to keep america under educated according to leading fact checking site politifact  just   of claims made by donald trump are true  one percent  meanwhile   out of every  statements he makes are absolute lies  let s take a look back at some of those lies they just keep on coming and on the matter of faith  donald trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical  yet  trump has been married three times  pokes fun of holy communion as eating  the little cracker   claims he has never asked god to forgive his sins in his life  and could not name a single passage of the bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture trump is about as devout a christian as bill nye and yet  he is winning evangelical support in droves  why  because the evangelical  christian conservative movement has zero to do with faith in god  and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right wing principles of crony capitalism  white supremacy  homophobia and sexism if this was not the case  trump would be the last candidate that appealed to evangelicals  to any right thinking christian  he is the  century incarnation of the whore of babylon but trump gets a pass for all of this  because under educated people are having their ignorance exploited  and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled  this resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades  they are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate  and they are going to come out in their droves to support him this means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on american soil in a very long time  the reproductive rights of women  the rights of lgbt americans  the rights of non christians  the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault  the rights of victims of gun crime  the rights of non white americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election   every american with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh tstorm of stupidity  bigotry and ignorance   featured image via screengrab
