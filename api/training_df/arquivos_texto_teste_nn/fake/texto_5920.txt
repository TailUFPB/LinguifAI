for months now  republicans and some in the bernie sanders camp have been looking for a smoking gun  a damning piece of evidence that proves  without a shadow of a doubt  that hillary clinton is cheating  the youtube channel  sourcefed  thought they found the smoking gun  when they demonstrated what they thought was irrefutable proof that google was in the tank for hillary clinton  unfortunately  sourcefed has no idea how google works the premise behind the conspiracy theory involves google s predictive search or autocomplete  when users type in partial key phrases  like  hillary clinton cri   other search engines  like bing and yahoo  list as a possible search phrase   hillary clinton crimes   google doesn t here s the video this is what i get when i type in  hillary clinton cri  on google yahoo gives me this bing  this after watching the video  i conducted my own little experiment  surely  if google was in the tank for clinton  it would show up under non predictive search results  right  for example  i typed in the words   hillary clinton  in google  and below the paid content and the standard things on top  like wikipedia  there s a whole lot of negative stuff those are the listings on page one  going deeper into the searches brings up a lot more negative than positive unfortunately  my experiment isn t any more scientific than sourcefed s  but others know more and they say that it s sourcefed that was manipulating the search results  not google  google  which should surprise few  has a more sophisticated search engine than either bing or yahoo  they do sort of manipulate searches  but not to influence public opinion  they don t include unfounded negative listings in their autocomplete options  no matter how many people are searching those rumors  clinton has never been convicted or even indicted of a crime  hence it not showing up  by the same token  entering  donald trump la  does not bring up  donald trump lawsuits   despite the fact that a whole lot of people are searching for information about his lawsuits  it does include  donald trump laughing   though just to test that  i entered  bill clinton i   because we know he was impeached  and surely  if google were manipulating autocomplete results for hillary  then they would certainly do it for her husband  right  wrong remember that bernie sanders rape fantasy essay from eons ago  that absolutely no one should care about  google doesn t care about it either similarly  i did a search for  donald trump bri   half expecting results for his alleged bribery of two attorneys general  nothing the most ridiculous part of the sourcefed allegation  though  is their assumption that people don t continue and enter all the letters and hit  enter   which would bring up numerous rumors  conspiracy theories and allegations  including the accusations of search manipulations by google  you d think they d at least keep themselves from looking bad in their search rankings  right  they don t here s what google has to say about it  claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works  our autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person s name  more generally  our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms   said the statement featured image via youtube
