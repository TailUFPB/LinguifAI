sen  ted cruz  a man whose climate science expertise extends no further than his ability to hold his arm out a window to see if it s raining  tried to troll democrats by proving climate change was wrong in a single tweet   and it backfired massively a vehement denier of climate change who once claimed he was just like galileo because both held unpopular opinions   eyeroll   and who accused the   of scientists who say climate change is real of being liars  cruz caused considerable damage to america s scientific community while he was in the senate  now he is poised to be in the white house  where he could downright derail it with those stakes in mind  over the weekend the democratic party s twitter account took a dig at cruz for brushing off the idea that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming yesterday ted cruz said that  carbon dioxide isn t a pollutant   someone needs to go back to science class  pic twitter com   the democrats   thedemocrats  april     whose philosophy appears to be  well if i m already in a hole  i may as well dig   immediately fired back with of a tweet of his own dems kill jobs  ignore facts   is what every human breathes out  every plant  in turn consumes    sciencefacts https   t co   ted cruz   tedcruz  april    which the scientific community responded in unison   you can t be that stupid  can you  cruz may not be an avid reader  but even a quick google search can debunk his premise conclusively  in an article published in scientific american in  and aptly titled  the worst climate pollution is carbon dioxide   writer gayathri vaidyanathan walks us through the reasons why  as far as climate change goes  the gas that truly matters is carbon dioxide  unlike its shorter lived cousins   sticks around in the atmosphere for decades to centuries  wreaking climate havoc  it has become very clear that if you want to stabilize warming at any level  you have to start talking about phasing out    said joeri rogelj  a research scholar at the international institute for applied systems analysis and lead author of the study   reducing other climate pollution can help in different ways and for different things  but in climate stabilization terms  it s noise on the fact that you have to phase out   here s a simpler experiment ted can do in his own home  take a blanket  put the blanket over your head  breathe in and out  notice how it starts to not feel great  now imagine that on a planetary scale  too much  can be a disaster and it wouldn t be a great place to live the always on point science writer for slate  phil plait  tackled this exact climate denier myth just a few months ago on his blog    so the deniers say  is harmless because it s just what we breathe out  and isn t carbon what all life is based around  how can that be bad this is nonsense  says plait this is a stunning statement  like most denier talking points  there s a germ of truth to it the carbon in living tissue does come in large part from atmospheric  but to say that means it can t be a pollutant is pretty silly for example  our bodies produce formaldehyde naturally  it s a byproduct of the metabolic process  yet the center for disease control and prevention classifies it as a pollutant  why  because too much of it under the wrong conditions is a bad thing as ever  cruz managed to be both wrong and smug at the same time  he s not just ignorant  he s proud of it why does this matter as you may have noticed  last october was the hottest october ever recorded  so was november  so was december  so was january  so was february  so was march  climate change isn t just theoretically possible  it s happening now and more quickly than many scientists ever dared worry it would  this means the time for action is already here  president obama has done several key things to help america play catch up on the war against climate change  first he dumped tons of money into researching alternative energy and america is finally getting serious about solar and wind power  but perhaps most significantly of all  we are beginning to work with other countries around the world to globally combat the worst effects this all goes away with ted cruz  a president cruz not only doesn t believe climate change is worth fighting  he doesn t believe it exists  for four to eight years  america will rollback and dismantle the progress it has made at this crucial time  what this means for the future is the stuff of nightmares but on the bright side  if our cities are flooded and our crops are failing at least president cruz can provide us have plenty of good  healthy carbon featured image via darren hauck getty images
