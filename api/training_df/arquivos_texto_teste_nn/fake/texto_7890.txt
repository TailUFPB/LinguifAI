during an appearance on cnn on tuesday  republican presidential candidate ben carson wondered aloud if his presidential campaign is all a big scam during the interview  a laughing carson told cnn s poppy harlow that his campaign had employed people who didn t really seem to understand finances  a moment later  as if the possibility had just dawned on him for the very first time  carson added   or maybe they did maybe they were doing it on purpose  it s impossible to tell if carson is extremely stupid or extremely good at acting stupid  either way  he would be an extremely terrifying president as addicting info reported in january  ben carson s campaign staff started jumping ship on new year s eve  with more than  of former staffers resigning in a  hour period the resignations followed months of accusations that the candidate s campaign is little more than a money making scheme  which also doubles as a promotional tour to sell books the fact that carson s campaign has been raising money hand over fist  but investing very little in actual campaign activities  was just one indicator that carson s presidential campaign was a hoax as new york magazine pointed out months ago  the carson campaign is  structured much more like a scamming venture than a political one  as evidence  new york magazine also reported  an astronomical  percent of his fund raising totals are spent on more fund raising   bernie sanders  by contrast  spends just  percent of his intake on fund raising   in addition to direct mail  carson seems to have undertaken a massive phone spamming operation  spending most of your money to raise more money is not a good way to get elected president  but it is a good way to build a massive list of supporters that can later be monetized  perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for armstrong williams  the figure running the carson  campaign   is  business manager   as opposed to  campaign manager   it does suggests that carson is engaged in a for profit venture  even more telling  a significant number of the companies hired to run carson s costly telemarketing and direct mail campaigns just happen to be run by friends and family members of staffers then there s the fact that  while carson s fundraising totals surpass that of every other gop candidate  his polling numbers are terrible while carson told cnn that  things are much better  with his campaign now  according to the atlantic  not much has changed the campaign is still spending huge amounts of money on raising more money  diverting millions to businesses like tma direct  which is owned by mark murray  one of carson s top fundraisers according to the atlantic  murray has also long worked with eleventy and infocision  two akron  ohio based companies  infocision has been implicated in past scams  eleventy s president is chief marketing officer for carson  communication management source is run by joanne parker  whose husband dean parker departed the campaign in december  according to the latest financial disclosures  the carson campaign paid eleventy marketing    million in the last quarter  while infocision got a whopping    million  communication management source didn t make out quite as well  being paid    million it s almost impossible to believe that carson doesn t know whether or not his campaign is a scam to bilk low information conservative voters out of millions of dollars his weird  out of place laughter  combined with his sad attempts to convince the public that it s all behind him now  are pretty good indicators that he s more than aware that his campaign is a hoax with the money still rolling in  though  carson is clearly going to try to keep the scam going for as long as he possibly can image from wikipedia
