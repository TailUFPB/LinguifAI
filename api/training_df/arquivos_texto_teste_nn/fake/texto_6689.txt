democracy now  host and award winning journalist amy goodman shredded the corporate media for the role they have played in what goodman refers to as the creation of  trump land  goodman s evisceration of the media s vapid election coverage came in the form of a three minute video spot for aljazeera s millennial focused media project  aj   in the video  goodman points towards the findings in the  tyndall report  which found that abc world news tonight gave donald trump  minutes of media coverage for every one minute of coverage of bernie sanders  campaign across all major news networks  sanders has received  minutes  worth of media coverage compared to trump s equivalent total network coverage of  minutes  as damning as that figure is for the corporate media  it gets worse when considering sanders  record shattering accomplishments goodman mentions one of sanders  accomplishments that is particularly relevant in an era where corporate money largely controls elections  in march  he  raised something like   million dollars  hillary clinton raised  and change million dollars    million dollars  that hasn t been done before  you break every record and there s a blip in the corporate media radar screen  it just shows how astounding it would be if he got anything near the coverage of the other candidates  keep in mind   the vast majority of that cash was raised by small donations from his supporters  which is a feat that would have seemed impossible before the primary election started  sanders has  for the most part  modeled his campaign funding after eugene debs  multiple presidential campaign runs at the beginning of the  century  during those runs  debs only took small campaign contributions from the working class  using the digital tools of the modern age  sanders has proven that the same model can be used effectively to run massive campaigns free from corporate influence  furthermore  the model can be scaled to fit any campaign at any level that means that not only has sanders shattered historical records  but his campaign has completely changed the way political campaigns operate in the future  given his accomplishments  his call for a political revolution should not be disregarded by the left   nor the right for that matter it isn t surprising that the corporate media would wish to shy away from these realities  the system that has led to their dominance as super predators in the media environment is the one that secures their hegemony you can watch the full video below featured image from video screenshot
