if there s anyone who shouldn t be pointing fingers at other men for the mistreatment of women  it s probably donald trump  yet today  trump completely ignored his grotesque track record with women  as well as his own rape allegations for the sake of a childish attack on his rival  democratic front runner hillary clinton in the complete absence of self awareness  trump posted an attack ad on hillary today via instagram  bringing to light past allegations of sexual assault against her husband  former president bill clinton  this isn t the first time trump has attacked the clintons this way  and they ve done a decent job defending themselves  but this time  trump has taken things a step further by actually using recordings of the victims accusing bill  as the ad comes to a close  hillary is heard laughing while ominous music plays in the background you can watch the attack ad below is hillary really protecting women a video posted by donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  on may    at   pdtas hillary has positioned herself as being a champion for women  as she was long before her presidential campaign began   trump feels that his best shot at turning female voters away from the former secretary of state is to highlight her husband s problematic sexual past the interesting thing about this is that trump himself has seemingly forgotten that he has also been accused of rape  in trying to smear the clintons with this nasty ad  trump has ironically and unintentionally made a case against himself  in the   trump s first wife ivana had accused the business mogul of brutally raping her while they were still married  here s what ivana said  which appeared in the trump biography lost tycoon ivanka trump statementand trump s misogynistic attitudes toward women don t stop there  he s been accused of groping women  being super creepy when it comes to sexualizing his own daughter  has attacked numerous female celebrities  personalities and politicians   including fox news  megyn kelly and senator elizabeth warren  and said that women should be punished for seeking abortions  not to mention  there is a never ending list of every misogynistic  sexist thing trump has said or done to women  so while trump is trying to soil the clintons  name  all he s really done is just put a spotlight on himself  there s a reason why almost   of american women don t like the donald  but he seems to live in denial featured image is a screenshot
