jeb bush was  once upon a time in a land far  far away  assumed to be the shoo in for the  gop presidential nomination  then  donald trump happened  and jeb s dreams of presidential glory were crushed  in fact  jeb s campaign is in such trouble now that he had to get his mommy to appear in a political ad reminding everyone that her son should be the gop s annointed one  and that trump is just a big bully well  it s a good thing that as jeb s campaign circles the drain and dies  he has other dreams to fulfill  bizarrely  it s to be a g rated killer on the hit fictional drama about the u s  government  homeland apparently  the series the circus caught jeb admitting on camera that he d like nothing more than to kill people on television  the thing is  though  trump is right about one thing  jeb bush is a lackluster dork who would be nothing more than a laughingstock on that series  in fact  he very presence would likely make it jump the shark  nevertheless  it s highly entertaining to realize the revelation that acting in a television drama is the next best thing to really being potus in jeb s feeble mind give it up  jeb  you ll never appear on homeland  and you ll never be potus  no worries  though  you have plenty of time and money  i m sure you ll find something constructive to do watch the video of jeb s confession below featured image via video screen capture
