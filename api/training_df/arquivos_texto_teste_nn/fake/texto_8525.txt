after getting crushed in the  election  the republican party realized that they needed to appeal to more than just old angry white men  but they didn t do that  instead  they doubled down on anti latino sentiment  then they tripled down  then they played their trump card and that was the end of the gop s latino outreach  now  pew research center has released a study that confirms the republican party is doomed  not only is the fastest growing group of voters latino  millennials  who already dislike the gop intensely  make up the fastest growing segment within that already critical demographic in other words  the people the least likely to vote for republicans are going to be one of the most powerful voting blocks in just a few years  just to make it a little more clear  here s what the growth of latino voters looks like by the millions and almost half of them are millennials  if i were a republican  this graph would make me wake up screaming every night  it s like the grim reaper showed up on my doorstep and said   hola  gringo  i d feel bad for the gop but they really did bring it on themselves  a few years ago  they might have been able to appeal to latino voters  but the last two years have seen a repeat of the exact same short sighted stupidity that drove the black community away from voting republican for the last  years  trump sped up the process considerably but it was already happening  you cannot tell an entire group of people that you hate their very existence and then be surprised when they vote against you republicans have painted themselves into a corner with no chance of escape  in order to rally their aging base  they demonized latinos by pretending immigration was an existential threat of america  they were so successful in this that they cannot  in any way  appeal to latinos without immediately alienating the old angry white people that keep them in office  but without the latino vote  republicans cannot possibly continue to compete at the national level for much longer it s the most delicious burrito of electoral doom imaginable and i can t wait to dig in feature image via pew research
