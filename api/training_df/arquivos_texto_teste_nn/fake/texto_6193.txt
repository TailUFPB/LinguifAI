ever since his gop rivals dropped out of the presidential race and he became the presumptive republican nominee  donald trump has stopped attacking his fellow republicans and focused his childish attacks on his biggest competition   democratic front runner hillary clinton  and of course  he s doing it the only way he knows how   by being a misogynist and attacking her marriage  the only problem is  trump is too stupid to fully grasp the full hypocrisy of what he s doing it s been widely reported that in the past  trump was somewhat close to the clintons   he even invited them to his  third  wedding  but what many don t realize is that the very attacks trump is making on the clintons are things that trump previously defended the political power couple against no one pointed this out better than chuck todd on wednesday morning  when he appeared on nbc s  today  to call trump out for being a  walking contradiction  it was already an amazing segment  with  today  showing some footage of trump calling paula jones  a woman who accused former president bill clinton of sexual harassment years ago  a  loser  the show also aired an old video of trump saying that the way he treated women would prevent him from being president if he were to run  in a statement that has come back to haunt him  trump had said  can you imagine how controversial i d be  you think about  bill clinton  with the women  how about me with the women  can you imagine  in the past  trump had also downplayed bill s monica lewinsky scandal  saying   look at the trouble bill clinton got into  with something that was totally unimportant   and they tried to impeach him  which was nonsense  but now that the stakes are high and trump needs to defeat hillary  his attitude has done a complete    and todd isn t letting him get away with it  to show just how insane it is that trump has continued to slide by with voters despite his lies  todd said  i don t know why people give him a pass on this  i mean  i asked him  i said what trump do we believe  what you said about hillary clinton five years ago  or what you say about her now he has contradicted every single attack he s made on the clintons  you can find sound to contradict it  it doesn t touch him  todd also encouraged hillary to start fighting back against trump s attacks  and to leverage trump s own mistakes to destroy his chances of getting the white house  i think he s counting on this  that the clintons don t want to engage him on this  so he thinks he s got free rein to do it if  hillary clinton  can make the case that  you know what  he s just like every other politician  that is the most dangerous description you can have if you re donald trump   it just hasn t taken hold  you can watch todd take down trump below featured image is a screenshot
