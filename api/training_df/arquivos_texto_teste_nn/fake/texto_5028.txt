adbusters  latest magazine cover definitely lives up to its mission of fighting back against the hostile takeover of our psychological  physical and cultural environments by commercial forces  the cover  which has trump s face plastered across the entire page  has made very creative use of its bar code and trump s head for a cover story about global fascism   and trump is not going to be happy about it  really  nothing could have been more appropriate twitterthis could be a jab at trump for the anti semitic memes he got in trouble for a few months ago  or a statement about his overall leadership style as more of a dictator than a president  either way  the magazine was dead on in calling trump out for his divisive  inflammatory statements and proposals with the donald boasting a bar code mustache meant to represent the facial hair of adolf hitler  adbusters has hit the nail on the head  the magazine s editorial says adbusters issue   takes on the rise of global fascism  exposing the symptoms of a sick and outdated system  by looking at cyber threats  political activism and the current fascist mood dominating eastern europe   the magazine explains  everywhere you look  fascist tendencies are creeping into view as each day our world falls further and further into chaos  have we forgotten the lessons of the past  will we bury our heads into the comforts of virtual reality while egomaniacs capture the imagination of the masses  cool fascismo is an unprecedented exploration into a world where a culture of cool becomes a culture of fear  if that doesn t describe trump perfectly  i don t know what does  we re waiting to see what trump himself has to say about the new adbusters cover  but there s a good chance it ll be a tweet about the magazine being  dishonest   struggling and  sad  featured image via twitter
