 persuasion is so important the resistance has to become a church a church that seeks converts huh    this guy is allowed to spew his propaganda like he s an expert on americans  unreal  did anyone else out there have to listen to that a few times to let it sink in american mirror reports despite trump s obvious successes implementing campaign promises like tax cuts  rooting out isis  and bringing back jobs  giridharadas believes  the resistance  has been effective in  protecting our institutions  in   when you think about   i think resistance was incredibly important  frankly  from my point of view  this president shattered every democratic norm that people on both sides take for granted   he alleged   but if the movement that has done such a good job in  at protecting our institutions only protects our institutions  i think they are going to miss an opportunity  the plan for progressives  giridharadas argues  should be to take the resistance movement to people who allegedly don t like them  tell those folks their way of thinking is wrong  and convince them to join forces against the president  the same president who just cut their taxes notice how not one person on the panel refuted what he said  no fair and balanced here
