the supreme court did something amazing on monday  they decided  with a unanimous conscience  that the principle of  one person one vote  was the way to go in a democratic republic like the united states still reeling from the disastrous decision that struck down the voting rights act in   republicans sought to double down on their assaults on voting rights through racist gerrymandering today  the supreme court gave republicans a well deserved  f you  when they rejected the gop s appeal to a lower virginia court ruling that overturned the redistricted map sending the case back to the lower court  the supreme court basically said they got it right  and see no reason to consider an appeal  thus giving democrats  and the people of virginia  the fairness they deserved and were robbed of in  two years ago  a federal court struck down virginia s newly drawn congressional maps because the drawers packed tens of thousands of black voters into an already heavily black  heavily democratic congressional district  the redrawing  which heavily favored republicans  allowed the gop to win  out of the state s  congressional districts  even though president obama won the state by three points and the electorate was down ticket while it won t capture a majority of the  seats held by republicans  the decision will certainly be turning the  congressional district blue  currently represented by randy forbes  the district will go from having a  percent democratic electorate to a rightful  percent with democrats aiming to take back the house and keep the swing state of virginia blue in november  this decision has come at a very good time looks like another gerrymandering  redistricting ploy from the republicans to steal the elections has gone down in flames  last year  the supreme court smacked down republicans in arizona when they tried to pull the same shenanigans  with arizona s booming hispanic and latino populations  gop control is on the verge of collapsing republicans want to hold onto absolute power  and they are seeing it slip away from them  so they try to cheat to win  and sometimes the supreme court does he right thing and blocks them from doing just that since it wasn t picked up  that means at least  justices  out of eight  or more said no  if scalia was still alive  i wonder if the case would have been picked up  and had it been picked up  how would the court have decided it maybe republicans shouldn t be so quick to turn down a moderate merrick garland confirmation  not that he outcome would have been any different in their favor featured image via win mcnamee getty images
