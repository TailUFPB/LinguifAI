in   florida s government almost shut down when a battle erupted between the republican house and the republican senate  gop senators were fighting to have medicaid expanded to cover more than   floridians  but the house was not interested  ultimately  nearly a million women  men and children were denied health insurance in the state  it was a huge victory for governor rick scott and right wing members of the house of representatives  however  their victory has done nothing to help the people of the state  and now the united states census bureau has released data that proves just how much the citizens could have used that expansion according to census data  nearly half of the counties in florida have high uninsured rates  of the state s  counties   of them uninsured rates of  percent or higher  the associated press reports the counties  which are largely located in central and south florida  have uninsured rates of at least  percent or higher according to  data released by the census bureau the urban counties of orange  miami dade and broward were among those on the list desoto county  a rural county in the state s interior  had the highest estimated uninsured rate at   percent screenshot via census govwhile the state s citizens are forced to suffer without insurance thanks to the legislature s refusal to expand medicaid  lawmakers are the recipients of heavily subsidized health insurance the monthly cost per legislator    a month for a family  or    a year  and   a month  or   a year  for individuals  that s only a fraction of the average monthly family premium paid by most floridians        according to data tabulated by the kaiser family foundation  a nonprofit that focuses on health care issues isn t that nice  florida is the perfect example of how republican policies screw over the average citizen  the gop believes that health insurance is not a right that should be afforded to everyone and meanwhile  they benefit from taxpayer funded health plans  they don t have to worry about how they will pay for a doctor visit if they get sick  they don t have to worry about forking over the full cost of medications  they do not live in fear of an illness bankrupting them  and while they live comfortably  they tell voters that obama s affordable healthcare act isn t working  but leave out the part about how they ve made sure the people in their state do not benefit from it in the same way blue states do  if florida lawmakers would expand medicaid  the uninsured rates would drop dramatically if florida lawmakers would expand medicaid  the uninsured rates would drop dramatically  unfortunately for floridians  they are not doing it because then they d have to admit the program is working and it would take away one of their anti obama democrat talking points featured image via joe raedle getty images
