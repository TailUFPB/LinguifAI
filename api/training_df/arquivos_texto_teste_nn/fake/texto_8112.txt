robert reich  the former secretary of labor under bill clinton  and a very reputable source at that  just came forward and announced there is a mole in the white house  and  that mole has information concerning president obama s selection of the next supreme court justice of the united states  scotus  as you may know by now  republicans are hell bent on doing anything and everything they can to block obama s right to nominate the next scotus  no matter who he picks  well  that s going to be a problem because this pick is absolutely perfect why do we say that  for one  republicans unanimously nominated him just three years ago     to serve on the u s  court of appeals for the d c  circuit  yes  you read that right     how on earth could the republicans deny him now  if you re familiar with the selection  you d know i m talking about judge sri srinivasan  he s asian american and indian american  and would be the first minority from both groups to hold the honor if nominated but  his minority status is not the only reason he s an excellent choice for democrats  he d be almost impossible for the gop to deny  but  don t plan on them not trying  i mean  they just don t care who obama nominates  plain and simple  this is an election year  and they ll fight him at all costs still  his record is hard to deny  obama has called him  a trailblazer who personifies the best of america   he s worked in the justice department under george w  bush for five years  and twelve former solicitors general  including republicans  have endorsed his prior nomination despite his arguing against conservative causes like the defense of marriage act  he didn t think it was constitutional given the fact that it placed limits on same sex couples pic via facebook while the pick is far from finalized  you can be sure to take this pick to the bank  don t expect president obama to twiddle his thumbs for too long on this one  he s ready for a fight  and will pick the best nominee  without a doubt but  just in case you re curious  a few other unofficial names are floating around that would be great nominees as well  and are rumored to be on obama s short list patricia ann millettshe also hails from the influential d c  circuit court of appeals and the senate confirmed her back in  by a vote of    not nearly as impressive as judge srinivasan s unanimous selection  but still a contender given her background  she s  and has a background working in both the bill clinton and george w  bush administrations here s why she would be a wise choice  there s only one other woman that has ever argued more cases before the supreme court   in all  than her  impressive  indeed loretta lynchshe s the attorney general of the united states  she s only been in the position since april   not very long  while we don t believe obama will pick her  it d be impossible not to have her name mentioned in the short time that she s been attorney general  she s already filed a discrimination lawsuit against the city of ferguson and indicted nine fifa executives for their match fixing scandal  if obama picks a woman  it will be the third woman in a row nominated to the court paul watfordsome people are saying this is the most likely selection to replace antonin scalia  but then again  they don t have a mole in the white house like robert reich does watford is an african american and confirmed to the ninth circuit in   he used to clerk for a conservative judge alex kozinski  and he s considered to be a moderate  he s also in his  s  which would make him a long standing member of the court if selected again  though  we stress that none of these nominees were unanimously selected like judge srinivasan  expect obama to go forward with the selection after his administration can gather up enough information on republican s opposition to him  hey  that s what moles are good for featured image via white house
