on tuesday  democratic senator dianne feinstein of california blasted president trump for saying he would move the u s  embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem  feinstein claimed it would be a  terrible decision  even though she previously voted for the embassy to be moved  the hypocrisy of the left doesn t stop there today  president donald trump announced that america formally recognizes jerusalem as israel s capital city  changing decades of u s  policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve  not derail  aspirations for regional peace the critics of donald trump attacked his decision  meanwhile  the truth is  that for decades  some of the most beloved democrats have used the promise of recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel as a way to get votes in   while campaigning for new york s us senate seat  first lady hillary rodham clinton said in a letter  that she considered jerusalem to be the  eternal and indivisible capital of israel  and will be an active advocate   if elected to new york s senate seat   to move the u s  embassy to jerusalem in a letter that became public thursday  mrs  clinton wrote   if i am chosen by new yorkers to be their senator  or in whatever position i find myself in the years to come  you can be sure that i will be an active  committed advocate for a strong and secure israel  able to live in peace with its neighbors  with the united states embassy located in its capital  jerusalem  hillary s not the only one to promise  that if elected  they would move heaven and earth to make jerusalem the rightful capital of israel  as it turns out  bill clinton  george w  bush and barack obama  twice  also made the same promise  the only problem is  none of them had the courage to do it watch when president  realdonaldtrump announced that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel  he fulfilled another campaign promise  in addition to those that go back  years   pic twitter com   dan scavino jr    danscavino  december    s why our courageous president  donald trump was right to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel matthew continetti of the washington free beacon wrote the best article on trump s bold decision to move the us embassy to jerusalem that we have seen to date not only is president trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and begin the process of moving the u s  embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency  it is one of the boldest moves any u s  president has made since the beginning of the oslo  peace process  in   that process collapsed at camp david in  when yasir arafat rejected president clinton s offer of a palestinian state  and the process has been moribund ever since  despite multiple attempts to restart it that is why the warnings from trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow  there is no peace process to wreck  the conflict is frozen  and the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in u s  or israeli policy but in palestinian autocracy  corruption  and incitement  have the former obama administration officials decrying trump s announcement read a newspaper lately  from listening to them  you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the middle east but for trump  in fact  the region is engulfed in war  terrorism  poverty  and despotism  israel faces threats in the north and south  its sworn enemy  iran  is growing in influence and reach  and the delegitimization of the jewish state proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses  i forget how the obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world  maybe someone will remind me one of the reasons the middle east persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been  for decades  a playground of magical thinking  whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the ayatollah khamenei is a good faith partner  whether it is imagining that assad will go just because we tell him to or that isis is akin to a terrorist  jv team   liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the middle east that is much more flattering than the actuality  a similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over jerusalem  every israeli knows jerusalem was  is  and will remain his capital  every recent president has agreed with him  and the u s  consensus has been bipartisan  the last four democratic platforms have said the obvious  that jerusalem is israel s capital  the senate voted   only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city  were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote  was it all virtue signaling  a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of u s  diplomacy it is a sign of the disingenuousness of american foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning  president trump has no background in or admiration for the routines  manners  and norms of the u s  foreign service  especially that part of it which specializes in the israeli palestinian conflict  this has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid  jerusalem is israel s capital  full stop  his transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition  in march   at the aipac policy conference  he pledged that  we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people  jerusalem   his remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro israel community i wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of u s  law as  disruptive   have they not paid attention to this man  donald trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the u s  capital for decades  in this sense  his jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm  he is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion  what trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one  by keeping his campaign promise today  he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the united states could have its cake and eat it too on the question of israel s capital  and by moving our embassy to jerusalem  the united states will acknowledge israel s right to determine its own capital city  that is not something to condemn or fear  it is something to be proud of
