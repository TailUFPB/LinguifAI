donald trump has been called out by yet another foreign leader for his ridiculous plan to build the great wall of  murica  during a facebook live interview by the new york times en espa ol  guatemalan president jimmy morales  a former television comedian  openly mocked the republican s wall trump rose to the top in the republican primary race by promising his supporters that he was going to erect a huge wall to keep latino immigrants out of the country  although he has said that he is going to force mexico  hahaha  to pay for this monstrosity  he has also promised that he is going to have it built really  inexpensively   in order to do that  he is going to need the cheap labor he rails against in all of his speeches  and that is what president morales offered him  to the gentleman who wants to build a wall  i offer cheap labor  we have high quality labor  and we ll gladly build  tell us the dimensions  and we know how to do it  the president could hardly keep a straight face when he offered to help  the gentleman   but he quickly turned serious when he started discussing real immigration policy with the reporter  saying  we believe   although i have no reason to involve myself in u s  migratory policy   we believe that it is necessary to think about migratory reform where many people who are there in an irregular manner will be regularized   he said  morales added that legalizing undocumented immigrants in the united states would benefit the country because they would  contribute more and pay more taxes  he is absolutely right  it would greatly benefit america if we would reform immigration  we have millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country who are contributing to society  but would love to contribute even more   unfortunately  they are unable to do so unless they are legalized republicans like donald trump do not consider that  though  not because they believe it is false  but because it is easier to keep their voting base energized if they have someone to hate  right wing   poorly educated  voters need a scapegoat to blame all of their problems on and immigrants are perfect for that  meanwhile  the gop continues to fan the flames to keep their dumbass base in a constant state fear which sends them back to the polls to vote for the right s candidates  it doesn t matter how much the gop is victimizing their voters by cutting funding for many of the programs that keep food on their tables  as long as they have  others  to pick on  they are happy so  trump will continue to push this great wall of  murica fantasy  his supporters will lap up his rhetoric and world leaders will continue to point their fingers and laugh at us  this is another reason why it is so important to vote blue in november watch the interview below  be warned  it s in spanish  featured image via video screenshot
