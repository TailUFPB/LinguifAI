democratic presidential candidate martin o malley likely never really had a chance against hillary clinton or bernie sanders  but he has to be admired for staying in the race for so long  despite such consistently terrible poll numbers  however  all of that change the night of the iowa caucuses  even before all of the votes were in  abc news tweeted that the former maryland governor is suspending his campaign just in  sources close to martin o malley campaign tell  abc o malley will suspend his campaign tonight    maryaliceparks  abc news politics   abcpolitics  february    to town hall  o malley got less than one percent of the votes at the all important caucus  this result is unsurprising  as nobody really thought that o malley was a serious candidate this is actually a good thing  because it s not like o malley would have had a snowball s chance in hell of winning a general election against any serious gop candidate  even if by some crazy twist of fate he had managed to beat both bernie and hillary in the primary to cinch the nomination in short  martin o malley s candidacy was never anything more than an early election cycle distraction  no matter what one might think of his political positions  the guy was really never going to get very far  and thanks to the stakes being so high with the people we re up against on the crazy right  it s time to focus on the folks who can actually win you had a good run  governor o malley  thanks for doing the right thing at the right time featured image from gage skidmore flickr
