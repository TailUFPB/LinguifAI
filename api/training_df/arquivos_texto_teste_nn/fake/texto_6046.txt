after former secretary of state hillary clinton unloaded on republican presidential nominee donald trump in a major foreign policy speech on thursday  the candidate responded not with substance or facts  but with a petulant tirade focused on how clinton looks and sounds  that was a phony speech   the presumptive republican presidential nominee said at a rally in san jose  calif   that was a donald trump hit job  his response to mrs  clinton s speech seemed to focus more on style than substance  she does not look presidential   he said   my temperament is so much tougher and so much better than her temperament  he crowned the democratic front runner with the insulting title he has long reserved for former rival sen  ted cruz  whom he called  lyin ted  lying  crooked hillary   he said at the rally   she made up my foreign policy  in her speech  which many observers described as the best she has delivered in the campaign  clinton picked apart trump s extreme rhetoric point by point  she plainly explained that  like many across our country and around the world  i believe the person the republicans have nominated for president cannot do the job  she described his ideas as  bizarre rants  personal feuds  and outright lies   and said he is  not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  because  it s not hard to imagine donald trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin  clinton went on to describe president obama s decision to make the call to kill osama bin laden as  as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as i ve ever seen  and contrasted that with  donald trump sitting in the situation room  making life or death decisions on behalf of the united states   she concluded   making donald trump our commander in chief would be a historic mistake  trump didn t respond to clinton s speech on substance  nor did he address the points she made about the style of his decision making  instead he went after how she looks and speaks  thin skin  indeed featured image via youtube
