late show host stephen colbert hilariously took aim at bathroom obsessed republicans on tuesday night and hit the bulls eye colbert began by talking about how anti lgbt conservatives have organized a boycott of target because the company unveiled a policy in which transgender people can use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity  and then he told the audience where he stands on the issue  here s the thing  i don t care if you re male or female  what sex or gender identity someone is  i   and i mean this sincerely   do not want to share a bathroom with anyone  for two reasons  no     and no     colbert began unlike republicans  colbert says when he goes into the restroom he has no desire to look at everyone s genitalia to ascertain whether they are transgender or not  when i am forced to use a public bathroom   which is infrequently  thank god   i go in there with blinders on  i don t know who s next to me  it could be a centaur next to me  for all i know  i don t even like to look at myself in the mirror afterwards  i know what i did  i m there for a surgical strike   get in  get out  minimal casualties  colbert doesn t even care if a famous celebrity or a fan is standing next to him  he simply wants to do his business with no chit chat and get the hell out  i m not there to make friends  if we ve just come out of a movie and you re standing next to me  i don t want to talk about how irreplaceable robert downey jr  is as iron man  i don t care if you re robert downey jr  yourself  second  if you re a fan of mine   that s wonderful   he continued   please don t try to shake my hand in there  because i know what you just shook  also  if there are a bunch of open stalls  don t take the one next to me  it s not the buddy system  with that being said  colbert concluded that republicans are the real weirdos for obsessing so much over who is using the bathroom and what their genitalia is  to all those lawmakers out there who are so obsessed with who s using what bathroom and what plumbing they ve got downtown   newsflash  you re the weirdos  here s the video via youtube colbert is absolutely right  of course republicans are not only obsessed with gay people having sex  they are obsessed with who is using the bathroom  in fact  they actually expect people to inspect the genitalia of other bathroom users and report them to authorities kansas republicans recently introduced a pair of bills granting students    every time they see and report a transgender student using the bathroom  which means they would actually have to look at what each person has between their legs in order to cash in the fact that conservatives even thought of such bills is sickening  and considering that republicans themselves have been arrested for misconduct in bathrooms while not a single transgender person has committed such a crime  it makes one wonder why we don t have laws banning conservatives from using public restrooms  after all  they seem to be the only ones who can t control themselves featured image via screenshot
