as one of antonin scalia s last rulings on the supreme court  he made the argument that black students should be discouraged from attending top ranked schools because they probably couldn t keep up  instead he suggested they be sent to  slower track schools  like  say  community college or lesser universities so they could shoot for mediocrity  it was an appallingly racist statement  from a sitting supreme court justice no less  and one that flies directly in the face of the lived experience of one of the most successful african americans of all time  barack obama on the way to the white house  obama overcame racism and adversity to thrive at two top shelf schools   harvard and the university of chicago   and that education helped propel his career into law and eventually politics  it s hard to imagine obama one day becoming president if he had taken scalia s advice and settled on a  slower track  community college so  it hardly seems surprising that obama isn t planning on cancelling his packed schedule to attend the funeral of a man  however important  that viewed people of his skin color as less competitive than their white counterparts  it s also a long standing tradition that either the president or the vice president attend the funeral of a justice  not both  biden already announced that he was going four out of the past seven funerals for a supreme court justice have either had the president or vice president in attendance former president george w  bush attended the funeral for chief justice william rehnquist former president bill clinton attended the funerals for former chief justice warren e  burger and justice william brennan but did not attend the funerals for justices harry blackmun or lewis f  powell jr former vice president al gore attended the funeral for justice thurgood marshall so for any other president this wouldn t be a big deal  but it s obama  and republicans are republicans  the freak out has already begun while fox news has devoted wall to wall outrage directed at obama for not going to scalia s funeral  he ll be in cuba working out the details to zeitgeist shifting thawing of relations with america s once sworn enemy   kind of a big deal   sen  ted cruz managed to amp up the hysteria to  while desperately clawing his way to second place in south carolina on the campaign trail  cruz decided that he would accuse obama of being an atheist  we ve got  more months of watching damage to this country  from a lawless and faithless president who is eager to travel to cuba  but is unwilling even to show up at the funeral of justice antonin scalia  this is a stark change in cruz s earlier remarks that said it was irresponsible to  speculate on the president s faith   it does  however  pander to the beliefs of the toxic fanatics at the very heart of the republican party  to them  obama will always be a kenyan  socialist  muslim atheist no matter how many times he celebrates christmas or mentions his faith in speeches cruz s shameful remarks come at a time when he is trying to woe many conservative christians to support his campaign  in fact  his entire base is built on christian extremists  suggesting that obama is a godless heathen is exactly the sort of thing that would get them fired up enough to vote for a sleazeball like cruz ironically  cruz s remarks come at a time where he and his fellow ideologues are melting down over the fact that the pope called donald trump s plan to build a massive cement wall across the entire southern border un christian  conservatives blasted the pope for pointing out the obvious and suggested it was offensive for someone to speculate about another person s faith  in other words  the sheer amount of hypocrisy being generated by the republican party could power the sun but perhaps there is just a twinge of jealousy in this mudslinging knowing that when obama does go to church he takes us to church feature image from gage skidmore flickr
