on thursday  over  latino celebrities including benjamin bratt  america ferrera  george lopez  aubrey plaza  zoe saldana and carlos santana released an open letter through the people for the american way  the letter was addressed to the latino community concerning the republican candidates running for racist in chief and it explained  very simply  that the republican party has committed electoral suicide the candidates cannot come back from these hardline stances  trump is certainly an outlier for his racist remarks  but the rest of the republican presidential candidates went off the deep end with him our communities have the power to decide who wins in the  election  we hope that power is used to vote for candidates who support our community  share our values  and will fight for working families  neither trump nor any of his fellow republican candidates meet that standard even if the eventual republican nominee backtracks on his or her anti immigrant sentiments  we must not forget that we ve now seen that in the face of bigotry  the republican candidates have chosen to turn their backs on our community  the current slate of gop candidates has proven to us that they ve joined and embraced the party of trump this is exactly why i ve been so excited about trump s campaign  in previous elections  the  liberal  media helped republicans maintain the fiction that they weren t xenophobic bigots  but with the coming of trump  that s all over  he s been so open about his loathing for latinos that the other candidates have been forced to abandon their coded language in order to compete for the attention of their breathtakingly racist base this  in turn  has made it perfectly clear to the latino community that the republican party is not interested in them in the slightest but rather only in  pandering to the anti immigrant base of the republican party that idolizes donald trump  the longer this goes on  the worse it will get and it must go on because racism and hate is all republicans have left anymore  if republicans try to appeal to latino voters in any way at all  their base will instantly revolt  they are caught in a trap of their own making and it is truly a glorious thing to behold in an individual statement  america ferrera said  it s critical that all americans  and especially american latinos  stand up to the misrepresentation of our communities coming from donald trump  ted cruz  marco rubio  and any other candidate running on a platform of xenophobia and fear mongering  the way to do that is to show up on election day  and that means young latinos have to register and vote  we have the numbers and potential to make a difference  this  of course  is the gop s worst nightmare come true  latinos voting en masse would take power away from the poor  oppressed white people of america carlos santana sent a more hopeful message to republicans that will   fall on deaf ears  to donald trump and the republican candidates spirit requires integration and total acceptance of everyone on this blessed planet  i invite you to utilize your power of wealth  to restore  amend and heal your relationship with all your sisters and brothers  it s never too late to graduate from the university of fear  i believe in you  your light can make a difference on our great nation when the power of love replaces the love for power  divinity is who you really are   light  peace to you  your families and all your immigrant employees  i ve said this many times before and i ll keep saying it  there s a reason the black community votes    democratic and it s not because democrats have made the black community a top priority  they haven t and it s an uphill battle to get democrats to do more for their black voters  even knowing that  the black community votes democratic because they know  as sure as the sun will rise  that the republican party hates them with every fiber of their beings  republicans are not indifferent like democrats  they are actively hostile and work to make things worse for the black community whenever and wherever possible now the latino community is learning the same lesson  republicans are no longer content to mostly ignore the latino community  they are going out of their way to demonize it and are openly planning to hurt latino families to appease their rabidly racist base republicans have awoken the sleeping giant and they re going to pay dearly for it in the very near future  featured image from hdstockphoto
