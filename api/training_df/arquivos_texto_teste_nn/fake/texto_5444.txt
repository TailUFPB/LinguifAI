florida s toxic and dangerous  stand your ground  gun culture nearly claimed the lives of two more children  their only  crime  appears to have been that they were playing the popular pok mon go mobile game a gun owner in palm coast  florida  heard a noise at   in the morning  looked outside and saw a white car parked outside his house he grabbed his handgun and went outside to investigate  as he came up to the car  he overheard one of the two teens say  did you get anything   troiano said that s when the man stepped in front of the vehicle  thinking they had possibly broken into his home  raised his gun and ordered them not to move  officials said the vehicle sped towards him and he moved out of its path  he then fired rounds at the vehicle because he said it  was attempting to strike him   troiano said the next day the mother of the teens  ages  and   called police to tell them that the teens hadn t told her what had happened until they discovered a flat tire and bullet holes in the rear tire  hubcap  and fender florida s  stand your ground  law is part of what is called the  castle doctrine   it is the result of a lobbying campaign by the nra and the right wing group american legislative exchange council  alec  to push dangerous gun policies in the states  the  stand your ground  doctrine is on the books in  states as a result it essentially gives shooters carte blanche to fire at and kill people without being prosecuted  they simply have to say they felt threatened within their home and escape being prosecuted for murder or civil liabilities in a lawsuit related to the incident  stand your ground  most notably was invoked in the trial of george zimmerman for the shooting death of teenager trayvon martin  a case that also occurred in florida if the teens playing pok mon go had been killed in this incident  it is highly possible that the shooter could have invoked the law and escaped prosecution for their death  the mix of silly teens playing a video game and an easily accessible gun could have been a disaster featured image via youtube wikimedia
