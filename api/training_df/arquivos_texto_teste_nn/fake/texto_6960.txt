bill nye was this close to participating in a debate on climate change with sarah palin  only to find out that he wasn t invited to the panel  but in a recently aired teaser for an interview with marc morano  the organizer of the climate denial panel  it s obvious to see why the group was terrified to let nye on the stage with an intellectual lightweight like sarah palin   nye mopped the floor with morano s tired arguments and didn t even break a sweat in a two and a half minute clip of a lengthier interview  nye gets morano  a man whom media matters named the  climate change misinformer of the year  in   to admit that the world is warming  then he asks the outspoken denier to put his money where his mouth and winds up demonstrating just how little confidence morano has in his own radical position nye  would you take the bet   will be among the hottest of the last  years and that   and  will be the hottest decade on record morano  no  i would agree with both of those  but i would say it s a meaningless stat because it s tenths of a degree nye points out that even tenths of a degree each year means major changes in climate over the next few decades  morano  who comes from the school of  let future generations worry about it  is again stumped when nye flips the narrative by focusing on his children and the future he is building for them  bear in mind  your reputation in the mainstream is a guy who will do almost anything to win  your children go to school  they have access to the internet  they see your history  what you ve said about people  your publishing of emails  you ve even encouraged harassment  i agreed to do this interview because i think it will expose your point of view as very much in the minority  and very much not in our national interest and not in the world s interest  and as i say again  i m very concerned about your kids  morano is known as the guy who most vehemently pushed the bogus story that climate scientists were faking data to promote the climate change agenda  he operates almost exclusively outside of reality  last year he threw an epic temper tantrum on fox news after learning that google planned to tweak their search algorithm to account for  factual validity  because he assumed  correctly  let s be fair  that his work would be pushed to the very bottom the full time propagandist recently produced and hosted a new documentary called  climate hustle  which he and friend sarah palin have billed the right wing s response to al gore s oscar winning an inconvenient truth  morano said the film  delivers a powerful presentation of dissenting science  best of all  in a humorous way   adding   this film may change the way you think about  global warming   according to an exclusive by variety  palin will be participating in an event that features a screening of the film and then a panel discussion afterwards  it will be hosted by republican rep  lamar smith of texas  another denier  and palin   who once described oil  gas  and minerals as  those things that god has dumped on this part of the earth  for mankind s use instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations  they re not exactly playing with a full deck nye has a reputation for tearing ignorant opponents to shreds during debates  he recently put on a master class during a much publicized debate with creationist theme park owner ken ham  in which he not only emerged the victor  but probably even changed a few minds in a crowd of deeply religious ham fans nye already seems pretty confident that despite not being invited to appear in person  his interview with morano says it all  on twitter  he trolled morano after the teaser for the contentious interview between the two aired showing that morano would not accept nye s bet of    climate denier  extreme doubter  won t take the bets  cause he knows what s up re  global temperatures  https   t co ojfuodpomb  bill nye   billnye  april    was originally reported that nye would be in attendance at the event to square off against palin  this unfortunately isn t true  instead  audiences will get to listen to palin ramble on about polar bears and drill  baby  drill with nobody there to call her on her misinformation  it is  without a doubt  a major missed opportunity featured image via getty
