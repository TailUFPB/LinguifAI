in what is seriously turning into a bromance for the ages  donald trump is now apparently turning into new jersey gov  chris christie s sugar daddy  instead of a regular old campaign appearance like he s been doing across the nation  at one rally stop in new jersey at the lawrenceville national guard armory trump will be charging   per person to raise money for christie s debt from his failed presidential campaign if that sounds weird  it s because it is  trump is now doing pretty substantial favors for christie and it definitely makes one wonder what s up political science professor brigid harrison from montclair state university said  this is really unique in its character  this is akin to hillary clinton holding a rally to pay off bernie sanders  debt  or to barack obama holding a rally to pay off hillary clinton s debt in   and while it wouldn t be unusual if trump had thrown a fundraiser for the explicit purpose of helping out christie  doing so with a rally is found to be very odd by experts and according to nj com  trump will also appear at a second  private fundraiser thursday for new jersey s republican party  which still has    in debt related to legal bills from the george washington bridge scandal that engulfed christie s administration  tickets for that event      looks as though trump is really starting to embrace the republican party and now realizes the need for donations and contributors  all this while he still claims to be an outsider  but looks to be squirming his way into the infamous  establishment  likely noting it s in his best benefit moving forward towards november  he s a businessman and likely sees all of this as some form of deal  because it is  it also makes one wonder what role christie would have within a trump administration  because it s becoming more and more obvious that may be the course of action who knows  really  and hopefully we ll never have to find out featured photo by sean rayford getty images
