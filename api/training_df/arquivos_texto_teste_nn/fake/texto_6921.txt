could anyone  in a million years  ever see bobby jindal doing the right thing and barring discrimination against lgbt citizens  that would be a no  because the rabidly anti gay governor would rather pander to the religious right but thankfully  louisiana s new governor  a democrat  has morals  and those morals include protecting all citizens from hurtful discrimination john bel edwards  who was elected last november against serial adulterer david vitter  signed a non discrimination executive order which overrode an executive order put into place by jindal that expanded provisions in a bill that allowed for a more rigorous approach to  religious freedom   edwards slammed jindal as pandering to  a narrow political agenda  although the anti discrimination executive order doesn t pertain to private businesses  it does ban discrimination against state employees and workers hired by state contractors the action  however  does allow exemptions for certain religious organizations and churches  edwards addressed this concern  saying in a statement while this executive order respects the religious beliefs of our people  it also signals to the rest of the country that discrimination is not a louisiana value  but rather  that louisiana is a state that is respective and inclusive of everyone around us contrast john bel edwards to governors pat mccrory and phil bryant  if this isn t enough evidence as to why it s so important for democrats to get out and vote  i don t know what would be  as lgbt citizens across the south  and elsewhere  face intense attacks on their identity  louisiana s democratic governor stepped up and did the right thing   in  heavily conservative and unpredictable state  edwards risks not just his own career  but those who support his actions risk theirs as well that s real leadership  like jindal s pandering  bryant and mccrory serve only to do just that   pander  in their conservative states  they are safeguarded by the religious right and the tea party activists who cheer on discriminatory legislation if the deeply religious  catholic john bel edwards can see past religious pandering to do the right thing  so can any other politician featured image via screen shot from campaign ad
