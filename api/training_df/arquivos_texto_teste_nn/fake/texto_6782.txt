this why the founding fathers wanted separation of church and state ever since conservative  christians  pushed congress and president truman to pass a law establishing a national day of prayer in   christian fundamentalists have made every effort to force their religious beliefs down the throats of every american despite a ruling by the seventh circuit court of appeals in   which says the national day of prayer is unconstitutional because the constitution bars congress from making any law that respects an establishment of religion  the national day of prayer persists  it s a religious exercise that serves no purpose in our secular government  and it alienates people who are non religious and people who do not worship the christian deity it also forces the president to sign a proclamation every year declaring the observation of the day  which means an atheist president would be forced to recognize religion every year in direct violation of the first amendment republicans have been particularly crazy about inserting religion into government  and an alabama republican wrote a disturbing resolution this year that demonstrates precisely why we need separation of church and state gop state rep  mack butler wrote up a national day of prayer resolution that demands america turn into a christian nation that bans abortion and returns to  traditional values   which one assumes includes banning same sex marriage and outlawing contraception as well as forcing non christian citizens to convert against their will  he even goes so far as to call the citizens of alabama  wicked  and called upon them to pray to prevent god from punishing them and the country here s the full text of hjr  whereas  god has blessed america  where freedom exists for all  regardless of belief or creed  and whereas  america s heritage is a beacon to the world  a shining city on a hill  and whereas  america s exceptionalism was not only on a thoroughfare for freedom beat  but a leader and protector of values and safety around the world  and whereas  though american s sovereignty did not and would not rule the world  rather than a colonial power  she shared her bounty  and whereas  america has turned from her values  she is engaged in practices antithetical to her heritage by not protecting the poor  defenseless  and unborn  and has permitted the law to discriminate pitting one s rights against the rights of others  and whereas  america now sits in her sanctuary while the rest of the world is falling into turmoil with genocide against christians and radical islamic terrorists wreaking havoc  and whereas  america s judeo christian tradition recognized a freedom of religion  the first freedom  that let all religions coexist  and whereas  traditional values have been removed from the public square where all values were once spoken  and whereas  religious freedom is threatened and god is mocked  and whereas  just as jesus observed when he drew close to jerusalem before his crucifixion and wept over the city that thought it knew of the things made for peace  it was now hidden from their eyes and just as high government officials often invoke the name of god  yet they tempt god by abandoning his truths  and whereas  america must reaffirm her freedom and her faith  and be it resolved by the legislature of alabama  both houses thereof concurring  that we urge america to reaffirm and protect its freedoms  be it further resolved  that the fifth day of may   be set aside as a day of reflection by the citizens of the state of alabama who will humble themselves and pray and seek god s face and turn from their wicked ways so that god will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their land america faces many problems including the threat of terrorism  climate change  income inequality  and being overtaken by the rest of the world when it comes to education  just to name a few  alabama faces serious budget issues as well as healthcare and education issues  yet all conservatives want to do about it is pray rather than construct and pass legislation that solves the problems  they literally believe that believing in god is all we need to do and all of our problems will magically be solved  this is counter to the hopes of the founding fathers that our government would lead by the use of reason  if we want to solve the problems our country faces  the first thing that needs to happen is to kick religion out of government once and for all  we need lawmakers  not preachers  then we can get to work dealing with our problems constructively instead of pretending that some invisible deity will come to our rescue  when a religion is good  i conceive it will support itself  and when it does not support itself  and god does not take care to support it so that its professors are obligated to call for help of the civil power  it s a sign  i apprehend  of its being a bad one    founding father benjamin franklin
