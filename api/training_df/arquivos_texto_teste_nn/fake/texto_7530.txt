by now  everyone has heard of the violence and chaos that got a donald trump rally cancelled in chicago  illinois on friday  trump is  of course  furious  and is blaming the events of the evening on the protesters  and even bernie sanders  instead of looking in the mirror and realizing that he is the one who created such a toxic  hate filled environment in the first place  now  he is doing what he does best and threatening anyone who dares to exercise their first amendment rights and protest his hateful rallies in a speech in kansas city  missouri saturday evening  the donald took protesters to task  and decided that the only way to silence them is to take legal action  he told his crowd of rabid fans  i hope these guys get thrown into a jail  they ll never do it again  it ll destroy their record  they ll have to explain to mom and dad why they have a police record and why they can t get a job  and you know what  i m gonna start pressing charges against all these people  and then we won t have a problem  trump then tried to make himself look better  by saying that they re probably good kids  i don t want to ruin people s lives  but the only way we re gonna stop this craziness is if we press charges  because then their lives are gonna be ruined  they re gonna know their lives are gonna be ruined  so i ll just tell you folks  from now on  if you do anything  we re pressing charges  okay  so  now  he really is going full on fascist  don t like people protesting  have them arrested  they should not be there  as far as he is concerned  at this rate  we might as well just burn the constitution to ash in donald trump s america watch the full speech below featured image via addicting info archives
