ted cruz is horrible  according to former classmates  he spent his time in college hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe  and leaves a greasy film behind on all he touches  his own daughter seems to be repulsed by the very thought of expressing affection toward him  on wednesday  msnbc s chris matthews may have solved the puzzle of the texas senator s general horribleness  there s a troll like quality to cruz   matthews told joe scarborough during a panel on the topic of cruz s ability to challenge trump   he operates below the level of human life  that s a little tough   scarborough replied   you have not gotten sleep  we re going to try that again  can i not have an opinion   matthews asked  before being told by scarborough   not that opinion   matthews attempted to better explain his position in a manner that even joe scarborough can grasp  which is a difficult task  i think he appeals to people s negativity rather than their joy  i don t think people feel good about voting for cruz  i think they feel   i don t know what it is he appeals to  people say he inherited the libertarian crowd  i don t see how  he doesn t seem libertarian to me  he s appealed to the baptists up here  i don t understand that  what is he  a theocrat  maybe he is   the matthews continued   there s something about that guy who has always reminded me of joe mccarthy  and there s something about him that s negative and menacing  when i say below the level of human life  i mean the good nature of human life  not just being a person   he said  explaining that the  hopeful simply doesn t have a human side that pretty much explains ted cruz  he s human  certainly  in that he has flesh and breathes and probably has feelings sometimes  but he is terrible at displaying it  like rubio  he comes off as robotic  but unlike rubio  everything about him seems disgusting and evil watch the hardball host reveal cruz for who he is below featured image from screengrab
