if you happened to see the university of maryland s press releases touting the benefits of  fifth quarter chocolate milk for athletes suffering from concussions  you might have wondered if it was an april fools joke according to those press releases  university researchers discovered that chocolate milk  helps improve the cognitive and motor functions of high school football players  even after suffering concussions  not just any chocolate milk will do  though  the university s press releases claimed that a specific brand  fifth quarters  stands head and shoulders above other brands of chocolate milk when it comes to boosting the brain power of athletes and concussion sufferers a press release posted in july of last year read more like a late night infomercial hosted by dr  oz   rather than a university press release titled  super natural cows make the best sports recovery drinks   it touted  not just best the benefits of fifth quarters chocolate milk  but the benefits of capitalism too  proclaiming the magic formula for the ultimate sports recovery drink starts with cows  runs through the university of maryland and ends with capitalism according to the press release  which has since been removed from the university s website  but is still accessible through google cache richard doak and kurt williams stood behind a fence at a high school football game in the mountains of western maryland and wondered why kids were getting injured more often  if it wasn t their training  they thought  then it had to be their nutrition next they did what any good parents would do they conducted research  created a solution and started a company so athletes everywhere could benefit from their discovery if you think this sounds more like a cheesy advertisement than a summary of academic research  you wouldn t be alone it gets worse according to the press release  doak and williams were surprised by what they discovered  the freshest milk legally possible  from the best cows  provided more of what athletes  bodies need than any artificial commercial drink  protein  grams  as much as most whey drinks  along with a special kind of protein that remains available for hours after drinking it  electrolytes far more than products on the shelf  and calcium and vitamin d for strong bones  they added natural cane sugar and cocoa to make it tasty for kids and to restore glycogen to muscles but of course they needed proof of this that s why they gave the university of maryland    to conduct  research  through umd s industrial partnership s program to understand what that program is  and what it means to the future of independent and ethical research  look no further than the school s own description of it  which cites  academic industrial  public private partnerships  in other words  this is a program that conducts privately funded research on behalf of businesses and corporations in this case  the ethical problems were entirely obvious without releasing any details on the study  the press release proclaimed that jae kun shim  a professor of kinesiology in the school of public health  conducted a year long study to test how well fifth quarter fresh aides the post exercise recovery of muscular endurance compared to other popular sports drinks  it outperformed competing products by   percent  it included the following remarks from professor shim  i knew they had a high quality milk with less damaged protein  and more electrolytes  but i didn t expect it would make much difference for strength endurance recovery  there are many studies out there that show the cardiovascular recovery benefits from milk based products  but this data is unique because we are showing that the muscular endurance recovery from this chocolate milk is significant  our data suggests that athletes may be ready faster and better for the next game or practice if they drink fifth quarter fresh chocolate milk  and that s not all folk  according to industry spokespersons  who had a heavy hand in both the research and the press release one secret to making higher quality milk  doak and williams discovered  is in the cows jerseys and guernseys whose milk innately has higher amounts of protein  electrolytes  calcium and carbohydrates than the milk we typically buy in stores  store milk is produced primarily by holsteins  which comprise  percent of the herds in the u s  simply because they produce more milk per cow it went on to claim  jerseys naturally produce the highest quality milk for human consumption   said erick metzger  general manager of national all jersey inc   an industry group   compared to average milk  a glass of jersey milk has greater nutritional value  nutrient dense jersey milk tastes better because there are more non fat solids  protein and calcium in jersey milk when compared with other breeds  the university was forced to retract the study  refunding the    it received from fifth quarters and other milk producers  to conduct what professor shim described as a    research project on friday  the university announced the results of the school s internal investigation into the project as cbs news reports here  the university s investigation found a concerning lack of understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research at all levels of the process  you don t say the university of maryland s  chocolate milk cures concussions  research is likely to go down in history as some of the worst corporate funded pseudo science of our time the lack of ethics applied by researchers in this specific study are glaringly apparent  even to the most casual observer the real concern is that this type of corporate funded research is taking place more and more often in the united states  fossil fuel companies pay big money to any  researcher  willing to deny climate change or demonstrate how safe fracking is the pharmaceutical industry funds the research that determines whether or not the products it markets to consumers are safe  while biotech corporations fund research into the safety of gmo  the list of industries buying science goes on and on while we often hear that all this corporate money flowing into america s colleges and universities doesn t influence research  the fifth quarters study shows otherwise  featured image via wikipedia cc
