on friday  during an interview on real time with bill maher  libertarian party presidential nominee gary johnson sat down with bill maher and tried to make the case for a libertarian president  maher brutally mocked johnson and his party s economic beliefs saying that  their economic theory is like mad max takes your gas and you die  the  libertarian party  would be more aptly named the  neoliberalist party   they are both radically conservative on economic issues and radically liberal on social issues  as maher described their views on government saying   i saw your convention  the vision of government is somewhere between colonial williamsburg and atlantis  both maher and johnson cited examples of some of the more unorthodox views some people hold within the libertarian party  johnson mentioned that he was booed at the libertarian national convention for stating that he believes that people should be required to get a driver s license in order for them to be able to drive  maher mentions that the question as to whether  year olds should be able to purchase heroin legally is a major debate between libertarians as nutty as that sounds  johnson insists that here are extremists and loons in every party  while posturing himself as an alternative to people who might be voting for the presumptive republican nominee this november  johnson insists that he is the best non major party candidate to take votes away from trump due to his predicted status of being on the ballot in all fifty states in the  general election the left has fervently hoped that a serious non major candidate would run against trump in the general election  with republicans begrudgingly beginning to rally around trump  it is looking more unlikely that either a serious or protest candidate backing a moderately conservative agenda will come from the republican party whether johnson can run a serious campaign in november will mostly be determined by whether he can make his way into the debates  candidates must be polling at   in order to make it into the debates  johnson is currently polling at    it s unlikely that johnson is going to reach the necessary threshold to join the debates  that being said  he does seem like a reasonable choice for conservatives who cannot hold their nose to vote for hillary clinton and are adamantly a part of the  nevertrump camp you can watch the interview below  in full https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
