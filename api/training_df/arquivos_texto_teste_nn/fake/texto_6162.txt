according to donald trump  joe the plumber was right when he said the only  american  thing we can do is elect a white republican president  emphasis on white  on thursday  the trump campaign somehow managed to lower the bar of decency even more than they already have  speaking on the donald s behalf  his campaign chair made a promise that will make trump s  poorly educated  white supremacist supporters happy   trump will only pick a white man for vice president  regardless of qualifications or other factors  because minorities are apparently incapable of being good at the job  he needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn t want to do   paul manafort told the huffington post   he seems himself more as the chairman of the board  than even the ceo  let alone the coo  there is a long list of who that person could be   the campaign chair continued   and every one of them has major problems  but no matter what their problems  every single one of them is better than those blacks and mexicans  according to manafort  he says that the campaign likely won t choose a woman or a member of any minority group only trump s idiot supporters would view choosing a running mate based on their qualifications for the job rather than sex and skin color  pandering   is this really who republicans want to lead the nation   someone who wants to literally build a wall to keep brown people out of the country  someone who thinks simply being from mexico makes one a drug dealer  someone who tweets out white supremacist propaganda and encourages his supporters to beat up black people at his rallies  even offering to pay their legal fees  featured image via getty images spencer platt
