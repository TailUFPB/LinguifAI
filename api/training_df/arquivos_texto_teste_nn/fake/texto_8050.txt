there s a myth running afoul within democratic and republican circles  but mostly among democrats  that bernie sanders is  too progressive  to actually get anything accomplished in washington if elected president  to drive this point home  some on the campaign trail are pointing to his record of accomplishments on capital hill  noting that he has only had three  yes     bills passed into law that he s sponsored over  years in congress  doesn t sound like that great of a record  does it  yet   what they fail to mention is that his record of successes is almost identical to hillary clinton s  in fact  sanders has a higher success rate we back this up with proven numbers  go to congress gov  you can look up every single bill that present  and past  members of congress have ever sponsored co sponsored during their entire time as elected representatives of the people bernie sanders sponsored  bills  he also co sponsored   bills  out of his sponsored bills  only three became law  meaning his success rate     percent  once you factor in his sponsored bills with his co sponsored bills  his success rate isn t all that much improved  out of   bills  only  became law that brings his total success rate to   percent hillary sponsored  laws and guess what  only  became law  the same as bernie   that gives her a success rate of   percent  that s barely above sanders  but   take a look at what happens when you factor in her co sponsored bills  out of the   bills she supported  only  became law that gives her a total success rate of   percent that s below sanders  but  we ll just go ahead and say they re nearly identical so  as we were saying  there s a myth going around that sanders can t get anything done because he s too far left  but as you can see  his record of accomplishments in congress isn t that far off from hillary s  at least according to the official congressional record   if this isn t absolute proof  then we don t know what is the truth is  it s not that far left progressives can t get anything done in washington  it s that congress is set up in a way that makes it virtually impossible for anyone to get anything passed  that s the way it s supposed to be  by design   that s why bernie has continuously said on the campaign trail that it s absolutely imperative that people become more involved  and vote   otherwise  they won t see the change they re hoping for  no matter if he  or anyone else for that matter  is elected president  this nonsense about him being  too progressive to get anything passed  needs to stop  no matter who you support for the nomination featured image via bernie sanders
