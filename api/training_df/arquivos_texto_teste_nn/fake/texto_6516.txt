imagine if donald trump rang president obama  how would that phone call go  jimmy fallon decided to act out his answer  with a phone call played out between fallon s  drumpf  and obama after winning indiana and becoming the presumptive gop nominee  trump calls president obama to chat  the only thing is  drumpf can seem to string a sentence together without making some sort of bizarre trump world word soup  did you see the news  i m now the republican president and come november  i m gonna be voted captain america   drumpf says out his pouting mouth  set as it is upon an unnaturally orange face obama begrudgingly congratulates the tangerine tycoon on his victory in indiana  and his becoming the presumptive republican nominee for president of the united states  of course  drumpf is little confused about exactly what makes the hoosier state great  i love indiana  the birthplace of indiana jones  obama lets the gaffe slide  choosing instead to keep it classy and acknowledge trump s success  i ve gotta admit  it was a big win   he says  to which drumpf responds  it was  and when i m in charge  america s gonna start winning  and winning bigly yes  that last word was just spontaneously invented by drumpf   like president george dubya bush and sarah palin before him   donald trump has seemingly made a campaign platform out of bad english obama calls him to task on the word  asking him if he just actually said  bigly   for real  but drumpf is unashamed  that s right  bigly  and i m gonna be the bestest  most fantasticest president ever  it s gonna be yuuuuugical  you can see the rest of the brilliant sketch in the video below whatever happens now  one thing is certain  the republican party is paying the price of inciting fear and prejudice into its supporters  the gop has turned itself into a party of extremist bigots  led by an extremist bigot  it has become a parody of its own worst elements
