full frontal host samantha bee is not known for mincing words  and this time she has turned her attentions to supposedly moderate gop presidential candidate john kasich  r oh   before the election season heated up  kasich was not known nationwide  so understandably his relatively non crazy public persona made him seem like a safe pick next to the clown show that is donald trump  and the dangerous extremism of ted cruz  however  samantha bee wants to warn us to not be fooled by kasich s not being as openly batty as his fellow gop presidential candidates bee spoke of kasich s record on her show  in which she reminded everyone that he is very anti gay and even more anti choice  in the nauseating bus terminal restroom that is the republican primary  john kasich initially seems like the least disgusting stall  but is kasich really the huggable moderate he s made out to be  the short answer to that question is a resounding no   from salon bee noted the candidate s scarcely mentioned record on gay marriage   obergefell v  hodges  the supreme court case that legalized same sex marriage  was originally called obergefell v  kasich   and reproductive rights  citing michael gonidakis  president of ohio right to life  who said   there is no candidate running for president who has done more for the pro life movement than john kasich   that doesn t sound like a moderate at all to me  in fact  it sounds like ted cruz part deux  only even more dangerous  because nobody knows what he s really like  kasich s campaign is built upon trying to make him seem like one of the sane gop candidates  when  in actuality  he s just as crazy as the rest  bee continued  if you live outside ohio  you don t hear much about kasich s anti choice record because he hides his abortion restrictions in larger budget bills  where they won t be noticed  kind of like a desperate  pregnant teenager buying ever larger sweatshirts  in a lot of ways  this makes kasich even worse than the others  at least we see their crazy and know what we re getting  kasich is very adept at hiding his  what does it say about the current incarnation of the gop that the only  sane  candidate is this guy thanks  ms  bee  for telling it like it is  as always watch the segment below featured image via video screen capture
