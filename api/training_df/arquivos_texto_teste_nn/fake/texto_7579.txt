a zion christian church prophet named alec ndiwane had a brush with death recently when his ability to see the future and fend off wild animals with the power of the lord failed him at a wildlife park in ghana  ndiwane  while visiting kruger national park with fellow church members  went into a  trance  and began  speaking in tongues   if you ve ever seen footage of this sort of thing happening to someone  it s better described as  he decided to play his role and spouted some gibberish just before making a complete fool of himself  the prophet threw caution to the wind and charged at a pack of lions who were happily chomping on an impala they had taken down  ndiwane ran towards them  believing the dominion over animals granted by god to man would keep him safe  as he ran screaming towards the pack  several of the animals decided he looked rather tasty  charging towards him instead of running away  when ndiwane realized there was some serious tonnage worth of teeth and claws headed his way  he miraculously snapped out of his trance and turned tail towards safety not only did god not give ndiwane power over the lions  he also failed to give him the speed to get away clean  a female lion got in a good swipe and ruined the rest of the trip  sending ndiwane to the hospital with major damage to his glutes  while doctors assured him his left cheek would be intact  the right cheek apparently didn t fare as well  ndiwane was stitched up and spent the night in the hospital the prophet told ghanaweb  i do not know what came over me  i thought the lord wanted to use me to show his power over animals  is it not we were given dominion over all creatures of the earth  no  it is not  we were given sentience and cognitive ability and opposable thumbs  but dominion over animals requires we use those things in an intelligent  well thought out manner when approaching creatures who kill things much larger and stronger than we are on a regular basis  if there is a god  she is laughing her ass off right about now  pun intended  featured image from wikipedia
