ever since supreme court justice antonin scalia s death  republicans have been clear about one thing  no matter what  they intend to obstruct obama because every day is a day that ends in   day   while the president has a constitutional duty to appoint a new justice to replace the much reviled racist  anti gay  anti woman sleazebag now that he is burning in hell  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has vowed that he won t allow the senate to even consider obama s nominee   no hearings  no votes  nothing republicans falsely claim that it is outside  tradition  for a president to appoint a new supreme court justice in his final year in office  despite that a full third of presidents have done so in an election year  on tuesday  the president met with mcconnell and  judiciary committee chairman charles grassley in the oval office to talk about obama s plan to nominate someone within the next couple weeks  unfortunately  the republicans refused to budge on their mission to obstruct the president the meeting barely lasted forty minute and  while the president offered to consider anyone mcconnell and pals suggested for the position  they continued their usual modus operandi of not having a single f cking idea after the pointless meeting  president obama took to social media to smack down some elephants  on facebook  he brilliantly trolled the  pro constitution  party with  words that should  but won t  shut them up   namely  article ii section  of the constitution  the message was punctuated with the hashtag  doyourjob   a message obama has been sending republicans since they initially announced that they would obstruct him no matter what  on twitter  the president posted a petition urging the senate to do its job  our supreme court is too important to be held hostage by the same partisan gridlock that has caused government shutdowns   the petition reads   president obama is taking his constitutional responsibility seriously the senate should do the same   along with the petition  obama left a very clear message  leaving a seat open on the supreme court for more than a year is irresponsible  along with the petition  obama left a very clear message  leaving a seat open on the supreme court for more than a year is irresponsible    but what else can we expect from republicans these days  irresponsibility is their defining attribute  do your job  is not a hard message to understand  but it is certainly not a course of action the party of reagan views as viable featured image via white house screengrab
