donald trump has repeatedly defended his blatant calls for violence against his critics by pretending that the protesters  not his fans  are the  violent  ones  this  he claims  justifies any assaults his supporters unleash at his rallies  no matter how unprovoked unfortunately  there is not a lot of proof that the protesters are the people starting violence  one man who was recently sucker punched by a trump supporter who thought he was from isis  he wasn t  was actually already being escorted out by police officers when he was attacked  he had done absolutely zero harm to anyone when he was hit with an elbow coming fast from his blind spot so lacking any real evidence  it seems that trump s campaign now wants to instigate fights between supporters and protesters in order to  prove  that it s not trump s rhetoric that is inciting violence   and they were just caught on tape at a tense rally in tucson  arizona  trump s controversial campaign manager  corey lewandowski   who has already been accused of assaulting a reporter at a separate rally  was filmed yanking the collar of protester  and then letting the man next to him take the fall for it  it s startling to watch  but look closely here is donald trump s campaign manager in the tucson crowd grabbing the collar of a protester  pic twitter com   jacqueline alemany   jaxalemany  march    honesty has no meaning in trump land  this obvious attempt to incite a fight was flatly denied by the campaign  they claimed the man to the left of lewandowski was the perpetrator  a premise absurd enough to rank up there with the most audacious lies of north korea or soviet russia back in the real world  the video clearly shows lewandowski placing a hand on the back of the protester s shirt  grabbing a fist full of collar and yanking  when the man turns  lewandowski lets go and watches as the protester and the man standing next to him get into a shoving match  he doesn t even bother to intervene  this is what he wants trump s rally was attended by conservative arizona sheriff joe arpaio  who runs portions of the state like his own personal dictatorship so it s unlikely any criminal charges will be brought against lewandowski  however  it is worth nothing that trump barely escaped a  inciting a riot  charge for his violent rally in north carolina just two weeks ago  the reasoning was that trump s actions and words are whipping his followers into a violent frenzy that makes it unsafe for protesters  now his campaign has been caught red handed trying to   say it with me   incite a riot once again this will go one of two ways  either trump s campaign gets charged with the crimes they are committing  or they are going to get their wish and someone gets killed  there doesn t appear to be a lot of middle ground here featured image via twitter
