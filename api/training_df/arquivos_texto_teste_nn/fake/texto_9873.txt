first hand account of a crazy liberal attacking a danish guy for being a trump supporter  an american woman wanted to sit at my table  i was wearing a maga cap  she became visibly angry with my presence  so my friend started recording her  this took place at  unibar  near aarhus university  denmark we chose to take legal action the following day  a case has been opened and she will be charged with politically motivated assault  a hate crime  political violence is never acceptable   no matter ones political affiliation yes  she s in trouble and should be  what s wrong with these  triggered  babies on the left it s like a cult of people where everyone has to follow  you can t have a free thought or else you re a  bad person   this woman ripped into a man who supports our president think about it  he s not even an american but a danish citizen does this remind you of the last few months of the campaign last year  trump supporters were repeatedly assaulted in so many ways but the media refused to acknowledge it  we saw trump supporters pelted with eggs  chased and tackled and punched  the woman above felt she could get away with doing the same thing  not so fast  she s in hot water after what she did to this danish trump supporter
