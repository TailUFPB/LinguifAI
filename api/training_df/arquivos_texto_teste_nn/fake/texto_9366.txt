has america reached a tipping point  will more and more fed up americans begin to object to athletes who choose to blatantly disrespect our flag during the national anthem  should athletes be allowed to disrespect our flag during school sponsored events  we d love to hear what you think in the comment section below todd starnes of fox news broke the story about  year old jim howard  of garden city  kansas is a red blooded  american patriot and a faithful supporter of the athletic program at the local community college for  years he s volunteered with the booster club   keeping scorebooks  holding fundraisers  running the chain gang for football   and even providing a place for players to have a thanksgiving meal he was in the stands on nov   for the season opener of the garden city broncbusters basketball team  and when the announcer asked everyone to stand for the national anthem  he dutifully joined the crowd and stood at attention that s when he noticed a lone player seated on a bench at courtside   rasool samir  a  year old muslim red shirt it was unusual because there s a team rule that the entire basketball team was supposed to stay inside the locker room until after the national anthem had concluded but as the crowd began singing about the bombs bursting in air and the rocket s red glare  the muslim basketball player grabbed a ball  walked onto the court and began shooting baskets  it was an  in your face slam   he said mr  howard decided enough was enough  he was tired of people disrespecting the national anthem  so at the conclusion of the song  he walked onto the court and confronted samir  i walked onto the floor and i told the guy he should respect the flag and if he s not going to respect the flag  he should get off the court and get out of the gym   mr  howard told the todd starnes show  you should respect the flag  if you don t respect the flag  just stay seated  don t make a big scene   he said   at least respect the people that paid for your scholarship to get you on this campus   like myself and everyone else in that gym  the garden city telegram reported that a police officer broke up the confrontation   telling mr  howard to return to his seat and escorting the player off the court when that happened  a number of people in the stands gave mr  howard a standing ovation and some fans even came over to shake the man s hand it seems  they too   had had enough  everyone around town was patting me on my back and saying thank you   he said the following day samir was dismissed from the team however  there are two versions as to what happened  the local newspaper says it was samir s decision to leave  but the american civil liberties union claims the young man was kicked off the team the kansas chapter of the aclu fired off a letter to the community college demanding answers and claiming that samir s constitutional rights were violated  he refrained from participating in the national anthem because he is a muslim and his faith prohibits acts of reverence to anything but god   the aclu wrote in a letter to the school well  if that s the case  why didn t samir stay inside the locker room with the rest of the team during the national anthem
