new york daily news stooped incredibly low on april   by running a cover story using parts of an interview bernie sanders had with the paper s editorial board out of context to attack him despite their interview never mentioning sandy hook  the article  featuring two connecticut hillary clinton supporters  attacked bernie sanders over a false assumption he is against gun manufacturers being sued in the interview senator sanders outlined his gun control agenda  comparing it to president obama s  when asked whether gun manufacturers should be susceptible to lawsuits  not should they receive immunity   bernie sanders said  no   while his explanation was largely omitted  in the same sense that if you re a gun dealer and you sell me a gun and i go out and i kill him   do i think that that gun dealer should be sued for selling me a legal product that he misused   but i do believe that gun manufacturers and gun dealers should be able to be sued when they should know that guns are going into the hands of wrong people   said senator sanders   so if somebody walks in and says   i d like   rounds of ammunition   you know  well  you might be suspicious about that  so i think there are grounds for those suits  but not if you sell me a legal product  bernie sanders went on to add he has a d minus rating from the nra and lost an election in  by three points against an opponent who was backed by the nra  trying to lie and portray bernie sanders as an nra backed candidate is preposterous  especially while hillary clinton has a former nra lobbyist  jeff forbes  co hosting fundraisers for her gun control is a hot issue among democrats  and the mainstream media is misrepresenting bernie sanders  record to favor hillary clinton when their agendas are virtually identical  but rather than sensationalize and further divide people on the issue  bernie sanders emphasizes prevention lawsuits are not meant to replace or make up for ground where legislation or laws have yet to be enacted  if any dealer or manufacturer acts within the confines of the law  they can t be held accountable in a lawsuit  whether it is guns or any other product other parts of the ny daily news interview have been taken out of context and manipulated by mainstream media  cnn was recently called out for making it seem as though bernie sanders was confused about how he would break up the big banks  he wasn t and isn t  on cnn  nomiki konst corrected an uninformed cnn anchor on what bernie sanders said  well actually  you know  there s great fact checking done on this in the new york times  which i hold as a higher standard of a paper  i think most new yorkers hold the times a little bit higher than the daily news and new york post  but they fact checked this and they basically said that he was right on this  you know the point if you read the entire transcript  which is very long  took about  minutes to read  he went into detail about how the determination of how to break up the big banks lies within congress or the president  and the president gives authority to the fed the problem is that we take  as we do in the media  take little bits out of context and don t show the full picture  and to be clear  to be even more fair  bernie sanders is the only senator who brought this up in congress  and you know what  the daily news didn t talk about that  but the new york times did  the mainstream media needs to stop taking the new york daily news interview out of context to suit its agenda in trying to stop the surging bernie sanders featured image via flickr
