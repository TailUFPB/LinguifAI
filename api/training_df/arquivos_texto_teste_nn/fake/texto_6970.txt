when faced with deciding if you re going to perform or not in a state that decided to make discrimination legal  many performers are left feeling there is only one option   boycott  and while very effective  because not only does it remove revenue from the state surrounding the performance  it also pisses off a lot of people who were looking forward to the show  people  who will then want to know why one of their favorite performers decided not to show up  if they didn t know already comedian joel mchale  however  went another route to combat the hatred of the new bigoted north carolina anti lgbt law  instead  he decided to keep his performance date in durham  yet he then donated  every single dime  from the show to the local lgbtq organization mchale s rep told people  joel is vehemently opposed to  and knows there are many in durham  which recently passed a measure condemning the law  that share the feeling  he felt this was a good way to raise awareness and much needed funds for a local center that is on the front line of this important cause  the actor even wore a  lgbtq durham  shirt on stage in support of the local community who is devastatingly impacted by this outrageous law  joelmchale  dpac tonight in lgbtq shirt    donating all   from show to lgbt  he ll come back to nc after  is repealed  demetri ravanos   demetriravanos  april    my good buddy  joelmchale made a nice shirt for the  lgbtqdurham community   lgbtq  joelmchale gave all the money he made tonight to lgbtq durham  pretty sweet move a photo posted by jf harris   jfharriscomedy  on apr    at   pdt during a video of the performance you can hear mchale call the law  f cking crazy   and completely lay into the absurdity of legislated hate in this world  you can choose to love and embrace everyone as the people that they are  ironically something the bible actually urges people to do once you get past the old testament  or you can choose to hate and live in the small  myopic mind that you haven t allowed yourself to escape  however  in the words of dr  martin luther king jr    hate is too great a burden to bear   it s actually easier to love  and hopefully the lawmakers in north carolina realize this sooner than later kudos to you  mr  mchale  this gesture will not be forgotten featured photo by angela weiss getty images
