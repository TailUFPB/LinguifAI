ted cruz got his ass handed to him on fox news sunday for calling president obama weak because he hasn t carpet bombed the middle east out of existence it was not a good time to be ted cruz during his appearance on fox with host chris wallace  throughout the interview  the republican presidential wannabe desperately tried to appear tough by talking about how quick he would be to wage total war against iran and isis  i will apologize to no one with how vigorous i will be winning the war on terror   cruz replied when wallace pointed out that former u s  army war college commandant robert scales dinged cruz for his call to carpet bomb as  just one of those phrases that people with no military experience throw around  the texas senator then attempted to describe what carpet bombing is by using the gulf war as an example  whining about how the military has shrunk since   and you want to know what carpet bombing means  yesterday was the  anniversary of desert storm  in   we had roughly   planes  today  we have    our air force has dropped in half  in   we had  ships in our navy  today  we have   it s dropped nearly in half  in   we had over a third more soldiers in our army  and we were launching   air attacks a day  we were carpet bombing them  and after  days of   air attacks a day  our troops went in in a day and a half and mopped up the remnants of the iraqi army because that s the effect of carpet bombing  cruz made his initial carpet bombing remark in december  saying we should see if  sand can glow in the dark  of course  carpet bombing is when the military drops hundreds or thousands of bombs over a large swath of land  hitting every thing in its path  it s indiscriminate destruction that kills civilians as well as military targets  in short  innocent people get slaughtered  it has also been a war crime since  chris wallace  of course  knows quite a bit more about the gulf war than cruz does  wallace covered the war from tel aviv as a reporter for abc while cruz was busy not studying nearly hard enough at princeton  we did precision striking   wallace corrected cruz   in addition   if i may   the iraqi army was all massed by itself in the kuwaiti desert  we re now talking about isis soldiers who are not massed  they are embedded in mosul  they re embedded in raqqa with civilians  cruz then went on a rant about how we should be bombing every building and oil field we can find regardless of whether or not isis has a connection to them or not and said that he would do exactly that if he becomes president here s the video via youtube in another part of the interview  cruz claimed that the only reason iran detained american sailors earlier this month is because of  the weakness of president obama   in reality  iran detained them and had every right to do so because the naval vessels went off course and entered iranian waters  it wasn t intentional  but it happened  and iran released the sailors  hours later after the servicemen apologized for the mishap and it was confirmed that a navigational error sent them off course  also  iran is helping us fight isis  which makes cruz s next statement all the more harmful chris wallace even informed cruz of that fact  but nevertheless  cruz declared that as president he would have punished iran with  full force and fury  and that  any nation that captured our military officers  captures our soldiers  should face serious repercussions  here s the video via youtube ted cruz would be a disastrous president if he were to win in november  he would start endless wars over the smallest disagreements and would stoop so low as to commit war crimes and kill innocent people to prove how tough he is  this is not the kind of president america needs  we already had a president who did these kind of things  president bush sent thousands of american troops to their deaths fighting two wars and used torture as a method of interrogation despite it being a violation of the geneva convention the fact that president obama has killed many high ranking isis leaders with precision drone and air strikes proves that we don t need to carpet bomb to achieve the same goals  the fact that president obama secured a nuclear deal with iran and the release of american prisoners they held as well as the quick release of american sailors also proves how diplomacy is effective at achieving our goals without firing a single shot or spilling blood the only thing ted cruz demonstrated today is that he is dangerous and irresponsible and shouldn t be allowed anywhere near american foreign policy nor should he be given control of the military featured image  wikimedia
