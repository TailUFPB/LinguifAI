the right is giddy over the fact that president obama s kenyan half brother malik says he plans to vote for donald trump  they shouldn t be  his reasons for voting for the braggadocios billionaire are even worse than the reasons for most americans malik obama lives in kenya  but he is eligible to vote in the united states because he sometimes lives in maryland and he worked there  rupert murdoch s new york post claims that malik is registered to vote in the united states malik is the oldest of the obama brothers  he s related through their father  but the two men have different mothers  the older obama    has spent most of his life as a democrat  but likes trump s slogan of  mak ing  america great again   he doesn t like hillary clinton s email scandal  and he has more than one personal bone to pick with his younger brother about trump  i like donald trump because he speaks from the heart   malik obama told the post from his home in the rural village of kogelo   make america great again is a great slogan  i would like to meet him  about hillary clinton and the email situation  she should have known better as the custodian of classified information   said obama the third reason makes one question whether malik had been a democrat at all  the man who reportedly has as many as  wives hates the idea of marriage equality  i feel like a republican now because they don t stand for same sex marriage  and that appeals to me   he said then  it gets a bit more personal  the elder obama says that he was close  personal friends with ousted and assassinated dictator  muammar gaddafi  i still feel that getting rid of khadafy didn t make things any better in libya   he said   my brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard  malik has an even more personal beef with his brother  it s about money  malik is in charge of the barack h  obama foundation  which named after the obamas  father  the foundation was set up to help people in their native village in kenya  but it hadn t registered with the state of virginia  from which it was run  shortly after the story became public  the irs approved the foundation s tax exempt status  fingers pointed at president obama  but malik insists his brother didn t help at all  and for that  he seems to resent him  my brother didn t help me at all   said obama   he wanted me to shut it down when i set it up  he hasn t supported me at all  oh  and the president also refused to intervene in his older brother s foray into politics  when he ran for governor of his kenyan county  malik partly blames his brother for his loss here s the video trump  in the meantime  is loving it  wow  president obama s brother  malik  just announced that he is voting for me  was probably treated badly by president like everybody else   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    of this should be terribly surprising  despite the fact that the two men were best men at each others  weddings  malik got on the birther train  he even questioned whether the president actually shared a father with him  of course  we can also go birther  asking if malik is actually registered to vote featured image via new york post screenshot
