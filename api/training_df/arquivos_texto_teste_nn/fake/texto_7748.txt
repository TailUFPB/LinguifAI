while republicans and their nra puppet masters refuse to acknowledge it  we have a gun violence problem in america today  almost like clockwork  anytime there is a shooting the right twists themselves into pretzels to blame anything but the easy availability of guns to  shall we say  crazy people each time  for instance  a  pro gun  republican shoots up a building  conservatives will fallaciously claim that he was a black lives matter protester  or ignore their raving mad right wing rants and love of weapons  or claim the shooter was a  progressive  because he was formerly employed by an insurance company by that name  or even say that a man who shot up a planned parenthood in an effort to stop abortion was a  transgendered leftist activist  who was trying to rob a bank  they spend so much time focusing on inventing stories that they completely miss the one trait all of these attacks share  the weapon used was a gun while they ignore the issues  the right bellows that the solution is more guns  not fewer  but a recent study   the largest of its kind to date   puts that assertion largely to rest  a research team reviewed  high quality studies conducted in ten countries over six decades and found that the tyrannical attempts by those of us on the left who want to restrict crazy people s access to guns because we are sick of seeing dead children on a daily basis  aren t at all misguided  as conservatives often claim while researchers stopped short of saying they have proved conclusively that firearm restrictions reduce deaths  the study provides plenty of evidence to suggest this is the case  across countries  instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate  we saw a reduction   lead researcher julian santaella tenorio from columbia university told vox  the study analyzed law changes in the united states  australia  austria  brazil  south africa  and other countries  no new data was collected  instead  the researchers observed the big picture  by taking a look at what the data says when all the studies are examined together  santaella teonorio explained  the simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths  the findings do not note one specific law that has caused gun violence to decrease like an assault weapon ban  or a ban on high capacity magazines  because the diversity among countries makes this difficult  however  in countries that overhauled their firearm regulations broadly  the changes shared similar characteristics  according to the researcher south africa s firearm control act of   for example  contained all three of these measures  and a study of five south african cities found a   percent reduction in firearm homicides each year for the next five years  reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed   the researchers say   although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides  to combat mass shootings  australia passed similar legislation in   thanks to the new laws  firearm homicide rates decreased by   percent  and suicides by   percent  there have only been two mass shootings in the country in the two decades since but even the smallest changes  such as background check requirements and storage regulations  can have a huge impact   laws restricting the purchase of  e g  background checks  and access to  e g  safer storage  firearms are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children  respectively   the researchers write of course  the weakening of firearm laws can have an impact as well  following missouri s decision to eliminate common sense laws requiring people to have a permit to purchase a firearm  the state saw a homicide rate increase of  percent  no other changes in the law explain this increase  stand your ground laws do nothing to reduce gun violence  but instead increase it  especially among white men   stand your ground laws were associated with a    increase in homicide rates  mainly driven by increments      in homicide rates among white males  while this can t be considered conclusive evidence that gun control helps limit fatalities  the study certainly provides enough evidence to give any republican who can manage to operate a toaster without an adult supervising the operation pause to consider that maybe  just maybe  laws limiting firearms to people who aren t criminals  who aren t insane  and who aren t going to misuse them or act irresponsibly are in everyone s best interest   even the most staunch second amendment supporter featured image via quickmeme
