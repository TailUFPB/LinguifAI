when i was a kid  i watched a number of fights on the playground  in the school cafeteria and just on my block  this was true when i was in elementary school and it continued to be true all the way to when i was in high school  if you would have told me that i could be arrested for not breaking up the fight  i would have looked at you like you were certifiably insane but that was before america decided that criminalizing childhood was a good idea murfreesboro  more than  people called for action sunday after parents said at least five students  ages  to   were handcuffed at hobgood elementary school on friday the students were arrested  accused of not stopping a fight that happened earlier off campus and later released from the juvenile center on fridaythese were not kids that participated in the fight  they just watched it happen and were arrested for it  think about that for a moment  a  year old child was handcuffed for not breaking up a fight  what did the police think this kid was going to do  attack them  what kind of thought process leads a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student  even worse  what kind of society allows a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student and not immediately fire them as a danger to the public but back to the flawed premise behind the arrest  i happen to have a  year old of my own and she has a fairly forceful personality  but the idea of her leaping into a fight to break it up is ludicrous  she s   and even if she d been   when did it become a legal obligation for kids to break up a fight they re not involved in  don t the police have anything better to do with their time than turn little children into criminals the icing on the cake was arresting them at the school in front of their classmates  because leading a  year old out of school in handcuffs can t possibly leave any long term mental scars  right  again  we as a society allow this to happen this is the direct result of a fundamentally broken law enforcement culture  they no longer see communities as made up of people  they only see potential criminals  it seems that the thinking is  if you get them into the system when they re young  you ll have an easier time throwing them in jail later  never mind that most of the cops involved almost certainly watched a fist fight as a kid  or got into one themselves  it s criminal behavior these days oh  and you ll be absolutely shocked to know that the community this occurred in is  you guessed it  mostly african american  because when little timmy watches a fight  it s just boys being boys  but little leroy  he s a goddamn criminal and needs to be taught a lesson with this kind of ongoing behavior  the police are hard at work creating an entire generation of  mostly minority  children that fear and loathe them  and then the cops have the gall to rage at the black lives matter movement  unbelievable featured image via getty
