according to donald trump  he loves veterans  at least that s what he keeps telling people  and when you re running in an election for a party that constantly uses the service of men and women and uniform as political props  you re going to tout the line that you love veterans as much as possible  however  actions speak louder than words  and trump apparently doesn t realize that people actually remember the actions he took back in  when he tried to remove veterans from  avenue in new york city  you see  trump tower is on  avenue  and those gosh darn veterans trying to make a living as vendors were just too unsightly for trump to have anywhere near his precious building in a letter trump wrote to the new york state assembly in   it said  while disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living  is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses  do we allow fifth avenue  one of the world s finest and most luxurious shopping districts  to be turned into an outdoor flea market  clogging and seriously downgrading the area  and then again to nyc mayor mike bloomberg in   whether they are veterans or not  they  should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street he image of new york city will suffer  i hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late  and in case that s not bad enough for you  he also wanted to make sure no one sat down near his building that may have taken away from the  beautiful ambience   according to the new york times he had large planters placed on benches  he said in   we have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench   drug addicts  vagrants  et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers  additionally  all sorts of  horrors  had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much  to be blunt  donald trump is exactly what s wrong with the united states of america  and for him to even remotely be coming close to gaining the republican nomination for president is outright horrifying  he only loves veterans when it s politically convenient for him to do so  to pander to a bunch of folks who are apparently so dumb to think he would actually make a decent president  his actions in the past with veterans only prove the continuing line that trump is only out for himself and what s best for trump  he doesn t want america to be great  because guess what  america is already pretty damn great  trump wants trump to be great  and he wants to stroke his ego inside the oval office  smart americans know better  and we need to make sure he stays as far away from the white house as possible featured image  flickr wikimedia photoshop
