instead of participating in tonight s gop debate  donald trump announced that he would be holding his own  veterans fundraising event  in iowa trump created a special website for the fundraiser  donaldtrumpforvets com as of   pm  the site had already raised     according to the website   percent of those donations are supposed to go to veterans needs here s a screen capture screen capture  donaldtrumpforvets comthere s just one problem  as reported by the federalist  donations to the website aren t going to veteran s organizations at all  instead they are going to his personal non profit foundation  the donald j  trump foundation a disclaimer acknowledging that donations are made to trump s private charity foundation appears at the bottom of the form in addition  the federalist reports that an email confirmation sent to donors reads  the donald j trump foundation is a  c    nonprofit organization and acknowledges that no goods or services were provided to you in return for your contribution  this letter is your receipt and should be kept with your tax records  according to forbes  less than one percent of donations made by the donald j trump foundation between  and   the most recent years for which data was available  went to organizations that help veterans  in fact  out of  organizations that received donations from trump s foundation  only seven were veterans organizations even more telling  the donaldtrumpforvets com website appears to have been created by the same florida based firm that created trump s official campaign website  the site was created on thursday morning  just hours before trump s  veteran s fundraiser was scheduled to begin while trump claims that  percent of the donations raised during the iowa event will go directly to veteran s needs  that claim seems dubious  at best as rachel maddow reported in   this would not be the first time that trump had used a  veterans fundraiser  to scam his supporters in september  trump held a fundraiser for a group called veterans for a strong america  it was later discovered that the  group  had just one member  that member was also the organization s founder  a man named joel arends watch rachel maddow s report below  via youtube trump is the worst kind of con artist there is  it s bad enough that he repeatedly scammed investors and swindled students  but using our country s wounded veterans to generate profits and publicity is as low as it can get featured image credit  michael vadon via flckr cc
