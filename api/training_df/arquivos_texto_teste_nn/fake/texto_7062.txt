you ve honestly got to be a special kind of stupid to go into the bronx in your effort to try to win new york  and then double down on putting new yorkers down for their supposed  values   however  there republican presidential candidate ted cruz was  in all his creepy glory  again going after  new york values  when asked to elaborate on what he meant  he said  those are the values  the values of the new york liberal politicians that have been hammering the people of this great state  and he especially went after new york city mayor bill de blasio  saying  every time there is a confrontation between criminals and cops he sides with the criminals  looters and rioters instead of the police officers  which is just a flat out lie  but he s clearly trying to cater to a crowd outside of new york  and completely giving up on any chance as winning the state over republican presidential frontrunner donald trump  however  cruz did take the opportunity to try to bash trump when he said   if you want to know what liberal democratic values are  follow donald trump s checkbook  donald trump has been funding those liberal democratic politicians   which may very well be true  but those  liberal politicians  keep winning  because they are clearly favored over smarmy  pretentious  wannabe  christian  conservatives who think they ve been appointed by god to run the nation  conservatives like cruz one protester  clearly fed up with the arrogance and idiocy of cruz even being there said   you re running on an anti immigrant platform  and you re speaking in the bronx  you should not be here   the bronx  of course  being home to thousands of immigrants  and has been for over a century not liking to be interrupted  republican staffers had this protester removed  but according to the ny daily news  it seems the protester got his fair share of applause for speaking up bronx borough president ruben diaz jr  said  ted cruz is a hypocrite  he not only offended new yorkers  he offended bronxites  and now he s here today in new york and in the bronx looking for money and votes  we in the bronx know how offensive he s been  we know the truth about our borough  cruz just being there is an insult in and of itself  who the hell does he think he is to come into the bronx seeking support  but then continue to put new yorkers down  that protester was absolutely right  he shouldn t have even been there featured photo by kyle rivas getty images
