with the race for president getting hotter by the day  and now that both parties have their presumptive nominees pretty locked up  the gloves have clearly come off on either side donald trump may have thought it was pretty easy to steamroll over his fellow republicans during the primary  but now he s up against hillary clinton  and she s no newcomer to having everything plus the kitchen sink filled with day old dishes thrown at her it s becoming for evident that trump is starting to flounder and that is pissing him off greatly  his remarks on the federal judge of mexican descent really began turning off his own party  as if they weren t listening to his racism before   and now after his politicizing of the shooting massacre of a gay nightclub in orlando  florida  well  his pathetic desperation is showing trump is actually trying   albeit failing   to appear as though he s better for women and the lgbt community than hillary clinton so  when trump asked  you tell me  who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than donald trump  trump   you tell me  who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than donald trump    phil mattingly   philmattingly  june    simply responded with one word  hi  hi  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  june    s really all she needed to say  because it s true  and for goodness sake  trump  don t refer to yourself in the third person not only is hillary better for women and the lgbt community  she s one million times better than donald trump on his best day  even if he were to be the grand marshall in a pride parade  you know you just pictured it  we can t allow trump into the oval office  not just for women and the gay community  but for the whole nation and the entire world featured photo by jeff swensen getty images
