yesterday  a second u s  judge on tuesday blocked president donald trump s decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children from deportation u s  district judge nicholas garaufis in brooklyn ruled that the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  or daca  cannot end in march as the republican administration had planned  a victory for democratic state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the federal government the decision is similar to a jan   ruling by u s  district judge william alsup in san francisco that daca must remain in place while litigation challenging trump s decision continues the legal battle over daca complicates a debate currently underway in congress on whether to change the nation s immigration laws the supreme court on friday is due to consider whether to take up the administration s appeal of the san francisco ruling  the court could announce as soon as friday afternoon whether it will hearing the case   reuterssince when does a judge unilaterally decide that a program based on an executive order by a radical and lawless president  with an expiration date  can be extended peel back the layers of lies that are being told to the american public by democrats like congresswoman nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer  and their allies in the media  and discover the shocking truth about the  dreamers  or voters  they re fighting so hard to keep in america   according to the hill  the narrative surrounding the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program holds that it was put in place to protect  kids  who were brought here through no fault of their own  daca supporters implied that applicants were mostly hispanic and that as citizens of distressed republics a short distance away from the wealthy united states  their violation of our immigration laws was somehow understandable  program applicants were also portrayed as brilliant valedictorians and proud members of the military from the outset  that narrative rang hollow  in a column for the washington post  mickey kaus described it as public relations style  hooey   here s why new data released by u s  citizenship and immigration services  uscis  definitively establishes that most of the daca narrative is false  particularly overblown are claims that deported daca recipients would inevitably be strangers in a strange land uscis lists  countries of origin for daca applicants  english is the national language in at least  of those countries  those include the united kingdom  canada  australia  new zealand and ireland  a large number of applicants are from india  hong kong and the philippines  where there are enormous english speaking communities other statistics also undermine claims that the united states must  take care of the dacas  or condemn them to a life of isolation and poverty in fact  many daca applicant s birth countries are listed on the higher end of the common standard of living indexes  which means that daca advocates are arguing that the united states has a moral obligation to undermine its own laws in order to avoid returning illegal aliens to countries whose citizens are considered to have a higher standard of living than many americans one wonders why it has never occurred to congress that its primary obligation should be protecting native born american kids from illegal aliens who compete with them for entry level jobs and seats at colleges and universities  curiously  our elected representatives seem remarkably unconcerned about protecting america s standard of living what is most disturbing about the data released by uscis  however  is the number of daca applicants who come from countries associated with terrorism or overt anti americanism  this is cause for concern given the  lean and lite  vetting used to quickly approve daca applications based on the facts   rather than the myth   it seems clear the individuals who applied for  and received  daca were not the oppressed  well meaning  high achievers that the media and the open borders lobby portrayed them to be
