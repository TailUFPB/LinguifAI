the republican party has been good at one thing thus far this election year  they ve managed to assemble a group of individuals who ve made the party of lincoln seem comical  whether its trump s antics  cruz s lies  or rubio s roboticism  it s not looking to good for the party to take back the presidency  the latest comic book tale comes from one john kasich who said that  women left the kitchen to vote for him when he first ran for office in  in a sign that fox news is desperately trying to resurrect an establishment candidate for the nomination  host megyn kelly  who has earned a reputation for being straightforward and even tough on candidates when they say stupid things  was surprisingly playful with kasich  after playing a clip of kasich s kitchen remark  kelly was friendly and self deprecating  i can certainly say that if it were my husband  he d say   for the love of god  get out of the kitchen  no one wants you in here  you do bad things in here  the two then had a creepy chuckle which immediately put kasich at ease  she even went as far as to rationalize his women in the kitchen comment  saying  back in  when you first ran for office    of women were not working out of the home full time  they just weren t  the vast majority of women were at home and things have changed a lot since then  these comments put kasich at ease and he then went on to say how much he supposedly respects women by giving examples  he said  but let s be real about this  you know  my campaign manager is a woman  she used to be my chief of staff and if i m president  who knows  she ll have one of the highest positions in the country  i have a lieutenant governor who s a woman  you know  the situation is  i appointed a lady to the ohio supreme court  you know  obviously a woman  and i ve a number of very influential women cabinet members  not only did kelly let him off the hook with his comments and rehabilitated him  but she conveniently forgot to ask kasich about signing a bill that would defund planned parenthood in his home state of ohio after kelly had admirably grilled trump about his comments about women  she disappointingly let kasich off the hook  this is a sign fox news is playing favoritism in its quest to rehabilitate an establishment candidate for the nomination here s the video featured image via screenshot
