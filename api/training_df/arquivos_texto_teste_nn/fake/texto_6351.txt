since the rise of presumptive republican nominee donald trump  the gop has been throwing up their hands in disbelief and trying to blame everyone but themselves for the success of such a horrendous presidential candidate  all while completely ignoring the fact that conservatives have paved the way for a candidate like trump to succeed with decades of hateful rhetoric and ignorance bill maher expertly pointed this out on friday night during his hbo show real time  when he sent a very special message to republicans  stop blaming liberals for the candidate you created  pointing out several headlines that showed that conservative  think pieces  have been pointing the finger at liberals  maher destroyed the concept that liberals condescension and political correctness forced otherwise reasonable people into trump s hateful embrace  maher brilliantly dissed the illogical  rage driven individuals that support trump  sarcastically stating that they would vote rationally if not for overbearing liberals  scientists  and historians and nutritionists telling real americans that they re dumb  it hurts their feelings when we insult their values with our facts   he continued  i m sorry you find it irritating when liberals point out that global warming exists or that racism exists or that gay people exist  but here s the thing  you people were wrong about all that  maher also attacked conservatives  opposition to facts and reason   which has been going on long before trump entered the political arena  maher hilariously joked that liberals were to blame for things like the man bun and gluten free cupcakes   so the gop must accept blame for the racism and widespread hatred of muslims  because those are the very attitudes that the republican party has propelled over the last several years  they are what is truly to blame for trump s rise maher even stated that he himself has mocked political incorrectness in the past  criticizing liberals for overreactions  however  maher said that  none of that justifies embracing a dangerous buffoon simply because his lack of political correctness is cathartic  to a huge round of applause  maher sent a message straight to the gop  trump is your problem  but somehow the party of personal responsibility doesn t want to take responsibility for this one  you can watch the brilliant segment below featured image is a screenshot
