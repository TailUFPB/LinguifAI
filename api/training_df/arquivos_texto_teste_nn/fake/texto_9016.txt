it s undeniable that donald trump is a giant asshat  his entire campaign built upon the exploitation of american conservatives  racism  and faux populist rhetoric that is completely at odds with his economic policies that he has put forward  but trump s asshattery isn t just reserved for people he can exploit for political gain the new york times recently ran an article that detailed the relationship between trump and his brother freddy  trump s younger brother was an alcoholic who died at the age of   freddy s alcoholism caused a major rift to form in the two brothers  relationship  one of the most scandalous revelations in the piece is that trump once revoked medical benefits to his nephew s sick infant son  trump had promised that he would pay for fred iii  trump s nephew  child s medical care  but a feud over an inheritance dispute devolved  that changed all of that the new york times reports  then came the unveiling of fred sr  s will  which donald had helped draft  it divided the bulk of the inheritance  at least   million  among his children and their descendants   other than my son fred c  trump jr  freddy s children sued  claiming that an earlier version of the will had entitled them to their father s share of the estate  but that donald and his siblings had used  undue influence  over their grandfather  who had dementia  to cut them out a week later  mr  trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew s infant child  trump s family did not want to talk to the media about the matter  trump offered the new york times an explanation for his actions during an interview  saying   i was angry because they sued   trump claims the whole thing was eventually settled  very amicably  trump s villainy has officially reached daytime soap opera levels  for sure  much of trump s hateful antics are a campaign tactic that he is using to get free media coverage  however  when a story like this come out  it shows that trump actually is a terrible  vindictive person featured image credit  gage skidmore   via wikimedia commons
