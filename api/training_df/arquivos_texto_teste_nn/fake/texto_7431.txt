an elderly massachussetts woman who wrote a letter to the boston globe denouncing donald trump now fears for her life after the ku klux klan responded to her legitimate criticism of their favored presidential candidate  louise mayerson has been through a lot in her  years on this planet  coming from a  family who was forced to flee austria when she was a child to escape adolf hitler s regime   but now she is forced to relive the terror her family felt as they fled the nazis mayerson  s letter  published march   criticizes trump s initial reticence in denouncing the numerous  numerous white supremacists who have publicly endorsed him i am an austrian refugee from the time of hitler who has been a us citizen for more than  years  i have found some alarming rhetoric coming from donald trump that is apparently finding approval from large numbers of my fellow americans  with trump s rather ambiguous response concerning his disavowal of the support of former klansman david duke  i have reached my breaking point   trump wavers on disavowing ex kkk member   page   feb    we all know the opinions and actions the ku klux klan stands for  among the fellow americans the kkk has sought out for its venom are american jews  trump s failure to immediately repudiate duke chilled my blood i can see myself needing to flee once more and perhaps return to my native country in europe  where hateful rhetoric is now strictly forbidden and punishable by law  my outrage grows and grows and grows   mayerson said in an interview following the publication of her letter   and it s flamed by the irresponsible actions  frankly  of donald trump  unfortunately  the  year old s expression of her completely legitimate misgivings about trump s association with white supremacists was enough to throw them into a fit of rage  days later  she received an envelop postmarked in boston  there was no return address   after all  the klan isn t exactly known for being forthcoming with their identities  there wasn t even a letter  enclosed was a single klan symbol  i believe somebody just read that letter  it touched a nerve  and that s the way they reacted   mayerson said  she contacted arlington police  who are currently investigating the matter  they also contacted the human rights commission  which assists hate crime victims  mayerson says she is pleased with law enforcement s response  and that she is distressed by the   poisonous atmosphere that has been created  by trump s rhetoric that can   lead to some pretty unpleasant things for all of us  robert o  trestan  regional director of the anti defamation league  says that trump s rhetoric will help this sort of thing to become commonplace  the more that hateful and denigrating speech becomes commonplace in the public realm from leaders  the greater the likelihood that people will start acting up  whether it s harassment via the mail or violence  a trump spokeswoman refused to comment on the incident  though she did point out that the candidate did finally denounce his david duke endorsement after he was unable to handle the media scrutiny  mr  trump has disavowed david duke  the kkk and all other groups that espouse similar views  he will continue to do so  trump may say he disavows the kkk and other white supremacists  but in the past he has tweeted some of their propaganda  in fact  based on a week of data collection   percent of the people trump retweets are white supremacists  unfortunately  the donald is exactly the sort of person who is popular with the white power rangers in the united states   and as long as we tolerate his hate speech  we can expect that this sort of thing will become the new normal featured image via youtube
