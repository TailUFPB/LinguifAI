hell just froze over  because fox news is now on president obama s side when it comes to his new gun safety executive order bill o reilly said  during a segment on the o reilly factor  that the nra and gun owners need to accept that background checks for buying guns are reasonable i know how unbelievable that sounds  but here it is in a video could we possibly have hit a point where the republican establishment has finally had it with the monster they created in   has the nra and its head idiot  wayne lapierre  finally become caricatures of themselves that are too embarrassing even for people like bill o reilly and fox news here is something that i never  ever thought i would say in my life  i agree with bill o reilly  especially on the part about being paranoid  however  there is one part where bill just had to veer back into the realm of stupidity so he could throw his audience a bone   likely to prevent them from throwing a beer can through their tv screen at home  bill openly addressed president obama while saying a firearm registry will not solve america s gun problem the sudden burst of common sense from bill couldn t last forever  it is a well documented  checked fact that president obama does not want to create a gun registry  this was proven when the last universal background check bill completely outlawed the creation of one obama s openly accused the nra of lying about this  from a rose garden press conference  they claimed that it would create some sort of  big brother  gun registry  even though the bill did the opposite  this legislation  in fact  outlawed any registry  plain and simple  right there in the text  but that didn t matter  the latest quinnipiac poll  from december     shows background checks have an absolutely massive amount of support across the board photo  quinnipiacit has had this kind of support since after the sandy hook massacre  give or take a relatively negligible variance in points  so to act like all of a sudden it is  reasonable  is strange at best regardless of the details  the simple fact that fox news   and bill o reilly in particular   are siding with president obama on gun control is nothing short of a noteworthy event in american history  the internal republican fallout will be amazing to watch featured image via video screen capture
