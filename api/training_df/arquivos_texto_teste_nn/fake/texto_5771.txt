this is disgraceful and it is an insult to every american who has ever lost a loved one to gun violence democrats are sick and tired of republicans offering nothing more than  thoughts and prayers  instead of doing something substantial to prevent mass shootings  so they took to the house floor on wednesday to protest gop inaction in order to force house republicans to allow a vote on gun control bills that senate republicans rejected on monday led by legendary civil rights icon rep  john lewis  democrats were preparing to hold a sit in when texas congressman and nra shill ted poe called for a recess  we have been too quiet for too long   lewis declared   there comes a time when you have to say something  you have to make a little noise  you have to move your feet  this is the time  lewis and  democratic colleagues sat on the house floor  recited the pledge of allegiance  and chanted   no bill  no break   but republicans called for a break anyway and then they censored the sit in by literally shutting off the video feed that allows americans to see what is happening in the people s house here s the video via youtube afterwards  rep  karen bass told msnbc that republicans are running scared because they fear the nra more than they fear the voting public  if you are constantly shut down  if if your voice cannot be heard  then it s time to take extraordinary measures   bass said of the sit in   i think the nra s influence is very profound  a lot of times  people think of it as an individual campaign contribution  that s not the issue  the issue is the fact that for a lot of members  if they do not have an  a  from the nra  they re concerned about the nra running campaigns against them  supporting their opponents or running independent expenditure campaigns against them  that s the fear  indeed  republicans in the senate fear the nra so much that they literally rejected a measure that would have banned suspected terrorists from legally buying guns  we re not talking about la  abiding citizens who are not being investigated for having ties to terrorist groups  we re talking about people who may have been radicalized and are being looked at by law enforcement  orlando shooter omar mateen was a suspected isis sympathizer  but he was able to buy his assault rifle legally because the fbi was powerless to ban him from doing so because republicans are apparently just fine with terrorists buying guns in america to kill americans with that s outrageous and should rally every voter in the country to throw republicans out of office  because the gop and their nra puppet masters are now just as much a threat to national security as the terrorists featured image via screenshot
