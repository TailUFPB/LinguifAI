republican lawmakers oppose paid family leave  but the majority of americans say they support it  which is bad news for the gop as hillary clinton and bernie sanders vie for the democratic nomination  one of their shared interests includes support of a federal law that mandates paid family leave paid family leave would allow workers to take time off to care for a newborn child or deal with any other family illnesses without having to worry about not getting a paycheck to take care of the bills the family and medical leave act already requires employers to give workers  weeks of leave  but the only drawback is that the leave is unpaid  which means many workers can t afford to take that much time off if any at all  paid leave would change that three states already have such a law on the books and other states are poised to follow suit  however  because congress is controlled by republicans  the effort to pass a federal mandatory paid leave law has gone nowhere because of gop obstruction but as the idea becomes more and more popular among americans  republicans may be forced to fall in line  and a new poll makes it clear that the gop should start paying attention to what the people want according to the associated press an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll released friday said  percent support paid family leave  democrats were more likely to back it  but republicans also expressed strong support  overall  support was stronger among people age   and among women strong support among republicans means that gop lawmakers may have no choice but to throw their support behind the effort if they want to make their constituents happy in michigan  which is controlled by republicans at the moment  mary jo morelli says she supports paid family leave because  i feel that in the u s   we need to realize that employees  or the workers  can t really do the best job possible if you are worrying about a family member  pushing for paid family leave would put republicans in a difficult spot since they would rick losing their corporate sponsorship if they side with workers on the issue  and if they chose to side with corporations  they risk being booted out of office by the voters  which means the issue has enough power to flip state legislatures into democratic hands if enough voters are made aware of the campaign to enact paid family leave the associated press reports that despite such a law existing in california about  percent had never heard of it  that means people in every state need to be educated about paid family leave and how it can benefit them so that the fight can be taken more seriously by lawmakers because a happier  healthier workforce is what is best for business and america featured image  pete souza
