just when you think the right wing shills at fox news couldn t possibly get anymore despicable  they go and do just that  by now  everyone has heard of the tragic crash of egyptair flight  in the vicinity of the mediterranean sea after it disappeared from the radar wednesday night en route from paris to cairo  while the rest of the world is reeling from this tragic event  fox business host stuart varney is busy trying turn it into a way to help elect donald trump appearing on fox and friends less than  hours later  varney insisted that this plane crash would somehow encourage the refugee crisis   he went on to say  i also think this may be good politically for donald trump  he s already tweeted out  saying this is probably terrorism he s the guy who is saying  hands off  keep muslims out temporarily whist we figure out who comes in  an incident of this type is surely a plus for donald trump  so  in other words  it seems that this imbecile is actually glad that this plane crashed and all of these people lost their lives  just since it helps trump and makes people more determined to ban muslims from america than ever  his statements are absolutely disgusting  but  then again  what can we expect from a trump supporting fox host i swear  these people never cease to amaze me with how low they will sink  for once  fox needs to do the right thing and make stuart varney apologize for these appallingly insensitive statements watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
