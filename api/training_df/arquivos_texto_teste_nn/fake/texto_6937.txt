ben stein is on a trump bashing spree again  and it s even more amazing than before  just a week after he blasted the republican front runner s sheer idiocy  in economics  stein gave the donald an epic tongue lashing for his non stop complaining about losing colorado to his rival ted cruz in an interview with neil cavuto on tuesday afternoon  stein didn t bother to mince his words as he condemned trump for all of his  whiny bitchiness  after losing every single one of colorado s delegates  calling trump a  big sulking baby   stein hilariously pointed out that it was trump s own fault for not reading the state s rules on the delegate process while trump s campaign b tched and moaned about the  gestapo tactics  that had supposedly caused trump to suffer such a humiliating loss  stein insisted that nothing of the sort had happened  colorado s delegates had not been stolen  the system was not  crooked  or rigged  or anything other sorry excuse that trump is claiming  trump just sucks  and wasn t smart enough to read the rules beforehand  stein mocked the ignorant business mogul  he didn t have one paid staffer on the ground  i assume he knows how to read  he s supposed to be so rich  can t he hire someone to read the rules  what a great point  you can watch stein s hilarious trump attack below to say that stein likes bashing trump is an understatement   he clearly loves it  last month  stein described trump as a  big sulking baby  in a previous appearance on cavuto s show  and he did so again last week  it looks like stein has been holding his true feelings about trump in for a long time  and is just getting started but in all seriousness  stein is terrified of the possibility of president trump  in an interview with cnn  the conservative economist confessed that although he s been a life long republican voter  he would rather vote for a democrat than see america s economy become destroyed under the donald  stein said  in all of my years as an economist  which is roughly  years  i ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from mr  trump  and it breaks my heart  it makes me want to cry because i m republican  i ve never voted for a democrat  and to think the guy who s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible  featured image via imeh akpanudosen   getty images
