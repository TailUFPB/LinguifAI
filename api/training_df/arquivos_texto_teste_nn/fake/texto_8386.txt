donald trump  who notoriously called people who finish in second place  losers   just had his words come back to bite him in the ass  and  as could be expected  the new york daily news was right there to give him some much deserved mockery  they referred to trump as  dead clown walking  in the headline  and went on to call him a  bombastic bozo  in the article the paper  which has become known for its brilliantly blunt covers  didn t cut trump any slack at all  they called it like they saw it once agains  and ran an absolutely delicious cover depicting trump as a clown  we all know that donald trump is far too thin skinned to be running for any political office  much less that of the presidency  and will likely blow a gasket and throw his gazillionth childish twitter tantrum  as he always does when anyone mocks or criticizes him  without further ado  here is the brilliant cover via ny daily newsthis is nothing less than absolutely perfect  trump s campaign has turned an important part of the american political process for a major party into little more than a circus  that s why people are calling them the gop clown car  that s exactly what they are  and trump has been in the driver s seat the entire time  driving that car straight into a hell of humiliation  trump s remarks afterward may have been humble  but there was also a touch of fear to them  he said he was  really honored   and then remarked on going to new hampshire  we love new hampshire  we will go on to win new hampshire  we will go on to win the nomination  he then seemed to admit that he may not win the general  and even mused about his post defeat plans  who knows  i think i might come back here  and buy a farm  watching this buffoon lose is just the most delicious brand of schadenfreude imaginable at this point in time  and i  for one  will make sure to pop plenty of popcorn in anticipation of the inevitable twitter tirade that is just waiting to burst forth  featured image from gage skidmore flickr
