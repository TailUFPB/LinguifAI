clayton denny is a former u s  marine who moved to sheridan  wyoming in august to work as a personal trainer and exercise coach  after a bike ride through town on saturday evening  clayton decided to cap off his night with a visit to a local bar known as the beaver creek saloon while there  he overheard jacob olson    and dylan dygert    say a racial slur  denny  who is of african american and chippewa cree descent  approached the two men to confront them about it all seemed to be going well as denny shook hands with one of the men  but then something changed as the encounter became more heated  the bartender ordered them to take the argument outside  the trio resumed their argument in an alley  denny turned and walked away and that s when olson and dygert attacked  a push  white flash  bits and pieces of pain   denny recalled about what happened  dygert and olson pushed denny to the ground and began kicking and punching him while yelling racial epithets at him  they beat him so badly that denny thought he might die even olson believed he may have left denny for dead as a witness told police that olson told someone on the phone that he may have killed someone aside from scratches  bruises  and cuts  denny suffered a broken orbital bone  which he would need surgery for in order to drain fluid and clean out an infection  he also suffered two swollen eyes  multiple cuts on his head that had to be stapled  and a concussion olson and dygert have both been arrested by sheridan police and are being held on    bond of course  they claimed they only attacked and viciously beat denny in self defense  however  they didn t know that the incident had been caught on video  which clearly showed that olson and dygert went after denny after he had already turned and walked away from them  in other words  denny wasn t a threat and olson and dygert lied to police in an effort to save their racist asses both men face  years in prison for the racist attack and hate crime charges are being considered by the county attorney s office  and if they don t charge them with a hate crime  the department of justice should do it for them but due to this disgusting attack  denny says he and his girlfriend have received tremendous support from the sheridan community  i do want people to know that the community of sheridan has been awesome  we ve had people stopping by all weekend and all week  just saying  you know  giving their condolences and helping us out  it sounds like denny has all the support he needs to get through this ordeal  let s just hope olson and dygert use their time in prison wisely to think about what they did and learn from it featured image  billings gazette
