anyone with any sense of history realizes that the confederate states of america and those who supported them were traitors who should have been in jail for treason  educated people also know that the confederate flag  and honoring events from the confederacy is largely seen as racist  and with good reason  however  none of this has stopped mississippi governor phil bryant   r of course  from declaring  through an official proclamation  that the month of april is now  confederate heritage month   he chose the month of april  because  according to him  it is the time of year in which the confederate states began and ended a four year struggle   bryant says in his official proclamation  it is important for all americans to reflect open our nation s past  to gain insight from our mistakes and successes  and to come to a full understanding that the lessons learned yesterday and today will carry us through tomorrow if we carefully and earnestly strive to understand and appreciate our heritage and our opportunities which lie before us  here is an image of the proclamation  courtesy of ny daily news facebook yes  reflection is important governor bryant  however  what you are doing is not reflecting  you are celebrating treasonous slave owners  celebrating what is arguably the darkest time in american history  that is nothing to be celebrated  you can teach history  even ugly history  without celebrating it with nostalgia and making it out to be something good then again  gov  bryant likely does not understand any of this  seeing as this proclamation  inspired by the very racist  pro confederacy group sons of confederate veterans  bryant also said if those who fought for the south during the civil war  the citizen soldiers who fought for the confederacy personified the best qualities of america  the preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the south s decision to fight the second american revolution  calling the civil war the  second american revolution  is problematic enough in and of itself  but to refer to confederate traitors as people who  personified the best qualities of america  is truly beyond the pale  this man has no business running a state  or being in any position of power whatsoever  time to step down  governor bryant  you are a disgrace to this country and to the office you hold featured image via phil bryant facebook
