donald trump is known for starting fights with people on his favorite social media platform  twitter  the republican presidential primary frontrunner may have started a fight that might land him in jail trump s latest feud is with the marlene ricketts  one of the owners of the chicago cubs  ricketts donated   million dollars to a superpac  that has the intent of taking down donald trump  the superpac called the  our principles pac  is being run by katie packer  packer is a former advisor to mitt romney  here s the tweet ricketts responded to the tweet  saying  it s a little surreal when donald trump threatens your mom but you know  the fact is whether it s my mom or my dad on his spending stuff or my sister on marriage equality or my brothers on what they do or what we do with the team  we re pretty much an open book  we stand up for what we believe in  we support the cause we think is important  and that s what america should be  robert reich wrote about the matter on his facebook page on friday night  that s where he said that one of his friends thinks that trump violated the law when he put that tweet out  after noting trump s statements that he would prosecute hillary clinton over her private email server  reich writes  my friend arthur ferguson  a former federal prosecutor  thinks trump s statement violates the federal law criminalizing extortionate threats   usc section  d  reads   whoever  with intent to extort from any person   anything of value transmits   any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation    shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years  or both   i m doubtful that anyone would actually consider prosecuting trump over the matter  though republicans are working double time to try and prevent a trump presidential nomination  they are all looking for a way to take down his campaign  and a criminal investigation might do just the trick  featured image from gage skidmore via flickr
