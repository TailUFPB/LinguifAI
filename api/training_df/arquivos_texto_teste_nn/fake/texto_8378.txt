donald trump didn t exactly have the best showing in iowa  at least  not for a guy who said just before the caucuses began that he would have a  tremendous victory   he ended up finishing   a full  points behind ted cruz and ended up tying with marco rubio for seven delegates while he didn t throw a huge tantrum on stage  he isn t exactly being that presidential about it  either  behind the scenes you know he must be fuming mad  rarely is he silent on twitter  and after the loss he didn t tweet a word  there was just silence for  long hours  losing iowa finally brought donald trump back down to earth  and if you re able to gather anything from his latest tweet  it s that he doesn t handle losing very well  instead of preparing himself for the oath of office  and acting presidential  he had to find a way to offer an excuse  and  boy did he pic via twitter trump has been known for quite some time for saying anything and everything on the popular site  and normally we could care a less  but he needs to be called out for being a sore loser  shortly afterwards  he also posted a cryptic message that made it seem like he wasn t as interested in running for president anymore  really  here was what he said  in part  i will keep doing  but not worth it  what exactly does this mean  it must mean he doesn t think running for president is worth it unless people give him credit for things  that  or self funding his campaign isn t worth it enough for him to be president  either way  if trump doesn t self fund his own campaign he d be beholden to outside groups and special interests  and has already said himself that he doesn t want that  so  according to his own rules  he has to fund his it  there s no other way according to him  and  to make matters worse  it s already been proven that he is  in fact  not self funding his campaign  go figure  so  what he says is not even true  for more on this  visit here  he s in this for the attention and nothing else  he could care a less about  making america great again  pic via twitter here s news for you  donald  being president is much harder than this  you don t give up after the first contest  and  you sure as heck don t complain  that  loser  front page cover from the new york daily news must have really got to him featured image from facebook
