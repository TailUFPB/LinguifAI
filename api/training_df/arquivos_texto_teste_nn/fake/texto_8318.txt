it was only a matter of time before this happened  the very first instance of an american presidential candidate in the modern age dropping the f bomb during a stump speech occurred this week  and  naturally  it was donald trump who broke through the taboo then backed over it just to make sure it s dead indeed  trump let fly with the f word on friday during one of his stream of consciousness rants that pass for stump speeches  and  frankly  i don t know whether to scowl or cheer  in spite of trump s general awfulness  i m leaning  cheer  we re gonna bring businesses back  we re gonna have businesses that used to be in new hampshire  that are now in mexico  come back to new hampshire  and you can tell them to go f ck themselves  because they let you down  and they left yes  let s tell corporations that send jobs to places like mexico and china to go f ck themselves  you know  corporations like trump s there s something particularly exciting when  f ck  becomes demystified  it should be  it s just a word  we can t say it on non pay cable or on the radio   or on websites because advertisers don t like it   but we can show unspeakable scenes of violence and other horrors all the time  there s something perverse and unjust about that  so  in that regard  trump can feel free to let the expletives fly  but if he s elected  i wonder if his fcc appointees will be equally lenient  on the other hand  trump s use of  f ck  is another step away from presidential decorum on the republican side  and one step closer to amateur hour composed of reality show hacks running for the highest office in the land  i m honestly torn for the record  trump has said  f ck  in public before  but not during a presidential stump speech featured image via video screen grab
