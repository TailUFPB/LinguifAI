dan rather  an often unbiased and objective presence in what was once credible media  has officially bucked his long held objectivity and completely and utterly destroyed donald trump after his now infamous  second amendment  comment taking to facebook  rather  who has gone on the record questioning trump s antics on the campaign trial  blasted the gop nominee for directing threats at hillary clinton  saying his comments now  no longer about policy  civility  decency or even temperament   but something more nefarious no trying to be objective and fair journalist  no citizen who cares about the country and its future can ignore what donald trump said today  when he suggested that  the second amendment people  can stop hillary clinton he crossed a line with dangerous potential  by any objective analysis  this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of american presidential politics  this is no longer about policy  civility  decency or even temperament  this is a direct threat of viol ence against a political rival  it is not just against the norms of american politics  it raises a serious question of whether it is against the law  if any other citizen had said this about a presidential candidate  would the secret service be investigating candidate trump will undoubtedly issue an explanation  some of his surrogates are already engaged in trying to gloss it over  but once the words are out there they cannot be taken back  that is what inciting violence means rather is absolutely right  had anyone else but donald trump said this  they would have been arrested and thoroughly interrogated  no questions asked and trump is already making up excuses  it was a joke  he meant more bodyguards and armed citizens  he meant protecting the second amendment in the court  yadda yadda yadda  more excuses from the candidate that  tells it like it is  for the people who like trump because he speaks his mind  they certainly have to make excuses for what he says all the time it s time the other media heads follow rather and break this  objectivity  that stops them from criticizing trump when he says something stupid  for too long the media has allowed him to get away with his insane rhetoric featured image kirk irwin getty images
