scott adams  who s best known as the creator of the dilbert cartoon  is endorsing hillary clinton  but not because he agrees with her policies  or even because he likes her  he s endorsing her because he believes  somewhere in his twisted little mind  that he ll be murdered if he doesn t in his blog  did you know there was a dilbert blog    he says that his politics don t match up with any of the candidates  but he does credit trump with  extraordinary persuasion skills   it gets worse  and don t feel bad if you have trouble keeping up with his theory this past week we saw clinton pair the idea of president trump with nuclear disaster  racism  hitler  the holocaust  and whatever else makes you tremble in fear the only downside i can see to the new approach is that it is likely to trigger a race war in the united states  and i would be a top ten assassination target in that scenario because once you define trump as hitler  you also give citizens moral permission to kill him  and obviously it would be okay to kill anyone who actively supports a genocidal dictator  including anyone who wrote about his persuasion skills in positive terms   i m called an  apologist  on twitter  or sometimes just joseph goebbels  if clinton successfully pairs trump with hitler in your mind   as she is doing   and loses anyway  about a quarter of the country will think it is morally justified to assassinate their own leader  i too would feel that way if an actual hitler came to power in this country  i would join the resistance and try to take out the hitler like leader  you should do the same  no one wants an actual president hitler then  it gets even weirder  adams predicts that trump will win in a landslide  but he believes that by endorsing clinton  he will insulate himself from any backlash  because  according to adams  one of the first people targeted when people try to assassinate trump  will be the creator of dilbert so i ve decided to endorse hillary clinton for president  for my personal safety  trump supporters don t have any bad feelings about patriotic americans such as myself  so i ll be safe from that crowd  but clinton supporters have convinced me   and here i am being   serious   that my safety is at risk if i am seen as supportive of trump  so i m taking the safe way out and endorsing hillary clinton for president uh huh  so  that would be a backdoor endorsement of trump  believe us when we say  scott adams  if trump is elected  you ll likely be one of the last people anyone thinks about featured image via youtube video screen shot
