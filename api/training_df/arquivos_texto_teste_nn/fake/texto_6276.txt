the u s  has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world  thanks to an awful lot of really bad conservative policies from the  and  designed to make us look tough on crime  mandatory minimum sentencing  imprisonment for crimes that don t really require it  and more  has not only put millions of americans in prison  but has had a disproportionate affect on minorities  is crime down from  years ago  sure  but senator  tehran tom  cotton thinks we re actually  under incarcerating  seriously  you can t make this stuff up  he actually labors under the delusion that we aren t putting enough people in prison  speaking to the hudson institute about a bipartisan crime reform bill currently before congress  he actually said  first  the claim that too many criminals are being jailed  that there is over incarceration  ignores an unfortunate fact  for the vast majority of crimes  a perpetrator is never identified or arrested  let alone prosecuted  convicted  and jailed  law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only  percent of property crimes and  percent of violent crimes  if anything  we have an under incarceration problem  he slammed the pro leniency crowd  and complained that just a tiny fraction of the federal prison population consisted of people incarcerated for something like drug possession  however  the federal bureau of prisons says that nearly half their prison population is there for drug offenses  which are defined as use  sale  possession  or furnishing of illegal drugs   percent of the state prison population is incarcerated for drug offenses cotton doesn t let pesky things like facts bother him  though  what s next  a three year mandatory minimum sentence for unpaid parking tickets  perhaps a five year prison sentence for violating pet limit laws  who knows with this guy besides all of that  the u s  has  percent of the world s population  and  percent of the world s prison population    million people are in prison here  and nearly half of them are black any guesses as to what tom cotton thinks of that  he either hasn t noticed  unlikely   or he s got the racist idea in his head that there s something wrong with black people that makes them commit more crime  far more likely   something else he said  about unjust sentences  could be interpreted that way  i don t discount the possibility of a manifestly unjust sentence  one so out of proportion to the crime that it shocks the conscience  but that s why the anglo american system of justice gives the pardon power to the executive   anglo american system of justice  there s really nothing to say about that other than   wow  this man is racist  one question this brings up is how much he s getting paid by the private prison lobby to be this kind of a hardliner  increasing mandatory minimum sentences and other nonsense to ensure high prison capacities is more at the behest of those people than it is a  tough on crime  policy cotton  who is the man behind the treasonous letter to iran a year ago  seems to suffer from a delusion that he s actually studied the issue  his answer to crime is no answer at all   it ll make our societal ills worse  but that s what cotton lives for  he lives for making things worse featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
