it s beyond sad to watch these young men sitting through an interview with their overbearing  loudmouth dad controlling their every move  it s especially disturbing to see lavar ball and the hosts of the breakfast club laughing about liangelo and his fellow ucla basketball players stealing louis vuitton sunglasses in china he certainly isn t doing them any favors liangelo ball said he wouldn t have apologized to president trump if ucla didn t make him do so after ball and teammates cody riley and jalen hill were arrested and released for shoplifting in china  the trio held a press conference after arriving in the united states where they thanked trump for his role in their release  but according to liangelo  who along with his dad  lavar  spoke about the apology with the breakfast club wednesday morning  an apology wouldn t have been in the cards if he knew he wasn t going to play for ucla again watch  as lavar ball  the father of  of these  unfortunate young men that were part of the interview with the breakfast club  talks about how differently he d be treated if he were white  perhaps someone should explain to lavar that the real reason he offends everyone within earshot of his big mouth  is because he s an arrogant ass  who owes any attention he gets from the media to his son s athletic abilities  which of course  he takes full credit for   they wanted to hear that  and he tweeted about it before my speech so i had to add it in there right before i gave it   liangelo told the power   morning show according to the middle ball son  the school reminded him about trump right before he went up to speak to the press  if they didn t tell me to do it  it wouldn t have been in there   ball said on the program  in reference to the trump apology trump fired off a tweet after the ucla players returned questioning whether they would thank him for facilitating their release trump s tweet then prompted lavar ball to question how exactly trump helped  who   ball told espn   what was he over there for  don t tell me nothing  everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out  ball s response led to more beef between the two  with ball reigniting the feud earlier in december when he tweeted a cartoon showing him dunking on the commander in chief liangelo  who was suspended indefinitely by ucla  left the school weeks later and  along with his younger brother  lamelo  signed a professional contract with lithuania basketball club prienu vytautas this week   nypon november     we published an article about how a family member revealed the sick reason lavar ball allegedly wouldn t let his sons see their mother after  surgery to remove portion of her skull so who is this crackpot lavar ball  and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the president of the united states just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country  andrew stephens of the armchair all americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self serving  money  and fame obsessed lavar ball really is  in his article  stephens reveals a sick man  who is so controlling of his  sons and their basketball careers  that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital  over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand on march     andrew stephens of armchair all americans published an article about lavar ball titled lavar ball  the epitome of what is wrong with modern sports  it touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children stephens claimed that in the article  without commenting on upbringing tactics  i attempted to delve into lavar ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit about an hour after the article was run  i received a comment on it from a member of the ball family  who wishes to remain anonymous  the comment  which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter  read as follows   wow  you nailed it  although you don t even know the half of it  lavar took over the high school program  added the coach  his puppet  which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year  and lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court  if you are allowed to shoot at any time from anywhere and never come out of the game  any decent idiot could score  points also  tina ball  his wife had a stroke on feb   she had life threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife    at the chhs vs  lb poly game with his sons  including lonzo  he still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him  and cause bbb sales to diminish   in   ca   tina is there now and he only visits for  hour a few days a week  while her mother has yet to leave her side  pathetic
