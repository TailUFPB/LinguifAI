to conservatives  everything is a conspiracy  and their biggest delusional conspiracy theory of all is that the united nations is going to take over america and confiscate everyone s guns so when some un vehicles were being taken for shipping overseas from the american manufacturer  a conservative motorist freaked out after seeing them on the road and immediately warned others on social media that a un invasion is imminent  can t begin to tell you how many of these i passed today on  near lexington va   wrote conservative jeff stern along with photos of the vehicles being hauled on trailers and that touched off a collective panic among right wingers who are likely setting up bunkers around their homes and loading every gun they own about now like texas conservatives did when they heard about the military training exercise known as jade helm stern saw the vehicles being transported along interstate  around lexington  virginia  which some conservatives mistook for lexington  kentucky and thus ended up spreading the rumor of un vehicles being spotted in both states  the daily mail decided to blow the story out of proportion and literally wondered if the un was here in the event of economic collapse  which only created more panic among mentally unstable conservativesparanoid conservatives even panicked about the standard features of the vehicles  which include bullet resistant glass and seals that prevent exposure to poison gas  considering where un workers usually end up in the world these two features are totally necessary and american military vehicles have the same features for the same reasons snopes even contacted the maker of these particular vehicles and received a reasonable explanation for why the vehicles were being transported unlike the daily mail  we contacted alpine armoring  the manufacturer named in their article  to inquire about the images  according to an individual with whom we spoke at alpine  the vehicles seen in these photographs were purchased by the united nations for use outside the united states  a number of defense industry manufacturers are based in and around washington  d c   a region that includes virginia  for obvious logistical reasons  and the representative confirmed that the trucks were ordered by the un for use in locations abroad after manufacturing  the un vehicles require transportation to their final ports of call inside the u s   and driving them to those final embarkation points could potentially put several thousand miles on them prior to their being loaded onto cargo planes or ships  so the trucks seen here were loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported in that fashion  it is a reasonable inference that  depending on their route and final destination  the same trucks would be spotted in other southern states  particularly if they were to be sent abroad via a cargo ship leaving from a southern port  but you can t expect conservatives to accept reason  which is why they shared stern s post over   times and made comments like these even sarah palin contributed to the panic among conservatives by buying into the theory that the un is here to take our guns away yeah  the stupidity is truly breathtaking featured image via facebook
