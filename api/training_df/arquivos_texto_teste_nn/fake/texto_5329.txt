throughout his campaign  donald trump has been thumbing his nose at the music industry by playing whatever damned songs he wants at his campaign rallies and even at the republican convention  now  the stars have had enough and they put together a music video for john oliver telling trump  and other politicians    stop using our songs  several musicians have complained after the trump campaign  without permission  used their music during rallies  but the issue really cared to a head during the opening night  and again during the closing night  of the republican national convention generally at a political convention  the nominee doesn t make an appearance until the final night  but trump graced the stage on night one  with queen s  we are the champions  blaring from the arena speakers  the irony of opening the most lgbt unfriendly convention in history with a song sung by a man who died of aids didn t get by the remaining members of the band  who told trump and the world that they did not approve an unauthorised use at the republican convention against our wishes   queen  queen   queenwillrock  july     none of that mattered to the trump campaign or to the republican party  because they ended the show with another unauthorized song  but that one might not have been so bad  it was the rolling stones   you can t always get what you want   which seemed  more than anything  to be pointed at all the republicans who are refusing to endorse the nominee that s not the first time whoever is in charge of trump s playlist has seemed to troll him  once  during a rally  rem s  it s the end of the world as we know it  accompanied the candidate onto the stage john oliver  who  fortunately  has the production budget of hbo and was able to put together a super group of sorts of pissed off musicians  the group included usher  cyndi lauper  michael bolton  josh groban  john mellencamp  heart s nancy and ann wilson  sheryl crow and imagine dragons  dan reynolds in the style of charity singles such as we are the world  ann wilson begins the song with the words   it s that time of year  campaign season s here  michael bolton sings   you wave and point make your speeches while balloons fall everywhere  usher continues   but we notice something s wrong and it s gone on way to long  so we re asking you right now  stop using our songs  it might seem appealing  but you re just stealing   they sing in front of american flags  baseball stadiums and mount rushmore source  daily mailthe video did show one song that could be used by trump  although the cat might object  here s the hilarious video featured image via video screen capture
