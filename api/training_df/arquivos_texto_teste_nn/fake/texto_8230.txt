depending on how you look at it  being able to control our minds with machines and computers could be either very terrifying or extremely awesome  however it looks like we re getting very close to connecting the two together and according to the defense advanced research projects agency  darpa   a darpa funded research team has created a novel neural recording device that can be implanted into the brain through blood vessels  reducing the need for invasive surgery and the risks associated with breaching the blood brain barrier  the technology was developed under darpa s reliable neural interface technology  re net  program  and offers new potential for safely expanding the use of brain machine interfaces  bmis  to treat physical disabilities and neurological disorders  via darparesearchers at the university of melbourne are trying to reduce the need for invasive surgery  and success of this technique could change the way modern medicine is performed  their hope is that with this non invasive techniques doctors will be able to better treat a wide range of neurological ailments  one of which being ptsd according to huffpo  the idea shares some similarities to the film  the matrix  where human beings are  plugged  into a virtual world through a data port in the back of the neck  however darpa believes that the main barrier in place preventing humans from effectively communicating is that the cabling we use to transfer the data between the brain and the computer is far too simplistic  there s hope that eventually this will be a way for people to even use artificial limbs as though they were organic  this technology  if successful  is going to change the lives of millions of individuals around the world quite honestly  this is absolutely extraordinary watch here via huffpo featured image  flixnerd
