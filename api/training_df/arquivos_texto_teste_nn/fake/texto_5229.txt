yet another highly respected conservative is jumping from the sinking gop ship now that the captain is billionaire blowhard donald trump  sally bradshaw  a top adviser to jeb bush  announced on monday that she is leaving the republican party  and furthermore  if the race is close in florida she plans to cast her vote for hillary clinton bradshaw  who was a top advisor to bush during his  campaign  has now officially changed her registration to unaffiliated rather than republican  in an email interview  she told cnn s jamie gangel that the gop is at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist   a misogynist   a bigot  this is a time when country has to take priority over political parties  donald trump cannot be elected president   bradshaw said bradshaw has a long history with the bush family  having begun her career in  working for george h w  bush s campaign  she has now joined the ranks of  many other prominent republicans who are staunchly refusing to jump on the trump train  bradshaw said  this election cycle is a test  as much as i don t want another four years of  president barack  obama s policies  i can t look my children in the eye and tell them i voted for donald trump  i can t tell them to love their neighbor and treat others the way they wanted to be treated  and then vote for donald trump  i won t do it  her departure comes on the heels of trump s revolting comments about the parents of a muslim american soldier who sacrificed his life in iraq while fighting for the united states military  bradshaw said his remarks were revolting and made me sick to my stomach   she continued  donald trump belittled a woman who gave birth to a son who died fighting for the united states  if anything  that reinforced my decision to become an independent voter  every family who loses a loved one in service to our country or who has a family member who serves in the military should be honored  regardless of their political views  vets and their family have more than earned the right to those views  someone with the temperament to be president would understand and respect that  bradshaw said trump s most recent comment was the proverbial straw that broke the camel s back  however  leaving the gop is something she had been contemplating for awhile  i ve been considering the switch for months  ultimately  i could not abide the hateful rhetoric of donald trump and his complete lack of principles and conservative philosophy  i didn t make this decision lightly   i have worked hard to make our party a place where all would feel welcome  but trump has taken the gop in another direction  and too many republicans are standing by and looking the other way  she served as jeb bush s campaign manager both times he ran for governor of florida  she said she hasn t made up her mind who she plans to vote for  but it obviously won t be trump  i haven t made a decision yet between clinton  gary johnson or writing in a candidate  if the race in florida is close  i will vote for hillary clinton  that is a very difficult statement for me to make  i disagree with her on several important issues  i have worked to elect republicans to national and statewide offices for the last  years  i have never voted for a democrat for president  and i consider myself a conservative  a supporter of limited government  gun rights  free enterprise  equality of opportunity  i am pro life  there are no other candidates who were serious contenders for the nomination that i would not have supported  bradley faults trump s presidential competitors for not coming out strong enough against him earlier in the campaign season  i really fault the candidates who did not speak out against trump until the end of the primary cycle  lindsay graham and jeb bush spoke out early and consistently   but most did not  fearful of offending that segment of the party or positioning themselves for future office  bradshaw insists that it is  the only real choice for reasonable  thoughtful republicans to make  our president must represent what is good about america   a belief in opportunity for all   regardless of race and gender and background   to rise up and live the american dream  a president can t tear down hispanics  or mock someone who is disabled  or use symbols in campaign literature that jewish voters understandably find offensive  to continue to be the hope of the world  all americans regardless of party affiliation have to reject him  she added  if and when the party regains its sanity  i ll be ready to return  but until republicans send a message to party leadership that this cannot stand  nothing will ever change  truer words were never spoken  the gop is no longer the party of conservatism  it is the party of trumpism featured image via joshua lott getty images
