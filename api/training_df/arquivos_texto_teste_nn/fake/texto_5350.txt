the gazebo at the cudell recreation center in cleveland  ohio has become a non official memorial for tamir rice  an innocent  year old who was shot and killed by the police  the gazebo is the location where rice was killed while playing with a toy rifle according to belt magazine  the location has also recently become a popular stop in the smash hit augmented reality game  pok mon go  for those not familiar how the game works  locations of interest   called pokestops   such as public works of art  historical locations  and other community hot spots the person who suggested the location be added as a location in the game developer s database took the opportunity to make a statement  the description for the pokestop reads  community memorial for tamir rice  shot and killed by cpd officers who shot him in under  after breaking department policy regarding escalation of force  the cudell gazebo bears no marker indicating that is a memorial for rice  the gazebo was scheduled to be demolished though it has not due to certain groups who wish to see the area preserved as a historical landmark  as of right now  the gazebo has remained in a state of limbo  so  besides the stuffed animals and other tokens left by community members  there is no way to tell what the historical importance of what the location is this virtual marker runs contrary to the findings of a grand jury who decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the shooting a commentator on the belt claims to be the person who wrote the description for the gazebo  he claims that he wrote the description not thinking that it would be noticed by many people  as it was added to a much less popular game created by the same company who created pokemon go  he writes that he wrote the description because  memorials are built in the hope people will remember  the events that ended tamir rice s life are something that i worry will be forgotten  it was difficult to see the gazebo pictured without context  and i added a bit without expecting it to be noticed by anyone else  the gazebo in the park should be turned into an official memorial for rice  however  even if it was the spot would not tell the story that so many people hear  it is nice to know that there are people able to get what many would consider the truth of the story of what happened at that spot than what is on the official record featured image from photo by drew angerer getty images
