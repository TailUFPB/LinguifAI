it was just a few days ago that president barack obama absolutely destroyed donald trump on his controversial comments about nuclear power  speaking to reporters at the fourth nuclear security summit in washington  d c   obama addressed the republican front runner s remarks that more countries should have nuclear weapons  and gracefully called trump out for being a complete idiot when he said  the person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the korean peninsula or the world generally  it was completely true and obvious statement to most   but not trump  who lives in a self absorbed  denial filled bubble  always ready to start an immature feud with people far more qualified than himself  trump has decided to hit back at obama   in a way that makes him seem like even more of a moron  during a campaign stop in milwaukee  wisconsin yesterday  trump literally decided to tell people that he understands  the world much better  than obama  seriously  watch that ridiculous moment below for trump to blatantly say that he knows more about how the world works than obama  who has been an extremely successful president for the last  years and done more for american than republicans will ever give him credit for  is a hilarious and yet terrifying demonstration in trump s obvious lack of self awareness trump followed that comment with criticism for the president s treatment of syrian refugees  making the argument that the united states should not be letting them enter the country  trump said  we have no idea where they come from  they could be isis  and they might not be  but they could be isis  did you ever notice the migration  there are so many young strong men  where are the women and children and i said don t let them in  we can t let them in  we ll build a safe zone  we ll build a free zone  we ll get the gulf states to pay  because i don t want to pay  currently  trump is behind his rival  texas senator ted cruz in wisconsin   and if cruz takes the state in its nominating contest on tuesday  this could be a major turning point in the race for gop nomination  if cruz wins  he would get all of the mid western state s  delegates  making it much harder for trump to reach the   delegates he needs to get nominated before the republican national convention in july  featured image via getty images   mark wilson
