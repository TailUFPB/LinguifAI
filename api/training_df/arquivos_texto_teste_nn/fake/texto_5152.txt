as donald trump continues down his path of self destruction  which is bringing the republican party down with him   members of the gop controlled senate are running scared   and they should be  trump is literally ruining the republican s hope of keeping their majority one senator in particular is making it his mission to distance his re election bid from the monstrosity that is donald j  trump pennsylvania republican pat toomey  who resides in a  swing state  very weary of trump s antics  told reporters that voters should separate his run from trump when they go to the ballot box in november and that they can see for themselves that the two are not similar pennsylvania voters are really quite sophisticated and they know for sure that donald trump is really in a category unto himself  so they will make their decision about the presidential race  and then they will make a completely separate decision about the person they want representing them in the senate toomey has not endorsed trump as of yet  but did say he is  waiting and watching  before he makes a decision according to realclearpolitics  toomey and katie mcginty  his formidable democratic challenger  are tied  the mcginty campaign didn t waste time in quickly tying the two together  saying   pennsylvanians understand that it s a trump toomey ticket   and added if he opposes clinton  as he says he does  he s by definition supporting not only trump  but the policies and values trump would bring to the white house so now instead of refusing to endorse  republican candidates are literally telling voters not to think about trump when voting for them  republicans are now asking voters to pretend donald trump isn t on the ballot  they re asking the electorate  in a presidential campaign election  to disregard their down ballot obligations are create two brands of conservatism to suit the gop s needs let that all sink in  that s how desperate they have become if toomey were serious about keeping his seat and holding on to any shred of dignity he might have once had  he would quickly and unequivocally denounce trump and the vile things that have come out of his mouth  as clinton leads the state by  points  and growing   toomey needs all the respect he can get the implosion is going strong  and they are tearing each other apart featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
