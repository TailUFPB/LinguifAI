there s a furniture company in southern maine called  chapter  furniture   the name and the entire concept of the company is to invoke the feeling of a fire sale  they have  or  stores that they only sign short leases on  so at any given time they can advertise   chapter  furniture is losing its lease in  enter town or street name here  and everything must go   it s a brilliant tactic for a company who will probably never resort to its name because it understands how to build from american greed at its very core  someone is going our of business or declaring bankruptcy  it s a free for all that s the american mentality surrounding bankruptcy  bankruptcy is there to help people in severe financial situations put their debt behind them and move on  it s also a way for sheisters to get a bunch of free stuff  make a bunch of money and work the system  donald trump qualifies as the second type  working the system   and openly admitting it    times now  trump s idea to  fix america  has taken a turn toward this mentality and the very thought of it is frightening the new york times reported that in an interview thursday  donald trump talked about how he would approach the national debt  thinking like a failed businessman  he insisted we should simply go to our creditors and ask them to take less  yes  in one idiotic statement  donald trump exposed just how little he knows about the economy or how the debt works  as the times points out  there is no credible evidence suggesting that our debtors would reduce we owe them by a nickel  trump thinks he s dealing in people with real estate they can t move selling bad debt for more bad debt until one day so much of the debt is paper   bad paper   that there s nothing left to do but fail  sound familiar  it should  it s what wall street and the dubya administration did to us in  let s assume for a moment that our creditors would take less  the bulk of the national debt is money we owe to ourselves  is trump going to ask the social security trust fund to take pennies on the dollar because we had a couple of wars that were too expensive and some handouts to fix the mess  how much less should those people who won t be able to retire when the fund is wiped out take  they ve been putting   percent of their paycheck into that fund since they started working  how much less should they settle for as for our other creditors  we re not defaulting on rented furniture  we owe other countries a great deal of money  plus interest  that they provided to us in cash  we use that money to fund the government  if creditors start seeing those kinds of tactics we ll have our credit rating lowered and lose credibility as a country  there s also a good chance the dollar would be removed as the world standard currency  ask donald trump what he ll do when we can t just print more money the bottom line is  trump has no idea what he s talking about  the national debt is one of the most misunderstood components of the federal government  for someone to seek the office that holds much influence over how that debt shrinks or grows without understanding it is preposterous  but then again   we are talking about donald trump featured image from billingsgazette com
