only  days ago  lindsey vonn told cnn that she wouldn t be representing president trump in the  olympics  she also boldly proclaimed that she wouldn t visit the white house if she were invited  i take the olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent  what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremonies  i want to represent our country well  and i don t think there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that  is it really appropriate for an olympic athlete representing the united states of america to make her performance in the olympics about her hate for donald trump was it really necessary for vonn to spew her hate on a network that is not only being called into question for their inaccurate  fake news  reporting on a regular basis but is also known for their extremely unfair coverage of our president well  after her miserable showing in switzerland yesterday   it looks like lindsey needs to focus a little more on her skiing technique  and a little less on her anti  trump rhetoric according to the ap  lindsey vonn finished a world cup super g in extreme pain saturday and was treated by race doctors for a back injury the american star crossed the finish line in obvious distress  in  place and   seconds behind the winner  and slumped to the snow she compressed her back on the fifth gate  according to u s  ski   snowboard vonn stayed in the finish house to be treated  and one hour later limped slowly into a waiting car to be driven from the st  moritz course minutes earlier  her father alan kildow told the associated press his daughter was  ok  in a race interrupted several times by gusting crosswinds  vonn wore the no   bib and was left standing at the start gate during the first delay of about three minutes  she stayed warm with a thick jacket draped on her shoulders the surprise winner was jasmine flury of switzerland  who had a career best world cup finish of fifth before saturday perhaps the outspoken lindsey vonn will get her wish and not have to represent the president or decline his invitation to the white house
