everyone has had it with the donald trump campaign  one person  in particular  has decided that enough is enough   a  year old named cameron edwards from flint  michigan  edwards wrote a letter to trump calling for him to end his campaign in the letter  edward writes that he did not view trump s campaign as a joke like most people did  edwards writes in the letter  mr  trump  when you first announced your bid to be commander and chief of this nation  the american people immediately dismissed your campaign as a complete joke  but not me  i genuinely believed that the people should take the time to listen to your campaign  i told others that it s possible that you may have something to offer  but in reality  i was very wrong  at that point  edwards goes on to list some of the things that trump has become known for over the past few months in the election  this includes the endorsement that trump received from former kkk leader  david duke  trump s non stop scapegoating of muslims  immigrants  and people of color those  however  are criticisms anyone can make  edwards  on the other hand  has a very good question that trump would hate to answer  what exactly is so great that trump is offering  which is exactly what every trump supporter should be asked  why would trump s america be great for a young black man living in flint  do you not see the message that you are sending to us  why would someone like me even be interested in your america  can you even give me one real reason why i should believe that i have an actual shot as a black teenager in your america  as far as i know  you haven t done anything to reach out to obviously concerned communities like mine  please remember  i am a flint resident  and like other members of this community  we are wondering why you and other republicans alike haven t reached out to us  the u s  is a mosaic of people  trump s america might be great for you if you are well of financially and are white  it still probably won t be  though   for everyone else  it would be a disaster  every wasp supporter that trump has to have at least one person in their life that would fall into the everyone else category edwards ends his blistering letter to trump calling for him to end his campaign  edwards writes  mr  trump  it is obvious that you are not interested in uniting this nation  and with the growing threat of violence within your campaign  i believe as a moral adult  that you must end your campaign to prevent people from getting hurt any further  it is simply the right thing to do  outside of a few grammatical errors  there is only one major problem with edwards letter  a reader pointed out the mistake immediately the full letter is embedded below         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt dear donald j  trump my name is cameron  i am a  year old  flint  michigan resident  and today  i would like to posted by cameron edwards on monday  march    image from gage skidmore via flickr with screenshot added
