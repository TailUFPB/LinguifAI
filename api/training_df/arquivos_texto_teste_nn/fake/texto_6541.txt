if republicans had hoped to escape  without pulling a  todd akin  and costing themselves yet another election over idiotic abortion comments  they just lost it in missouri  a contentious fight over giving  personhood  rights to fetuses  and therefore legally defining abortion as murder   has given rise to one of the most horrific pro life arguments made so far  tila hubrect  a state representative arguing in favor of  fetal personhood  claimed that abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape because getting pregnant is the  silver lining  of the  bad  situation her comments were captured by progress missouri it is not up to us to say  no  just because there was a rape  they cannot exist   sometimes bad things happen   horrible things   but sometimes god can give us a silver lining through the birth of a child many conservative pro lifers think it  hubrect just said it out loud  women are baby factories and if they happen to get pregnant while being raped  then look on the bright side the sickening conclusion is that women should be given absolutely no choice in who they conceive with missouri s republicans are currently trying to make that conclusion fully realized with a particularly egregious pro life bill that would define  personhood  at the moment of conception  this would allow fetuses to be given  due process  and possibly assigned state lawyers to file suits against their mothers if they tried to seek an abortion  taken to its logical conclusion  which the supreme court would certainly take issue with   women could be held accountable for murder if they were to exercise their right to an abortion rep  jay barnes  r  recently bragged to the st  louis post dispatch that this bill would make missouri the most  pro life state in the country  over night  he and people like hubrect aren t messing around even in conservative missouri  however  there seems to be limits to how far people are willing to let lawmakers control their bodies  coincidentally or not  missouri is also the home of former rep  todd akin  who infamously floated the bogus theory that if there is a  legitimate rape  then the female body has ways to shut down her uterus and avoid a pregnancy  akin went on to get positively demolished in his election to democrat claire mccaskill it seems likely that hubrect  perhaps overly giddy at the implications of this bill  may have just given her fellow republican lawmakers a lot of heartache on election day listen to hubrect s comments below featured image via linkedin
