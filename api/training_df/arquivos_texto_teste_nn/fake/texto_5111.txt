while many of us are still trying to understand why the hell a presidential candidate would call for the assassination of another presidential candidate  some americans are still in denial and holding onto the false belief that republican nominee donald trump is not a complete dangerous psychopath following trump s recent  second amendment  comments suggesting that hillary clinton should be shot dead  cnn s don lemon held a discussion last night to discuss the severity of his comments  it didn t take long before he and republican congressional candidate dan bongino got into a vicious fight over bongino s blatant ignorance insisting that trump s comments were not actually implying violence  bongino brushed the matter off and showed a horrifying amount of disrespect when he claimed he was  trying not to break down in laughter  over lemon s concern about trump s remarks  lemon fought back and said trump needed to be more accountable and responsible with his words  and bongino countered   you didn t come into this with a clear and open mind  that s when lemon lost it  reacting to an unfathomable lack of logic  lemon responded the way everyone should  the furious host went off  what you re saying right now makes no sense  i m sitting at home  i m watching donald trump  i have two ears and i have two eyes and i can see the reactions  we re not stupid   you should be ashamed of yourself  bongino yelled back at lemon for talking to me as if i m a child   and as lemon criticized him for  lying   bongino s temper tantrum got so bad that he yelled for the network to cut off his mic  you don t know crap about this  don  you re a tv guy  i was a secret service agent  now cut off my mic  do what you wanna do  bongino s request was ignored  and lemon  with the rest of the guests  spent the remaining segment trying to make bongino understand why trump s comments were so unsettling  the two men spent the show basically at each other s throats  bongino continued to deny the fact that the secret service is actually taking this matter very seriously despite the evidence lemon kept pointing out  and the cnn host became increasingly frustrated with bongino s stupidity you can watch lemon unload on bongino below featured image is a screenshot
