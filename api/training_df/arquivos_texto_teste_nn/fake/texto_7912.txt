ben carson just got a reality check he really didn t like   by fellow conservative bill o reilly on monday night s edition of the o reilly factor  the host delivered the hard  soul crushing facts to the republican presidential candidate about how improbable it was that he would win the gop nomination  basically  o reilly told carson  it would take a miracle  even after an embarrassing loss in the south carolina primary on saturday  carson couldn t come to terms that his campaign was over  he not only told his supporters that he had just as many delegates as the other candidates  aside from the winner  of course   but continued to keep up this act with o reilly while trying to convince o reilly  and possibly himself  that with just  one more point  he would have come in third  o reilly got fed up with carson s denial tactics and decided to give him the cold  hard truth  he said  you know me  i m a fairly straight forward guy  it would take a miracle for not only you but john kasich  at this point  with the delegate situation being what it is  to overcome trump  while o reilly still felt there might be hope that sens  marco rubio  r fl  and ted cruz  r tx  could give trump a run for his money  o reilly said to carson  but for you  very difficult  it was like o reilly was speaking to a wall  because carson continued to believe  a lot of things can happen  and that with only five gop candidates now  he could be more successful when america focuses on the issues over  personalities  o reilly kept taking carson off cloud nine and putting him back into reality  where it was becoming clear that carson should soon be dropping out of the presidential race  noting that march  was a crucial date for carson  o reilly said  you know  doc  i gotta tell ya  i just don t think you re gonna do it  it s not you  it s history  it s almost like governor bush in a sense that it was just the wrong time for governor bush up against the colossus  carson reluctantly agreed with o reilly  but mentioned that bill clinton didn t emerge as a success until after the sixth contest   and o reilly shut him down once again  it became clear that o reilly already thinks carson s campaign is over when he asked carson who he d be endorsing after he drops out  carson didn t have an answer  and probably isn t ready to accept defeat  but it s clear that he should start thinking about it you can watch o reilly break carson s heart below  featured image via video screen capture
