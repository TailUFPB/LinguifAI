bruce springsteen has decided to cancel a concert in north carolina that was scheduled to take place on april   springsteen released a statement on the matter where he explained that the cancellation is a protest against north carolina s new law that gives people the right to discriminate against lgbt people the law    not only legalizes discrimination against lgbt people  it forces businesses and schools to discriminate against them as well  springsteen joins other big names in the growing boycott against north carolina  paypal cancelled their plans to build a massive new operation center in charlotte  that cost the state  skilled jobs here is the announcement from bruce springsteen as you  my fans  know i m scheduled to play in greensboro  north carolina this sunday  as we also know  north carolina has just passed   which the media are referring to as the  bathroom  law     known officially as the public facilities privacy and security act   dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use  just as important  the law also attacks the rights of lgbt citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace  no other group of north carolinians faces such a burden  to my mind  it s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress  right now  there are many groups  businesses  and individuals in north carolina working to oppose and overcome these negative developments  taking all of this into account  i feel that this is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for those freedom fighters  as a result  and with deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in greensboro  we have canceled our show scheduled for sunday  april   some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry   which is happening as i write   is one of them  it is the strongest means i have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards as springsteen notes  the media has dubbed the right to discriminate law as a the  bathroom law   while in this case this attack on individual rights is targeted towards lgbt people  it is actually a continuation of the republican to erode local democracy   preemption laws  like  are a strategy conceived by right wing think tanks that date back to the  s the idea behind these laws is to prevent grassroots movements from creating progressive change in local cities  that way activists and organizations who do not have the resources to scale their operations to run statewide campaigns are locked out of the equation while these boycotts are welcomed   is simply another iteration of a national strategy to destroy local democracy  in order to create a true resistance movement to these laws is to oust the political regimes that are making them  it ll require nothing short of a political revolution  until that happens  the only thing progressives can do is play a game of political whack a mole featured image from  photo by jamie mccarthy getty images
