the director of the anti lgbt group the family research council had an interview with chris mathews that he probably should not have shown up for  travis webber  who is the director of the center for religious liberty at family research council  seemed quite incapable in this interview  constantly dancing around and attempting to avoid a valid question by msnbc host chris mathews on which bathroom he would suggest for trans activist jennifer finney boyland the conversation got started when boyland pointed out that the conservative push on bathrooms was simply an attempt to make up for lost ground after they lost the same sex marriage battle  boyland said  i don t think this is about bathrooms at all  i think it s about equal rights  transgender people don t want special rights  we want equal protection under the law  and mostly what we want is to be left alone  and if we can t be left alone  we d like to be treated with love  so you don t want me in the men s room  and you know how you create that perfect situation  just stop  stop coming up with these laws  stop causing trouble where there is no trouble  maybe because now gay men and lesbians can get married  and they re no longer the whipping boys and whipping girls in this country  now maybe they re trying to rile up people against transgender people  and it s not right  and it s not fair  that s when host chris mathews jumped in  putting webber on the spot  asking him   travis  tell jenny what bathroom she should use  that s when webber stumbled and paused  at one point saying   yeah  i mean i m not sure  um     mathews then said   well just answer that question  travis continued to avoid the question with a response that had nothing to do with the question  prompting mathews to include   see  no  you can t answer the question  can you  webber s inability to respond to a valid question is indicative of the way conservatives have handled this issue and many others  one thread to notice about these so called conservative gop folks is their constant attempt to divide and deny people their rights  whether it s supporting discrimination for same sex couples  banning muslims  building walls  denying rights to transgender americans  or supporting an apartheid state like israel which denies palestinians human rights  the conclusion about conservatives must be that they are crazy watch the video here  featured image via video screen capture
