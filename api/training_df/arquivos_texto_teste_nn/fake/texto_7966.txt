right wing morons everywhere are panicking about what will happen to the supreme court now that notoriously bigoted justice antonin scalia has died  of course  immediately this became a political situation before the man s body was even cold  and with politics comes conspiracy theories  one of the biggest theories out there among the right is that president obama had scalia assassinated  of course  this absolutely ridiculous  but that holds no water with idiots  what is  however  especially horrible is when widely read papers repeat this nonsense  which is just what the ny post has just done citing a report from a supposed forensics expert  the paper ran a grossly irresponsible story saying that scalia  could have been poisoned   among other things  the post said in its trashy article lethal poisoning could have left supreme court justice antonin scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found  a top forensic pathologist told the post on wednesday  it would look like he s asleep  it doesn t show anything on the body   said dr  michael baden  who spent  years in the city s chief medical examiner s office the paper  of course  left out the fact that this forensics guy had no ties to examining scalia at all  as well as the fact that his passing due to natural ailments was  perfectly plausible   too well  considering the fact that the man was almost  years old  there s absolutely no reason for there to be suspicion that he didn t just die in his sleep  in fact  he had already lived past the usual age for an american man whoever wrote this crap at the ny post should be ashamed of themselves  then again  after seven years  we re used to the right wing blaming president obama for literally everything  even things he couldn t have possibly had anything to do with featured image via legal geekery
