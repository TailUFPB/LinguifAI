friday on msnbc  climate activist bill nye warned conservatives to  watch out   saying progressive blue states will  address climate change  on their own nye said   only  percent of people in the u s  think that congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups  especially from the fossil fuel industry  have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty  plus or minus two percent  is the same as plus or minus  percent  he continued   there s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writ large states rights  just watch out  conservatives  if states rights include california  illinois  new york   these places that  where people voted in a progressive fashion   watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions  either overtly or by default  on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done  then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way  he added   we ve got to remind people that we re all in this together  the people i think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies  we want to engage everybody  not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest  it is not in the best interest  especially of your children and grandchildren  a couple of times you mentioned that i am against the president and so on  i m not especially against the president  i just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future  to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future  this is true  not just with regard to the national debt  which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved ronald reagan  not only will that national debt increase  but the climate debt  in a sense  what we have to do to address climate change  will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down     breitbart newsthe climate change debate went nuclear last year  over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the national oceanic and atmospheric association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming  pause  in an article on the climate etc  blog  john bates  who retired last year as principal scientist of the national climatic data center  accused the lead author of the  noaa  pausebuster  report of trying to  discredit  the hiatus through  flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards  in addition  mr  bates told the daily  mail that the report s author  former noaa national centers for environmental information director thomas karl  did so by  insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation  gradually  in the months after  came out  the evidence kept mounting that tom karl constantly had his  thumb on the scale    in the documentation  scientific choices  and release of datasets   in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy   mr  bates said saturday on climate etc the june  report   possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus   which updated the ocean temperature record  was published six months before the u n  s paris summit the accusations sparked a fierce back and forth sunday between so called climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of mr  bates  claim  which he defended on the climate etc  blog run by former georgia tech climatologist judith curry zeke hausfather  berkeley earth climate scientist  said in a sunday  fact check  on the carbonbrief blog that the karl paper s conclusions  have been validated by independent data from satellites  buoys  and argo floats and many other independent groups  while noaa s data management procedures may well need improvement  their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups   mr  hausfather said  citing berkeley earth and the u k  s met office hadley centre he said the record  strongly suggests that noaa got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years  meanwhile  the whistleblowing prompted a  we told you so  moment from republicans on the house science  space and technology committee who have long suspected the obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the   pause in global temperature increases  now that dr  bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within noaa about the quality and transparency of the data before publication  we know why noaa fought transparency and oversight at every turn   said chairman lamar smith in a sunday statement the panel launched an investigation into the noaa pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was  rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so called clean power plan and upcoming paris climate conference  dr  bates  revelations and noaa s obstruction certainly lend credence to what i ve expected all along   that the karl study used flawed data  was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored noaa s own standards for scientific study   mr  smith said mr  bates said he decided to come forward after reading a washington post article dec   that said federal scientists are  frantically copying u s  climate data  fearing it might vanish under trump  as a climate scientist formerly responsible for noaa s climate archive  the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data   he said on climate etc in his experience  the  most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of tom karl et al    hereafter referred to as the karl study or    purporting to show no  hiatus  in global warming in the   noaa did not return immediately sunday a request for comment  the daily mail said that mr  karl  admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published  but denied trying to influence the climate summit  asked why he had not waited  he said   john bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time  he denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for paris  saying   there was no discussion about paris   said the daily mail article the american geophysical union issued a statement saying it was  very closely monitoring the situation  have considered the possible implications  and will be sharing any new information or response by agu with you here
