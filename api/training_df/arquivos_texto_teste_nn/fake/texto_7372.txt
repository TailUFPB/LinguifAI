republican front runner donald trump has stopped events for strange reasons before   let s not forget that the business mogul once hijacked and paused an entire gop debate  just so that he could assure america that there was  no problem with the size of his penis  he s at it again  and this time is just as bizarre cnn had wisely decided to cover president barack obama s press conference with raul castro instead of trump s address to the press after his meeting with republicans in dc  but when the network turned back to trump s press conference things got really weird  while taking questions from the audience at the construction site of the trump international hotel  the candidate decided to stop the show and give a woman a job interview on the spot while cameras were rolling and everyone else awkwardly looked on the woman identified herself as a   survivor and an iraq and afghanistan war veteran  telling trump  i love the policy that you have for the military  i wanted to know if trump towers would be part of the veterans job  trump cut the woman off and said  what are you talking about here  we are doing some of that actually already  we have it very much involved  why what are you looking for  what kind of a position  then trump invited her to  come up here  on stage with him as the woman joined him  trump asked the crowd gathered at his soon to be hotel   do you mind if i do a job interview right now  we need good people  for this  job interview   trump instructed the woman to tell everyone about about her experience with design and decorating  in those few seconds  trump decided that she would be a great employee and passed her off to  the men  in charge of the building  saying that if they could negotiate a great deal on her salary  she would probably have a job in no time you can watch this strange  impromptu interview below watch  donald trump conducts impromptu job interview during press conference https   t co   cspan   cspan  march    interview was so weird and uncomfortable to watch  trump got grilled by the next reporter he chose to take questions from  the reporter asked trump why he would offer a job to a complete stranger  trump responded  i felt good about her  i ll tell you what  i looked at her  i said she  you know  i have gut instincts  ok  and we re allowed to have that  and i looked at her and she asked a question and it was a very positive question  she just seemed like a good person to me  featured image via gage skidmore
