picture it  a marginalized but divinely inspired individual  michele bachmann  makes the huge discovery that the bible predicts a global conspiracy  it s engineered by the antichrist  president obama  to get the world to declare war on israel  steal their energy and usher in the end of the world  will michele be able to beat the odds and save us all from destruction spoiler alert   she already did  it seriously sounds like the plot to a  cent movie in the discount dvd bin  but sadly it isn t anything so harmless  right wing watch reported that america s most adorable prophetic savior  michele bachmann  announced how the bible told her the syrian civil war is just a false flag operation to cover up a plan by obama to kick start armageddon  bachmann also said that world leaders were set to grant  legitimacy to the islamic state   russian and iranian intervention in syria was a setup to invade israel by those nations and china will be helping russia and iran to help make sure it matches biblical prophecy better bachmann then linked this all to president obama becoming the antichrist by transforming into an  evil world leader  secretary general of the united nations  bachmann was quoted as saying obama would only  go into an empowered  powerful un  that was powerful enough to see the united states come under the un s authority  since we won t be getting anything sensible out of michele  right wing watch thankfully found where she got her idea  it turns out it wasn t from the bible but from a report in the right wing rag investor s business daily  ibd cited what may be a non existent report from al jarida that this is happening  al jarida is the same publication that suggested obama will shoot down israeli aircraft if they try to attack iran  so their credibility is dubious at best  either way you look at it  it seems michele saved the world yet again by letting obama s secret out and ruining his plans listen to michele bachmann tell you about obama  the antichrist  and all that nonsense below featured image from flickr
