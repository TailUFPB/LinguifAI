on january   the u s  state department announced that the agency had identified  pages of  top secret emails  among the   pages of emails contained on former secretary of state hillary clinton s private email server not surprisingly  clinton s gop rivals went straight to work spreading half truths and misinformation about the announcement as former chair of the u s  senate intelligence committee dianne feinstein pointed out in a statement on friday  several key facts are being left out of the narrative surrounding the announcement for starters  the  pages of  top secret  communication actually involve only seven chain emails  each of these seven emails was sent to a larger group of recipients  including the former secretary of state none of the  top secret emails  were sent from hillary clinton s private server all of the emails originated from within the state department s unclassified system  none of them contained the mandatory  top secret  label which is required for all classified communication during a press conference on friday  state dept  spokesperson john kirby told reporters that the emails were being withheld because they meet the definition of top secret communication now kirby also stressed that the emails were not marked classified at the time that they were sent  was the information contained in the emails considered classified at the time they were sent  keep in mind that all   of clinton s emails were sent between march  and february   since the state department regularly raises the status of unclassified material to the level of classified  it s more than likely the content of these seven emails was not considered classified when it was sent according to clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon   in at least one case  the emails appear to involve information from a published news article  the last time the gop went wild with claims that clinton had  top secret emails  on her private server  we later found out that the information had been retroactively classified by the fbi to summarize in other words  this is not the huge scandal republicans were hoping for  instead  it s just another baseless right wing attack on hillary clinton that falls apart under even the slightest amount of scrutiny featured image credit  pixabay
