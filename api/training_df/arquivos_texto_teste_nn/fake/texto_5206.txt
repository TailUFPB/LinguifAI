earlier on tuesday  donald trump decided to accept a purple heart from a supporter who had earned it for his service  it was a thoughtful gift  but one trump should have refused to accept considering it is a medal earned by being greatly injured or dying in the line of duty serving the nation  and given in the name of the president to top it all off  trump said he  always wanted  one  and this way is  much easier  no one  wants  a purple heart  no one  it s something those in the military actually try to avoid earning  but when it is earned  it is greatly earned and comes with the respect of a grateful nation for the sacrifice given one person who actually did serve their nation  and actually earned a purple heart  is none other than rep  tammy duckworth  d il   she lost both of her legs and damaged her right arm while serving  a sacrifice trump will never know anything about considering he got five deferments from serving in our military during a time of war after hearing trump s remarks surrounding the purple heart  duckworth tweeted out  donald trump  this is how one usually looks when you are awarded the purple heart  nothing easy about it    realdonaldtrump  this is how one usually looks when you are awarded the purple heart  nothing easy about it  pic twitter com   tammy duckworth   tammyforil  august    on you  tammy  for showing trump what actual sacrifice and serving one s nation with courage looks like featured photo by win mcnamee getty images
