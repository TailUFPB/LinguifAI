donald trump has shown his true colors time and time again while running for the republican nomination for the presidency  thus far we ve discovered that he advocates for violence at his rallies  he has racist tendencies  and he says many creepy things about women  including his own daughter  while all of these factors have put a dent in his possible nomination  he still has a comfortable delegate lead and he polls well in upcoming contests  despite the overwhelming evidence that trump is a certified douche bag  there are voters out there who find his insanity appealing  now comes another video that the hacker collective anonymous posted that proves just how absurd it would be to elect this man as the representative of our country and the symbol of our nation watch video here the clip was taken in  at wrestlemania  and it shows donald trump tackling  professional wrestling promoter vince mcmahon and then beating him to the ground  trump then triumphantly pumps his fists in the air  a disgruntled mcmahon is then tied to a chair and trump is shown shaving his head as the crowd cheers him on while this video is quite entertaining  it s very hard to imagine that the guy  we just watched clotheline and shave vince mcmahon s head could be the leader of our military  the planner of our economy  and the guy who represents america to the world let s hope that donald trump running for president is just a short and funny clip in america s history and nothing more  featured image via video screenshot
