the republican national convention was already shaping up to be a nightmare  and for donald trump and the very few gopers that are going to be in attendance  it s about to get a lot worse pro lgbt group planting peace found the perfect way to troll bigoted republicans  and they unveiled it earlier today  directly outside where the rnc in cleveland will be held next week is a new billboard showing trump and ted cruz  who was once smeared by the business mogul but is now speaking at his convention  seconds away from the grossest make out fest you ll ever imagine  the caption on the billboard is also perfect  love trumps hate  end homophobia  planting peacethe timing is perfect   planting peace erected the billboard right as the republican platform committee approved what is being referred to as the gop s most homophobic party platform yet  to encourage republicans attending the rnc to actually consider how the party s bigotry might be affecting america s youth  planting peace said  we challenge the gop to think about how many times their children could hear messages like these and not be impacted or question their value and worth  these messages sink our young people into a spiral of depression and directly correlate to queer youth attempting or actually committing suicide  the blood of these children is on the hands of the anti lgbt platform of the republican party  planting peace is the same non profit that brought the equality house  a rainbow colored house sitting across the street from westboro baptist church  into existence   so it was only appropriate that this equally troll like statement like this would come from them  aaron jackson  the president of planting peace  said the sign was meant to attack the gop s anti gay agenda  what donald  ted and the republican party either fail to realize  or realize and just don t seem to care about  is that their words and actions toward our lgbt family especially lgbt children have meaning and impact  lgbt children hear these messages telling them they are nothing but second class citizens and are left feeling broken or  less than  when children are dying because of negative messages  then it s time to change the message  planting peace calls for the immediate change in the republican party platform with regard to our lgbt family and lgbt rights  never again shall a negative  hateful message be uttered in the name of  religious freedom   we are calling for action that brings full  fundamental rights to the lgbt community  and a narrative that empowers lgbt people to live and love freely  this billboard is going to have trump and his brainless supporters going insane  we can only hope that someone will be able to take a picture of trump s face when he sees it featured image via gage skidmore
