a leon circuit judge in florida has adopted a map of florida senate districts that is a huge win for voter s rights groups and a crushing blow to one of the most heinously corrupt political systems in the country  florida registered democrats outnumber republicans  the state has a history of pulling off wins for democrats like barack obama and al gore  the latter is proof of what the state is also famous for florida has a sad history of voter suppression  college students and new residents turned away because they either kept their home state license or hadn t switched it yet  it was ok to register  sorry  you just can t vote  long lines and refusals are commonplace  as are difficult to read ballots  then there were the chads  hundreds of thousands of votes tossed aside because of hanging chads so why is the redistricting of florida s senate so important  it gives the democrats a shot at a one seat majority  taking half of the legislative power in the state is the first step to maintaining florida as a solidly purple state  purple states tend to turn blue in presidential election years  and with a little bit of down ballot voting  a democrat could see the governor s mansion florida s house districts were recently redrawn as well  but the more than  seat supermajority republicans hold is from the rural districts where the south is still the south and everyone else be damned  still  a purple florida could lead to exciting advances in both the us house and senate  marco rubio has shown what his service to his country means by abandoning his post  he doesn t want to play senator anymore  he wants to play president that s the kind of quality  red  thinking we ve seen from florida since the   we get to sit and listen to jeb  brag about how great the florida economy was when he was governor  never once mentioning that it was built on a bubble of real estate and construction  it was called a  boom   every tradesman known to man went into business for himself and made three phone calls  scheduled  months at a time of whatever it was they did and went to work when the bubble exploded and the bottom fell out  thanks to further deregulation by brother george among other things  florida was left in shambles  the housing market decimated  banks went into mass foreclosure mode on such a scale that it will never truly be settled  neighborhoods were abandoned as tradesmen lost their livelihoods almost overnight this is the republican plan in action because florida is so strict with their building licenses and the costs with required insurances went so high that those enterprising tradesmen ended up working for big companies or leaving the state altogether when things started turning around  many who lost everything found themselves working for half or less of what they were making before the crash florida deserves a break  far too much idiocy comes from florida conservatives  or have we forgotten  george zimmerman  florida has a shot at redemption if those people who are registered democrats get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket featured image via redstate com
