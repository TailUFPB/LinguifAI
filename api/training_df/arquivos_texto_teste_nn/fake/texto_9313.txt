 a conversation with msnbc host craig melvin got heated today when rep  sheila jackson lee  d   texas  refused to say thursday whether her democratic colleague rep  john conyers  mich   should resign  she was all over the map and was confused about what she thinks about conyers saying  congress should instead focus on how to  change the system   straddling the fence has never been more fun to watch with these leftists who don t know what the hell to do  my brain hurt after watching this interview what did she just say except to repeatedly say she s  not taking a back seat  over and over again we hear ya sheila but what does that have to do with conyers resigning  msnbc host craig melvin repeatedly asked the congresswoman about sexual harassment allegations against conyers  but jackson lee steadfastly refused to say her colleague should step down  i believe the decision to go or come will be the decision of that member   she said   as i understand it  mr  conyers is with his family  i m praying for them  i m praying for the women  and i m praying for them to make their decision  but all those decisions are usually at the behest of the member and i expect that to be the case here  melvin asked if she thought the democratic party was sacrificing its credibility on standing up for women by not pushing out conyers  jackson lee denied that was the case nice pivot by lee to blast trump but we re not buying it  craig  absolutely not  because the story is not near concluded   she said before shifting to say what is  appalling  are the allegations against republican senate candidate roy moore and president donald trump melvin pressed jackson lee further on her position about the women who have come forward against conyers  bringing up an african american accuser who was on the  today  show thursday morning  the texas democrat said melvin was  mishearing  her because she is not taking a  backseat  on matters of sexual harassment  she said democrats would not be  wimps  on this issue the truth was right there when craig said the conyers victim  looks just like us it was on jackson lee repeated again that she s not  taking a backseat  on matters of sexual harassment yada  yada  yada
