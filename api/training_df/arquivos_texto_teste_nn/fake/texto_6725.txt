maine has a very bad governor  thanks tea party movement   who just keeps getting worse republican governor paul lepage decided to take a cue from donald trump and spend the weekend mocking indian people  apparently drawing upon his own experiences   and warped by lepage s truly stunning level of racism  no doubt   he lamented the fact that restaurants hire immigrants  the problem  he said  was that he needs  an interpreter  to understand them  and  he added  people from india are  the worst ones  this is right on the heels of donald trump s latest stab at xenophobic nationalism when at a rally he put on a stereotypical indian accent to lament the fact that he had spoken to someone outside of america to inquire about his credit card   part of his plan to make america great again  is to bring telemarketing jobs back to the country  a job nobody wants   the crowd ate it up  so  it seems  did lepage  whom recently accused ted cruz of  stabbing him in the back  and is a big fan of trump lepage has made a name for himself as both a terrible governor in the traditional sense  he s been nearly impeached a number of times and is universally loathed by both republicans and democrats in the state legislature   and an unrepentant racist  already this year he made headlines for this astoundingly offensive rant  these are guys with the name d money  smoothie  shifty  these types of guys  they come from connecticut and new york  they come up here  they sell their heroin  they go back home  incidentally  half the time they impregnate a young  white girl before they leave  which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road  he later said he didn t mean to say  white girl   then a few days later  he said screw it and admitted that he did mean white girls but only because he knew that would make the story sound scarier in a twisted way  lepage is probably relieved that his racism is back in the news  his last act of infamy was blocking a bill that would provide life saving drugs for opioid overdoses to addicts  his reasoning  why bother saving them  they ll just overdose again paul lepage is the worst featured image via youtube screengrab
