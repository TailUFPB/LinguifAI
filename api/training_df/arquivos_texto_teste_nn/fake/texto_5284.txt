it s a good thing democrats picked philadelphia to host their convention  pennsylvania is continually being talked up as  swing state  that could go for trump  they said the same thing about romney in   and he lost by  percent  but as hillary clinton delivered her acceptance speech  one that commentators say could sway undecided voters  a new poll comes out showing clinton beating trump by a whopping nine points in the  swing state  of pennsylvania here s why that s important  people say trump could  some say will  win pennsylvania because of the  rustic belt  white  male centrists who typically lean democrat  but could be swayed otherwise the suffolk university survey showed clinton leading trump    with  percent undecided  the poll also closely reflects nbc news wall street journal marist poll conducted earlier in july that showed clinton with a  point lead  this one   what s also interesting is clinton still blows trump out of the water when factoring jill stein and gary johnson in the polling when clinton and trump were matched in the poll against libertarian nominee gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein  clinton s margin over trump was the same  at  points    percent to  percent  johnson earned  percent  while stein took  percent and  percent were undecided among those candidatesthink about that  before clinton even delivered her  speech of a lifetime   two polls   one from a well known publication and one from a close to home college  show the same results  clinton s choice of a progressively centrist vp pick  who is a major ally to unions  could pick up the weary and disenfranchised white blue dog democrats after the convention  clinton and kaine will be touring the state by bus as they seek to cement and keep their support among pennsylvanians in the west trump continues to be liability for his own campaign while democrats are getting major viewership at their convention  let s hope the momentum can continue featured image via justin sullivan getty images
