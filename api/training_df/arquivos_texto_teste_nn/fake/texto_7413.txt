the majority of america has been wondering who actually is supporting donald trump  he s been rejected in chicago and protests have been a theme at his rallies throughout the country  yet  he does have support as evidenced by his trouncing of other gop hopefuls who are just as crazy as he is but are prone to show it less  so  who are trump s supporters exactly  this video shows us who these people are and how they think watch video here one man believed that the government is after trump  turning the volatile and nasty republican candidate into a victim or even a martyr of sorts   i m for trump cause he s being bullied by the government and they need to be together   the man said  and when asked about the frequent counter protests against trump  he defended the republican candidate   i m not racist and i don t think he s racist   though he admitted trump should have denounced the kkk another man believes in trump s honesty and thinks bernie will control his every move  i think trump is honest  we don t need a barack in office no more  because he s a liar  he can t be direct  hillary clinton is a criminal  bernie sanders is a socialist  he believes in taking away all our freedoms  he ll control the way we eat  the way we sleep  the way we live  these remarks border on paranoia and misinformation  if these people just looked a little closer and deeper at who they re voting for  they would see a racist  a demagogue  and someone who s already done damage to this country  one can only imagine the damage he would do should he become president  featured image via video screenshot
