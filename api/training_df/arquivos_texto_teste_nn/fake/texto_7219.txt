one thing you don t ever want to do is tell a woman to smile more  it s become this thing where people feel they are entitled to tell a woman how she should or should not behave or appear  as if a woman does this one thing  she ll appear more likable or more genuine or more pretty  here s the thing   no one is telling men to smile more  because when men don t smile they re being serious and responsible and down to business  god forbid it be the same thing for a woman pointing out this hypocrisy perfectly was none other than ellen degeneres on her show  she said  she gave a very passioninate speech  and then someone  i don t want to say it was a man  because it was a bunch of men   they said that hillary needs to smile more here s something you should never tell a woman   smile  relax  calm down  or drink less  it s then brought up that no one is telling the male candidates to smile  ellen then shows photos of all the men still running for office  sans kasich   she also points out that it s lose lose for women  because at the same time they re being told to smile more  they re told to wipe the smile off their face because they may look crazy  meanwhile  the men can pretty much do as they please ellen said  i know hillary  and i know there are plenty of things that make her smile   like her daughter  her granddaughter  when there s a sale on pantsuits i m not against smiling  i think we should all do it more   women  men  cats  clint eastwood  but we should do it on our own terms  which is exactly right  telling a woman that they should smile is telling a woman what they should be doing with their body and image  and that s pretty much the epitome of misogyny  if you don t think it s sexist that likely says more about you than it does about anything else featured image via video screen capture
