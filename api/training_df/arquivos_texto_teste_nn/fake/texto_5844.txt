a texas mother recently woke up to possibly one of the most infuriating things a parent can see   a nasty  bigoted message on facebook that was warning her about her lesbian daughter  cassie watson s daughter  ali chaney  was sent home from school last month for wearing a t shirt that read   some people are gay  get over it   in rainbow letters  that s how this teacher knows ali is gay the message in question said the teacher  who appears to be a woman named janice williams  tried to weasel out of taking responsibility for this when she was asked about the offensive message  my fb account was hacked yesterday and i was not responsible for the message sent to the lady causing her to believe that her child would be harmed  it took several attempts to delete the account after notifying fb that my account had been hacked  i have lived my life protecting the rights of others and being an advocate for all children  i m saddened that a hacker can cause such negativity and division among so many people  please give my sincerest apology to this woman and her child  thank you   oh  bull cookies  isn t that always the fallback excuse when you write something horrible like that to someone   my account was hacked   however  like any sane person would when confronted with something that sounds like so many hollow excuses  watson called it  garbage  the school district says the t shirt was  disruptive   because several students had complained  like telling lgbtq students they have to kowtow to the whims of homophobes or be singled out and punished isn t disruptive  nevertheless  they stood by that decision  issuing a statement that said  our purpose at ccisd is to educate children  first and foremost  according to ccisd s dress code in the student handbook and code of conduct  clothing that is disruptive to the learning environment based on reactions by other students is prohibited  the student was offered a school shirt to wear and declined  there s more  though  kcen tv reached out to the district and discovered that this teacher resigned way back on june   well before this message was sent  and for a reason completely unrelated to this situation  one might think that williams felt free to spread her homophobia because she wouldn t face any consequences for doing so this is not something that anybody should ever send out  because it just perpetuates the cultural problem that played a huge role in the orlando massacre  anybody who would send a message like that has their hands covered in the blood of the lgbtq people who have died in hate crimes featured image via screen capture from kcen tv news report and facebook
