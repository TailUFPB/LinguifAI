seldom in life are there truly head scratching moments that make you question all life and sanity  but donald trump being nominated for a nobel peace prize is definitely one of those moments  and no  this isn t satire according to the announcement of those who have been nominated  us republican presidential hopeful donald trump has also been nominated for the prize  according to nobel watcher kristian berg harpviken  the director of the peace research institute of oslo according to a copy of the nomination letter harpviken said he had received  brash tycoon trump   who has attracted international condemnation by calling for a ban on muslims entering the united states   deserves the prize for  his vigorous peace through strength ideology  used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical islam  isis  nuclear iran and communist china   however  it was definitely made known that anyone can be nominated  so his nomination is not indicative of his actual actions and behavior  thousands of people around the world are allowed to make nominations for the peace prize  including members of parliament and government ministers  former laureates and some university professors the nobel institute accepts all valid nominations  so having one s name on the list is not to be taken as a sign of approval  further proof that anyone  and i mean anyone  can be nominated can be found in the fact that right wing radio host rush limbaugh was also nominated many years ago clearly  trump shouldn t be a top contender considering his play for peace is through hate and war  which  of course  in fancy speak would sound something like  vigorous peace through strength    but no  it s rather sanity through means of insanity  and it doesn t add up other nominees include  germany s angela merkel  pope francis  and the greek islanders who helped desperate migrants   edward snowden  the man who leaked intel for the sake of fame reform is also a contender at the end of the day  anyone can be nominated  but it doesn t mean that they ll win  however  the fact that trump was even nominated is terrifying in and of itself  we ll find out this october who actually takes home the prize  hopefully  it will go to someone most deserving  featured image  flickr
