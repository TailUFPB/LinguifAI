if michigan s embattled republican governor thought he could simply keep his head down and he would be off the hook for what his administration did to  and didn t do for  the city of flint  then he just got a very rude awakening  rick snyder and several of his staffers were just served notice that they were being sued for a  pattern of racketeering activity  the lawsuit stems from a group of  flint residents who saw the lack of action being taken at the criminal level and decided to seek damages at the civil one  snyder now faces a rico suit  the same typically used to take down corporations committing fraud and organized crime done by mobsters  ironically  it s snyder s conservative philosophy of treating his governance like running a business that may be his undoing  he wants to run the state like a business   attorney marc j  bern said of snyder   well  the citizens of flint  as shareholders in the corporation of the state of michigan  i don t think they were treated in an appropriate way  the lawsuit alleges that officials misrepresented the suitability of the flint river water as the city s drinking water source for roughly two years and billed flint residents at rates that were the highest in the nation for water that was unusable  resulting in the city s budget deficit being reversed at first blush  using the rico act  to go after a sitting governor seems like a stretch  but snyder has always stressed how he hated government and considered himself more of a facilitator of private industry  to prove it  one of his first acts after being elected in  was to give enormous tax breaks to his rich friends  in that light  proving greed motivated gross negligence  and potentially willful deception  at the hands of snyder s administration shouldn t be very difficult  through emails  it s clear that both snyder and the people who worked for him were very aware of problems with flint s water  at the same time  the group made very little attempt to hide the fact that they hoped skimping on flint s water safety would save them a few bucks in the long run  it was all part of that business first mindset that snyder trumpeted during election years as the washington post put it snyder  a former accountant and venture capitalist whose twitter handle is  onetoughnerd  took office in  promising to fix the state s many financial problems by applying the expertise of outsiders who could reinvent the way government works  in flint  where poverty had deepened after the departure of much of the auto industry  he appointed a series of emergency managers whose authority superseded even that of the elected city council with his unelected cronies in place  snyder focused on profit margins rather than the welfare of his state s residents  and to absolutely nobody s shock  the plan came back to backfire   hurting michigan s most vulnerable  now he s being accused of the same crimes that took down the mafia  should snyder ever wind up behind bars  it s likely he would fit right in featured image via mark wilson getty images
