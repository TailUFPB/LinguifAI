normally  the thought of listening to coldplay is the stuff of nightmares  just behind spooning with sarah palin and spending more than  seconds staring at ted cruz s face  but something is happening that  for a few seconds  might just make what would normally be an act of self torture tolerable  coldplay has announced that the president s moving rendition of  amazing grace  will be included on their next album the band s frontman  chris martin  says the singing voice of president barack obama will make an appearance on upcoming album   a head full of dreams   which is due to be released next month  he told british tabloid the sun  we have a tiny clip of the president singing  amazing grace   because of the historical significance of what he did and also that that song being about   i m lost but now i m found   the publication notes that the band has obtained both obama s personal permission to use his voice  and that of the church in which the golden words were recorded a source close to the band added   barack obama wouldn t let just anyone feature his vocals on the record  especially considering what a deeply emotional moment it was for him  but he clearly loves coldplay and is happy to be a part of their music history  the band were obviously thrilled  they needed to get permission from obama himself and the charleston church it was recorded in  i met barack obama in the summer and one thing he said to me was   oh i have your songs on my ipod   but i just thought   oh i bet he says that to every pop star he meets   martin says  i can t get my head around the notion that the president of the usa would have any of my songs on his playlist  it is just too surreal  while many would question the president s choice in music  none can deny that it would truly be an honor for any band to obtain the president s personal permission to use his voice in their songs watch the president show off his dulcet tones below featured image via getty
