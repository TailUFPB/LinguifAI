the battle between supporters of black lives matter and those who see blm as a racist  violent group of domestic terrorists is getting worse in the wake of the deaths of officers in dallas and baton rouge  which blm had zilch to do with  it s easy to assume that every police department everywhere are working on ways to stop blm in their tracks  but that s not true  there is at least one department that actually sees blm quite differently earlier this week  phoenix black lives matter hosted a forum in which police officers  and other community leaders  were invited to speak  the phoenix police department s assistant chief  mike kurtenbach  said outright  the phoenix police department doesn t see black lives matter as a terrorist organization  we view black lives matter as a partner who holds us accountable we stand with you to find solutions  there s no way to respond to that but with cheers  and phoenix mayor greg stanton reinforced that by telling the diverse crowd that they re looking to have a very diverse police department  and they want people to apply to work in their department  more diversity can mean more accountability  which means changing policing for the better  working with blm as a partner  instead of fighting them as a terrorist group  also leads to better policing we re full of people mostly conservative who believe that blm is specifically waging a war against cops  though blm actually decries that violence  they want to remain peaceful  yet  our conservative leaders  particularly those at the republican national convention right now  scream about black lives matter being inherently racist  as donald trump himself said  then again  from a white supremacist  that s not too surprising  but it s disgusting that so many in the gop agree with him there s also rudy guiliani  who claims to have saved a lot more lives with his broken windows policy than black lives matter ever did  he said  i don t see what black lives matter is doing for blacks other than isolating them  all it cares about is the police shooting of blacks  it doesn t care about the  percent of blacks that are killed by other blacks  we don t see how he cares about black lives at all  new york city s broken windows policing model has led to a very  very racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white people then there are some police departments that see blm as a threat  and any support of them as a gross insult  almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with  for instance  the somerville  mass  department is calling for the removal of a black lives matter banner from city hall like it s the confederate flag  their union actually said  the somerville police employees association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the black lives matter banner above the main entrance of city hall  it is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country  the people who cry   all lives matter   really don t get why the movement specifies the black community  some lives in this country matter more than others here  given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police  are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system  and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent  their lives matter considerably less than other lives that is an undisputable fact so it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with blm on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this  rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence  we need a lot more of this featured image via phoenix police department
