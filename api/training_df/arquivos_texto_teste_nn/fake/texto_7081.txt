it s no secret that donald trump talks to his supporters at an elementary school level  but even third graders would have to look at this answer to the question of  why abraham lincoln was a successful president  and laugh  trump  like a deer in headlights  delivers what may be the dumbest response ever delivered by a person hoping to bullshit his way through a question he can t answer it s a beauty to behold trump sat down with legendary journalist bob woodward to cover a variety of topics  trump  having clearly not prepared whatsoever  flailed spectacularly throughout  just one example  i m a very inclusive person  i actually am somebody that gets along with people  and yet from a political standpoint  although i certainly have a lot of fans  you just said hello to senator sessions  it s enough to give sarah palin a run for her money for the word salad of the year title however  trump s train finally derailed completely when woodward asked him what he though the republican party stood for given its legacy as the party of abraham lincoln  trump responded as if he had never heard the name before well  i think lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons  he was a man who was of great intelligence  which most presidents would be  but he was a man of great intelligence  but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time  ten years before or  years before  what he was doing would never have even been thought possible  so he did something that was a very important thing to do  and especially at that time what did abraham lincoln do  don t ask trump  he just knows it was something  very vital  and  very important  the reaction on twitter was unforgiving   katherinemiller that s verbal diarrhea not an answer to anything   david bohm   davidjbohm  april    this is like a  grade history paper    katherinemiller  does trump know what abraham lincoln did as president  pic twitter com   yes  nick  earcy    yesnicksearcy  april    there is another theory here  perhaps trump isn t dumber than a  grader  perhaps he s just more racist than you dared suspect the fact of the matter is that trump s campaign has thrived on appealing to the portion of the american public most likely to ask  why isn t there a white history month   to many of his supporters  lincoln s emancipation proclamation wasn t necessarily a good thing  a full  percent of his supporters say they thought it was a mistake  some have even argued that african americans were better off as slaves than  democrats   trump supporter ben carson once mused that obamacare was as bad as slavery to talk about lincoln s success is to talk about african americans and to talk about african americans is to not talk about the  silent majority  who claim it is white people who are oppressed  so  a good way to sidestep alienating your base is to talk in generalities  lincoln succeeded  for numerous reasons   he did  something  that was  vital   it was  something  that was  very important to do   trump may think he has a great relationship with  the blacks  but it s the whites who come out by the thousands to vote for him   and he knows it i m not sure which is worse  a republican front runner who can t articulate who abraham lincoln was or one who finds the emancipation proclamation so controversial that he can t even mention it as one of the former president s successes featured image via white house and scott olson getty images
