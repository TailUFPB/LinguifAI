the houston police department and texas rangers are investigating after a gun nut opened fire on the office of democratic state senator john whitmire a day before president obama is scheduled to speak in austin early thursday morning around    a shooter fired several rounds into the two story office   there are bullet slugs everywhere   whitmire said   one lodged in a framed picture  it s pretty amazing  whitemire  a gun control advocate  surmised that the weapon used in the attack was an ar  because the bullets were   caliber  no one was harmed in the shooting but whitmire and his staff along with law enforcement officials are taking the incident seriously  we ll take precautions  but it s part of the job  unfortunately  in this day and time   whitmire said   they are checking in this general area to see if anyone else received any gunfire  we don t know yet  i don t know yet  the targeting of whitmire s office occurred the day before president obama is scheduled to appear at the south by southwest tech and music festival on friday where he is delivered a keynote address upon hearing of obama s schedule  texas open carry gun nuts stated their desire to attend the event with their guns to hand out pro law literature  but one of the gun nuts had a different idea for what his buddies should do  if you get a clear shot  please fire for effect   conservative gun nut kriss elliot wrote on facebook so not only has the texas open carry obsession resulted in violence against a democratic office  it has resulted in gun nuts actually wanting to assassinate president obama  and now it s much easier for them to do this because they are legally allowed to carry deadly firearms in public view make no mistake  these people belong in jail or at the very least an fbi watch list  but as long as republicans control the state it will remain an exaggerated and embarrassing version of the wild west featured image  onlyinyourstate com
