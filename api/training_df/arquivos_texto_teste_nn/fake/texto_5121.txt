even the women of fox news refuse to buy trump s bullshit claim that he is a feminist that why when fox business contributor bernard mcguirk referred to the republican nominee as the  ultimate feminist  on tuesday all four women of outnumbered immediately lit him up for it fox host sandra smith asked if senator susan collins  refusal to endorse donald trump will hurt him even more among women  a demographic trump is struggling to gain support from because he has repeatedly attacked them throughout his campaign and has generally treated them like shit his entire life indeed  trump thinks that women are objects who are nothing more than sexual conquests and incubators nevertheless  mcguirk still had the gall to declare that trump is a feminist because he attacks men and women equally  which drew the ire of the four female hosts around him  if a woman attacks donald trump  he ll attack her back just like he would with a man   mcguirk continued   he doesn t look at her as a delicate little flower  we can t you let you get away with that   smith said before meghan mccain gave mcguirk a piece of her mind  informing mcguirk that trump desperately needs women right now more than he needs white men  facts are a stubborn thing  he s doing very poorly with women  specifically college educated women  which is a demographic that normally just easy for republicans to scoop up  he s got you  bernard  he needs me  he needs sandra  i like you  i respect you  in all fairness  it s directed at us  it s not directed at you  he s already got white men  mccain and her fellow hosst were particularly outraged by mcguirk s claim because trump has relentlessly attacked new hampshire senator kelly ayotte for criticizing his attacks on a gold star family who lost their american soldier son when he sacrificed his life to save his fellow brothers in arms  i don t know kelly ayotte   trump said   i know she s given me no support   zero support   and yet i m leading her in the polls  i m doing very well in new hampshire  we need loyal people in this country  we need fighters in this country  we don t need weak people  we have enough of them  clearly  trump attacked a woman for rightly standing up to him rather than admit he was wrong one fox host concluded that trump may be an  equal opportunity attacker  but that doesn t make him a feminist here s the video via youtube and women overwhelmingly agree  which is why over  percent of women view trump unfavorably and why hillary clinton is poised to win the women vote by an even larger margin than president obama did in  featured image  screenshot
