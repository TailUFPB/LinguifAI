on monday  donald trump accused the president of the united states of being an isis sympathizer and when the washington post reported on it  he threw a tantrum that culminated in his taking the unprecedented step of banning one of the biggest newspapers in the country from having access to his campaign  to put that in its proper context  during the height of the watergate scandal  an event begun by two washington post reporters  president richard nixon didn t even try to pull press credentials  it was literally unthinkable on facebook  trump went on a rant about how unfair the washington post was being for accurately quoting him i am no fan of president obama  but to show you how dishonest the phony washington post is  they wrote   donald trump suggests president obama was involved with orlando shooting  as their headline  sad based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting trump campaign  we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest washington post to be clear  trump is   as is often the case   openly and unapologetically lying  earlier in the day  he went on fox news and remarked that the reason obama can t stop terror attacks in the united states is because he doesn t want to  we re led by a man who is a very   look  we re led by a man that either is  is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind  and the something else in mind  you know  people can t believe it  people cannot   they cannot believe that president obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical islamic terrorism  there s something going on  it s inconceivable  and when reporters asked him to clarify  he refused  and cryptically added that he would let people decide for themselves what he meant  trump  who has been on record for years as being a birther  knows what conclusions his fans will draw  why rock the boat by turning that particular dog whistle into a bull horn by one count  trump has banned at least seven media outlets from covering his campaign due to unflattering treatment   this doesn t include the news programs or journalists whom trump simply refuses to talk to because of personal beefs  we count at least  outlets trump has barred from events nat review  daily beast  huffpo  buzzfeed  wapo  politico  dmr  who else   alexandra jaffe   ajjaffe  june    few more  mother jones and univision  there are likely others  there will likely be more soon so when the washington post was added to the list  the paper s editor marty baron released a scathing statement calling trump on his fascistic view towards the free press  donald trump s decision to revoke the washington post s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press  when coverage doesn t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be  then a news organization is banished  the post will continue to cover donald trump as it has all along honorably  honestly  accurately  energetically  and unflinchingly  we re proud of our coverage  and we re going to keep at it  in short  don t expect the washington post to just roll over  they are going to continue to go after trump wherever and whenever he tries to pull a fast one on the american people trump has also flirted with the idea of getting rid of the free press altogether once he is president  on at least one occasion trump told his supporters that he would open up libel laws and viciously and aggressively sue any media outlet that tries to criticize him  with such a fundamental danger to america s first amendment  only one news network embraced trump s moves towards tyranny  his friends at fox stuart varney on fox business calls  washingtonpost reporters looking into trump  henchmen  of jeff bezos  pic twitter com   john whitehouse   existentialfish  may    must assume they re safe  with the sunny coverage they give trump  it s unlikely that they ll lose their credentials any time soon featured image via gerardo mora getty images
