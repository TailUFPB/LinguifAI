donald trump has once again used images of non american military in a campaign appeal  this time the former reality tv star used images of communist soldiers in a web ad advertising his support of veteran s issues the men were clearly communists  as the detail on their medals read  cccp   the russian initials for ussr   the union of soviet socialist republics interesting choice for a photo of veterans in this  realdonaldtrump video  https   t co ndxdwpvmdd pic twitter com   josh perry   mrjoshperry  january    he was called out for posting the communist soldiers as americans  the trump campaign pulled the video  but here it is the incident is not the first time team trump has tried to pass off foreign soldiers as americans  in july  trump tweeted out a photo of himself embedded on the american flag with a photo of soldiers  the problem is  that photo was a picture of german nazi soldiers  as in the photo of the communist soldiers  a cursory glance at the picture would have revealed the ss eagle logo on the side of their uniforms as he often has done during the campaign  trump blamed the photo on a  young intern  and pulled the picture it was the same excuse he used on friday when he re posted a complimentary twitter image from an account called  white genocide   who turned out to be a trump supporter who also is a backer of the white supremacist movement trump s campaign is a cult of personality  built of toadies who appear to have risen in the ranks based on how much they suck up to the former reality tv star  actual competence doesn t seem to matter at all  even more damning  it doesn t seem to matter to republican voters  who appear quite fine with giving their support to trump  even as he can t show the basic respect that is due to members of the u s  armed services but then again  that seems to be the mindset of most of the republican establishment  so perhaps it shouldn t be so surprising or jarring featured image via flickr
