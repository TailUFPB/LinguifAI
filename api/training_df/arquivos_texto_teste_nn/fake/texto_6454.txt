throughout donald trump s entire campaign cycle  many conservatives have spoken out against the business mogul reality television star and expressed their opposition to his candidacy  however  now that his competition is out of the race and trump is the republican party s presumptive nominee  right wingers are desperately seeking a way to make sure trump doesn t further ruin america  for many of them  this means supporting democratic front runner hillary clinton by any means possible on cbs  face the nation  clinton revealed that over the past few days   basically ever since it became clear that trump will likely be representing the gop in the general election   she s been getting  a lot  of republicans asking to help her campaign  many of these conservatives are passionate  nevertrump voters who would rather abandon their party and vote blue in the election than vote one of the most terrible people in the united states into the white house during the interview  john dickerson asked clinton how she plans to handle conservatives who are still  skeptical   but embracing the idea of voting for her clinton simply replied that she is not only more than qualified to be the next president  but has a  track record of getting results   the former secretary of state said  i am asking people to join this campaign and i ve had a lot of outreach from republicans in the last days who say they are interested in talking about that  you can watch the interview below the speed at which trump has pulled the republican party apart is impressive to say the least  we could have predicted that some conservatives would be jumping ship by the party s reaction when trump was first announced as the party s presumptive nominee  the sheer rage from conservatives was priceless   many of them not only burned  tore up or destroyed their voter registrations cards by other measures  but many changed their party entirely  so while trump has risen amongst his own supporters for being more vulgar and offensive than ever  he is only helping to unify the rest of the country   against him featured image via justin sullivan   getty images
