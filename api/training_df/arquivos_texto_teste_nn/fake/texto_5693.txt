when republicans announced that they would be abruptly releasing the conclusions to their exhaustive  five year benghazi witch hunt this week  political strategists were stumped  either this meant they had something explosive and wanted to unload it  or it meant they had absolutely nothing and wanted to bury the wasted energy  money and time spent on this anti hillary clinton hit job long before the election rolled around upon releasing the document  it became instantly clear which option this was  even after five years  the republican led benghazi investigation found absolutely zero evidence that hillary clinton did anything wrong  nor did they find a single way clinton could have saved any of the victims  in short  the investigation was a complete and total dud as the new york times summed up ending one of the longest  costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history  the house select committee on benghazi issued its final report on tuesday  finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by hillary clinton in the  attacks in libya that left four americans dead not that republicans didn t try their hardest  the investigation cost a truly staggering   million and took years to conduct  at every turn  the evidence suggested clinton was not irresponsible with her actions while secretary of state  and at every turn that evidence was ignored in the hopes that there was a bombshell just around the corner also admitted to during the final report  president obama didn t  lie  to the american people about what happened in benghazi  that was right wing spin the investigations generally concluded that after the attack  the obama administration s talking points   a matter of much dispute   were flawed but not deliberately misleading the idea that president obama would have all the information to accurately describe what was unfolding in benghazi as it happened was preposterous  as someone once wryly remarked  george w  bush spent years telling the american public that iraq was responsible for    president obama spent a few hours saying  we don t know  what happened in benghazi  hardly an impeachable offense nevertheless  republicans   including trump s campaign   have tried to make a lot of political noise based on these rumors  in a sick irony  trump s own lawyer spent the same morning this report was released openly accusing hillary clinton of  murder  because of benghazi nbc wsj poll has  realdonaldtrump beating  crookedhillary on  honesty    nationalsecurity  this picture says it all  pic twitter com   michael cohen     june    was understandably relieved to have this nonsense put past her  despite the lack of evidence  certain corners of the internet routinely cited benghazi as a reason not to vote for her  that talking point has finally and comprehensively come undone  after more than two years and more than   million in taxpayer funds  the committee report has not found anything to contradict the conclusions of the multiple  earlier investigations   a spokesman for the clinton campaign said in a statement   this report just confirms what majority leader kevin mccarthy and even one of trey gowdy s own former staffers admitted months ago  this committee s chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave americans in order to try to attack the obama administration and hurt hillary clinton s campaign  in many ways  this final white flag by republicans represents the increasingly despondent way they are viewing the upcoming election  their candidate is a belligerent  self aggrandizing bigot that is currently losing by historic numbers in the polls  if the gop had any shot at competing in this election with that guy  they needed something like benghazi to derail clinton  instead  they were forced to admit there was nothing there by releasing the report now  there is a clear sense that the republican party is hoping to dig their trenches  hunker down and wait out whatever comes next  the benghazi investigation going down in flames isn t exactly a game ender  but it s certainly not the game changer they had hoped for either featured image via drew angerer getty images
