trump s supporters have proven time and time again that the reason they re able to stand behind the donald with a completely clear conscience is because they re exactly like him  the pro trump crowd is just as islamophobic  racist  irrational  angry  vulgar and self involved as the republican frontrunner himself  the majority of trump s supporters also share another trait of trump s   they  too  are misogynists and this couldn t have been more evident than his supporters  choice of attire at a recent rally while at trump s campaign event in syracuse on saturday  jill colvin of the associated press managed to snap a picture of this disgusting t shirt  proudly worn and modeled by one of the candidate s young trump bros if you need any more convincing that the  trump that b tch  slogan isn t a misogynistic  disrespectful attack on women  just wait until you see what the front says misogyny at its finest  not only was there a completely despicable message on the back of the shirt  but the front makes a disgraceful  tasteless reference to former potus bill clinton s infamous affair with monica lewinsky  there couldn t be a more immature  vile way to disrespect democratic front runner hillary clinton than this these t shirts were being sold outside of the event  and it s shameful to think that even one person would buy one  but then again  what else can you expect from someone who believes that trump is worthy of being the next president of the united states these people have stood by trump through every single one of his attacks on women  not including trump s extremely long  and forever expanding  history of misogyny  these morons have supported the disgraced candidate through his horrific abortion remarks that stated women should be punished for terminating a pregnancy  his unprovoked attacks on rival ted cruz s wife  an incident where trump s own campaign manager threw a female reporter to the ground  and trump did nothing about it   trump s one sided feud with fox news anchor megyn kelly  his awkwardly incestuous comments about his own daughters  and so much more these people have absolutely no moral compass between right and wrong  and they ll do anything just to get some attention   just like trump himself  trump s misogynistic messages are becoming more and more terrifying  and his followers are going to stand behind him one hundred percent  the gop has been terrorizing women forever  but trump s particular brand of hateful rhetoric is especially dangerous  featured image via twitter
