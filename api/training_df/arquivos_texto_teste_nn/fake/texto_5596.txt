donald trump is the twitter candidate  so it shouldn t be a surprise that one of his supporters got himself into hot water with a recent tweet  that supporter is a candidate for massachusetts state senate and in it  he praised trump for  putting self righteous faggots in their place  ted busiek  who wants to eliminate affordable housing  same sex adoptions and daylight savings time  denied that this tweet was hateful donald trump  putting self righteous faggots in their place since   how i love this fellow  maga https   t co   ted busiek   tedbusiek  july     he insisted  it was a reference to the way trump  in   insulted native americans  if you look at some of the reservations that you ve approved       they don t look like indians to me  and they don t look like indians to indians  and a lot of people are laughing at it   trump said in the remarks dated   apparently shocking the congressman questioning him  who likened the remarks to historical racism  trump said   only indians can have the gaming       why are you being discriminatory  why is it that the indians don t pay tax  but everybody else does  i do  busiek told the news service he didn t intend the term in a  hateful sense  or to imply that the congressman was gay  using the word instead to mean the congressman was  obnoxious  and was  kind of being a jerk  source  mass livegot it  so it was the  nice  use of the word  faggot   of course  busiek s history might indicate otherwise  i already mentioned that he s against same sex adoptions  and of course  he s against same sex marriage  he  like many trump supporters  is also concerned about losing his rank as a white man on the  excuse the pun  totem pole claiming a  cultural rift  exists between state house politicians and a sizable section of the bay state s population  busiek told the news service he spoke for  anybody who works for a living   and those who find themselves  under attack  for their  oppressor status  as white  male and successful  i think there s a great amount of jealousy involved   busiek said of so called  social justice warriors   who attack real and perceived racial and gender sleights asked if he was a social justice warrior for successful white men  busiek said   that s a good way to sort of turn it on its head  maybe i m engaging in identity politics  too   busiek said  though he said he disagrees with that point of view because  he said  identity politics is contingent on being  born into a victim class  if busiek s tweet proves anything  it s that trump is merely a mirror reflecting the bigotry of his supporters  trump is a truly horrible human being  who insults women and basically every minority  but he says very little about lgbt people  if anything  he s been historically supportive  of course  that s not to say trump won t tweet something ugly about gay people today  after all  he s all about pleasing his supporters featured image via ted busiek s facebook page
