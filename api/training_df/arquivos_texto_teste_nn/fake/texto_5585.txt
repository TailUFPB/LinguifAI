michigan s republican governor  rick snyder hasn t quite satisfied his penchant for evil doing  snyder  who is globally infamous for overseeing the poisoning of the city of flint  michigan  is now trying to re steal more than half a billion dollars from michigan s teachers in   a law was passed that forced school employees to contribute  percent of their pay to their healthcare retirement benefits  the law was ruled as unconstitutional by the court of appeals on june   that means that the already collected   million dollars that are currently held in escrow must be returned to the school employees that it was originally stolen from  governor snyder s decision to drag this case out  even though the attorney general will not assist in the appeal  is a shameful use of the people s time and money  school employees deserve to have their hard earned money returned to them as soon as possible  but instead they will have to wait as governor snyder spends more time defending what is clearly an unconstitutional law   said david hecker  president of american federation of teachers michigan that ruling doesn t fit into snyder s master plan  he is now suing to appeal the court s decision  the suit is so frivolous and politically toxic that even the governor s republican comrade  michigan attorney general bill schutte isn t willing to touch it with a ten foot pole  schuette has announced that he will not represent the snyder administration  after reviewing the appellate decision in american federation of teachers v  state of michigan   the attorney general is declining to provide counsel if the governor wishes to appeal the ruling   said schuette spokeswoman andrea bitely bitley also said that  in this case  we ve not only reviewed the ruling  but we ve also spoken with many teachers and heard from many teachers across michigan  and it just didn t make sense to continue the appeals process through our office at this point  snyder insists that he is trying to protect  the stability of the system   according to a statement from snyder s press secretary  anna heaton the snyder administration has proven once again how badly government functions when it is controlled by republicans  snyder s political career is virtually over  that means he is free to fight for the causes he truly believes in without worrying about his name becoming more tarnished than it already is  apparently  those causes include stealing from teachers and school employees paychecks featured image from mark wilson getty images
