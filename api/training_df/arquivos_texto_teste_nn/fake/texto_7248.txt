there has been a consistent thread in zionism that has called for the ethnic cleansing of palestinians for over  years  and this thread has dominated both secular and religious zionists on the grounds of creating and maintaining a majority jewish state  theodore herzl  an atheist jew  who is considered the father of political zionism  advocated for the expulsion of the palestinian people when he helped launch the zionist experiment  over  years later  there are millions of displaced palestinians and millions of others who are under a brutal israeli military occupation  and the calls for ethnic cleansing continue not only by secular israeli jews but religious israeli jews a novice on israel would assume that these calls are by individuals on the fringes of israeli society  however  the latest call comes from israel s chief sephardi rabbi  yitzhak yosef  yosef said that non jews should be forbidden to live in the  land of israel  also striking is yosef s views on non jews in the country  deeming them as inferior  a view shared by the vast majority of israeli jews toward the palestinians  in fact  at the very most  yosef believes that the palestinians should be servants to the jews  he said  if our hands were strong  if we had governing power  then non jews shouldn t live in the land of israel  but our hands aren t strong  we re awaiting our righteous messiah  who will be the true and complete redemption  and then they ll do this  the reason some non jews are allowed to live in israel is to serve the jewish population  who will be the servers  who will be our assistants  therefore  we leave them here in the land  it must be emphasized again that this is not an individual who is on the fringes of israeli society  he is the chief rabbi of millions of israelis who feel the exact same way  moreover  just like theodore herzl and the early zionists who set the seed of racism and ethnic cleansing  a majority of israelis want palestinians expelled from the land  that is alarming  given that the  israeli government has life and death power over the palestinians and right wing crazy israeli settlers walk around palestinian neighborhoods brandishing their weapons and terrorizing palestinians unfortunately  the united states is israel s enabler and we give them billions of dollars in weapons every year  one only need look at the embarrassing way our politicians grovel to the influential pro israel lobby  aipac   which has a stranglehold over us politicians  have you ever wondered why most politicians fawn over israel  it is because aipac can make or break a candidate if it deems him her to be nonconformist to anything israel yet  americans also have a strong social justice fabric and if americans new the nastiness of israel s treatment of the palestinians  we would collectively call on the boycott  divestment and sanctioning of israel until it conforms to international law featured image via video screen capture
