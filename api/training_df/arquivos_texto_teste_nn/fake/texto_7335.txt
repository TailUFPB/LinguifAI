well this is a peculiar thing indeed  paul ryan  leading member of the ayn rand cult of hating the poor  has had a change of heart via raw story  there was a time when i would talk about a difference between  makers  and  takers  in our country  referring to people who accepted government benefits  but as i spent more time listening  and really learning the root causes of poverty  i realized i was wrong  a republican admitting they were wrong about anything is like finding a four leaf clover in the sahara  finding a republican that admits they were wrong to demonize the poor in america is like finding one on the moon  but ryan wasn t done  he made it absolutely clear what he meant  takers  wasn t how to refer to a single mom stuck in a poverty trap  just trying to take care of her family  most people don t want to be dependent  and to label a whole group of americans that way was wrong  i shouldn t castigate a large group of americans to make a point  so i stopped thinking about it that way and talking about it that way  but i didn t come out and say all this to be politically correct  i was just wrong  while i want to believe that ryan had a true come to jesus moment  i don t believe for a second that he didn t understand the root causes of poverty  he just didn t care until trump threatened to utterly annihilate the republican party by telling the base that the rich don t give a damn about them a few days ago  i wrote about the national review  the right s premiere collection of thought leaders  dropping the pretense that the right wing elites consider the rural poor to be the  real america   years of pent up hostility and derision come flooding out like a tidal wave of scorn  i wondered if this meant that the republican coalition of the poor and the rich was finally ending  but then how would the rich hold on to power without their useful idiots to vote for them ryan s sudden reversal on poverty suggests that while the national review is giving up on the poor  the republican party itself is not  by finally talking about poverty instead of spewing hate at the poor  republicans may finally be ready to address the actual problem instead of simply trying to sweep it under the rug  they ll have to if they want to reclaim their base from trump it would be the absolute height of irony if donald trump forced the republican party to move away from the fringe in order to start governing responsibly again featured image via ai archives
