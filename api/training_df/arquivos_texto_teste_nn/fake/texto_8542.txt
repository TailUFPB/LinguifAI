you know the water crisis in flint  michigan is bad when a group of white  anti government militiamen decide that they have to protect a minority community  last week  the genesee county volunteer militia  gcvm  put a call out for like minded  patriots  to join them in a protest against the  tyrannical government  in flint  to help our effort  the gcvm are requesting a show of support on sunday  january    from patriots and patriot groups across the land as a united front  standing with all citizens of the city of flint  mi  we ask militia  oath keepers  iii   home guard  and all other like groups to wear your uniforms and insignia to this event  all others are welcome to join us as well  we ask that you only wear side arms and not long rifles  this is not about our  amendment  this is about the infringement on the good people of flint    god bless the republic  the detroit free press reports that about thirty armed militiamen dressed in fatigues showed up for the event on sunday and handed out clean water to the people in the community maj  matt krol  executive officer information officer of the gcvm said that his group did not believe it was a  racial issue  and explained  we re here to defend this community  we re not going to allow  the government  to step on the people of flint any longer   he added  if it means having to take up arms in defense   we will do that as well  okay  a couple of things here need to be addressed  first of all  thousands of people would not be sick and ten people would still be alive if flint was a majority white  upper class community  race very much played a part in what happened  but so did their socioeconomic status  as we know  the two often go hand in hand secondly  arming themselves is not going to make the water in the community clean  that is just nonsense and it is the kind of insanity that makes the rest of us look at them and think that they are a bunch of nuts   even when they are trying to do something good when this story first popped up across my facebook newsfeed i thought  ahhh here come the racist gun nuts trying to make a name for themselves on the backs of the minority community in flint   but as it turns out they were joined by african americans as well  twenty seven year old  la mont williams of chicago defended gcvm and said  there s really no motivation other than the people of flint need help and we re in the position where we can help people need water  you can t go three days without drinking water and if you can come out here and help  i ve been met with nothing but love  my little brother has been met with nothing but love and everyone seems to appreciate just two guys coming from chicago and helping out  and i m pretty sure  the more the merrier  the militiamen definitely deserve to be commended for their work this weekend  while other groups like them often give the movement a bad name  they were really only interested in helping the desperate people in flint bravo  watch featured image  video screenshot
