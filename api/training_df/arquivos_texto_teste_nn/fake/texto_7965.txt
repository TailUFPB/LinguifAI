in another show of just how disturbing the republican party s base has become  an astonishing number of primary voters marching out of the polls in south carolina proudly said they supported trump s idea to ban muslims from entering the united states according to a cbs news exit poll conducted during the south carolina primary  a staggering  percent of voters said they supported trump s proposal to ban muslims  this is in line  but actually slightly up  from an earlier south carolina poll that found trump supporters overwhelming favored legalizing discrimination against muslims there s also   support among trump voters for creating a national database of muslims and   support for shutting down all the mosques in the united states  something no one else s voters back  only   of trump voters think the practice of islam should even be legal at all in the united states  to   who think it should be illegal  to put all the views toward muslims in context though    of trump voters continue to believe the policy of japanese internment during world war ii was a good one in the days after the san bernardino terror attack  trump demanded that america ban muslims   even american citizens currently abroad   from entering the country  he ordered a  total and complete  shutdown on muslims   indefinitely  or as he put it  until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses  our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad  and have no sense of reason or respect for human life  certain political observers believed that trump s proposal to ban muslims   even american citizens abroad   from entering or re entering the united states was so far beyond the pale that he would suffer in the polls because of it  jeb bush even risked his own campaign to call trump out on it donald trump is unhinged  his  policy  proposals are not serious   jeb bush   jebbush  december    for common decency  and jeb bush   trump s supporters loved the idea  his polls actually went up  republicans have since only embraced trump s bigoted ideas at ever scarier levels of enthusiasm given the hatred coming out of the election booths  it s no surprise to learn that donald trump is projected to win south carolina by a massive margin  if moderate republicans are wondering how the gop went so wrong  they might want to look at what the voters are actually saying  trump represents discrimination  bigotry  and hatred  and they absolutely adore him featured image via darron birgenheier flickr
