president obama has of course made history as the first black president in american history  but one of the stories that is sure to be told about his presidency is the steps made to help bring lgbt americans into the mainstream of the national dialogue  they have  of course  always been there  but they have an ally at the highest levels of the government unlike at any other time now president obama  in what is supposed to be his so called  lame duck  period  is working on a federal monument to the struggle for gay rights at stonewall in new york city president obama is poised to declare the first ever national monument recognizing the struggle for gay rights  singling out a sliver of green space and part of the surrounding greenwich village neighborhood as the birthplace of america s modern gay liberation movement while most national monuments have highlighted iconic wild landscapes or historic sites from centuries ago  this reflects the country s diversity of terrain and peoples in a different vein  it would be the first national monument anchored by a dive bar and surrounded by a warren of narrow streets that long has been regarded the historic center of gay cultural life in new york city obama went from being tentative about same sex marriage when he ran for the presidency in   to being the first major party candidate to support it in   with an assist from vice president biden   obama has gotten rid of the military s  don t ask don t tell  policy  advocated for benefits for same sex partners  supported transgender service in the military and has refused to use the power of the government to obstruct other efforts to secure equal rights for lgbt citizens those fighting for lgbt rights still have some work ahead of them  especially with conservative republicans often engaging in last gasp efforts to attack full equality  like the mean spirited  bathroom bills  in the south   but under this president the march towards justice has had a reliable ally featured image via flickr
