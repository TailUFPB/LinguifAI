democrat senator kristen gillibrand  ny  likes to think of herself as a champion of women  after multiple women came forward to accuse fellow democrat senator al franken of sexual assault  photos were also supplied as evidence of one of the accuser s claims   gillibrand finally called for franken to step down  was gillibrand s call for her fellow senator to step down part of a larger plan to appear neutral  as she then attacked president donald trump for unfounded allegations against him only months before the election   isn t it kind of hypocritical for gillibrand to call anyone out of sexual misconduct after she fought to bring a muslim athlete to upstate new york who molested an innocent  year old girl while he was in america the media cheered when ny democrat senator s kirsten gillibrand and chuck schumer helped a  yr old muslim man enter the u s  after he was denied entry the media was strangely silent  however  after he molested a  yr old upstate ny girl while she was with her family at an event celebrating the muslim athlete  yesterday  it was discovered that the islamic extremist who killed  people and injured dozens of others  when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in new york city  entered our country on a  diversity visa  that was the brainchild of none other than the democrat senator from ny  chuck  i always put diversity before our nation s security  schumer an indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of u s  lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the world snowshoe championship in new york has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor it was a long journey for indian snowshoe champion hussain and his coach to the world snowshoe championships in saranac lake  new york last weekend the us embassy in new delhi rejected tanveer hussain s application for a visa so he could compete in the world snowshoe championship last month  fox news reported local officials then appealed for help to schumer and gillibrand  and their offices reached out to the new delhi embassy  which let hussain successfully reapply for a visa democrat senator chuck schumer  an outspoken opponent of president trump s position on stricter immigration policies for immigrants and visa holders coming into the united states  bragged about getting around trump s temporary travel restrictions to bring convicted pedophile tanveer hussain to new york on his facebook page schumer s office told fox he often intervenes to help international competitions  as we often do when local communities ask for help  at the request of saranac lake we helped to navigate the visa process so these athletes could compete at a local competition  the charges against one member of the group  who is accused of a serious crime and abusing our visa program  are extremely troubling  if he s found guilty  he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law   a rep said gillibrand s office offered a similar response  adding that the charges are  extremely serious  hussain hails from the indian side of the disputed himalayan region of kashmir  which is predominantly muslim  although india is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban  hussain and khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the united states was turned down in late january  the first business day after trump s travel ban was put in place khan told the bbc that an employee at the u s  embassy in new delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy  u s  officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban  an embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day    national posttanveer hussain was indicted in august   by an essex county grand jury for allegedly having inappropriate contact with a  year old saranac lake girl earlier this year tanveer is pictured below surrounded by young teenagers at saranac middle school  taneer is pictured in center left with his arms around a young girl the grand jury returned the indictment charging tanveer hussain with one count of first degree sexual abuse and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child  a report in the adirondack daily enterprise quoted a press release from essex county district attorney kristy sprague as saying the reckless and irresponsible acts of democrat legislators like senator chuck schumer  perfectly illustrates why trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants hussain and team manager abid khan arrived feb   in the bucolic adirondacks town  which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome  locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie   khan said in a facebook post the  fairy tale  was shattered wednesday  when hussain    was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment  police said the parents of the  year old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened monday  after the end of the three day snowshoe competition  and reported it to local authorities chief charles a  potthast jr  of the saranac lake village police force said the girl was playing pool monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where hussain was staying  there was a moment when the two were alone  and that s when the incident occurred   potthast said  the girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing during their time in saranac lake  hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about kashmir at
