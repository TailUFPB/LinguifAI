who needs experts  really  when one can rely on his or her own intuition  i mean  donald trump clearly knows better than any  expert  in regards to foreign policy  or maybe  he s full of absolute horseshit while campaigning in la crosse  wisconsin  trump told a crowd of supporters that he s probably not going to rely on any experts  sure  he has advisers  but according to trump   the experts are terrible  he said  you look at what china s doing in the south china sea  and they say   oh  trump doesn t have experts  let me tell you  i do have experts but i know what s happening  and look at the experts we ve had  ok  look at the experts  all of these people have had experts  you know  i ve always wanted to say this i ve never said this before with all the talking we all do all of these experts   oh we need an expert  the experts are terrible  look at the mess we re in with all these experts that we have  look at the mess  look at the middle east  if our presidents and our politicians went on vacation for  days a year and went to the beach  we d be in much better shape right now in the middle east  yep  he really said that  folks  he apparently thinks we d be better off if we just let isis take control and take part in no intervention whatsoever  at least that s what he just implied  he clearly thinks we haven t  over the course of decades  set up very valuable relationships  many that are even unheard of  because he thinks he knows better  he seems to think not knowing anything is better than knowing what you need to know this is exactly how he is appealing to his imbecilic base of voters who really don t know any better or understand one iota how much of a delicate dance foreign policy is  trump wants them to believe that even though he has no experience whatsoever in foreign policy or diplomacy that he is still the man for the job  apparently ineptness is a valuable qualification he s playing his followers like a fiddle and they are clearly too dumb to know the difference  this isn t only foolish  it s wildly dangerous  yes  we need experts  yes  we need people who actually have experience and know what they re doing in regards to foreign policy  for goodness sake  don t fall for his propaganda    realdonaldtrump   the experts are terrible  https   t co  pic twitter com   politico   politico  april    image via video screen capture
