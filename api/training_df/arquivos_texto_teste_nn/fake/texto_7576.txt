the man behind the lovably hapless office drone  dilbert  has a few things to say about donald trump   and they are a doozy in a post on his blog  cartoonist scott adams blasted people who dared to compare donald trump to german dictator adolf hitler  describing the comparison as  racist  against german people can we agree that calling the candidate with german ancestry hitler  is racist  it sure feels that way to me  i m about half german  same as trump  and it feels like a racial insult to me i m not easily offended  but i don t see any other way to interpret the incessant hitler analogies directed at trump  if he were female and asian   with exactly the same policies   would we be comparing him to hitler every five seconds i don t think so there are  of course  a few things wrong with adams  analysis   german  isn t a race  hitler wasn t german  comparing one person with german ancestry to an infamous tyrant isn t  racist   the list goes on  but more to the point  donald trump wouldn t be an asian female  because donald trump s policies   at their core   appeal to white supremacists who would never consider voting for a woman of color  the kind of hate fueled rhetoric that makes trump soar in the republican polls is at the expense of minorities  women  and other disadvantaged groups  you know who else used prejudice and scapegoating to fire up his supporters  adams sure can t think of anyone however  adams believes that trump is actually the anti hitler  because   and this is pretty astounding   trump is actually  pro minority   but only the  minorities  adams considers worthy what adams doesn t mention are actual minorities  including hispanics that trump described as  rapists  or african americans  who have been repeatedly violently attacked at his rallies  the minorities adams counts are mostly just aggrieved white people who want things their way and are upset that president obama won t give it to them what about the muslims trump suggested should be banned  adams agrees that s discrimination  but says they deserve it trump has indeed suggested discrimination against incoming muslims  but i think you have to see this situation as a special case because sharia law is incompatible with the constitution of the united states  and conquering infidels is part of the islamic belief system in some corners of islam  if we can t tell the good people from the bad  it boils down to national security and risk management hilariously  adams concludes by begging his readers to instead try to compare hitler to people like  nelson mandela  mother teresa  and gandhi   he claims it s  easier than you want to believe   he doesn t explain how despite all of this lunacy  adams says he isn t endorsing trump for president  but only because the republican front runner  scares  people too much to effectively bring the country together  however  he is optimistic that trump could  persuade  people not to be afraid of him using his  deal making  skills  if that happens  adams seems to think trump would be an awesome president  just ask all those  minorities  he mentioned featured image via  flickr
