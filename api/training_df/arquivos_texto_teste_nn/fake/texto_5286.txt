the same conservatives who have attacked president obama over the last eight years really liked his speech on wednesday night when president obama spoke in support of hillary clinton during the dnc convention  he extended an olive branch to conservatives who are dissatisfied with donald trump as the republican nominee  look  we democrats have always had plenty of differences with the republican party  and there s nothing wrong with that   obama said before reaching out to those who are  nevertrump  it s precisely this contest of ideas that pushes our country forward  but what we heard in cleveland last week wasn t particularly republican   and it sure wasn t conservative  what we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other  and turn away from the rest of the world  there were no serious solutions to pressing problems   just the fanning of resentment  and blame  and anger  and hate  president obama then stressed unity along with the themes of patriotism and our founding fathers  and he even mentioned ronald reagan  and that is not the america i know  the america i know is full of courage  and optimism  and ingenuity  the america i know is decent and generous i see americans of every party  every background  every faith who believe that we are stronger together   black  white  latino  asian  native american  young  old  gay  straight  men  women  folks with disabilities  all pledging allegiance  under the same proud flag  to this big  bold country that we love  ronald reagan called america  a shining city on a hill   donald trump calls it  a divided crime scene  that only he can fix the reason he ll lose it is because he s selling the american people short  we re not a fragile people  we re not a frightful people  our power doesn t come from some self declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way  we don t look to be ruled  our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in philadelphia all those years ago  we hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that we the people  can form a more perfect union  and because many republicans are starting to wake up and realize what their own party has become  they praised president obama s speech national review columnist rich lowery was stunned because he seems to think patriotism and the founding documents are trademarked republican beliefs american exceptionalism and greatness  shining city on hill  founding documents  etc they re trying to take all our stuff  rich lowry   richlowry  july    erickson of redstate couldn t believe how much he enjoyed it  i disagree with the president on so much policy and his agenda  but appreciate the hope and optimism in this speech   erick erickson   ewerickson  july    gop offered a vision of doom  despair  and division  tonight the president i think divides us offered optimism  i hate this year   erick erickson   ewerickson  july    strategist rory cooper thought the speech was  great  and slammed his own party for making it easy for obama by nominating trump  great speech  and we made it easy for him   rory cooper   rorycooper  july    conservative was shocked to hear president obama defend conservatives from trump still stunned  feel like i m in the twilight zone  obama just defended america   conservative values from attacks by the republican nominee      ag      agconservative  july    bush campaign staffer tim miller said that republicans just lost an entire generation of voters  will a trump apologist explain to me why an  yo watching the conventions would want to be a republican  we re giving away a generation  tim miller   timodc  july    reagan speechwriter john podhoretz appreciated the nod to his former boss take about five paragraphs out of that obama speech and it could have been a reagan speech  trust me  i know   john podhoretz   jpodhoretz  july    they praised president obama s speech  they all still hate him and the progressive policies he supports  of course  these republicans conveniently ignore that many of the policies president obama has pursued throughout his two terms were ideas that their party once supported  especially obamacare  but the consensus is clear  donald trump preaches hate and division while president obama delivered the speech republicans only wish their nominee would have done  thank god the president had the grace on that stage last night to point out that donald trump is neither a republican nor a conservative   erick erickson wrote on thursday   i am glad that even the president is not willing to tar and feather my party with trump  despite my party s willingness to commit political suicide  featured image  pete sousa
