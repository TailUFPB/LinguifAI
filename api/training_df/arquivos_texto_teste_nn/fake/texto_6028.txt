donald trump s many business ventures mean that he s got business relationships with many banks  including wall street banks  he could easily waltz into the white house owing at least   million to deutsche bank  which creates a massive conflict of interest that many have pointed out  deutsche bank has been heavily penalized by our government for repeated violations  and having business ties to trump means they could whip him into letting them off the hook just to preserve his businesses  creating a massive conflict of interest now  anti wall street crusader elizabeth warren has joined the chorus of voices decrying this  slamming trump and his relationship with deutsche bank in a statement to mother jones  the job of the president is to enforce the law fairly  if a serial lawbreaker like deutsche bank is caught manipulating markets again  how would trump hold it accountable knowing that the bank had the power to pull the plug on his own businesses  that s a question that should worry every american  these financial entanglements along with many of his other ongoing business concerns and arrangements present huge conflicts of interest  deutsche bank settled with u s  regulators for things like fixing metals prices and rigging interest rates   that s what warren means when she calls them a  serial lawbreaker   but they re fighting us on other things and have been for years  they re among the banks that screwed the little guy that trump claims to stand for in order to enrich themselves having trump in the white house could easily allow them to put our regulators over a barrel  and he ll have to break his promises to the little guy two weeks ago  warren attacked trump for saying that he d made money off of the  economic crash  which is something for which everyone should attack him because that s just sick for a presidential candidate to say  she said back then that trump only cares about trump  and those statements disqualify him from being president of the u s she also went after him for saying that dodd frank put too many regulations on wall street bankers  she wanted to know whether he could even name three things that dodd frank does  and said   seriously  someone ask him   chances are  he doesn t have a clue what his businesses owe deutsche bank should disqualify him from the presidency because the president of the united states can t be in a position where foreign entities  whether they re governments or private organizations  can put him or her in a bind over regulation  elizabeth warren knows what s what here  and that s why her attacks are escalating  trump can t be trusted in the white house featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
