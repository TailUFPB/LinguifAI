saudi arabia  that bastion of human rights  is at the center of a controversy on twitter  to be more specific  a starbucks in saudi arabia is getting the attention  that s because their stores have segregated entrances for men and women stories about the barbaric treatment women and other political minorities face in saudi arabia are nothing new  however  the oppression they face does not usually receive a publicly stated golden seal of approval from a major u s  company one starbucks located in jabir is currently undergoing remodeling  they have segregated entrances and seating for women and families  the wall that separates the two sides came down during the remodel  so they decided to just outright ban women from entering the cafe  one woman encountered this sign while trying to get her caffeine fix  please no entry for ladies only send your driver to order thank you   starbucks store in riyadh refused  serve me just because i m a woman   asked me  send a man instead starbucks pic twitter com   manar n     february     starbucks in saudi arabia refused to serve women  note on their door  plus official response from company  pic twitter com   muhammad lila   muhammadlila  february    gets so much worse starbucks responded to the situation  they released a press statement  which says the following  at starbucks  we adhere to the local customs of saudi arabia by providing separate entrances for families as well as single people  in addition  all our stores provide equal amenities  service  menu  and seating for men  women  and families  starbucks  whoever came up with  we adhere to the local customs of saudi arabia  needs to be paid more  they managed to make starbuck s support of incredibly sexist laws against women sound like the company is doing nothing more than trying to be a culturally sensitive  century global corporation what other local customs of rich isis does  saudi arabia really does not like it when you compare them to isis  starbucks adhere too  if an atheist like raef badawi   threatened  islam by saying what they believe in one of their  locations in saudi arabia  would they be fine with it if they person was sentenced to death   the official statement said  customs  which leaves a lot of room for such questions i could go on and on dissecting the lengthy statement put out by starbucks  the mental gymnastics that went into making the company sound as if they are actually supporting women s rights is astounding  however  i think this might be the most egregious part  we are pleased to share that the store is now accessible to single men on one side as well as women and families on the other side  starbucks has now  stores in saudi arabia and all stores cater to both families and singles  except for one that is exclusively reserved for women and families  they re  pleased  to inform people everything is back to normal because their cafes are all now   segregated again if you recall  starbucks attempted to profit from the wholesale slaughter of people of color last year  by way of their infamous  racetogether marketing campaign  after all  one marginalized group s oppression is another empowered group s opportunity  for some f cking reason  starbucks urged customers to talk to their baristas about racism here s an idea  what if every one of starbucks  customers started asking baristas about how incredibly messed up starbucks  overseas business practices are  we can make it a campaign and call it something like  holdthesexism or  patriarchytogether  this is really low for a company that tries so hard to appear to be progressive featured image by nirzar  own work    via wikimedia commons
