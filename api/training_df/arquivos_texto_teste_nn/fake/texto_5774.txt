stephen colbert was so angry at senate republicans that he crushed them into dust during his show on tuesday night on monday  senate republicans had the opportunity to join democrats and pass gun laws designed to prevent suspected terrorists from legally purchasing assault weapons in this country to kill americans with instead  the nra puppets obeyed their masters and ignored the will of the american people by voting the bills down  which means potential terrorists like omar mateen will still be able to buy guns for future mass shootings and that didn t sit well with colbert  who wasted no time ripping republicans to shreds  we all have jobs to do   colbert said   i m doing my job right now and i ve got these cameras here to prove it  after the attacks in orlando  i thought  maybe the government might do their job and pass any kind of law  even a fig leaf to justify their existence  they couldn t even agree to keep people on the terror watch list from buying high powered assault rifles  i don t understand you  senate  ninety two percent of americans want you to expand background checks for gun buyers and you just ignore them  since when does  percent of the population get to have total control over an issue  that s like taking your entire family on a cross country car trip and letting grandma choose all the music  colbert then took the gloves off and continued smacking down senate republicans with a series of devastating jokes that should make every american so embarrassed that republicans control congress that they will do something to reverse that in november  hey  senate  my dog accomplished more than you this week when it rolled over and licked its nuts   colbert said  with a beat track playing behind him  hey  senate  i ve seen bugs trapped in amber move faster than you  you guys think the terrorist watch list is when you put  homeland  on your netflix que  you might as well ask the gun lobby to check for a hernia as long as they ve got your balls in their hands  senate  you couldn t pass a bill if it was coated in ex lax  but if you ever did pass a bill it would say   be it resolved  no kissing and the nra should just leave the money on the dresser  senate  you accomplish so little that kylie jenner wants to know what you do for a living  senate  you got more old white men lying around than a life alert ad  you re so divided  you couldn t come together if you had  hours and a reach around from sting  you re like a grandpa after an all starch dinner  you cannot get sh t done  here s the video via youtube senate republicans should be ashamed of themselves  they were sent to washington to protect and work for the american people  not the nra  clearly  they are incapable of doing anything substantial to protect the lives of americans because the nra owns them and would rather they insist that merely saying the words  radical islamic terrorism  is enough  republicans are not fit to be public servants   years after the gop ended slavery they ve become nothing more than slaves themselves on a plantation run by the national rifle association  and that is a threat to the lives of every man  woman  and child in this country featured image  screenshot
