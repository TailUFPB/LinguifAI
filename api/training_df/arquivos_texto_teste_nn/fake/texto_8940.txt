do you remember the time that republicans thought automotive companies should be allowed to go bankrupt  they seem to have forgotten all about that house republicans are set to give a big wet kiss to volkswagen in the form of a bailout that will prevent them from being sued by over   american consumers  against whom they admitted committing fraud volkswagen has been caught up in a huge scandal after it admitted to cheating on air pollution standards  the context behind the scandal and ensuing lawsuits lies with  defeat devices  that vw had installed in approximately   of their diesel vehicles  in order to fool emissions testing in the u s remember  these are the same republicans that worked to block a vw plant from opening in chattanooga  tennessee because the plant was going to be unionized  this proves they don t really care about volkswagen  they just really love hurting american citizens the suit  filed by the justice department on behalf of the epa could net volkswagen up to   billion in fines  however  that s not all of their problems  the justice department also indicated that it could roll individual lawsuits into their litigation as well  the individual lawsuits come from owners that might win up to    each in compensation for paying more than a gas powered model costs plus decline in resale value  add on a potential  billion more from consolidated individual cases whoa  that s a lot of money what will volkswagen do  why  run to republicans of course yes  these are the same republicans that wanted gm to just go bankrupt when a bailout for them would save jobs  it s clearly a different story when government action helps regular people  for rich  faceless corporations no bailout is too large or too insane   and this bailout is truly insane the bill  which doesn t actually offer monetary compensation to cover vw s lawsuit costs  will instead make it virtually impossible for a class action suit to be brought against the corporation from the fiscal times the simplicity of the vw bailout bill belies the chaos it would create  proponents like the u s  chamber of commerce  the bill s leading lobbyist  say they merely want to get rid of  non injury  class action cases  based on potential damages from defective consumer products or corporate actions that have yet to result in harm  lawyers for class action litigants argue that defective products deserve compensation even if the consumer hasn t yet been injured but the bill goes much further  stating that courts may not certify class action suits unless the plaintiff  affirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative or representatives  this is devastating because it sets up all class actions to fail   says attorney lori andrus  who represents several volkswagen plaintiffs  if every class member must have the same type and scope of injury  it forces extensive proofs for class certification   essentially a full blown trial up front  where plaintiffs will have to prove that their injuries match with their fellow representatives source  the fiscal timesto put it simply  this isn t only for volkswagen  this is a good straw man case that republicans can use to do something they have wanted to do for decades   shut the door to justice on american consumers that get screwed over by corporations  it would allow for rampant abuse of the system  resulting in sub standard products being sold  with little to no recourse available to consumers ever  additionally  it would overturn decades of judicial precedent where corporations were held accountable for fraud while circumventing federal rules that lay out class action standards as an extra insult  republicans are pairing the bill with the fact act  which would force public reporting of personal information of asbestos victims  in an effort to sabotage their compensation for poisoning  it s incredibly inappropriate for congress to send the message that it s ok to hurt people by the millions   said rebecca kaplan   a volkswagen owner   the more people you hurt  the more this law will protect you  featured image via screen capture from youtube
