for the last few weeks  rumors have been swirling that delegates at the republican national convention have been concocting a plan to thwart donald trump s nomination and broker the convention  ushering in a candidate who isn t completely hated by the american people reince priebus denied it  donald trump denied it  all republican insiders denied it and said things were on their merry way to columbus but as it turns out  the delegate coup is concrete  and is currently in motion  anti trump delegates  concerned for the future of their party  and their power   are requesting a rule change for the convention that will allow delegates pledged to trump to opt out  and instead vote their conscience in other words  this rule change would turn every delegate into a super delegate the letter  sent by colorado delegate kendal unruh  asked the committee to adopt a  conscience clause  into the rules  thus circumventing the delegate rules and procedures set up by the states if any such delegate notifies the secretary of his or her intent to cast a vote of conscience  whether personal or religious  each such delegate shall be unbound and unconstrained by these rules on any given vote  including the first ballot for the selection of the president of the united states  without the risk of challenge  sanction or retribution by the republican national committee  rnc  the letter went on to justify how a delegate  who is bound by the rules of the state to represent the will of the people  could possibly decide they want to vote another way allowable personal reasons shall include the public disclosure of one or more any grievous acts of personal conduct by a nominee candidate  including but not limited to  criminally actionable acts  acts of moral turpitude or extreme prejudice  and or notorious public statements of support for positions that clearly oppose or contradict the policies embodied in the republican party s platform as established at the national convention so far   delegates have been in the works to thwart the presumptive nominee  but a rule change from the rnc could spur more action if delegates felt  all of a sudden  a change of conscience running a group called the free the delegates  unruh is hoping to secure a majority vote from the  member rules committee such an action would expose a very real and very damning rift within the republican party  as former bush official endorse clinton  republican lawmakers back away from endorsing trump  and the public continues to disdain the nominee  the white house may remain blue featured image via jeff j  mitchell getty images
