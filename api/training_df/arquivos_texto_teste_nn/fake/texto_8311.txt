the satanic temple just forced a total shutdown of all prayer at phoenix city council meetings  by requesting that they also be allowed to offer prayers at the start of meetings like their christian counterparts phoenix lawmakers have been trying to figure out what to do regarding the request for weeks  they couldn t allow all prayer  because it would have meant they supported satanists in some people s minds  they couldn t allow only christian prayer  due to inevitable lawsuits  so ultimately they came to what shouldn t be   but is   a very controversial solution  banning prayer completely from the meetings lawmakers decided in a   vote that council meetings will now begin with a moment of silence instead of a christian prayer  the moment of silence is intended to allow individuals to pray to whatever god is their personal choice  and leaves it out of the public domain completely  this is a pretty reasonable solution  since there isn t to be any mingling of church and state  however  these are red state christian extremists we are talking about  their struggle is real the objections have been emotional  loud and generally ignorant  christians are pushing for their right to pray  but they don t seem to understand the fact they can t allow their prayers while banning others  the phoenix council had an option of either allowing the alternate prayers  or banning them while facing a first amendment based lawsuit that is practically a guaranteed loss for them  they chose a third option of banning all prayer  the best option  completely  now they are being threatened with even more lawsuits from christians that want to insert religion into government   as long as it s only christian religion the blubbering outcry by the christian extremists is almost comical  councilman sal diciccio said  this is what that satanist group wants  a moment of silence is basically a banning of prayer  it s to agree to the satanic goal to ban prayer  yup  that s it alright  they just let the devil win  actually  the founding fathers had the crazy idea to ban religion from public governance  but hey  facts don t really matter when it comes to religion there were a great deal of gasps and clutching of pearls  but somehow phoenix was not consumed by the desert in a massive sandstorm by the wrath of god  frogs have chosen to not fall from the sky and the firstborn of arizona are currently safe from the angel of death  funny isn t it  how republicans claim america is a  christian  nation  but the only ones who care about the constitution are the atheists  agnostics  and satanists these days watch christian outcry on the victory of satan over freedom below featured image from video screen capture
