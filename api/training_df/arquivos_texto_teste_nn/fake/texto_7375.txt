this pastor s church should be heavily taxed for this kind of political speech democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders is the first jewish candidate to win a state primary in american history  pulling off the feat in new hampshire last month in an incredible upset of hillary clinton the self described democratic socialist has excited crowds across the country with his vow to reign in wall street and end income inequality  sanders is particularly popular with young people who see him as a desperately needed agent of change who can turn the system around and ensure a better future for all americans and it s because college students support him that one christian televangelist is calling sanders the next adolf hitler  you know  the nazi germany dictator who ordered the extermination of six million jews during world war ii  yeah  that hitler during a sermon  disgraced pastor jim bakker openly compared sanders to hitler citing his socialist beliefs and claimed that if he s elected every american will be dead in a year  one of the most popular politicians right now is a socialist   and who is his biggest following  the young people of america  from the colleges  maybe you understand a little bit what it felt like to live when hitler was reigning and the church had to sit by and keep watching it and watching until millions  tens of millions   they had to build factories to kill people  all it takes is a couple bombs and all of america will be dead within a year  less than a year  just months  bakkers audience  of course  consisted of a bunch of easily frightened old conservative white people here s the video via youtube there are many problems with bakker s comparison first of all  while young people are flocking to sander s campaign  they are doing so on their own volition while hitler and the nazi party actually went into schools to indoctrinate the german youth to get their support second  bernie sanders is a democratic socialist  which is totally different from a national socialist as sanders explained in november  democratic socialism  builds on what franklin delano roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all americans  and it builds on what martin luther king  jr  said in  when he stated that   this country has socialism for the rich  and rugged individualism for the poor   it builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families  the elderly  the children  the sick and the poor  indeed  sanders believes in  economic equality  universal health care  wall street reform  universal college education  paid family leave  in addition  sanders also seeks  political reforms to limit the power of the wealthy so there is  democratic socialism for working families  not just wall street  billionaires and large corporations national socialism  on the other hand  is a brutal and authoritarian fascist ideology practiced by the nazis and other right wing groups who believe in a racial hierarchy with whites at the top  nazis support policies that push national power  demonize intellectualism  subjugate women  punish homosexuality  censor the free press  and are over obsessed with christianity among multiple other aspects you can find by clicking here in no way does national socialism apply to bernie sanders  jim bakker would be thinking of this guy image via imgurneed proof of trump s fascism  well  there s the fact that he ll soon have his own version of hitler s brownshirts  then there s the fact that legendary investigative journalist carl bernstein explained why trump is a fascist  there s this excellent comparison made by the daily show  and there s the fact that neo nazis show up to support trump at his rallies seriously  jim bakker is either oblivious to the real fascism being pushed by trump or he supports trump and just wants to shift the accusations of fascism to sanders to protect the republican front runner  either way  bakker and his church should face steep taxes for engaging in political speech  especially the kind that pushes outright lies featured image via video screen capture
