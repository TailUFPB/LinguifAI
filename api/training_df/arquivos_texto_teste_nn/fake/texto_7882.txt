back in   getting then republican presidential candidate mitt romney to show his back tax returns was like pulling teeth  he knew that if he showed his returns he would not only be displaying how much he truly makes  but he would be revealing how much he actually pays in taxes  now  romney has decided to go after present day republican presidential candidate donald trump for the very same reason romney seems to be legitimately concerned that there may be some sort of  bombshell  hidden within trump s taxes that will show something the american people won t like at all while appearing on fox news with neil cavuto  romney said  i d like to see a number of things from the candidates  not just their positions on issues  in some detail  and some candidates are more thorough in laying out what they re going to do than others  but i d also like to see their back taxes  i d like to see where they filed their taxes in the last several years  i m not talking about their taxes this year  i m talking about the taxes that have already been filed with the irs  and donald trump and marco rubio and ted cruz have not shown us their back taxes  you know  this was an issue in my campaign they were all over me for my taxes  it became a big issue  but i put my taxes out in january of   and that gave people a chance to digest it and decide whether i was going to be the nominee or not  if in fact donald trump s taxes or marco rubio s or ted cruz s have some real problems in there  let s get them out there and see them  but i think it s pretty clear that given donald trump s dodging and weaving and delay  i think the last time he was asked about his taxes he said   well  it s going to be a month   look  people have a right to know if there s a problem in those taxes before they decide  romney also said  we have good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in donald trump s taxes either he s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is  or he hasn t been paying taxes we would expect him to pay or perhaps he hasn t been giving money to vets or to the disabled like he s been telling us he s been doing  now  besides just accusing trump of random things  let s think about this for a second  is romney actually concerned about what s in trump s taxes  or is he just trying to do to trump what was done to him  maybe it s some sort of sweet revenge for him  however you look at it  romney looks like a giant walking and talking hypocrite  and one of the first to point that out was none other than trump himself mitt romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool  is now playing tough guy  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    s not wrong  that does seem to be exactly what he s doing either way  trump should make his finances transparent to the american voting public so they can judge for themselves if they approve of the way trump handles his finances  but romney  especially on this issue  should probably keep his mouth shut  he s the last person who should be going after anybody on taxes watch here featured image via screen capture fox news
