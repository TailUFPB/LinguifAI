the right wing loves to appropriate revolutionary icons  muhammed ali is very much one of those icons  since his passing on friday  the boxing champion and political agitator s legacy has been praised by those who have agendas that are antithetical to the the champ s views on the world  this is probably best exemplified by the message that he sent to donald trump  though trump was not named explicitly  and anyone else who wants to take trump s proposal to ban muslims from entering the united states seriously trump recently sent out a tweet  where he praised ali for being a truly great champion and a wonderful guy  muhammad ali is dead at   a truly great champion and a wonderful guy  he will be missed by all   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    tweet stands out in stark contrast to the disgusting one that trump sent out about muslim athletes just a few months prior to ali s passing obama said in his speech that muslims are our sports heroes  what sport is he talking about  and who  is obama profiling   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    were quick to point out how vile and asinine the statement was and dude   realdonaldtrump  you ve met  muhammadali multiple times  pic twitter com   parker molloy   parkermolloy  december    trump and ali had a friendly relationship prior to trump s political campaign  ali sent trump a letter denouncing the idea that muslims should be banned from entering the united states  i am a muslim and there is nothing islamic about killing innocent people in paris  san bernardino  or anywhere else in the world  true muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called islamic jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion we as muslims have to stand up to those who use islam to advance their own personal agenda  they have alienated many from learning about islam  true muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force islam on anybody speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness  i believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people s views on what islam really is  as we all know  trump has not heeded that message  trump s entire campaign stands in opposition to what ali preached like the great man himself  ali s powerful message floats with the grace of a butterfly  yet should sting those who they are addressed to like a bee featured image from  andrew h  walker getty images
