phyllis schlafly  the rabid anti feminist  anti gay  anti anything that makes sense grassroots organizer  thinks michele bachmann   yes  michele bachmann   is completely unqualified to pick up the torch and lead the family values movement for once  phyllis schlafly and liberals agree on something schlafly    is facing a coup by her own daughter and other members of her organization  the eagle forum  after endorsing gop frontrunner donald trump  other members of the forum were unaware and taken aback by schlafly s endorsement  and would have rather backed texas senator ted cruz while appearing on right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones  radio show  schlafly contends that after passing over her daughter  anne cori  for the position of successor  all hell began to break loose  the forum handpicked a successor  ed martin  but that notion quickly went down in flames it was schlafly s pick for a successor that shouldn t have surprised anyone  michele bachmann the former congresswoman from minnesota and failed presidential candidate is almost identical in every way to schlafly  they are both anti woman  anti gay  anti science and oppose anything progressive  it seemed like a perfect match  bachmann even recorded a moving tribute to schlafly  who she called the pioneer of the modern conservative woman and her personal  heroine  however  as schlafly got to know the congresswoman on a more personal level  the quicker she realized bachmann was completely unqualified to succeed her  telling alex jones  a lot of our people wanted us to pick michele bachmann  and she certainly has a lot of talent  a very fine speaker and so forth  but she knew nothing about running an organization and she knew nothing about politics outside of her own domain  ouch  even michele bachmann is too stupid to lead an organization of equally stupid people  add that to the list of things she s failed at i m not quite sure what  her own domain  means  but if she s talking about bachmann s fantasy land inspired politics  than yes  she knows nothing here s bachmann s cringe worthy tribute to schlafly featured image via brendan smialowski getty images
