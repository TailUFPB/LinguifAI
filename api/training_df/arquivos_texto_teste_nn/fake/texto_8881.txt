the nra has an army of puritanical  loyalist supporters who will oppose any and all attempts at gun control  almost anyone who owns a gun or supports the second amendment is a member of this legion that will rise up in fury if anyone attempts to do something as bold as study gun violence in the united states that s the common narrative that the nra wants people to believe  in reality  the nra s membership is huge  somewhere between  million and   million people  but it is a paltry number compared to the number of gun owners in the united states  approximately   of the united s states reports that either they or someone in their household owns a gun  making gun owners a minority in the united states  the exact number of people who own a gun in the united states is unclear  but that number has to be much larger than those who are a member of the nra when president obama announced his plan to enact new gun control laws by using his executive powers  he claimed that gun owners would support the new gun control laws  a cnn orc poll reveals that he was right  the washington post wonkblog compiled the results of the poll into a chart  found below  the poll results show that a majority of people  even gun owning households and republicans  support the new gun laws  the poll even mentioned president obama s name during the poll  which can skew polling results  as wonkblog pointed out  i think it is fair to say that republicans have a tendency to have negative view of president obama  yougov did an experiment that showed that a mere  percent of republicans supported universal healthcare when they said that president obama supported it  when pollsters said that donald trump supported universal healthcare    of republicans said that they support it  too chart courtesy of wapo wonkblogso  if these new gun law regulations are favorably viewed by the majority and are minimal in their scope  as even the nra admits  why couldn t they be passed through congress  that s where the real power of the nra starts to be seen  they just buy candidates  that s the reality of money in politics  the majority s opinion does not matter  congressional representatives appeal to the well funded minority  ideas of democratic rule by the majority be damned  the executive orders that president obama plans to make law are not the actions of some despot trying to seize guns away from law abiding citizens as the nra wants their supporters to believe  his hand is being forced to take these actions by the gun lobby who have made effective government unconscionable in the age of rule by corporate oligarchy featured image credit via the white house   wikimedia commons
