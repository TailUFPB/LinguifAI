while i m not totally immune to clickbait as a writer  i try really hard not to grossly misrepresent what public figures say to generate outrage  not because i imagine myself to be a great journalist  i blog  journalism this ain t  but because i shouldn t have to lie to get a story out  so imagine my disappointment when i saw the following from raw story  barney frank   low information  voters are to blame for problems that make trump and sanders appealing this is a fail on so many levels first  while the host jose diaz balart tries to conflate trump and sanders voters  it is screamingly obvious that frank is only talking about democratic voters the entire time  his entire argument concerns the people who don t come up to vote in midterms and then complain that obama didn t get things done  no rational person can listen to this and think he s talking about both liberal and conservative voters if conservative voters were as lazy as liberal voters in the midterms  we wouldn t have the gridlock that s pissing off liberal voters second  when we use the term  low information voters   it has a very specific connotation  we mean people who are not informed compared to the general population about an issue  or issues  but still feel passionately about it  or  in the case of fox news viewers  misinformed about an issue and feel enraged about it  when a person insists that obama is a muslim or that climate change is a hoax  that is a low information voter  on the liberal side  when someone insists that hillary clinton is being investigated by the fbi or that bernie sanders is getting rich by running for president  that is also a low information voter  at least on those topics but that s not what frank is saying at all  he s lamenting  quite correctly  that the people who couldn t be bothered to vote in the midterms don t understand or don t want to understand that the lack of progress that s pissing them off is a direct result of them staying home in  and   that s not calling people  low information voters   that s calling them out on their hypocrisy   i want x  y and z but i don t wanna have to vote in midterms to get it   and even though frank kind of blames bernie supporters for this  let s be honest  there s zero reason to lay that solely at their feet the closest frank gets to calling bernie followers  low information voters  is when he points out  again  quite correctly  that people don t understand that building controlling majorities in government takes more than one election cycle  if you want to split hairs  sure  they re low information voters  but you re stretching at that point  but it doesn t matter if you like  love or loathe bernie supporters  they re not low information voters in general and  in this context  certainly not any less informed than the overwhelming majority of americans  no one uses the phrase to denote a lack of understanding of advanced civics which is why frank doesn t actually use that phrase in the entire interview finally  the anti establishment anger of trump and sanders supporters are coming from two completely different places and frank never even remotely suggests that the two stem from the same problems as the raw story title clearly says he does  the majority of the anger from the sanders camp is that america is not moving to the left fast enough  the don t like obamacare because it s not single payer  they don t like wall street reform because it wasn t strong enough  etc  etc trump s supporters aren t angry that the country isn t moving to the right fast enough  they re angry because it s not moving to the right at all  gays can marry  obamacare hasn t been repealed  the rich forgot to trickle down their wealth like we were promised by saint ronnie  women still have reproductive rights  black lives are starting to matter to say the two are similar is laughable and frank never comes close to even an insinuation of it you can be mad at barney frank for supporting hillary if you want  but if you have to lie about what he s saying and why he s saying it  you ve already lost the argument here s the video featured image via screencap
