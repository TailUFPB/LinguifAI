on december   chester pennsylvania police officers shot and killed one year old bear  a mixed breed family dog  who had been rescued by his owners just months before according to christie fry  the owner of the dog  she first encountered bear when he was just four months old  three months later  she brought the injured pup home to join her family  bear came into my life in may as a rescue  he was seven months old and had a broken leg  he was brought into my family and his leg healed better than expected without requiring surgery  he could run and jump like a normal dog  i loved this dog  i fell in love when i first met him as a four month old pup  but two weeks before christmas  chester police pumped eight bullets into bear  as the horrified mother watched from her window fry says that she heard bear barking in the backyard at about   am that morning  there was construction going on at the house next door  she explains that bear was securely hooked up on a tie out in the yard  so she didn t see his barking as a cause for concern about ten minutes later she heard the first gun shots i hear two gunshots  as i m getting up i hear the third  as soon as i m standing  i can see out my side window  police  fourth shot  i look at what they re doing and see my dog on the ground  my dog starts screaming  i scream  more shots  five  six  seven  eight  there s two cops taking turns shooting him with smiles on their faces fry says she ran out the door  yelling  what the hell  one of the officers asked  is this your dog  she says that after she told them  yes  and tried to asked what happened the response she was given is even more disturbing the officer said  and i quote   well you don t have a dog anymore  he s done now   and laughed in my face she goes on to say my one year old puppy that i did everything in my power to save was laying there dead  they shot my dog like he was a human coming at them with a gun bear was killed less than two feet from his own dog house  located near the fence that separates christie fry s property from the house next door image credit  puppycidedb coma photo of his body shows that the fence between the fry s yard and the neighbor s was open  bear s body is lying just on the other side of the fence in a subsequent report filed by the police  officers claimed that they had received  complaints  about bear christie fry says she was never informed of any complaints from anyone she was at home at the time that police  accompanied by an animal control officer  came to her home  no one ever knocked on her door or made an effort to contact her instead it appears that the cops and the animal control officer went directly to the fry s backyard  where bear was barking and restrained according to animal control  bear conveniently  broke loose from his tie out  at that time  he claims that bear knocked him over  he denies that the dog ever bit him or even tried to bite him even if the puppy did knock him down  which is doubtful  why was it necessary for cops to shoot him eight times christie fry has started a go fund me page to raise the money to hire a lawyer  as she points out here  the area around bear s dog house is bare dirt  as is the neighboring yard  yet she says that there was not a speck of dust or dirt on the animal control officer s suit  even though he claimed that he was knocked into the dirt by an overly zealous puppy it seems more likely that the cops went to the fry s home that day with every intention of killing the dog  they likely thought there was no one at home to witness the shooting  that would explain why neither animal control nor the police made any attempt to talk to his owner  but headed straight for the backyard instead fry acknowledges on her go fund me page that  bear was a barker   was he just getting on the nerves of the construction crew next door if there were complaints about bear  police have yet to provide his owner with any details of those complaints this is not the first time that chester police have come under fire for killing a dog in   shocked bystanders captured video of officers opening fire on a pickup truck that was occupied by dogs  the truck was parked directly in front of the high school  police opened fire  shooting toward both the truck and the school during the student lunch period here s more on that story from nbc news  according to chester mayor john linder  police followed  all protocol  when they opened fire on the pickup truck  ultimately killing three dogs since the dogs involved in that incident were pit bulls  the mayor justified the actions of police by citing a supposed  violent history of the animals in question    here s what happened when our guest writer let a pit bull near his baby  in a statement published by the daily times  mayor linder said   p olice personnel immediately arrived on scene and assessed the severity of the situation  they took immediate action to ensure that no one in the vicinity could be harmed  meaning they did exactly what witnesses said they did  they pulled up in their vehicles  grabbed their guns and started shooting  immediately   into the bed of a pickup truck  in front of a school  while school was in session according to the mayor  two dogs were killed inside the truck  a third was killed  after it exited the truck   that means they were shooting at a moving target in front of the school  with people standing all around the shooting was justified because  according to the mayor  the three dogs were a greater threat to the public than a hailstorm of bullets the mayor stated that the officers involved in the shooting outside the school were in communication with the city s only animal control officer it s likely this is the same animal control officer that was on the scene when bear was killed in a twitter post  fry points out that it s not only police that she wants to see held accountable image credit  chris christie on twitter  via puppycidebdin his  statement  mayor linder also said  we don t want to be known as a place that abuses animals or kills dogs  how about not allowing laughing cops to get away with killing innocent family pets  like bear  who had never even been accused of biting anyone fry is in search of an attorney who will help bring the officers that killed bear to justice you can donate to fry s legal fund here  featured image
