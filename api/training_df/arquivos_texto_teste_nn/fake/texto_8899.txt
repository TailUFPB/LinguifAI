once again pro gun forces in america are trying to intimidate anyone trying to reduce gun violence   even the president himself ahead of president obama s town hall about his executive action to reduce gun violence  warnings were issued about the likelihood of gun fans parading around outside the event brandishing their weapons president obama s town hall event on gun violence at george mason university in fairfax  va  on thursday night is likely to provoke strong emotions  and the school s police chief is warning students and faculty that protesters could be carrying weapons on campus   legally  please be advised that it is lawful to carry firearms in virginia  and this includes at public outdoor spaces on our campus   thomas longo  gmu s interim chief of police said in an email to the school s internal listserv  though students are on winter break  the chief wrote that the university police  will have officers present to ensure that all protesters remain law abiding  over the last few years the so called  open carry  movement has paraded around with weapons in public as a way for gun extremists to show off to everyone how supposedly macho they are in some cases  these protesters have taken their weapons into restaurants  supermarkets  and major chain stores like target  understandably  most parents don t want to have guns swinging around while they re trying to buy their weekly groceries and some stores have begun to ban the open carry crowd the nra   who chickened out when cnn invited them to this town hall   has pushed the president as the gun confiscator in chief  when in reality at best obama has pushed for expanded background checks and limits on gun magazines  now those who have been teed off by this organization   who pays its executives handsomely from their annual dues   have been driven to brandish guns outside an event under heavy secret service protection it isn t smart  it s dangerous  and at best it will continue to make the pro gun side of the debate come across as unhinged extremists featured image via wikimedia
