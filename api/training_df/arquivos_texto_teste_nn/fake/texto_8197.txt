it looks as though the conservative target of choice this week to throw all their blind rage at is legendary artist beyonc   after all  she had the audacity to perform at the super bowl and sing a song that points out police brutality  something many conservatives don t want to admit actually exists against people of color however  as they want to go after beyonc  for being a woman of color with a powerful platform to get an important message across  what exactly are these conservatives doing to make the world a better place  because as far as i can tell  beyonc  has actually been the one doing just that for a long  long time as beyonc  uses her success to spread awareness  she s also using her earnings to make sure the homeless in houston have a place to live  in fact  she gave   million over several years to help fund  knowles temenos place apartments  which helps house those who have been displaced  she  alongside her family and fellow destiny s child alum kelly roland  began this project in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in houston  it s actually illegal to feed the homeless  on top of that  it s illegal for the homeless to go in search of food for themselves  it s seems as if it s a pretty heartless society  and beyonc  is actually stepping up where society has let these people down texas  that prides itself of on conservatism  even more so on their conservative christianity  is letting their citizens down  while they love to boast that they re welcoming to business  they clearly are not welcome to much of anything else  well  at least if you don t have money  however  part of being good christians should be adhering to the teachings of the bible  something beyonc  seems to have actually taken to heart by taking action  after all  in the bible  jesus told everyone to take care of the sick and shelter the needy  conservatives have seemed to have lost that message somewhere along the way while they were hating immigrants  the poor and needy  and while telling sick people if they can t afford healthcare  well  too bad so  maybe next time  before criticizing someone for performing and speaking truth to power on a stage being broadcast around the world  just because it s difficult for you to hear and wrap your head around  maybe  just maybe  listen to what s being said  maybe  just maybe  realize there s an epidemic of police brutality that makes all the good officers look bad as well  and something needs to be done  and maybe  just maybe  realize the person who you are criticizing is a person you should emulate and appreciate for all they are doing for communities  those around her  and pretty much all of society  then maybe  just maybe  you ll see something you ve never seen before   faith  hope and love  the pillars of the christian faith that conservatives boast so proudly  but have failed at actually achieving featured image  wikimedia commons
