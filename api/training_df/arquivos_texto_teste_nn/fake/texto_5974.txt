absolutely everything about the story of brock turner  the convicted stanford swim team rapist  is gag worthy  he received a particularly light sentence  more on that in a bit   his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just   minutes of action   now  a friend of turner has spoken and her  yes her  attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well  he s in college  or something like that apparently  according to turner s childhood friend  leslie rasmussen  a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus  i don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten   years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him  i am not blaming her directly for this  because that isn t right  but where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists  then  the obligatory victim blaming  this is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot  that is a rapist  these are not rapists  these are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement  no  this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far  this was a violent sexual assault  here s just some of it  as retold by the victim he said he had asked if i wanted to dance  apparently i said yes  he d asked if i wanted to go to his dorm  i said yes  then he asked if he could finger me and i said yes  most guys don t ask  can i finger you  usually there s a natural progression of things  unfolding consensually  not a q and a  but apparently i granted full permission  he s in the clear  even in his story  i only said a total of three words  yes yes yes  before he had me half naked on the ground  future reference  if you are confused about whether a girl can consent  see if she can speak an entire sentence  you couldn t even do that  just one coherent string of words  where was the confusion  this is common sense  human decency according to him  the only reason we were on the ground was because i fell down  note  if a girl falls down help her get back up  if she is too drunk to even walk and falls down  do not mount her  hump her  take off her underwear  and insert your hand inside her vagina  if a girl falls down help her up  if she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts  maybe she is cold  maybe that s why she wore the cardigan clearly  calling turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness  it s simply a fact  brock was convicted of three felony counts  while the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been  years  he will likely only serve three months  as horrendously unjust as that sentence is  it s still about three months longer than  percent of rapists serve  that s political incorrectness if i ve ever heard it featured image via video screen grab
