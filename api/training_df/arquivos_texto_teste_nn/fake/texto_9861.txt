top gop official ed rollins was interviewed by a very angry lou dobbs  he was furious with the ringside performance of john kelly aka drama queen during president trump s un speech  some are saying it was before the speech   the chief of staff should be behind the scenes how about he should be fired because he s not even a supporter of president trump  he voted for hillary clinton ed rollins  at least what i ve heard from sources inside who know kelly  he is an honorable man and a good general  he didn t vote for him  he voted for hillary  so i don t think basically he is a trump supporter or ideologically a trump supporter whaaaaaat      how can president trump have a chief of staff that doesn t even follow his belief in policy there is controversy over whether kelly was was drama queen during or before trump s speech  if it was before then this is a great case of the democrats trying to sabotage trump again  no matter what happened  it s still shocking that trump would have a chief of staff who isn t on bird with his policy
