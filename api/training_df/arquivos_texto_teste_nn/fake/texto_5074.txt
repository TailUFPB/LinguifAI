it s truly sad that southern conservatives don t even know their own history during a donald trump rally in florida a group displayed a confederate flag at the venue and were quickly told it had to be removed  the flag had a  trump   message on it when asked by cnn why he displayed it  brandon partin explained that he bought the flag because they were being sold outside the rally and he thought donald trump would approve of it being flown at the rally and then partin defended the flag as  not racist  and suggested the civil war was not fought because of racism and slavery  most people in our country don t understand the full history behind the flag  so  i understand that the media and a lot of other people are going to turn it into something that it s not  you know  say that it s a racist thing or  you know  white supremacist  i am not a white supremacist  and it was about the north and the south  it wasn t about racism at all  the north had african americans fighting for them and the south had them for them  too  so for people who spin it in that direction is just completely false  i think that on a personal level between my beliefs and trump s beliefs  i don t think he would have a problem with it at all because he probably understands the history and that s why we re all here  here s the video via youtube first of all  the idea that slaves willingly fought for the confederacy is ludicrous  the slave holding confederates feared giving firearms to slaves  plus  slaves would have been forced to fight because they would not have freely fought for their own continued enslavement  also  the confederacy only approved of forcing blacks to fight for them on march    in an act of desperation  lee surrendered on april     partin is right that a very small percentage of black people in the south were soldiers in the confederacy  but that s only because they were pressed into service by their tyrant masters and didn t want to be slaughtered for disobeying furthermore  the civil war and the confederate flag was all about slavery and racism  as evidence  in their declaration of the immediate causes which induce and justify the secession of south carolina from the federal union  south carolinians prominently cited slavery as the major cause of the decision to leave the union and begin the process of seizing control of forts and other united states government property a geographical line has been drawn across the union  and all the states north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of president of the united states  whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery  he is to be entrusted with the administration of the common government  because he has declared that that  government cannot endure permanently half slave  half free   and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction this sectional combination for the submersion of the constitution  has been aided in some of the states by elevating to citizenship  persons who  by the supreme law of the land  are incapable of becoming citizens  and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy  hostile to the south  and destructive of its beliefs and safety in addition  confederate vice president alexander stephens made it clear in his  cornerstone speech  that the confederate government was founded on the belief that black people are an inferior race and that slavery is the cornerstone of the south  our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas  its foundations are laid  its cornerstone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man  that slavery  subordination to the superior race  is his natural and normal condition  in short  the confederate flag waving morons are trying to re write history to make the confederacy look like it was this great paradise that the  evil  union unjustly fought a war against in    the war of northern aggression  some conservatives call it  except that the south fired the first shots at fort sumter in an effort to forcibly seize us government property it s time for conservatives to face facts  the confederate flag is racist  the civil war was fought over slavery  and the confederates were a bunch of traitors whose descendants are still whining about a war they lost and are now supporting trump because they believe he ll help them revive the  cause   which again is all about subjugation  hatred  and oppression of people who don t have white skin featured image  screenshot
