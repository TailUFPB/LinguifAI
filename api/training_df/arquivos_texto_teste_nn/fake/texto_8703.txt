trump supporters have a lot in common  they lack education  they re a bunch of horrible racists  they want to  make america great again  by viciously beating african american protesters and homeless people  the idea of keeping brown people out of  murika appeals to them  his appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit  but did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines trump support better than jingoism  racism  homophobia  extreme anti muslim sentiments  or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a hispanic person again politico s matthew macwilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a trump voter in fact  i ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports trump and it s not race  income or education levels  it s authoritarianism that s right  trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed  above all  by americans with authoritarian inclinations  and because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the american electorate  among democrats as well as republicans  it s very possible that trump s fan base will continue to grow macwilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled   voters across the nation   i found that education  income  gender  age  ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a republican voter s preferred candidate   he writes   only two of the variables i looked at were statistically significant  authoritarianism  followed by fear of terrorism  though the former was far more significant than the latter  macwilliams explains that trump s pledge to make  america great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that muslims be banned from the united states  wear special id badges if they re already here  and be rounded up into concentration camps  as well  of course  as his great wall of murika   all cater to authoritarian inclinations authoritarianism is not a new  untested concept in the american electorate  since the rise of nazi germany  it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science  while its causes are still debated  the political behavior of authoritarians is not  authoritarians obey  they rally to and follow strong leaders  and they respond aggressively to outsiders  especially when they feel threatened this  of course  describes trump supporters perfectly  frighteningly  authoritarianism  while prevalent among republicans  is not limited to the right  in the  democratic primary  the political scientist marc hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income  ideology  gender  age and education in predicting whether voters preferred hillary clinton over barack obama   macwilliams notes   but hetherington has also found  based on  years of polling  that authoritarians have steadily moved from the democratic to the republican party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights  gay rights  and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today macwilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the democratic primary race  thus far  but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the republican side   as  percent of republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale  macwilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism   whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent  obedient or self reliant  well behaved or considerate  and well mannered or curious  based on these questions  trump was the only candidate republican or democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant   he concludes  this  combined with the   of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on u s  soil  gives us something to fear  while it s easy to say president trump  can t happen here    that americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of adolf hitler being elected   macwilliams points out that it s time that democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking trump seriously featured image via gage skidmore flickr
