bernie sanders on wednesday attacked hillary clinton s political self identification as a progressive  the vermont senator posted a series of tweets defining for his supporters what it means to be a real progressive you can be a moderate  you can be a progressive  but you cannot be a moderate and a progressive   bernie sanders   berniesanders  february    top of defining the word  establishment  as a pejorative term  sanders is now engaged in a game of ideological purity similar to the ongoing battle on the republican side about what it really means to be a conservative contrary to sanders  view of progressivism  it s absolutely possible to be a progressive on some issues and a moderate on others  likewise  it s entirely possible to be a progressive while governing as a moderate   be it a moderate across the board or just occasionally depending on the issue  for example  what about the gun control issue  his campaign manager says he is  very moderate  on the issue   https   t co   alex seitz wald   aseitzwald  february     bernie s own adviser defined him as  moderate  on guns  how would sanders score on his own ideological purity test but  really  what does it even mean to be a progressive  is there an agreed upon set of qualifications for the label  is sanders talking about being a far left liberal  a progressive reformer in the classical teddy roosevelt sense  what is it  sanders elaborated via a series of additional tweets in an attempt to define what he means most progressives that i know don t raise millions of dollars from wall street   bernie sanders   berniesanders  february    progressives i know are firm from day  in opposition to the trans pacific partnership  they didn t have to think about it a whole lot   bernie sanders   berniesanders  february    progressives that i know were opposed to the keystone pipeline from day one  honestly  it wasn t that complicated   bernie sanders   berniesanders  february    progressives i know were against the war in iraq  one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the united states   bernie sanders   berniesanders  february    points  but why do they have to be couched in the context of a purity test it appears as if sanders is taking on both the clinton machine  the democratic party establishment and anyone who doesn t qualify as  progressive  in his view   ejecting them from his exclusively progressive club  it s difficult to see how this helps to build a unified  big tent coalition necessary to not only win the nomination but  more importantly  the general election one last thing  it s entirely possible that clinton believes she s a progressive  the term is fluid enough to apply  even though she likely adopted the term in an attempt to win over voters to her left  but wasn t part of the point of a sanders candidacy to influence the so called moderate democrats to do exactly what clinton is doing   to be influenced by the strength of the sanders message and to be pulled leftward  if so  he s clearly been successful at doing so  if he d rather not pull center left dems leftward  then he should say so  but he can t have it both ways  featured image via video screen grab
