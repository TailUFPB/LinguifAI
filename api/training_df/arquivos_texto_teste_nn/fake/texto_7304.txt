poor  poor ted cruz  he just can t catch a break having endured repeated attacks on his wife by republican front runner donald trump  cruz practiced his best  tough guy  face in the mirror  found the nearest camera and told trump   donald  you re a sniveling coward and leave heidi the hell alone   and it almost would have worked if it weren t for a meddling nbc reporter who pointed out the massive elephant in the room without missing a beat  nbc s hallie jackson stepped up to ask the one question cruz didn t want to hear  are you more loyal to the republican party  or your wife  his flailing response speaks volumes a clearly unimpressed jackson asks cruz to explicitly say whether or not he would support donald trump as president if he got the nomination  cruz was left temporarily speechless  before weakly saying the question was irrelevant because trump was going to lose  jackson didn t let up jackson  that s not answering the question  senator cruz  i am answering the question  donald trump will not be the nominee jackson  he s leading right now and you just looked into that camera and said he was a coward  will you support him as the nominee cruz  donald trump will not be the nomineewhat makes jackson s questions so brutal is that for cruz  he s always struggled to distance himself from trump while at the same time copying many of his ideas  and like many republicans  cruz has repeatedly said he would support the eventual nominee whoever it was  even as he publicly attacked trump  just earlier this month  cruz was still adamant that party loyalty meant everything  my answer is the same  i committed at the outset  i will support the republican nominee  whoever it is   cruz said making things even more awkward  cruz and trump spent the early part of the election praising each other  cruz would live to regret tweets like this one in the end  with trump s sizable lead in the primaries  cruz will need to decide what he will do if trump wins  as he calls trump a  sniveling coward  on camera  he may soon be faced with having to grovel at trump s feet  just as his former fellow candidates chris christie and ben carson have already done   no doubt when that happens  cruz is going to wish he never met hallie jackson featured image via twitter
