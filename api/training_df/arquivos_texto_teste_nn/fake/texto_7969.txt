a yelp customer service employee was fired just two hours after her open letter to yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman went viral talia jane  a  year old living in the san francisco bay area in california  worked as a customer service rep for yelp s  food ordering app  but after the company caught wind of a blog post she d written about how she and many other employees of yelp struggled to make ends meet  she was fired  in her open letter entitled  an open letter to my ceo   she wrote  every single one of my coworkers is struggling  they re taking side jobs  they re living at home  one of them started a gofundme because she couldn t pay her rent  another guy who got hired  and ultimately let go  was undoubtedly homeless  jane also spoke of how difficult it was to pay her rent when the company would only pay her    an hour  which translated to    after tax  of her monthly expenses  jane also had to spend over   to take public transportation to work  as her apartment was  miles away jane had tried to find ways to make it work  she explored living together with a co worker  but soon found out that most of them lived with their parents or also could not afford the rent on their wages  jane said  i thought to myself   oh  i m tremendously f cked   so i m just going to try really hard on improving at this job so i can transfer and get a pay increase  but then i was told that wouldn t happen for at least a year  to pay her rent and bills  jane cut back on groceries and did  hours of overnight shifts every week   but she eventually reached her breaking point  she told business insider  i brought up the wages in every quarterly meeting i had with my managers  they were well aware that i was struggling despite doing what i could with what i had  the last straw was when i woke up yesterday two hours after going to sleep because my stomach hurt from hunger  and it s something i m used to  but this time it was really driving me to put something in my stomach immediately   i couldn t wait  minutes for my rice to cook and it all became very clear that this shouldn t be an issue i was dealing with to the point where i forgot it wasn t normal  it was then that jane realized she couldn t continue on like this  she decided to start tweeting yelp s ceo twittertwittertwitterjane followed those tweets with a blog post on medium  where she spoke of  balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn t involve crying in the bathtub every week   she wrote  i haven t bought groceries since i started this job  not because i m lazy  but because i got this ten pound bag of rice before i moved here and my meals at home  including the one i m having as i write this  consist  by and large  of that  because i can t afford to buy groceries  bread is a luxury to me  even though you ve got a whole fridge full of it on the  floor  but we re not allowed to take any of that home because it s for at work eating  of which i do a lot  because  percent of my income goes to paying my rent  isn t that ironic  your employee for your food delivery app that you spent   million to buy can t afford to buy food  that s gotta be a little ironic  right  mediumdriving her point home that her payment at yelp was not a living wage  jane went on to explain i got paid yesterday      bi weekly  but i have to save as much of that as possible to pay my rent      for my apartment that s  miles away from work because it was the cheapest place i could find that had access to the train  which costs me    one way to get to work  that s    a day  by the way  i make    an hour after taxes  i also have to pay my gas and electric bill  last month it was    according to the infograph on pg e s website  that cost was because i used my heater  i ve since stopped using my heater  have you ever slept fully clothed under several blankets just so you don t get a cold and have to miss work  have you ever drank a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work  that post went viral  viewed by over   people  in an interview with buzzfeed  jane said  i wanted  to understand that i wasn t some little  annoying fly buzzing around his head  i wanted him to understand that i m not some obnoxious idiot who thinks it s funny to harass the ceo on twitter  i m someone who has concerns and is reaching out  hoping that he can do something  i was sitting there and thinking   i hope he sees this and i hope my ceo listens and hears me   and then it started to dawn on me  i wonder if i ll get fired for saying this out loud  it only took two hours for her to find out  soon  her company email account stopped working  and jane was fired  she said  my manager and hr told me the letter and what i wrote violated yelp s terms of conduct  a spokesperson for the company released the insensitive statement  we do not comment on personnel issues  however  we did agree with many of the points in ms  jane s post and we viewed it as her real  personal narrative about what it s like to live in the bay area  most importantly  it s an important example of freedom of speech  we agree with her comments about the high costs of living in san francisco  which is why we announced in december that we are expanding our  customer support team into our phoenix office where will pay the same wage  however  jane insists that yelp isn t being honest about why she was fired  she said  yelp is trying to make this die down by lying about it  firing someone while their post about pay issues is on the cusp of going viral  that s like a lightning strike in the middle of a super dry forest  things have just exploded  jane is currently trying to find a new job  and will likely struggle financially until she can  hopefully  find something more promising than her former position at yelp  if you are interested in helping jane  she has left these details on another blog post detailing her termination from the company featured image via talia jane
