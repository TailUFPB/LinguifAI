rick santorum had the impossible job of defending donald trump during friday s real time and he found himself humiliatingly outnumbered bill maher began by expressing astonishment at how the republican nominee has been acting throughout the campaign  even conservative commentator tara setmayer couldn t believe trump s antics  surmising that it s almost like he is trying to lose but people just keep supporting him so he has to do something even more outrageous  it s easy to behave this way when you re mentally ill   director rob reiner chimed in   it s not like he s trying to lose  he can t help himself  then santorum took his turn and instantly became the punching bag for maher and the other two panelists when he attempted to defend trump as some kind of change maker while portraying hillary clinton as a politics as usual candidate setmayer pointed at santorum and pointed out that people like him are to blame for trump getting this far while rob reiner once again pleaded   stop being mentally ill  santorum claimed that trump was relatively tame on friday  prompting setmayer to ask if trump seriously  wants a cookie for acting like an adult  for once maher explained that trump can never be president because  his number one priority is getting back at anybody who has slighted him in any way  santorum continued repeating how trump has tapped into some kind of anger among conservatives who think they are being ignored  but setmayer hit back by noting that there s a way to do that  without acting like a petulant child   and that trump is an embarrassment santorum then attacked hillary clinton by claiming trump isn t a liar like her by bringing up her emails again  which drew the ire of rob reiner  let s talk about the fbi  there was one email  one email that was not listed as classified   with a little tiny  c    and james comey said anybody could have missed that  enough of that  enough of that  bill maher agreed  saying that he is  sick  of hearing about hillary s emails all the time the panel continued piling on santorum with setmayer doing the most damage and then maher slammed republicans for  handcuffing themselves to a dead hooker  by making trump their nominee and catering to a base that hates and denies facts here s the video via youtube donald trump is an embarrassment to this country and as this episode of maher demonstrates  even conservatives are embarrassed that he is the republican nominee  those who still support him are either ignorant or just want to watch the world burn featured image  screenshot
