poor gopers looking forward to participating in conversations about the republican national convention are going to be disappointed that their only option is to live stream and watch  thanks to donald trump s supporters  the rnc was forced to close its live chat when the conversation became bombarded with hateful anti semitic messages this hatefest happened when former hawaii gov  linda lingle took the stage to talk about the inroads the gop has created with jewish voters and to criticize the democratic party for its supposed hostility toward israel  it didn t take long for trump s moronic followers to take things a step further and bombard the chat with disrespectful phrases such as  press h for hitler    joos    ban jews    oy gevalt   and  kike   there were also a few  n bombs  dropped in the chat before it was shut down here are some screenshots that show what was being said online before the chat was closed down rncrncrncrncas shown in the screenshots  the star of david made many appearances  as did references to adolf hitler clearly  trump s supporters are only following in their beloved presidential candidate s footsteps  as it wasn t too long ago that trump landed himself in hot water for tweeting an anti hillary clinton meme that included the star of david  even while he was being accused of anti semitism  trump expressed disappointment that his social media manager had chosen to take the tweet down and replace it with something less offensive things like this can only be expected as trump continues to run his convention this week  his fans are known racists  white supremacists and misogynists  so i m sure we re going to see much more of these hateful messages in the near future  if the rnc was trying to get people to take it seriously this election  they seriously underestimated the stupidity of trump and his supporters featured image via screen capture
