was found dead in his apartment earlier this week according to new york city police  he committed suicide by stabbing himself to death that s a pretty normal way to commit suicide right it s like the time when former president of the united nations general assembly john ashe  was found dead in his apartment only days before he was set to testify against the clintons in a corruption case  the official reports indicated that ashe died of a heart attack the problem  however  is that police on the scene reported ashe died when his throat was crushed during a work out accident adding to the mysterious nature of ashe s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court monday with his chinese businessman co defendant ng lap seng  from whom he reportedly received over   billion in donations during his term as president of the u n  general assembly  and then there was this  during the presidency of bill clinton  seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the democrat national committee now abc news is reporting an acclaimed trauma surgeon was found dead with a knife in his torso sunday in his park avenue apartment in a suspected suicide  new york city

apartment at   p m  sunday found lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso  according to the nypd  emergency medical service responders pronounced him dead the email wikileaks published  was highly critical of the failed relief efforts in haiti and was shared by cheryl mills with hillary clinton in   lorich was part of a relief effort that flew to haiti as a volunteer to offer his skills for civilians who had been injured during the earthquakes that devastated the region within  hours of the earthquake  a  member team of surgeons  anesthesiologists  and operating room nurses was assembled  with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment  and flew to port au prince with dr  lorich bill and hillary clinton s  charitable  clinton foundation led the relief effort in haiti raising millions of dollars from around the world to help the people recover from the natural disaster  sadly  most of the funds never reached the people of haiti  but instead  lined the pockets of the clintons  associates who were meant to redevelop the nation  but never delivered dr  lorich and his team were there to help save the limbs of those injured  which without the proper medical treatment  would have meant amputation for a lot of people lorich described amputation in those conditions as a  death sentence  and hoped to treat as many sufferers as possible  saying   we expected many amputations   but we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable  particularly those of children   we recognized that in an underdeveloped country  a limb amputation may be a death sentence   it does not have to be so  with the amount of money that was being donated to haiti for the victims  lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched down instead  he described the situation as  shameful  and witnessed  first hand  a huge misappropriation of funds  with the people affected by the disaster receiving no help whatsoever dr  lorich was disgusted by what he saw and sent an email to then secretary of state hillary clinton s chief of staff cheryl d  mills to report what he had seen in july   a  year old haitian tied to the clinton foundation was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head it s no secret that the clinton foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished haitians who were devastated by hurricane hanna in   through their  foundation   haitians have been protesting for years outside of the clinton foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the clinton foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor one man was set to testify against the clinton foundation next week  that man was  year old former haitian government official klaus eberwein  he was found dead in his miami home with a  gunshot to the head  that s been ruled a  suicide  by the miami dade s medical examiner records supervisor   think vince foster klaus eberwein  a former haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of clinton foundation corruption and malpractice next week  has been found dead in miami  he was  eberwein was due to appear next tuesday before the haitian senate ethics and anti corruption commission where he was widely expected to testify that the clinton foundation misappropriated haiti earthquake donations from international donors eberwein  who had acknowledged his life was in danger  was a fierce critic of the clinton foundation s activities in the caribbean island  where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency  fonds d assistance  conomique et social  for three years according to eberwein  a paltry    of donations granted by international donors to the clinton foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting haitians actually ended up in the hands of haitian organizations  a further    ended up with the haitian government  the remaining      or    billion   was funneled to non haitian organizations  the clinton foundation  they are criminals  they are thieves  they are liars  they are a disgrace   eberwein said at a protest outside the clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan last year the former director general of haiti  who also served as an advisor to haitian president michel martelly  was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in haiti  muncheez  and even has a pizza   the klaus special   named after him according to the haiti libre newspaper  eberwein was said to be in  good spirits   with plans for the future  his close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide  it s really shocking   said muncheez s owner gilbert bailly   we grew up together  he was like family    your news wireamericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the clinton crime family when in september of   former senate president of haiti  bernard sansaricq  shocked a large crowd at a trump campaign event in little haiti  fl  sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the clinton s dirty dealings in haiti while he was still in office  to his credit  candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind  and to expose the crimes of the clinton s  who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white house sansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti  his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to  side  with the clinton administration and he would  be the richest man in haiti  he also demanded that hillary clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the haiti earthquake crisis  as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation  not even   of that money went back to haiti  so  mr  trump  we are asking you  begging you  the haitian community will side with you if one day  you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in  after the earthquake  haiti is a very poor country  haiti needs defenders  you said you would champion our cause  we welcome you sir and we will work with you  ask hillary clinton publicly  during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti  only a couple of days before eberwein s death  a republican donor  and operative from chicago s north shore who said he had tried to obtain hillary clinton s missing emails from russian hackers killed himself in a minnesota hotel room days after talking to the wall street journal about his efforts  public records show in a room at a rochester hotel used almost exclusively by mayo clinic patients and relatives  peter w  smith    left a carefully prepared file of documents  which includes a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring
