as donald trump heads into the general election against democratic rival hillary clinton  he is literally doing everything possible to cause a republican revolt  as backlash mounts after his racist comments regarding judge gonzalo curiel  gop lawmakers from mitch mcconnell to paul ryan have called on the nominee to soften his rhetoric  focus on the issues  and drop the subject speaker ryan referred to trump s comments as the  textbook definition of racism   mcconnell called the comments  stupid  and requested that trump apologize immediately and what does trump do  the exact opposite of everything they recommended in an interview with the new york times  trump blasted fellow republicans for being to harsh on him  politicians are so politically correct anymore  they can t breathe  the people are tired of this political correctness when things are said that are totally fine  it is out of control  it is gridlock with their mouths  trump also said he expects to work well with these same republicans because he s  always gotten  what he wanted  and trump actually thinks ryan and mcconnell s criticisms of his clearly racist sentiments are hurting the party mr  trump  arms crossed tightly across his chest during lunch  was aggrieved and considered some of the republican pushback inappropriate and unhelpful   though he did not want to address specific critics  he insisted that he is anything but a racist and  with his usual rebuttal by the numbers  stressed that voters have rewarded his outspokenness with a record haul of primary votes while washington is held in dismal regard he still thinks he s done nothing wrong  and what s even worse is he thinks politicians calling out his blatant racism is considered being  politically correct   one can only imagine what doesn t constitute being politically correct in the mind of donald trump what should worry the nation more  that the republican nominee thinks he s saying the right thing  or that there are millions of people supporting him the billionaire blowhard also told the times that he intends to run his campaign the same way he s been conducting it over the last several months  meaning the racism and sexism will be front and center this is a man who cannot admit he is wrong  this is a man who cannot apologize for saying the most vile things  this is  man who thinks he s so great that republicans will just fall in line featured image via john moore getty images
