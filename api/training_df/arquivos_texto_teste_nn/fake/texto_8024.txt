in a perfect world  there would be extraordinarily qualified presidential candidates coming from both sides of the aisle  we d have a battle of the minds  those who differed in matters of political opinion and policy approach  but all respectable choices  alas  we don t live in a perfect world  currently  the united states has one major political party with two very respectable candidates  either of which would make a fine choice as commander in chief  varying only in strategy  but not terribly in ideology  the other major political party is basically made up of rejects from their high school student council who grew up and couldn t get into leadership roles within their home owner s association  so they decided to go in to politics  to be blunt  there is no good choice for president running for the republicans  they all make shit up as they go along case in point  ben carson when asked a question regarding christian values as compared to the social values of republicans  and how they really don t go together  carson replied  my stance is that  we the people have the responsibility to take care of the indigent in our society   it s not the government s job   you can read the constitution all you want  it never says that it is the government s job and i think where we ve gotten confused  in the old days of america when communities were separated by hundreds of miles  why were they able to thrive   because if it was harvest time and the farmer was up in the tree picking apples and fell down and broke his leg  everybody pitched in and harvested his crops for him   if somebody got killed by a bear  everybody took care of their family  who the hell is getting killed by a bear  where the hell are they living  and is it a bear  such as one you d find in the forest  or one you d find in the castro  these are all questions we d like to have answered  don t leave us hanging like this  ben  sure  he s talking about the  old days   but how far back are we going  if we re talking about the days when the nation was founded  well  we re not exactly living in the same sort of society with the same needs  and we now have different resources available carson s broader point seems to be  we don t need government if we can take care of ourselves and our communities  however  the nation is composed of many different types of communities that are all represented in this thing we call government  which is an organizational structure in this little thing we like to call  civilization  without which  we would slip into chaos and despair in what some would call social darwinism  so  while carson s story is sweet  and weird  but actually kind of scary  the  everybody   that took care of the family is the community structure  carson actually makes a very good argument for liberals  and especially hillary clinton s  it takes a village  argument anyway  watching carson talk about a bear attack is very entertaining  and you ll likely watch it at least five times  so  enjoy  when asked about social values  ben carson reflects on ye olde times  when bear attacks were the norm  pic twitter com   mashable news   mashablenews  february    featured image from twitter wikimedia
