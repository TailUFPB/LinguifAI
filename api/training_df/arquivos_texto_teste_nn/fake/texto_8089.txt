it looks as though republicans are hellbent on obstructing president obama from doing his constitutional responsibility of nominating a new justice to the supreme court to replace the recently departed justice antonin scalia  they keep touting the line that we should wait until the next president is elected  that way the people can weigh in on who they d like as a replacement  not quite realizing the people did weigh in  twice  when they elected and reelected president obama  however  they know that justice scalia was the most conservative voice on the court and knowing that obama has the chance to nominate a liberal terrifies them to no end no greater example of this fear was demonstrated than by republican presidential candidate sen  marco rubio while on meet the press with chuck todd  rubio said  we have an obligation to do it  but not now  this term of the supreme court  they just started it  but it s not all year long  the court can function with eight justices  it does it all the time  especially when justices have to recuse themselves  for example  kagan had to recuse herself early in her term because she had just left the administration we re going to have an election in november where this vacancy is going to be an item of debate and voters are going to get their weigh in  so i just don t think it s wise  and there s precedent for this  for a president nearing the last few months of his administration  to put someone on the court that may be there for  years  if you squint  you ll be able to see rubio reach down his pants to pull that statement out of his ass  and knowing that line is absolute poppycock  and listening to rubio try to justify himself  chuck todd snaps back  do presidential terms end after three years  that s what i don t understand  is why not go through the advice and consent  you don t have to approve it  you can reject it  that s what happened in    but why not go through this process   and boom goes the dynamite  todd was quite visibly perplexed and couldn t quite seem to be able to wrap his head around the fact that rubio was actually saying the words that were coming out of his mouth however  rubio wasn t done  squirming in his underoos after that question  he said  there comes a point in the last year of the president  especially in their second term  where you stop nominating  you basically say  at this point  with a few months left in your term  no accountability from the ballot box on the appointment you re going to make   on a lifetime appointment  but todd interrupts this malarkey  we re eleven months    declaring the amount of time left in obama s term as commander in chief  and insinuating the president has every right to nominate someone new squirming some more  rubio keeps denying the fact that obama has every right to nominate a new justice  because he thinks that he s going to be president and he wants to nominate a conservative just like scalia what rubio needs to understand is  president obama can  should and will nominate someone to replace scalia  republicans are showing their fear and it s ugly  they are proving they are  constitutionalists  until they actually have to abide by the constitution  as per usual let s hope obama nominates someone amazing  and nominates them soon watch the interaction here  video  nbc featured image  screen capture
