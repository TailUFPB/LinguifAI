last week  printers at colleges across the country suddenly started spitting out fliers advocating white supremacy and antisemitism  the headline of the flier was  white man are you sick and tired of the jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy   and it went downhill from there on monday  a white supremacist hacker claimed responsibility for the mass hack princeton  n j    a well known computer hacker who goes by the name of  weev  said he was behind a wave of anti semitic  racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week  weev is the alias of andrew auernheimer  who in  was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on at t s servers and gained access to the data of   customers  mr  auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization  but his conviction was overturned on appeal it s not clear that  weev  even broke any laws since all of the printers he accessed were open to remote printing and were not protected by a password although  weev  did not mention donald trump  it s not much of a stretch to assume he s a big fan  while the white supremacy movement has always been lurking in the shadows  trump s candidacy has emboldened it to crawl out into the light  with millions of people no longer ashamed to be openly racist  the ranks of the kkk and neo nazi groups have swelled  giving them and people like  weev  the confidence to publicly tout their hatred of those people the fliers directed readers to the daily stormer  a neo nazi website  mr  auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree   my motivation is this  white cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners  the  threat  to  white culture  that he s referring to is the loss of white privilege  this is truly a terrifying concept to people who think white people are inherently superior but refuse to compete on a level playing field  it s also the fear that minorities  once in power and no longer minorities  will treat white people the way white people have treated them for centuries we should expect to see more  a lot more  racist propaganda being disseminated by bigots who honestly think their time has come again featured image via nbcphiladelphia com
