as the new york primary draws closer and closer  hillary clinton  current front runner in the democratic party  is slated to win by a comfortable margin  for now   new york  a solid democratic state when heading into the general  is also a very diverse state   which is good for clinton according to nate silver of fivethirtyeight  new york s diversity is why clinton will most likely win on tuesday  in fact  according to silver s measures  clinton s wins in heavily diverse states like texas  nevada  florida  south carolina  etc  most closely represents the democratic electorate in the general election silver predicts  through meticulous exit polling data and election trends  that the citizens who cast their vote for the democratic nominee in november will be  percent white   percent black   percent latino   hispanic  and  percent asian  that s a pretty diverse electorate  something democrats should take pride in silver also says this is why clinton will most likely be the nominee  as silver writes  clinton s major wins in states like florida and texas are embody the  coalition  democrats need to win in addition to being important to the democratic party s electoral present and future  florida  virginia  north carolina and texas are quite diverse  they re diverse ideologically   miami and austin aren t exactly  the most conservative part  of the country   and they re diverse racially  they contain not only a substantial number of african americans but also hispanics and  increasingly  asian american voters in fact  these states are among the most demographically representative of the diverse obama coalition that clinton or sanders will have to rely on in novemberthe states whose primaries most resemble the real democrat electorate are one of clinton s strengths comes from the black vote  which carried her to an impressive sweep of the south summed up in other words  clinton has won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographics strongly resemble those of democrats as a whole  this shouldn t be surprising   clinton is winning nationally by about  percentage points in the popular vote  so if you re in a state that s well representative of democrats  national demographics  you might expect her to win it by a solid margin too this isn t to say sanders hasn t won some diverse states that vote democratic   he crushed clinton in hawaii  and pulled off a major upset in michigan  should he win the nomination  he ll win virtually every demographic versus any republican candidate   as will clinton if she s the nominee  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
