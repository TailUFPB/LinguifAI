ted cruz paid dearly for insulting  new york values  on tuesday night  and stephen colbert couldn t resist rubbing the loss in cruz s smug face during the late show on wednesday night  the audience applauded after colbert told cruz to  suck it  the clearest message coming out of new york last night was  suck it  ted cruz   colbert quipped   suck our new york values  indeed  ted cruz had hoped to win new york even though he had been trashing the state throughout his campaign for not having the same values as him and new york voters delivered a crushing defeat to the texas senator by voting overwhelmingly for donald trump in fact  new york hated cruz so much that ben carson received more votes than he did even though he hasn t been in the race for a month  a fact that colbert found amusing  and in one county he even lost to ben carson  who dropped out of the race a month ago   colbert reported   though  to be fair  dr  carson may not be aware that he dropped out of the race  but even though cruz was beaten like a speed bag in a loose suit  at the end of the night ted cruz managed to keep it positive  and also kind of creepy   colbert continued before playing a clip of cruz talking about  america lying down with her back on the mat  during his concession speech colbert smiled and chuckled and then interpreted cruz s words  that is when america is at her best  lying down with her back on the mat  lights on and with a firm handshake and then back to your separate beds for some quiet weeping  if you know what i mean  here s the video via youtube if ted cruz learned anything from his loss on tuesday  it s that you should avoid insulting an entire state when you are trailing your opponent in a race you desperately want to win  especially if your opponent is a native of the state you are insulting cruz had hoped that new yorkers would forget all about what he said about them and vote for him anyway  he was wrong  featured image via screenshot
