in the most surreal moment in modern american politics  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told panicking republicans that the gop would actively destroy donald trump s election chances if it came to that  that rush of warm air you feel on your face  it s the wave of radiation from the republican party s nuclear meltdown  we re witnessing the death of a major political party things are getting truly desperate in conservative camps and the grim acceptance that this isn t a bad dream and that trump is almost surely going to win the nomination has begun to set in  it s led to an odd plan  in a stunning report by the new york times  republican sources confirm that party leadership is planning to destroy trump and give hillary clinton the win rather than let him have control of the gop to rally depressed republicans  mcconnell has hatched an unthinkable tactical retreat  let hillary clinton win and focus on maintaining control over the senate while still hopeful that mr  rubio might prevail  mr  mcconnell has begun preparing senators for the prospect of a trump nomination  assuring them that  if it threatened to harm them in the general election  they could run negative ads about mr  trump to create space between him and republican senators seeking re election  mr  mcconnell has raised the possibility of treating mr  trump s loss as a given and describing a republican senate to voters as a necessary check on a president hillary clinton  according to senators at the lunches did you catch that  mitch mcconnell floated the idea of tanking his party s own candidate for president over sandwiches at lunch mcconnell s thinking is this  if republicans accept that trump will never win the general election  they can devote their energy towards running against clinton at the senate level  if that sounds insane  then welcome to the republican party in  the saddest part in this scheme is that mcconnell s plan probably won t even work   at least not in the way he hopes  for one thing  trump has run his entire campaign on being anti everything the current  establishment  republican party stands for  if his rabid supporters catch wind of the fact that loathed senators like mitch mcconnell are lining against him  that will only make him more popular  trump s been saying the party is against him all along  this only confirms it making matters even more dire  mcconnell s tenure as senate leader has been defined by such egregious levels of obstructionism that republican lawmakers are roughly as popular as athlete s foot  in just the last few weeks  sources leaked mcconnell s plan to literally do nothing during this year s legislative session  if that  do nothing  strategy is shameful  he only made it worse by following it up with the announcement that he would be blocking president obama s supreme court justice nominee to score political points  neither decision was popular with democrats or republicans as a result  polls suggest mcconnell is leading senate republicans into an epic defeat on election day  having destroyed trump to save the jobs of senate republicans  he will be left with nothing to show for it  a fitting end to a republican party that rushed so fast to the bottom that they didn t realize they had jumped off of a cliff featured image via gage skidmore flickr
