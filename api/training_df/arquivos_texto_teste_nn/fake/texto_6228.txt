california is known as one of the most gay friendly areas of the country  but they are not without their share of homophobes  this was made abundantly clear on saturday during a home game being played by the san diego padres baseball team  the san diego gay men s chorus was due to perform the national anthem prior to the game s start  and things went horribly wrong perhaps there was already foreshadowing that the gay men s chorus would not be welcome to do their performance  considering the fact that there were calls for them to pay for tickets for the so called privilege of performing   even if they had no intentions of staying to watch the game  however  if you think that was bad  what happened during the performance itself was infinitely worse  as the chorus took the field to sing the star spangled banner  to their horror  a recording of a woman s voice singing the song was played  game officials made no move to stop the recording  and made no apology  the gay men s chorus just had to stand on the field until the recording finished  and then they were taken off the field  when they were being led away  there were many homophobic taunts shouted  including one that chanted   you sing like a girl the san diego gay men s chorus released the following statement regarding this disgusting situation what should have been a night of joy and celebration at petco park last night  instead turned into a nightmare raising serious questions about homophobia within the san diego padres organization and its relationship with the lgbt community before the start of the last night s san diego padres game   volunteer singers of the san diego gay men s chorus took to the field to proudly sing the national anthem  instead  in front of the large crowd gathered for the la dodgers game  the san diego padres played the recorded voice of a woman singing the anthem no attempt was made to stop the recording and start over  no announcement of apology was made to the singers or their friends and families in the stands  no attempt to correct the situation occurred other than to force the  men to stand in the spotlight of center field for the song s duration and then be escorted off the field to the heckles of baseball fans shouting homophobic taunts including  you sing like a girl  this incident followed several days of troubling comments and behavior within the san diego padres organization  three days before the game  san diego padres representatives aggressively sought to prevent singers from performing the national anthem unless they purchased a ticket to the game even if they did not plan to stay for the game which was not part of any previous discussion or written or verbal agreement and would have cost the small  community based non profit thousands of dollars  the demand eventually was rescinded on friday following repeated complaints made by sdgmc and san diego pride to san diego padres management with this as background  we call on the san diego padres and major league baseball to immediately launch a full and transparent investigation into the incident to determine if someone or some people intentionally engaged in anti gay discrimination or a hate crime by playing a female s voice to represent a group of gay men with the purpose of denigrating and or ridiculing gay men  the historic significance of such an act is not lost on the lgbt community especially in relation to professional sports and added to the depth of embarrassment experienced by the singers and their families we also call upon the city of san diego city attorney s office and the city of san diego human relations commission to independently investigate this incident to determine if members of the san diego padres organization engaged in activity in violation of the san diego human rights ordinance or engaged in any deliberate hate crimes based on sexual orientation we applaud san diego padres president and chief executive office mike dee for reaching out to our organization to apologize and to offer to meet with lgbt leaders to discuss the incident  we look forward to this meeting  we believe it is important to work together with the san diego padres organization to build bridges within the lgbt community rather than burn them down as happened last night however  we are very disappointed with the san diego padres dismissively brief two sentence statement at   p m  on saturday  may    which did not appropriately address the gravity of the situation nor pay due to the  volunteers who took to the field in celebration and were led off in humiliation hopefully  mike dee gets rid of the people associated with and responsible for what happened at that baseball game  there is simply no excuse for what was done to these singers  this is blatant homophobia  and it was done in an effort to humiliate an organization of gay singers  to let them know in no uncertain terms that even in supposedly liberal california that they would not be accepted since fans were deprived of the opportunity to hear it on saturday  here is a video of the san diego gay men s chorus singing the national anthem featured image via video screen capture
