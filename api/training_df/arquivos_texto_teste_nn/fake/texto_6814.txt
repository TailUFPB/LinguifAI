it s amazing how quickly  free market values  go out the window when republicans don t get their way in tennessee  house majority leader gerald mccormick  r  vowed to start an economic hit list on businesses in the state that stood up for lgbt rights in the face of a recent discrimination bill similar to the one passed in north carolina the so called  bathroom bill  would have forced trans students at public schools and colleges to use the gender on their birth certificate to determine which bathroom to use  it was an increasingly desperate response by conservatives to solve a non existent problem in opposition to the expansion of gay rights across the country  thankfully  tennessee s republican lawmakers got cold feet after watching states like north carolina and mississippi get economically devastated by their own versions of the law however  mccormick was not happy about it  on the floor of the house he threw an epic tantrum that included floating the idea of using economic coercion in order to get businesses to drop their support for lgbt rights  his plan was to block companies who are seen as gay friendly from getting tax breaks like other businesses in the state  the ultimate goal appears to be to drive those businesses to bankruptcy or force them to comply with mccormick s narrow view of human rights  all these companies who tried to blackmail us over this thing  when they come for their corporate welfare checks next year  we need to have a list out and keep an eye on it  note  mccormick s use of  blackmail  here means democratic and economic expressions of protests mccormick also accused people concerned with gay and trans rights of being unconcerned with gang violence  what do the two have to do with one another  who knows  and certainly not mccormick  this weekend we had four people shot in chattanooga   mccormick said  but  our chamber of commerce is writing us letters about the bathroom bill  now the reason they re not all fired up about the city of chattanooga s handling of the gang problem is because the city of chattanooga sends them money and funds their budget  and we don t  guess what  we ain t gonna  the hypocrisy of creating a needless bill and then getting upset when people  waste time  opposing it is  of course  extremely rich like his counterparts in north carolina  mccormick seems absolutely bewildered by the fact that the american people are not cool with his party s attempt to bully transgender people  rather than reflect on the outrage and reassess his own beliefs  the republican response has been to double down and accuse the opposition of being part of a vast  gay agenda  conspiracy with his delusions intact  mccormick now wants to use his position to destroy businesses that stand with the lgbt community  it would be laughably desperate if it weren t so vile featured image via youtube screengrab
