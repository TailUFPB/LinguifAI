a group of saint louis university baseball players won t be punished after an insanely racist conversation they had amongst themselves became public  while it might seem that a group of students in a position to represent the school might face some form of discipline if they were to  say  call the president a  baboon   reference multiple awful stereotypes about black people  and complain that a  colored  is running the country  unfortunately  the school is continuing a proud american tradition almost as ancient as the sentiments these students were busted expressing  protecting sports teams from facing the music for their actions last may  the team traveled to washington  d c   where the conversation in a pitchers only groupme chat swiftly went from  where do we eat  to  donald trump s inner thoughts  one player suggested the  kfc in the white house    you know  because all black people eat fried chicken  har har   another helpfully added that  they got rivers of the grape kind there   another reference to a popular african american stereotype among stupid people  i heard they got a colored running the country   someone else said   this tru   another player replied   unfortunately   it is   the asker responded   f cking watermelon eating baboon  and luke sommerfeld needed a macbook charger via deadspinit s unclear if luke ever found his charger  but one thing is for certain   the pitchers on the saint louis university baseball team are a bunch of racist f cks one of the players texted a screenshot of the message to his roommate  former team manager brendan twomey  who held on to it for almost a year until his girlfriend saw it on her phone  together  the two filed a complaint to the university  deadspin gives a brief rundown of the events that transpired  the report was filed on april  april   twomey and his girlfriend spoke to a university investigator on april   after not having heard anything about the status of the investigation  twomey and his girlfriend sent the image to the black student alliance  who posted it to their facebook page  dr  mona hicks  slu s dean of students  said there had been a miscommunication and a meeting to discuss the case was supposed to be held the next day but  according to slu s bias related incident report log  the investigation had been closed on april  and labeled not applicable for discipline  when i received that screenshot  obviously i knew it was wrong  but i was in a tough situation because i didn t want to necessarily hurt anybody   twomey said as he explained his reasoning for holding onto the screenshot for so long  you become close  because you do spend so much time with them  so you overlook   at the same time  i felt extremely disrespected  i knew there should be some sort of punishment  but i didn t know how to go about that   he added asked about her decision to fail to punish her racist baseball players  hicks was full of excuses  if i were to directly state to you   you suck because of all of your social identities that god gave you   that would be wrong  that would require some adjudication   hicks said in defense of giving her school s pitching rotation a pass on the horrible things they said   we also need to respect laws  this was a private conversation  or at least the perception of private between in group parties  hicks did not explain what privacy laws were broken  though the answer to that is  none   one of the players sent the screenshot to someone who showed it to someone else  no one hacked anyone  no one took someone s phone without permission  all of the information was given willingly  but  hey   she was trying to protect these students  right to privacy rather than avoiding a disruption of the season that might lead to the team failing to make it to the playoffs two years in a row  ultimately  they did not   right instead  the players  chose  to participate in a  facilitated dialogue  about what they did and the team s four captains wrote a letter to the school newspaper apologizing for that racist thing their teammates did  the leaders and captains of the team would like to extend an apology to anyone offended by the bias messages  we  too  are frustrated and feel that the comments do not accurately reflect the values that we hold  so far  the only person to face any real punishment is twomey  who has been harassed since he blew the whistle on the players  racist conduct  the riverfront times reports two days later  twomey says he awoke to discover his roommate had sloshed chewing tobacco spit on the floor outside his bedroom door  as well as the kitchen sink  fingernail clippings had been prominently placed on the towel twomey uses to clean his glasses  in a wednesday facebook post from pulphus  twomey s roommate was identified as slu pitcher brett shimanovsky   in fact  shimanovsky appears to be the very same player roommate who earlier provided twomey with a screenshot of the racist chat thread  twomey himself declined to answer questions about his roommate s identity  but says the roommate has since voluntarily moved out  shimanovsky did not respond to a message seeking comment   i consider this retaliation for filing a bias incident report   twomey says in a video documenting shimanovsky s actions twomey says he is disappointed that the university has not in any way punished the players  whom he says should have been forced to miss a conference tournament  but that clearly was not an option in the eyes of the school  of course   he calls the captains   letter an  insult   though he notes that the team s coach  darin hendrickson  did take the time to discuss the issue with him  he said he was aware there was a culture problem on the baseball team  a culture problem of entitlement  privilege and immaturity  he also said it was one of his biggest regrets that he hadn t recruited more diverse players   twomey recalled  he adds that there are  racial issues  that need to be confronted it started a dialogue and frankly it needs to be continued   the student says   hopefully  this issue will light a fire under the university and get them to really dedicate themselves to the slu mission of diversity and inclusion  featured image via screengrab
