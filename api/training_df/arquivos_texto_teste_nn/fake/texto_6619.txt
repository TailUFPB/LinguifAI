according to republicans  it is imperative that we  protect women and children  by instituting measures that punish transgender women for having a penis  some measures would literally place a bounty on transgender people  financially rewarding anyone who spots a penis in the women s restroom  others would impose heavy fines on transgender people simply for going to the correct bathroom  these measures  which combat alleged threats which have absolutely no basis in reality  have been decried nationwide by thinking individuals who realize that republicans   the very people imposing these harsh and pathetic laws on the rest of us   are a greater danger to women and children than transgender people could ever be while republicans crow about their attempts to save woman and childkind from the evil penises that may or may not be attached to women whose primary goal in a bathroom is to relieve themselves  they ignore certain inconvenient truths   like that children face greater danger from straight men in the men s restroom  on april   a traveler at a seattle airport noticed something horrifying  a man was snapping pictures of his  year old son in the bathroom according to charging papers  the little boy was using the bathroom when north carolina resident  yes  he s from the same state that recently shamed the nation by  protecting  children from transgender women with its asinine  bathroom bill   stood in the neighboring stall and began taking photos over the stall wall  the boy s father spotted the man performing this disgusting act and rushed to stop him  are you taking pictures of my son   the man demanded angrily  joshua gitlin denied it  but the father saw a photo of his son still on the pervert s cell phone screen  he grabbed gitlin s phone and slammed the stall closed as others called for police assistance  gitlin was arrested  at the scene  police confiscated his phone and other electronic devices with which gitlin was traveling  he was jailed and charged with voyeurism  but was released saturday on    bond to date  there have been zero instances of transgender people being arrested for bathroom misconduct  but the same can not be said for republican lawmakers  unfortunately  transgender people don t write the laws in november  be sure to head to the polls and vote blue so we can end this absurdity and begin focusing on real  important issues   like undoing the damage republicans are inflicting on our nation featured image via afflictor
