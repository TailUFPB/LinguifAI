when hatred takes human form  it looks a lot like the founder and chairman of the liberty counsel mathew staver  you may recognize him as the lawyer for the infamous kentucky county clerk kim davis who refused to do her job because her hatred was too big a burden to bear so she chose prison instead  she just couldn t stand the thought of two loving people of the same gender getting married  so she showed us just a taste of what was about come in terms of hating the lgbt community  and she had staver as her equally bigoted lawyer what s come since davis  hissy fit has been a string of anti lgbt bills disguised as  religious freedom  laws  and staver is the man behind the hate nationwide  cbs news investigated and came to find out that it s been staver leading this zealous crusade  from laws prohibiting transgender individuals from using the proper bathroom to allowing businesses the right to refuse service to the lgbt community  staver has been there through it all  yet  he cleverly words his hatred as such  it is only about being free to pursue your faith  we have no interest in discriminating against anyone  no  staver  the first amendment already guarantees your freedom to pursue your faith  what you re doing is helping states all across the nation write laws to specifically discriminate against lgbt individuals  you are making it legal to deny service or evict tenants based on sexual orientation  this legislated hate is taking away the freedom of lgbt citizens to grant the freedom to legally discriminate to religious zealots afraid gay money has gay cooties  and god forbid a transgender person needs to pee oh  and get this  staver doesn t think businesses are really going to pull out of the states that have enacted these laws  he s supposedly calling their  bluff   he s about to be in for a rude awakening  because being on the wrong side of history has never boded well for any bigot  his hatred for the gay community is bizarre  if he wants freedom  live and let live  it really can be that easy watch the story from cbs news featured photo by ty wright getty images
