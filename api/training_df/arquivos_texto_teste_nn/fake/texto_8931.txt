while it s often difficult to notice  joe scarborough is one of the remaining few  reasonable  republicans  of course  this has a lot to do with his party s radical shift to its far right flank  backed with the ascension of donald trump  consequently  certain republicans such as scarborough  who at one time sounded radical  sound rational today  to his credit  scarborough has often sidestepped partisanship to give credit where credit is due such was the case wednesday morning when the host of msnbc s morning joe vocally defended president obama s executive order on gun control scarborough and co host mike barnacle elaborated on the president s announcement  and agreed that expanding background checks for gun sales is an eminently reasonable action to take  scarborough made sure to underscore for his unhinged conservative viewers that obama didn t say anything about grabbing any guns  he also validated the president s genuine sadness and anger when mentioning sandy hook during his remarks via media matters scarborough  you see the frustration  don t you  in every press conference after every mass shooting  the president being frustrated by his inability to get anything done even when  percent of americans support stronger background checks barnicle  absolutely  joe  and living with the knowledge that you have to provide more information to become a little league baseball coach than you do to a gun show scaborough  look at this  so if you re driving  a lot of people are listening to us as they drive into work  we re showing a quinnipiac university poll that actually shows  percent of americans support background checks for gun purchases at gun shows  eighty seven percent republicans   percent  and as other pollsters have told us  up to  percent of republicans in early primary states  who vote in early primary states  support background checks  and  this is not a prediction  i m just going to tell you how it s going to be  there are going to continue to be mass shootings  terrorists are going to continue to do it over the next decade  and the things that i ve been talking about on background checks and all of us have been talking about and the president has been talking about  republicans  it s going to be the republican position within the next two  three  four years  i say jim vandehei  one of the things that was most astounding yesterday was the reaction  the pavlovian reaction from republicans over a set of actions that really weren t far reaching  and even the white house will tell you  they were modest at best  he hopes he can do something to start the gun show loopholes so terrorist can t walk in and buy guns  but it wasn t even that  and i m not knocking him  it wasn t that sweeping  nobody got any guns taken away yesterday and  of course  joe is correct  according to a recent quinnipiac poll   percent of democrats and  percent of republicans support background checks  back in    percent of gun owners supported expanding the regulation  yet  when the manchin toomey amendment was proposed back in   the senate gop filibustered the legislation in defiance of nearly  percent of its voters  why  three words  national rifle association  the only constituency that matters to the congressional republicans  it s an almost awe inspiring dynamic   the nra s extremist agenda is a higher legislative priority for the gop than  percent of republican voters furthermore  the president s order is  as scarborough said  not that  far reaching   back in   the president announced much more stringent and comprehensive regulations on gun ownership  the president  at the time  tried to resurrect the expired assault weapons ban and close all of the loopholes created by the nra in   there were bullet control  proposals  no more magazines larger than  rounds  and no more armor piercing bullets  today  however  the president s actions are limited to just the background checks and additional funding for the fbi and atf  nothing else  but that won t stop the relentless lies and fear mongering by the gop  telling its people that obama s out to confiscate their guns  as much as i d like it to happen  it won t featured image via video screen grab
