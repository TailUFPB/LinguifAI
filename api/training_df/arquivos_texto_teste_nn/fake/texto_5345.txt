following all the idiotic drama of donald trump s choosing mike pence of indiana for his running mate  hillary clinton s choice of senator tim kaine may have seemed a little lackluster to some  however  kaine compliments hillary in a way that many people probably haven t thought of  and their pairing makes trump and pence look far worse now than before politifact  which republicans revile because they think facts are pesky  annoying things to be ignored  put out a scorecard with the ratings of  statements tim kaine has made  it turns out that he has more statements rated true and mostly true than he does half true  mostly false  and false put together  he has no pants on fire ratings at all compare that to mike pence  politifact has rated  statements pence has made  and of those   only four are true or mostly true  four  he has six half true statements and six false statements  his only saving grace here is that he also doesn t have any pants on fire ratings a look at hillary clinton s and donald trump s politifact scorecards just drives home the point that the gop is riddled with people who lie and spread misinformation  trump  being the master liar he is  has more false and pants on fire statements than he does mostly false  half true  mostly true and true statements combined hillary  on the other hand  has more true and mostly true statements than she does half true  mostly false  false and pants on fire all together  just like her chosen running mate  these two are a good team just on that basis so is it really any wonder that hillary introduced her running mate as  everything donald trump and mike pence are not   of course  she was talking about the policies that trump and pence are putting together  but the ability to acknowledge facts and tell the truth is another major way in which hillary clinton and tim kaine are not  well  anything like any republican we ve got in other words  we have two presidential tickets that illustrate republican honesty versus democratic honesty  and democratic honesty wins hands down  facts don t lie  and unfortunately for the gop  facts have a liberal bias photo of clinton kaine by justin sullivan getty images  photo of trump pence by alex wong getty images  images merged by rika christensen
