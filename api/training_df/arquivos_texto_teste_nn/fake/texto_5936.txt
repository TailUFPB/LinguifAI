when we lost boxing legend mohammed ali this week  we lost more than an athlete  we lost a humanitarian  a man who was a great example to people all over the world of what being a leader and an all around decent human being means  therefore  it is only fitting that his public funeral be a place to remind everyone what this great man was about  and what we as people should   and should not   aspire to be  that is just what rabbi michael lerner did in a speech that brought the house down at ali s funeral on friday lerner took to the stage and declared that he was there as a  representative of american jews   after that  he turned his attentions to gop presidential nominee donald trump  without mentioning the orange buffoon by name  lerner said  we will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down muslims and blaming muslims for a few people  we know what it s like to be demeaned  we know what it s like to have a few people who act against the highest vision of our tradition to then be identified as the value of the entire tradition  of course  this was a clear reference to trump s appalling call to ban muslims from the united states  lerner wasn t done yet  though  he went on to trumpet the praises of a clinton victory in november  and also insisted that we need to make the world a more equal place for all  he continued  tell the next president of the united states that she should seek a constitutional amendment to make all national and state elections funded by congress and the state legislatures  and all other sources of money be banned   including money from corporations  from individuals  make it all public funding  tell her that the way to achieve homeland security is not for us to try new ways of domination  the strategy of domination of the world of  the other  to get security has been tried for the last   years and it doesn t work  the way to get security is for the united states to become known as the most generous and caring country in the world  not the most powerful  well said  rabbi lerner  this speech is something everyone needs to hear  because you are right on the money in every way  every single standing ovation you got here was more than well deserved watch the brilliance unfold below featured image via video screen capture
