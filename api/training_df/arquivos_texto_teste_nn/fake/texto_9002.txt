in a new poll that asked americans to comment on their anger issues  republicans and white people reported being angry nearly all the time perhaps stoked by hate mongering organizations like fox news and right wing radio  a large portion of conservative white people said they got enraged over current events at least once a day  and many felt that they were angrier now than they were just one year ago overall   percent of americans said they find themselves feeling angrier now about current events than they were one year ago  whites are the angriest  with  percent saying they have grown more outraged over the past year  that s more than latinos   percent  and african americans   percent  seventy three percent of whites said they get angry at least once per day  compared with  percent of hispanics and  percent of blacks the poll also found republicans are angrier than democrats  sixty one percent of republicans say current events irk them more today than a year ago  compared to  percent of democrats the poll  while not exactly scientific  does reinforce earlier research that found white  conservative americans feel they are more oppressed than any other group  oftentimes  this anxiety is  explicitly about not coming to grips with a black president peter brimelow  author of  alien nation  common sense about america s immigration disaster   asserts that much of white america s anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics diversity  he says   is not strength  the tea party is a response to this emerging white fear  conservative politicians  sensing an opportunity  seized hold of those anxieties and exploited them for votes  it was also impossible to contain  the hatred and fear mongering on the right has turned into an uncontrollable inferno  the results are toxic new realities like donald trump s popularity and   more recently   the armed takeover of a federally owned wildlife reserve by right wing extremists who think paying grazing fees for their cattle is tyranny on the face of things  americans should have less to be angry about  conservatives may not like it  but the economy has roared back to life under obama  more americans have health insurance than at any time in history  social injustices that have long plagued the country are finally being reckoned with  crime  in large part  is down what s left is the shrieking  hollow screams from pundits and politicians who desperately need you to stay mad  the tea party was an utter disaster  and many of its beneficiaries have been booted out of office by voters with a tea party hangover  but its initial surge of racist  xenophobic rage proved to many that  voting angry  is a legitimate   if pathetic   electoral strategy  and as america approaches its next election  it s clear that they are madder than ever feature image via flickr
