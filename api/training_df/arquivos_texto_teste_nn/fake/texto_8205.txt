well  here we go again  donald trump saying something weird  stupid or offensive has become as common as the sun rising  despite that  he just keeps managing to take things up one more notch on the ladder of inflammatory nonsense today s new normal in stupidity comes with trump s declaration that he would be open to arranging the assassination of world leaders that he doesn t like  this was revealed when he said that he would make china assassinate kim jong un  the leader of north korea trump elaborated a bit on his plan for forcing another country to assassinate people  however  he failed to explain exactly how he could force another sovereign nation to actually do something so asinine  i would get china to make that guy  disappear in one form or another very quickly  china has control  absolute control of north korea  they don t say it  but they do  and they should make that problem disappear  china is sucking us dry  they re taking our money  they re taking our jobs and doing so much  we have rebuilt china with what they ve taken out  we have power over china  china should do that  source  inquisitrwe all know it isn t a big shock when republicans  trump in particular  simply don t know what the hell they are talking about  however  on this one  trump really does take the cake  state arranged assassination is illegal in the u s  and has been for decades  gerald ford banned it via executive order in   and jimmy carter strengthened the ban again in   executive order  lays it out plain as day    prohibition on assassination  no person employed by or acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in  or conspire to engage in  assassination source  fas orgthis follows promises by trump to not only bring back waterboarding but to also include new and unspecified methods of torture that he calls  a hell of a lot worse  do you know who else assassinates people and tortures  enemies of the state   north korea  will trump get so bad that he advocates for the assassination of himself  it would be ironic featured image from alan com
