as president obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people  two new york lawmakers are being threatened by the nra for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition the bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a  day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns the nra  of course  is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state senator roxanne persaud and assemblywoman jo anne simon but rather than simply protest  the thugs over at the national rifle association decided to pull a sarah palin and make targets of the pair of democrats in a twitter post by nra publication  america s  freedom   pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice  to make it even more threatening  bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them  underneath the image  the nra whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti gun scheme  here s a screenshot of the tweet the image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter as you ll recall  former arizona rep  gabrielle giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after sarah palin posted a map on facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control  the map  which still exists on palin s facebook page  served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage  giffords survived despite being shot in the head  but the nra seems to be hoping for a repeat persaud and simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts  i think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone   persaud told the daily news   by placing someone s picture with bullets next to them  you are playing on the fears of people  the new york daily news reports persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts  who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month  they are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working   she said the daily news also reports that nyc mayor bill de blasio and brooklyn borough president eric adams condemned the tweet as well once again  the nra is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years  even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country  if a gun nut does end up taking a shot at persaud or simon  the blame should be placed squarely on the nra featured image  raw story
