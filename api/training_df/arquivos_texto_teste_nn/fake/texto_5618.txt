anyone following this election can easily see that donald trump is no angel  from his bigotry  racism and misogynistic behavior and comments  it s hard to make the case that trump is a man of virtue and worthy of running a country  acclaimed documentarian ken burns was quick to point this out in a recent interview with the daily beast  where he spoke at length about how awful of a human being trump is although burns was promoting his films  the filmmaker couldn t help but get carried away when the conversation turned to race relations in the united states  and the topic of trump came up  burns had been talking about his film the central park five  which is about five african american teens that were wrongly convicted in the assault of a white woman in central park when he reminded everyone how trump reacted to that case  he said  he shamefully took out a full page ad in all of the new york dailies asking for a restoration of the death penalty for two  year old  two  year old  and one  year old innocent children  while new york state laws would not have permitted their execution  just the fact that there was a rush to judgment ought to be complete evidence of how temperamentally unsuited he is for the office he now seeks  after his slam of trump s racism  burns went off on another anti trump rant  labeling trump as a  super predator  and going after the business mogul for being a bigot that has benefitted from the speed of social media and an  amoral internet  burns said  i find donald trump more of a super predator  this idea that he can attack and attack and attack whole groups of people  and that we live in a media culture where that s permitted to be tolerated it s the spectacle and not the truth of it  an amoral internet permits a lie to travel around the world three times before the truth can get started  and we live in a place where lying is ok where a lassitude develops where it doesn t matter what the truth is and that s how it s possible for someone like him to be advanced who is so clearly temperamentally unsuited and has no idea about governing  then  burns turned to the gop and the religious right  bringing up trump s long history of sexism  misogyny and his utterly creepy obsession with his daughter ivanka  burns criticized evangelicals that are somehow able to justify voting for trump  the republican party has been extraordinarily successful at getting many groups of people to vote against their self interest  evangelicals are voting for donald trump  what part of donald trump reminds you of jesus christ  trump lusts after his own daughter on national radio  talks about women s bodies and breasts in such a disparaging way  and mocks them  how is this in any way christian  when you make the  other  the enemy  how is that christian  there has been incident after incident  past and present  of trump saying things about his daughter ivanka that no father should ever say  most notable is what trump said in a  interview where he said   i don t think ivanka would do that  inside the magazine   although she does have a very nice figure  i ve said that if ivanka weren t my daughter  perhaps  i would be dating her   there have been several other instances  and it s amazing that burns pointed this out  if racism and bigotry weren t enough to convince america s more religious voters that trump doesn t live the values of christianity  his obvious sexual attraction to his own daughter should certainly raise some red flags featured image is a screenshot
