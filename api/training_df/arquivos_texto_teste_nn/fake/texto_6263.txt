according to reuters  a grand jury in oklahoma found that  jail staff did not verify what drugs they were using for lethal injections and were unaware when the wrong drugs were administered   this report is another damning piece of evidence that shows that there are many flaws in the supposedly  humane  systems in place for carrying out capital punishments in   the news broke that the execution of an inmate named clayton lockett  who was sentenced to death for murder  an executioner failed to properly put an i v  line into lockett  the needle used to inject the lethal drugs into lockett began to spray all over the execution chamber that he was in  he died  after  minutes of agony  not because the toxins that were pumped into his body worked as intended  but because they caused lockett to die of a heart attack after  a massive outcry from the public  which included a scathing condemnation from amnesty international  oklahoma made some minor changes to their policies regarding executions  in   two more botched executions were performed  one of those executed was charles werner  his final words were  my body is on fire  one of the major factors contributing to these botched executions is due to the absence of sodium thiopental  which is the executioner s drug of choice for lethal injections in the u s  the drug was taken off from the market in  due to increasing international regulations on lethal injections  states who have yet to abolish capital punishment  have been scrambling to find alternatives that means  once again in its history  the u s  is desperately clinging to a practice that the rest of the world is moving towards abolishing  there are many good reasons for abolishing the death penalty but there is one reason in particular that even the staunchest advocates of the deathly penalty must admit is terrifying  a recent study found that  in  prisoners who are sentenced to death are actually innocent no matter what protocols are put in place  we can never know for sure if they are truly innocent  i share the same stance as many capital punishment abolitionists  that capital punishment is always wrong  no matter what  whether the convicted individual is guilty or innocent  the idea that innocent people might be subjected to what is increasingly becoming not only a death sentence but a sentence to living their final moments in a state of hell   my body is on fire   is unconscionable oklahoma  you have already proven that reforming your policies on capital punishment are a facade  it s time to for you and the rest of the states that have yet to abolish the death penalty to give up this barbaric practice right now  all executions are on hold in oklahoma  since then  not a single execution has been botched and not a single innocent person has been murdered by the state  it s sounds as if they have found the perfect solution to their problem   now they just need to make it permanent featured image from  photo by joe raedle newsmakers
