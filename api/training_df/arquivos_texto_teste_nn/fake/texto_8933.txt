in a glorious segment on the late show  stephen colbert piled on the mockery of the anti government loons who took over a federal wildlife refuge building without preparing for the long haul when ammon and ryan bundy seized the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon  they were hoping to ignite a war against the federal government  instead  the federal government ignored them and most of america laughed at them and the right wing militia movement became an even bigger joke than it has ever been the armed militants have been labeled  y all qaeda  and  vanilla isis  and drew even more ridicule after having to beg people to send them snacks through the us postal service because they somehow forgot to prepare for a long occupation  ammon bundy has even backed away from his brother s claim that the group came there to kill or be killed during an embarrassing interview with megyn kelly clearly  bundy s pathetic rebellion has very little support  and stephen colbert only added more mockery on tuesday night  i haven t seen this many angry  bearded men in oregon since i referred to blue moon as a craft beer   colbert quipped  these confused  fragile  heavily armed creatures need someplace to live where civilization won t upset them  they re clearly endangered  although it s hard to know exactly how many there are because their camo is so good  here s one standing between two bushes  i believe  sadly  there s no hope of establishing a breeding program because  frankly  it s a bit of a sausage fest  colbert also mocked the stand off the armed traitors hoped for but didn t get  probably not what the protesters had in mind  that s like taking over the alamo and then not being surrounded by the mexicans  to conclude  colbert mocked bundy and his friends for being less prepared than a troop of boy scouts  what heroic  go it alone mountain men have always needed   go gurt  string cheese and lunchables  i want you to hang in there  fellas  because help is on the way  the refuge should really be renamed the  ammon bundy preserve for the armed and cranky   colbert suggested here s the video via youtube yeah  hang in there  guys  because the longer you carry on this farce  the more material you give to stephen colbert and the rest of the world with which to mock you  congratulations  you all are officially a worldwide joke featured image  screenshot
