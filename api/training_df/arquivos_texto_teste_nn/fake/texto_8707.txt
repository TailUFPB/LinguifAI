montel williams took republicans to the woodshed on saturday for putting american lives in danger by criticizing the iran prisoner swap it was a gesture that iran did not have to take  after all  it wasn t part of the nuclear deal reached with president obama and other world leaders last summer  but iran released four iranian american prisoners on saturday  including washington post reporter jason rezaian  pastor saeed abedini  and former marine amir hekmati  in exchange for iranians imprisoned in the united states for sanctions related violations republicans had demanded that the release of the americans be a condition of the nuclear deal  and had president obama listened both efforts would have been put in jeopardy  six months after the nuclear deal was finalized  president obama has now successfully negotiated an end to iran s nuclear program and the release of the americans the gop used as pawns to sabotage the deal but the good news didn t stop republicans from whining anyway  even though the released prisoners weren t even home yet  gop presidential wannabes cried that there should not have been any swap at all  we shouldn t have to swap prisoners   christie said   these folks were taken illegally in violation of international law and they should have been released without condition  rubio claimed that the swap will embolden other nations to take americans prisoner so that they can get something in return  governments are taking americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under barack obama   rubio said   it s an incentive for more people to do this in the future  jeb bush responded by saying he would have threatened iran with war to get the prisoners freed  i would say        if you do not release them  that there s going to be military action  that that s an act of provocation  an act of war   he said in other words  republicans would have left these americans in jail because they didn t get their way or they would have declared war on iran and sent thousands of american troops to their deaths over the imprisonment of four people  that doesn t sound like responsible foreign policy  and former marine and talk show host montel williams feels the same way as reports trickled in that the four americans were being released  williams took to twitter to blast republicans who criticized the prisoner exchange before it had been completed beyond inappropriate for republican candidates to criticize a deal to release hostages before they are home  sit the hell down and shut up   montel williams   montelwilliams  january    dear americans  just for today  let s  stopwiththestupid  just absorb that something monumental has happened  leave politics till monday   montel williams   montelwilliams  january    the tea party could manage to criticize a deal to bring hostages home before said hostages left where they were being held   notbright  montel williams   montelwilliams  january    saturday evening  williams continued ripping republicans a new one on facebook          if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt it s beyond irresponsible that some of the republican candidates criticized the swap that will bring our hostages home posted by montel williams on saturday  january    have now given us a clear demonstration of how they would handle international affairs and it doesn t look good  the gop would risk war and the sullying of our reputation around the world in a desperate effort to not look weak  since when did peace and diplomacy come to equal weakness  not only did diplomacy secure a nuclear agreement that will keep the world from being set ablaze for decades to come  it helped four americans gain freedom  the fact that president obama was willing to swap prisoners and make concessions makes him a strong leader  not a weak one  and the seven iranians released in exchange were not even a threat to us  they simply violated the economic sanctions put in place to get iran to the bargaining table  they weren t terrorists the bottom line is that president obama achieved success on both initiatives without having to fire a single shot or spill one drop of american or iranian blood  that is true strength that republicans will never have conservatives can either wake up and join the majority of the country and celebrate return of our hostages or be relegated to irrelevancy   montel williams   montelwilliams  january    image  facebook
