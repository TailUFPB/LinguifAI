the more we get to know donald trump  the more we realize that he s just a big orange version of kim jong un  he s childish  petulant and thin skinned  and anyone who has wronged him had better watch out  mitt romney wronged donald trump  he refuses to endorse the billionaire and well  it appears that trump is holding a grudge against romney from   trump wants credit for helping him lose the election  or something like that on sunday s meet the press  trump talked about the feud that appears to be happening between the  nominee and the  presumptive nominee  every single robocall i made  he won that state  every single speech i made  he won that state  in terms of the primaries  i believe i won him  or helped him win five states that he was going to lose in the primaries   trump continued and that support came with personal cost to trump  i raised a lot of money for him  i ruined the carpet in my apartments   i had so many people come  we actually had to have two fundraisers because there were so many people  here s the video it is true that in   trump endorsed romney  as for trump s argument that he would have taken romney over the victory line if he accepted more help  well  probably not  at that time  the trump revolution  or whatever you want to call it  had not yet started  polls at the time showed that trump would have been a negative on romney s campaign romney hasn t always been so sour on trump  after receiving his endorsement  romney sung trump s praises in a way that almost sounds like a presidential endorsement in an interview in march  trump said that romney begged him for his endorsement in   mitt is a failed candidate   he failed horribly   trump said   i backed mitt romney  you could see how loyal he is  he was begging for my endorsement  i could ve said   mitt  drop to your knees   and he would ve dropped to his knees  he was begging  he was begging me  it s doubtful that romney actually begged trump  but the former candidate does claim that if trump acted the way then that he does now  he did   then he wouldn t have accepted it if trump had said  years ago the things he says today about the kkk  muslims  mexicans  disabled  i would not have accepted his endorsement  mitt romney   mittromney  march    romney had any of your sympathy  this is where he should lose it  he knew what trump was about long before   as you recall  during the arab spring in   when muammar gaddafi was persona non grata in the united states  trump rented him a piece of land  his racism was clearly evident in his birther stance and with this tweet in response to baltimore riots following the death of freddie gray  our great african american president hasn t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    views on immigration are hardly new stop the ebola patients from entering the u s  treat them  at the highest level  over there  the united states has enough problems   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    of course  we know that trump is sexist  none of that is what matters to romney  though  although romney does enjoy the illusion of decorum  what matters to romney is that trump has no core beliefs  he even flip flops on how he ll treat his and romney s own kind  but he does seem to be settling on raising taxes for the wealthy  sort of  that might be just a bit too far for romney featured image via video screen shot
