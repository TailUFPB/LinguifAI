a citizen from the united arab emirates  uae  was brutally arrested after racist islamophobes in avon  ohio  called the cops on him because he was wearing traditional uae clothing and having the gall to speak arabic on his personal cell phone  ahmed al menhali was merely a guest visiting the u s  and staying at a fairfield inn  but  true to form for the racist islamophobes  he s obviously a terrorist  because reasons it was apparently two people who called    the hotel clerk s sister and her father  the caller reported her sister told her there was a male in the lobby  in full head dress with multiple disposable phones pledging his allegiance to isis  avon police then received a second  call from the desk clerk s father who also requested assistance on behalf of his daughter  when police arrived  though  they found al menhali simply speaking arabic into one phone  despite that  they brutally pinned him to the ground and cuffed him  according to the council on american islamic relations  and police body cam footage seems to confirm that  they were supposedly following standard protocol until they discovered that al menhali was  in fact  totally unarmed  no bombs  no guns  no nothing below is the body cam video from one of the responding officers this is what republicans have wrought upon society with their ongoing fear mongering regarding muslims and terrorism  they spout disgusting  ignorant rhetoric  and then morons like this hotel clerk  who clearly buy into everything bad they hear about muslims  call the cops on totally innocent people what s worse is that the right wing pundits who spew forth this racist rhetoric would likely be fired if they said it about jews or christians  but noooooooooo  if they re talking about islam  then they believe all is well  despite efforts from some of our leaders  including george w  bush  to try and separate the religion of islam from terrorism  we still have people like his royal islamophobe  king trump  along with ted cruz  mike huckabee  and others  stoking irrational  paranoid fires like they ll freeze instantly if they don t we re also getting good at pissing countries right the hell off with this crap  the uae was sorely disappointed that one of their citizens was treated this way for zero reason  to the point where their government called up our deputy mission chief  i e   the department of state  over there about the  brutal   ill treatment meted out by the ohio police to an emirati citizen   they were apparently told that we respect the right of foreign nationals to wear clothing in accordance with their traditions and views  but it s patently obvious that we don t  all because of what if  the uae also felt they had to send out a warning to their citizens traveling abroad  for citizens traveling outside the country  and in order to ensure their safety  we point out not to wear formal dress while traveling  especially in public places   that sounds an awful lot like telling women to dress more modestly if they don t want to be raped  how about we actually stop teaching people that all muslims are terrorists  one single hotel clerk from a small town managed to cause an international hassle thanks to gop fear mongering  at least the mayor of avon has the city reviewing the incident to decide if the people responsible for this should face charges message from mayor jensen  pic twitter com   city of avon  oh   cityofavonoh  july    s a hint for them  yes  they absolutely should the mayor of avon called this incident a  miscommunication  in that apology letter  miscommunication our lily white asses  this was a result of the blatant racism and islamophobia that republicans with miniature brains  and their frightened  paranoid  xenophobic little mouthpieces  have sown here  this hotel clerk should be fired at the bare minimum  she and her family should face charges  and republicans need to stop their racist fuckery and accept responsibility for creating an environment that leads to ordinary people in small towns creating international problems featured image via screen capture from embedded video
