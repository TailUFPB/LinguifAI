adolf hitler isn t enthused about being compared to republican front runner donald trump  according to comedian sarah silverman  who dressed up as the nazi dictator and made an appearance on conan  after being introduced  silverman as hitler said  wow  look at that  i have to say  that s more applause than i expected  don t get me wrong  conan  i agree with a lot he says   a lot  like  percent of what he says  i m like  this guy gets it  but i don t like the way he says it  it s crass  in reference to a recent gop debate when rubio poked fun of trump s hands and implicitly referred to the size of his penis  silverman as hitler had this to say  what kind of person talks about his penis size on national television  oh yeah  i m so sure donald trump has a big penis  i famously have a micro penis  that s what makes a tyrant  anyway  all these comparisons to trump  it s like  it bums me out  you know what i mean  sometimes i watch him and i m like   is that how people see me   watch the clip here trump has received a barrage of criticism  some comparing him to the notorious dictator including louis ck  who said   he is dangerous  mexican president enrique pe a nieto said trump s campaign had similarities to the rise of the nazi leader in an interview with good morning america  trump said of the comparisons it s a terrible comparison  i m not happy about that  certainly  i don t want that comparison  but you know we have to be strong  and we have to be vigilant  people agree with that  we don t want to lose our jobs to china  and we don t want to lose our jobs to mexico and japan  if trump doesn t want such comparisons  then he should stop propagating in ways that remind the world of the notorious nazi dictator
