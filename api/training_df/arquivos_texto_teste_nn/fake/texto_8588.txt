while it s exciting to see a great television show finally make its way back to the small screen  it s disappointing to realize another aspect of old school tv was also rebooted  while david duchovny and gillian anderson are both equal partners on the x files  as it turns out  when anderson was approached for the reboot she was offered half as much money as her costar  so much for equal pay for equal work  apparently  having an extra appendage in between your legs makes you somehow more valuable the characters mulder  duchovny  and scully  anderson  go together like peanut butter and jelly  peas and carrots  bert and ernie  you wouldn t pay ernie less than bert  would you  well  of course not  they re both male  and puppets   we re getting off track here s the thing  back in the   when the x files was originally airing on television  anderson worked hard to make sure she was paid equally as much as her costar  when asked about the current pay disparity  anderson said  i m surprised that more  haven t brought that up because it s the truth  especially in this climate of women talking about the reality of  in this business  i think it s important that it gets heard and voiced  it was shocking to me  given all the work that i had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly  i worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it  even in interviews in the last few years  people have said to me   i can t believe that happened  how did you feel about it  that is insane   and my response always was   that was then  this is now   and then it happened again  i don t even know what to say about it  it is  sad  according to the hollywood reporter  both anderson and duchovny were paid the same in the end  but the fact that they weren t from the get go is  well  sad  as anderson said unless a show features a strong male lead and other female actresses are quite obviously supporting roles  co leads  regardless of gender  should be paid the same  they both bring the same amount of talent and equity to their performances and the show s success this is still a battle not only women in hollywood have to continually face  but women in every profession nationwide  so  while some conservatives like to tout that  women are already equal    actually  no  they re not  at all  it s important now  more than ever  to make sure we elect into the white house another person with the ideal of making sure equal pay for equal work happens once and for all  it s time  in fact  it s far past time  we need another liberal in the white house featured image  youtube screengrab
