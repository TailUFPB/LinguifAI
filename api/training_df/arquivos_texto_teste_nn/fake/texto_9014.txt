a donald trump supporter came up with the worst idea ever when he got it into his head that it would be a good idea to try to heckle bernie sanders at a massachusetts campaign rally  clearly he did not know what he was getting himself into the heckler was wearing a trump shirt  and holding a sign that said  obama is as christian as bruce jenner is a woman   as he started being an obnoxious twit  interrupting bernie s speech and making a spectacle of himself  bernie pointed right at him and said into the mic  here s a trump supporter worried about mr  trump s money  the crowd  took over at that point and started chanting bernie s name over and over   completely denying the trump goon s ability to speak waving his arms around and cheering for himself  the heckler was eventually escorted from the gathering by security while looking quite satisfied that he was immortalized on youtube after the interruption was over and without missing a beat  bernie declared  i say to mr  trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation  watch bernie and his supports completely shut down the heckler below protesting during political speeches is nothing new  ever since obama became president it has gone mainstream as a way to get candidates to immediately address issues  however  let s contrast bernie and his supporters  reaction to your average donald trump rally bernie s people got a bit loud and drowned out the heckler while bernie mostly stayed on topic without getting ugly towards him  when these same things happened at trump rallies  the interrupters literally risked their lives  on one occasion  trump encouraged his supporters to attack a black man  and on another yet another black man got ganged up on with trump supporters saying shoot him    kick his ass   and  light the motherf  r on fire  featured image via video screen capture
