there are a lot of people in the united states who simply do not understand the meaning of  religious liberty   having religious freedom is not the freedom to be discriminatory against others based upon your faith  it is the freedom to worship how you like on your own time  the first amendment was very clear in its intent of separation church and state with the establishment clause  there is no national religion  there is no religious test  and having a faith is not required however  there are those who still like to skew not only the constitution to their liking  but also the bible to their favor  folks like senator ted cruz who will pick and choose which laws suit their fancy and which bible verses they want to hold near and dear to their hearts to throw in people s faces when they want to be bigoted jerks when it comes to  religious liberty  in the state of georgia  the state s legislature passed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse to serve or hire base upon sexual orientation  however  noticing that such a law is not only bigoted  but would also be harmful to the state economy as many businesses were threatening to leave  georgia governor nathan deal made the smart choice to veto the bill governor deal had it exactly right when he said  i do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith based community in georgia  but senator ted cruz used his skewed and biased point of view based upon his own understanding of things  and had this to say regarding the veto  i thought that was very disappointing to see governor deal in georgia side with leftist activists and side against religious liberty  it wasn t too long ago that religious liberty enjoyed bipartisan support  the modern democratic party has determined religious faith is inconsistent with its political objectives  i think that s shameful  the only people using their supposed faith and point of views for political objectives are people like ted cruz  legalized discrimination doesn t become less discriminatory when you call it  religious liberty   it s still unconstitutional and it s still wildly un american if cruz wants to call those who follow the constitution and abide by the  and  amendment  leftist activists  well  then so be it  i guess the framers of the constitution were also  leftist activists  then ted cruz is angry that georgia s governor vetoed an anti gay bill https   t co   nowthis   nowthisnews  march    photo by scott olson getty images
