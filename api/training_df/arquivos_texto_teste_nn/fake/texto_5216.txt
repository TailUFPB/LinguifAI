dr  drew pinsky knows a thing or two about reality show stars  so it wasn t really that hard for him to question donald trump s mental health the republican nominee has been going further and further off the deep end since the first day of his campaign last year  his behavior and big mouth have caused many americans to say that trump is not fit for public office  especially an office as powerful as the presidency  which has access to the nuclear weapons codes and according to dr  drew  who is a board certified internist and a assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the keck school of medicine at the university of southern california  americans are right to worry during an interview with don lemon on cnn  dr  drew explained that he doesn t think trump is necessarily insane  there s two definitions of sanity  one is legal definition  and that is somebody who is so out of it they don t know the difference between right and wrong  that is a very high standard for insanity  very few people meet that standard  when you re legally insane  you re really not functioning  clinically  medically  usually when we talk about insanity  we mean psychotic  hearing voices  hallucinations  but he did concede that trump is showing signs of mental instability  the question  though  is  are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected  that s a pretty hard thing to predict  i don t know if this is just somebody playing politics  or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses  when i hear people that are impulsive with their speech  i worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions  pinsky then went on to question the mental health of trump s supporters  who seem to support him no matter what he says or does  what s more fascinating to me  don  is not him but his supporters that seem to not be concerned about any of this  that  to me  is fascinating  as always  what is up with us  let s just assume that most people that would choose to be in a very high profile race like this would have narcissistic tendencies  and there s something called sort of narcissistic injury  then narcissistic rage  if you injure   if you really shame somebody   they tend to be sort of teflon when it comes to shame  if you shame them  they can react with extreme aggression and extreme rage  so this seems to be that kind of a psychological process  here s the video via vidme donald trump is a threat to this country  placing him in a position with such consequential responsibility would be reckless and it would embarrass this nation on the world stage america needs a president with a temperament and mental stability that will not cause world war iii  we need someone who is not thin skinned or easily provoked  we need someone who think of the people and the country before themselves  that person is not donald trump featured image via screenshot
