there have been a lot of strange things to happen over the course of this election cycle  but what you re about to witness may be in the top ten  maybe even the top three as much as it s nice to see one time foes donald trump and ben carson getting along so splendidly  albeit likely for illegal reasons  this new bromance took a turn for the awkward while at a fundraising event in mar a lago  florida  when the two were seen dancing together while being serenaded while the singer sang what could easily be the whitest version of ben e  king s  stand by me  ever sung  trump and carson casually swayed back and forth to the easy listening tune in front of a crowd of eager donors who can t wait for trump to turn all of america into a casino and or golf resort of course  the singer would swap in words like  donald trump  stand by me    and while i know this may make most sane people vomit  or likely laugh at the idea of trump actually caring about anyone other than himself  trump did seem to like it there s really no other way to describe what happened  so please check it out for yourselves watch the video here via washington post  featured image via video screen capture
