immediately following the election  a few leftist designers announced they wouldn t work with melania trump  their decision to not offer their fashion creations to melania hasn t seemed to have had much of an effect on her  melania has brought elegance  class and most of all  style back to the white house that we haven t seen since the jackie kennedy era apparently  vanity fair missed the excitement and enthusiasm so many women  and men  seem to have for seeing photos of the always meticulously dressed first lady melania trump  because somehow  her name was kept off their  best dressed women of   list  but several names that appeared on their list have many americans scratching their heads in disbelief melania made her first major fashion statement on the day her husband was inaugurated as our  president  where she was seen wearing a stunning two piece  robin s egg blue  ralph lauren suit later in the evening  melania stunned again in a sleek white  off the shoulder column dress with a modest slit revealing her toned legs  as she and president trump danced to frank sinatra s  my way  there have been countless photos of melania carrying herself with grace  class  and elegance as truly one of the most well dressed first lady s in history melania stunned the world in her luxurious black pants suit on her first overseas trip to saudi arabia with president trump again  melania pulled off another amazing pants suit on her trip to saudi arabia  that even made some of us forget about the damage hillary clinton had done to the image of pants suits on women but vanity fair s list apparently is less a list of  well dressed  individuals and couples  and more a list of individuals who lean left  here are a few of the people who did make vanity fair s list here are a few of the people who did make vanity fair s  best dressed women  list beyonce s sister   yes  the same sister who was caught on camera beating and kicking jay z in an elevator   solange knowles made the list   because why we don t need to go into the whole love fest between solange s much more famous sister beyonce and the obama s  do we and the entertainer rhianna  who usually looks like she just walked out a freak show  and calls women up to the stage while she s performing to grind on them in front of a packed house  was also named as one of vanity fair s  best dressed   did we mention that she was a huge obama supporter  when she visited the white house  she told her fans that the best part of the visit was that obama was  black   she probably just forgot that he is also white  anyhow  it s probably pretty clear why vanity fair chose her vanity fair even had a  best dressed couples  category  and to the surprise of no one  the obama s and the macron s made the list that should have been renamed the  high profile people on the left who wear clothes   of course  michelle and barack made the list  even funnier  is the fact that vanity fair chose this photo to highlight michelle s great taste in clothing and then there s the leftist first couple of france  the macron s  we must concede  that emmanuel and brigitte macron are the only leftists on this list that we believe actually have any business being on a  best dressed  list  like melania trump  france s first lady never disappoints when it comes to fashion  vanity fair did however mention melania and her fashion sense in arecent article  but it was anything but flattering  as they attempted to accuse her of copying  of all people  michelle obama  as a way to make her more appealing to americans  lol from the vanity fair article melania trump appears to be taking a page out of the michelle obama book of fashion  the usually designer clad trump flew from camp david to d c  over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable   pink gingham shirt from j crew along with a pair of matching j brand pink pants and manolo blahnik flats  according to yahoo style canada  the button up top is a discontinued piece from the brand s  collection  perhaps she s been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her first lady reign the mall brand is a major departure from the first lady s typical designer wardrobe  which is occasionally criticized for being over the top and out of touch  trump s predecessor michelle obama was often lauded for wearing j crew during her time in the white house  coming across as a more relatable and accessible first lady than many in the past  it seems entirely possible that trump is ripping out a page from the obama handbook in order to drum up some much needed goodwill from the public
