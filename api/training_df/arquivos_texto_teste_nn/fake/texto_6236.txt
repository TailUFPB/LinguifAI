trump is a millionaire who clearly doesn t need federal money for his businesses  but he took it anyway  even though it was supposed to go to small businesses that were devastated by the terrorist attacks on september    when the twin towers fell that day  it did significant damage to many area businesses  many businesses were wiped out entirely because they were based within the world trade center  in the aftermath  people avoided the area and area businesses struggled to survive the economic hit that why congress tried to come to their rescue by passing a recovery program earmarking hundreds of millions of dollars meant to help small businesses that were affected by the attacks however  small businesses that could have been helped were actually shortchanged because wealthy corporations ended up getting awarded millions of dollars despite not being near ground zero donald trump s building at  wall street is one mile away from the world trade center  yet trump was able to claim that the building only had   in the bank and that it was a small business in order to receive    that should have gone to revitalize the real small businesses around the world trade center but  wall street brings in   million in revenues every year  which goes beyond the federal definition of a small business even if there had been any damage to  wall street because of    trump could have definitely paid to fix it himself  but he didn t  instead  he swindled the empire state development corporation out of    of taxpayer money so that he wouldn t have to reach into his own deep pockets it makes one wonder just how many times he has taken federal tax dollars throughout his career as a businessman  which makes the fact that he continues to refuse to release his tax returns all the more infuriating not only would those documents show us exactly how much money trump makes every year  it would show us how much he has suckled off the government teat  but he has excused not releasing his taxes because he claims he is being audited  which the irs says wouldn t prevent anyone from releasing copies of their tax returns  clearly  donald trump has something  or many somethings  to hide that could make americans hate him even more than they already do taking   funds from small businesses is just the tip of the scummy iceberg featured image via wikimedia commons
