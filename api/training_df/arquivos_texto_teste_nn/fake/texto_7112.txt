 we re paying so much attention to donald trump   comedian margaret cho told addicting info in a phone interview  ms  cho has openly endorsed bernie sanders  but has applauded hillary clinton s political efforts as well   what he has done to politics is a travesty  it s a real embarrassment to the nature of politics in america  this was a dignified profession  there is a circus element to him  it s almost like we re looking at nero  nero is infamously known as the most tyrannical and insane emperor s rome ever had  after taking the throne at the age of   nero had his mother killed  was known for overt self indulging and had anyone who dissented against him killed  for leisure  nero would wander the streets of rome and murder people at random   after a fire burned most of rome to the ground  nero pointed the finger at christians  which began a reign of persecuting and torturing anyone associated with the religion  similar to the rhetoric from donald trump against muslims  a few years later  rome finally rebelled against nero s tyrannical rule  and nero committed suicide  leaving no heir to the throne and a free for all among rome s military generals to seize power the rise of donald trump has invoked similar fears that such a tyrannical ruler could become president of the united states  although  it is incredibly unlikely donald trump would ever reach the extent nero did  with the support of a gop majority in congress  donald trump would likely reverse decades of progressive reforms democrats have worked endlessly to push into legislation  the supreme court could possibly receive a judge incredibly unfit to be serving in such a capacity  groups such as those who identify with the muslim religion would be in even greater danger of their rights being taken away as donald trump has made proposals similar to those enacted by adolf hitler preceding the holocaust during world war ii  the comparisons to hitler are not that far off   added ms  cho   it s a very dangerous time   senator ted cruz doesn t offer any better of an option for republicans  who may face a brokered convention as many leaders in the party don t want donald trump or ted cruz as their nominee either featured image via flickr
