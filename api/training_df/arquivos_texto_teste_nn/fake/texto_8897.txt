worst governor in the united states paul lepage  r of course  has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office  but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall on wednesday night  during a town hall meeting  maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of lepage s mouth   and that s saying something while discussing maine s drug problem  lepage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting  white  mainers hooked on heroin  it got worse from there  these are guys with the name d money  smoothie  shifty   these types of guys   they come from connecticut and new york  they come up here  they sell their heroin  they go back home   lepage told a large crowd   incidentally  half the time they impregnate a young  white girl before they leave  which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road  d money  smoothie  shifty in a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist  lepage s long suffering communication director  peter steele  said that this wasn t about race  he then gave the following word salad defense  the governor is not making comments about race  race is irrelevant   steele said   what is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers  his heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood  too  we need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state  there are  might i say  just a few questions left unanswered here  why did he use names like  d money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from connecticut and new york  doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer  why did he specifically mention  young  white girls  when describing the kind of girls d money  likes to  impregnate   does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate maine s young women but the biggest question is does he really think the entire state of maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is  an ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women democrats have long complained about lepage  but even republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior  some have even created a website called  get right maine   which is an attempt to get lepage booted out of office and give the republican party a chance to save their image from the damage lepage has done for lepage  his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically  just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype d money to voters  maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick lepage from office or just censure him house majority leader jeff mccabe  d skowhegan  said lepage created this situation with his own actions  we join other mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration   said mccabe   democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us  we are committed to addressing the drug crisis  growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills    the governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games  he just handed his haters   which is  roughly  just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition  ever his own worst enemy  lepage countered by throwing a massive tantrum  accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with democrats again the sooner lepage gets booted from office  the better feature image via flickr
