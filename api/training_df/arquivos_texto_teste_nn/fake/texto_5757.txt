another day  another time the supreme court surprises everyone  while the divided court issued a serious blow to immigrants  their families  and the obama administration  it did decide to save an important protection for minorities  affirmative action the court  and a  to  decision  kagan did not participate   upheld the university of texas  practice of considering race a factor in admissions the surprise decision was written by justice anthony kennedy  a reagan appointee  and joined by ruth bader ginsburg  sonia sotomayor and stephen breyer dissenting was clarence thomas  john roberts and samuel alito kennedy  writing in the court s opinion  warned that while it may use race as a factor in admissions  it may not be the only determining factor the court s affirmance of the universities admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the university may rely on that same policy without refinement  it is the university s ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies the case stemmed from an incident in  when a high school graduate was denied admission to the university of texas at austin  the student  abigail fisher  who is white  alleged that she was a victim of racial discrimination  at the time  ut had a program that automatically accepted the top  percent of high school graduates  and took in other factors such as scores and extracurricular activities  fisher  who scored in the top  percent  felt she was unfairly denied even though she had  out of  on her sat  and volunteered for habitat for humanity in other words  she felt entitled  and  whenever a white person is a  victim  of  discrimination   they want to cry  racism  and throw everyone else under the bus this decision was the second time the supreme court took up the case  the first time  the court sent the case back to the lower system for further review  when the same conclusion was met  the court agreed to hear it once more  the first time  however  all justices except for ginsburg agreed  kagan  again  recused herself   ginsburg s dissent chided the court for ignoring precedence and racial history justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that the university s admission policy treats race as merely one factor in the overall decision to admit a student  which is permissible under previous judicial precedent  she also argued that the equal protection clause does not require that state universities be blind to the history of overt discrimination and that it is preferable that they explicitly include race as a factor in admission decisions rather than attempt to obfuscate its role the supreme court made a surprising decision today  however  if scalia was on the court and still kagan recused herself  the decision would have been split and the outcome would have been the same in this case  justice would have prevailed anyway featured image via win mcnamee getty images
