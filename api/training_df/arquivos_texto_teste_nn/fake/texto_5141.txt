donald trump is now alleging that the united states presidential election will be rigged against him  as per usual  trump s allegations are not supported by any compelling evidence  his supporters have decided that the election will be swayed in clinton s favor by the big scary liberal media  trump campaign top advisor  rudy guiliani  repeated these claims during an interview on abc new s this week sunday morning non stop conspiracy theories about the media s bias against trump are a response to trump s plummeting polling numbers which show that democratic challenger hillary clinton is enjoying a comfortable lead this week co host  martha raddatz  presented a remark that newt gingrich had given to the washington post  the current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable  because right now  neither of them is acceptable  trump is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is  raddatz then asks guiliani   is that the way you see it  guiliani responds  saying that no he does not see it the same way as gingrich does  he then claims that the media has not hit clinton as hard as it has hit trump  according to guiliani  this is evidenced by the negative media attention that trump has received during his feud with the khan family  compared to the media attention that clinton received because of benghazi  and i think her comments   hillary s comments   just don t get the same attention that trump s do  for example  she lied to a gold star mother  she lied to pre   patricia smith  the mother of sean smith  who   who was killed at benghazi  i believe  because of her incompetence  her incompetence in failing to secure that mission  and she lied to her on september     right at the coffin  she said it was due to a video  so i think that s far more serious or at least it said get as much attention as all of the attention that was paid to  you know  the comments that were made about the khan family  ah  the press isn t talking enough about clinton and benghazi  that s why trump s campaign is floundering  it couldn t possibly be that trump is a loudmouth asshat who decided it would be a grand idea to repeatedly insult the family of a deceased war hero  could it trump supporters will say anything to try and rationalize away the fact that trump is a dangerous man who cannot bully his way into the white house you can watch the segment below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
