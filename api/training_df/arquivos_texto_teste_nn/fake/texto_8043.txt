republican presidential candidate john kasich is promoting his idea to create a new government agency that would promote christianity around the world kasich touted the idea recently during an interview on nbc news according to kasich  the agency s job would be to  revive what we used to do when we beamed messages into the former soviet union  kasich went on to say that his new agency would  beam messages around the world about what it means to have a western ethic  to be part of a judeo christian society  kasich has managed to remain under the radar thus far in the presidential primaries  thanks to his undeserved reputation as a  moderate republican  the idea that the ohio governor is somehow less insane than other gop candidates competing for the party s nomination is simply absurd kasich is clearly just as dangerous and extreme as his republican rivals  maybe more so  given his ability to pass himself off as a  middle of the road candidate  in case you have any doubts  listen to kasich explain his idea for a government sponsored propaganda agency  which would promote christianity not only around the world but right here in the united states  as well here s video of the interview  via nbc news kasich likes to hype himself as a  small government  republican yet during this interview  kasich made it clear that he is dead serious about creating an agency that would not just expand government  it would authorize government to become the official  worldwide distributor of christian propaganda in order to keep government from ever getting involved in the distribution of religious propaganda  the first amendment of the united states constitution strictly forbids government from passing any law establishing  prohibiting or promoting any religion kasich s idea for creating a government agency that would distribute christian propaganda  at the expense of taxpayers  is exactly the kind of thing the first amendment was designed to keep the government from doing while on the surface  there may seem to be a difference between one republican candidate and the next  don t believe it every one of these right wing nuts is intent on turning the u s  government into the distribution and enforcement arm of the christian church john kasich is no less extreme than ted cruz  a christian dominionist who wants to seize every aspect of society  from government to education to the media  in order to further his own religious beliefs and kasich and cruz are no more extreme than marco rubio  who declared in a recent campaign ad that  our goal is eternity  before going on to quote a bunch of random bible verses  which he s obviously sure will help get him elected while all of the  republican candidates may be well suited to open their own mega churches or launch a right wing radio program  not a single one of them is fit to become the next president of the united states featured image from video screen capture via nbc news
