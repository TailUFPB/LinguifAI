there has been a minor war brewing in congress since february that the media has not received as much attention as it needs to  many republicans are refusing to support president obama s plan to prevent millions of deaths from the zika virus  an epidemic that has swept through south america and could enter into the continental united states any day now in february   the world health organization officially declared the zika virus a public health emergency of international concern  that s when president obama announced a plan to spend    billion dollars to halt the spread of the virus before it reaches the united states and the rest of north america below is a map released by the white house that shows how the virus can spread throughout the united states the zika virus is spread through mosquito bites  specifically  aedes mosquitos  which are often found in urban areas  are to blame for the spread of the virus  when a person contracts the zika virus  the symptoms are usually fairly mild  those who are infected experience pain in their joints  headaches  and pain behind the eyes  symptoms usually persist for a few weeks and then go away  usually  a person who becomes infected with the virus becomes immune to the disease in the future  there is no cure for the disease  historically  there have not been any incidents of the zika virus being a fatal  however  since the outbreak  deaths have been linked to the virus   one of which was in puerto rico even though symptoms are mild for the average person  everything changes if a pregnant woman contracts the virus  that s where the disease reveals its true power to destroy lives  the zika virus can cause a fetus to develop what is called fetal development disruption sequence  what happens is that the brain of the fetus stops growing  or is severely scared  which leads to brain damage and conditions such as microcephaly  a condition where an infant s head is much smaller than it should be  sometimes  as small as an orange  according to npr as it was pointed out in an opinion piece published in the new york times  the fact that republicans are willing are not willing to take immediate action to stop the virus is incredibly hypocritical when you consider they tried to blame the  ebola outbreak on the president it should be noted that not all republicans are willing to risk the nation s health over petty budget squabbles  senator marco rubio has publicly lambasted his fellow republicans for stalling   rubio was quoted as saying   the money is going to be spent  and the question is  do we do it now before this has become a crisis  or do we wait for it to become a crisis   rubio has good reasons to plead for urgency on the matter  gulf states will be among the first and hardest hit by the zika when and if it reaches the continental united states  including rubio s home state of florida  if only  rubio had the same mentality when it came to other crises such as climate change so once again  we find ourselves with a congress controlled by neoconservatives who have neither the compassion to do what is right and act to save lives  as well as the lack of fiscal wisdom to understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  these types of battles are what are what legitimizes brand new congress s mission to scout out and support democrats and progressive republicans  yes  they do exist  it s pragmatic to accept that there are seats dems are never going to be able to take   in elections to make a congress that functions  or at least one that functions well enough that they can decide that the future of the united states shouldn t look like an episode of the walking dead featured image from  photo by mario tama getty images
