john oliver  of hbo s last week tonight  dove into the deeply shady world of debt buying and collection on his sunday segment  but last week tonight isn t just about giving out information  the show often does surprising things well in advance of an air date so they can make the biggest impact possible  and sunday s episode was no exception  what they did will impact   people in the u s so what happened  oliver started a debt buying collection agency in mississippi called central asset recovery professionals  inc   or carp  for short  he used it to show just how easy and cheap it is to get into this business  debt buying is a grimy business and badly needs more oversight  because as it stands any idiot can get into it  and i can prove that to you because i am an idiot and we started a debt buying company  and it was disturbingly easy  not long after carp incorporated  they were offered a portfolio of medical debt worth nearly   million  and given the names  addresses and social security numbers of the   people who owed that debt  we bought it  which is absolutely terrifying because it means if i wanted to  i could legally have carp take possession of that list and have employees start calling people  turning their lives upside down over medical debt  the portfolio cost carp      they got it for pennies on the dollar  that s the norm for this business carp didn t start sending employees after these people like a regular agency  though  instead  oliver and last week tonight got together with a charity called rip medical debt  and forgave all   million of it  those   people don t have to worry about what they owe to hospitals  clinics  and individual practitioners anymore  they might not even have to worry about whether they ll have to file for bankruptcy anymore john oliver just wiped out the medical debt of nine thousand people  let that sink in while you watch the entire segment  which details out just how disgusting and grisly the debt buying business is  below we re the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn t have some form of nationalized healthcare available to everyone  and medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy here  in fact  more than  percent of bankruptcies in the u s  have to do with medical debt  it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for one necessary procedure  cutting edge cancer treatments can run into the millions in english  our system is f cked all to hell because of profit this move technically cost less than the famous oprah winfrey show where she gave her entire audience a new car  spending roughly   million  but the impact  and the message  are far greater  hats off to john oliver for this featured image via screen capture from embedded video
