it really seems as if republicans don t think the things they say and do are recorded  it s as though they only live in the moment and history ceases to exist  because if they realize the things they say and do are recorded they would know that we could throw what they ve said and done back in their faces  like with what is about to happen you see  republicans are hellbent in making sure president obama doesn t nominate anyone to become the next supreme court justice of the united states after the passing of justice antonin scalia  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell even went so far as to say   the american people  should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice  therefore  this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president   and don t forget senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley insisting we wait until next year to fill the vacant seat  he said  the fact of the matter is that it s been standard practice over the last nearly  years that supreme court nominees are not nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year  given the huge divide in the country  and the fact that this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent congress and push through his own agenda  it only makes sense that we defer to the american people who will elect a new president to select the next supreme court justice  however  what both these republicans fail to realize  alongside all the other conservatives and conservative pundits who share this opinion  is that it is the president s constitutional duty to nominate a new justice so that order and balance is held within all three branches of government  it is also not their place to say that he can t  truth is  they don t want him to  because they re terrified of who he might pick to replace the ultra conservative scalia here s the thing about history  though   it will come back to bite you when you least expect it  and prove that you may  in fact  be a huge hypocrite  here are some quotes from back when former president george w  bush was trying to get a vote on his nominees  and you may recognize a couple of the names  because of the unprecedented obstruction of our democratic colleagues  the republican conference intends to restore the principle that  regardless of party  any president s judicial nominees  after full debate  deserve a simple up  or  down vote     sen  mitch mcconnell  r ky       i hope that by the end of this session of congress  my colleagues will give the president s qualified nominees what they  and all current and future nominees deserve  the opportunity to have a fair up or down vote on the floor of the senate on their nomination  for the sake of the senate  the nation  and our independent judiciary  i hope that these partisans will not launch more filibusters  but from what i ve heard today  i won t hold my breath     sen  john cornyn  r tx       the bottom line has to be that the president has the right to get a vote  an up or down vote  on his nominees     sen  john cornyn  r tx       let s debate the nominees and give our advice and consent  it is a simple  yea  or  nay   when called to the altar to vote  filibustering a nominee into oblivion is misguided warfare and the wrong way for a minority party to leverage influence in the senate  threatening to grind legislative activity to a standstill if they do not get their way is like being a bully on the school yard playground  let s do our jobs  nothing is nuclear about asking the full senate to take an up or down vote on judicial nominees  it is the way the senate has operated for  years     sen  chuck grassley  r ia       but denying these patriotic americans  of both parties  who seek to serve this country an up or down vote is simply not fair  and it certainly was not the intention of our founding fathers when they designed and created this very institution     sen  richard burr  r nc       every nominee deserves a prompt up or down vote on the senate floor    dick cheney     and if this truly how all these men felt at the moment  then they should still feel that way now  they should abide by the constitution  allowing president obama to make his picks  as well as give him an up or down vote on who he decides would be the best fit  only reasonable  right  you know  since it s their idea featured image  flickr
