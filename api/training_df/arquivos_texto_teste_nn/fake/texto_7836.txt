conservative donors are shaking in their boots over the idea of a trump presidency destroying the republican party  and the last  years of their promotion of plutocracy in america  things have gotten so bad for them in the face of trump s virtually unstoppable campaign  that they are now throwing money at a gop consulting firm to figure out if a late term independent  party run could be initiated if trump wins the republican nomination the document  which was supposed to remain confidential  was created by staff at data targeting  which is a right wing political firm in gainesville florida  the memo says that it is possible to mount an independent candidacy but  will require immediate action on the part of this core of key funding and strategic players  all this research has to happen before march   when inevitably trump is the nominee  so that we have a plan in place   an inside source that was part of the development of the document said  march  is the day after the republican primary in florida  which is winner take all for the victor  marco rubio supporters are hoping that they can win this one to halt trump s so far unstoppable momentum  as it is now  rubio s prospects for this are growing dimmer by the day  the latest real clear politics poll shows trump at   to rubio s    it will be almost impossible for rubio to beat trump in his home state at this rate the process of creating a third party  independent  to run is not going to be easy  the candidate would need to gather over   petition signatures in texas by may   and   in north carolina by june   while this is possible in the time allotted  finding some relative unknown and suddenly propping him or her up as the great white hope of the republican party will be met with jeers by many  as dumb as republican voters may be  they aren t going to suddenly start voting for a corporate funded nobody texas and north carolina have been pegged as the litmus test due to texas s  electoral votes being a necessity for any republican win  and north carolina s status as a swing state that leans republican  a failure in these states for a third party candidate would make it nearly impossible for a  party win it s possible that the third party candidate could still run  in an effort to simply prevent a trump presidency at the cost of letting the democrats retain control  a trump nomination is going to be embarrassing enough for republicans  an actual trump presidency would possibly damage the party permanently beyond repair  it s only a theory  but if it came down to destroying the party or waiting at least  more years  they will take the latter featured image via youtube
