as a writer  especially as a writer who writes controversial  to some christians  books  j k  rowling knows a thing or two about freedom of speech  so i suppose it s not surprising that when asked about it  she defends speech  even if it comes from someone as  offensive and bigoted  as donald trump in a speech at the pen america literary gala on monday night  rowling used her personal distaste for trump s demagoguery to make a larger case for global freedom to speak   now  i find almost everything that mr  trump says objectionable  i consider him offensive and bigoted  but he has my full support to come to my country and be offensive and bigoted there   she said  noting a popular online petition to ban trump from entering the u k   his freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigot  his freedom guarantees mine  the harry potter author s comments came after british lawmakers debated banning trump from local travel for  hate speech  if you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you   she said   you have crossed a line to stand along tyrants who imprison  torture and kill on exactly the same justification  source  slatehere s the video rowling told the audience that she has little to complain about when it comes to censorship  but she did regale the story of a christian who accosted her   i didn t know  i m praying for you  could be so intimidating   she said she was probably underselling it  her books  and movies  have long been targets for right wing christians  who are upset by the occult theme  some have tried to ban the books from classrooms  and some have succeeded  she even had to defend her books in court as for trump  she s not a fan  in december  she posted this  referring to harry potter s archenemy  lord voldemort  who is sometimes compared to trump how horrible  voldemort was nowhere near as bad  https   t co   j k  rowling   jkrowling  december     rowling loves the freedom of speech much more than she hates trump  so she s willing to acknowledge that he has the perfect right to say the awful and hateful things that make up his campaign rhetoric what trump supporters don t realize  though  is that while i  or rowling  can defend trump s freedom of speech  we also have freedom of speech  which means we are free to call him pretty much anything we want  we are also free to call his speech what it is  hate speech  the most important freedom for right now  though  is the freedom to vote against him  or  as she more eloquently put it   his freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigot  his freedom guarantees mine  featured image via video screen capture
