in a glorious segment of full frontal on monday  host samantha bee took aim at the religious right wing movement and absolutely destroyed her target after taking a brief shot at ted cruz and his failed quest to capture the evangelical vote that came out overwhelmingly for the  thrice married foulmouthed tit judge who likes planned parenthood and thinks corinthians is a type of car upholstery   donald trump instead  bee explored how the religious right took over the republican party it all began  years after humiliating evangelical failures to ban alcohol during prohibition and to defeat the science of evolution during the scope s monkey trial  bee played a video of christians condemning involvement in politics  and then something happened in the early  when heritage foundation co founder paul weyrich called upon the republican party to reach out to conservative  christians   whom political morton blackwell describing as  virgin timber on the political landscape  well  technically virgin  if you don t count butt stuff   bee quipped bee then explained that it was a court case that pushed evangelicals to get involved in politics during the early   however  she was quick to point out that the case wasn t roe v  wade in   bob jones university  whose  christian  founder once declared that  if you are against segregation and against racial separation  then you are against god   claimed it had a sincere religious belief against interracial dating so strong that the school refused to accept black students unless they were already married  this violated irs regulations so the irs informed the school that it would lose its tax exempt status  the school retaliated by filing a lawsuit which they would finally lose in  when the supreme court sided with the irs  bob jones university would not allow interracial dating for another  years until the restriction became so embarrassing they struck it down in  evangelicals looked around for another issue to use as a rallying cry and decided to focus on abortion while also trying to establish school prayer while trying to get rid of sex education bee then issued a disclaimer  please understand when i say the religious right  i m not talking about people of faith   hashtag  notallchristians   but a political movement to harness voting evangelicals to the conservative republican cause  when bee resumed her epic history of the religious right  she noted that evangelicals abandoned jimmy carter   the devout baptist farmer who taught sunday school and helped the poor   and threw their support behind a  divorced movie star who hung out with hollywood jews  sinners  and believers in evolution   that man was ronald reagan  the year was  and that led to a video of reagan attending a sermon by televangelist james robison in which he smeared liberals as perverted communists according to bee  that s when  the christian right and the republican party locked eyes and leaned in for their sloppy  year tongue kiss  she went on to point out that the gop s  platform  didn t contain a single reference to god of religious issues  bee showed a list  which featured the gop elephant mascot being raped from behind by a cross  of all the issues republicans now focus on to please their evangelicals masters  which includes opposition to same sex marriage and abortion   i hope they sanded that   bee said of the cross as the audience laughed during the final stretch of the segment  bee pointed out that evangelicals have been losing ground for the last  years  especially on the issue of lgbt rights  which is why they have gone full circle by focusing once again on their racist roots by supporting donald trump here s the video via youtube of course  the rise of the christian right as the base of the republican party will also be the gop s downfall as their base gets older and dies off  donald trump appears to be their last desperate gasp to hold on to whatever political relevance they once had  but in order for the religious right to lose that effort  americans needs to vote in november to overwhelmingly reject trump  his evangelical supporters  and everything they represent featured image via screenshot
