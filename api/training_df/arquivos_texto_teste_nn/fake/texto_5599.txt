the gop has been impatiently waiting for the moment that presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton would be indicted over the issue of her emails  and today they finally got their little hearts broken earlier on tuesday  fbi director james comey made the announcement that no conservative wanted to hear   that after a lengthy investigation into clinton s controversial government emails  the fbi would not be recommending that the former secretary of state be charged with a crime  this makes it truly a sad day for the gop  and you can tell how bitter they are just by the interviews they re giving after the fbi made that announcement  republican nation committee  rnc  chief strategist sean spicer was in an embarrassing amount of denial when he went on cnn and insisted that the fbi had issued a  clear indictment  of clinton s judgement  despite the fact that it didn t recommend a formal indictment at all  spicer got so worked up over the fact the clinton wouldn t be charged that he completely lost it  and threw a bit of a temper tantrum over the investigation s results  spicer said  these findings of the fbi are a clear indictment on hillary clinton s judgement and fitness to be president  the office that she s seeking requires the highest level of judgement  making sure that our nation s secrets are protected  cnn host kate bolduan reminded spicer that the fbi had said that  no reasonable prosecutor  would even think about bringing charges against clinton not fully understanding the irony that his party s candidate is the most unfit presidential candidate of our time  spicer snapped back  this is someone who wants to be president  kate  bolduan then cornered spicer and asked him if he trusted the fbi to conduct a fair investigation  and the rnc strategist had to admit that he did  spicer confessed  well  it sounds like it  the findings that they made are very clear that she did exhibit poor judgement  that it was reckless by their account  and it is not their job to decide whether it is formally prosecuted  john berman jumped in to point out that trump had also disagreed with the fbi s assessment  calling it  very very unfair   spicer decided to defend trump and accuse clinton of rigging the system  i m not a lawyer  if she had followed the law and used a state department account or even used a private system like the director pointed out like gmail then this wouldn t be a problem  she chose to set up a system for herself around the rules that were established for everybody else for a reason  and that reason is she didn t want people to know what she was doing any other employee that works at the state department that did what she did would have their security clearance pulled and would be facing charges  this is absolutely ridiculous  bolduan took another opportunity to make a complete idiot out of spicer  when she followed up with this question  donald trump in his tweet called this  very very unfair   do you think the investigation was unfair or do you agree with your candidate who thinks it was  very very unfair  all spicer could do was reluctantly say that the investigation was fair  but that he still agreed with trump that clinton should be prosecuted  he lamented  the system clearly looks like when the fbi turned it over  the department of justice has already seemed to make it very clear what they re going to do with this  you can watch spicer get all worked up in the interview below featured image is a screenshot
