one would think corey lewandowski  trump s former campaign manager  would eventually get tired of swiping at paul manafort  the man who replaced him  he s already stabbed manafort in the back  however  when the new york times published a report on manafort s secret ledger in the ukraine  it seems lewandowski couldn t resist twisting that knife just a bit lewandowski was fired over conflicts with manafort regarding campaign strategy  and they really didn t part on the best of terms  earlier this year  politico reported that these two were at each other s throats to the point where trump created a new position for manafort  this was after manafort tried to bring lewandowski down this isn t the first time that he s gunned for manafort  the last time involved suggesting on cnn that manafort should be the one who gets fired  or takes the high road and resigns  over the disaster that was melania trump s plagiarized speech at the rnc so the spirit of this tweet is very likely lewandowski crowing over what may well be manafort s downfall secret ledger in ukraine lists cash for donald trump s campaign chief https   t co   corey lewandowski   clewandowski  august    downfall  the implications for manafort are bad  since there s at least   million that s slated for him  courtesy of then president viktor yanukovych and his pro russian political party  this information also shows how the businesses with which manafort worked raided ukraine s assets and influenced what should have been free elections  among other indications of massive corruption so manafort s horrifically corrupt  which is probably why trump wanted him so badly  this info isn t quite new  but these are details that weren t previously known  in other words  it s looking increasingly like manafort did  indeed  have some kind of hand in helping russia invade ukraine  even if it was indirect  adam weinstein also tweeted the article  but says his own work shows that this is just the beginning of manafort s doom  speaking as someone who has a story coming this week  this is just the beginning for manafort  it gets worse  https   t co   adam weinstein   adamweinstein  august    lewandowski must be positively gleeful over this  not that it matters   it s not likely trump would ever bring him back on board  lewandowski  however  likes to go after his enemies relentlessly  if indirectly  this is one feud that isn t going to end anytime soon featured image by joe raedle getty images
