columbine was the original school shooting  sure  there had been others  but that was the one that got the world s attention  it was the horror that was to become all too common in america s high schools and colleges  on that fateful day   april      the nation was rocked when  year old dylan klebold and  year old eric harris went to their own high school and opened fire  they wounded  victims and killed  more  the truly horrific part of all of this is the fact that it could have been much worse   because  even more than a school shooting  columbine was a failed bombing  klebold and harris had brought several homemade propane bombs with them in their efforts to make sure their attack on their school reached maximum effect   but the bombs failed to detonate in the past  the parents of these infamous school shooters have refused to talk to the press on television  however  that all changed when sue klebold  dylan klebold s mother  decided to break her silence and sit down for an intimate interview with diane sawyer   her first television appearance ever regarding her son s devastating crimes mrs  klebold talked about the guilt she has lived with over what her son did  and about the many things that she missed that  in hindsight  may have prevented this travesty  saying  i had all those illusions that everything was ok because  and more than anything else  because my love for him was so strong  klebold then acknowledges that she understands why some parents blame her  why they believe that she and her husband should have seen that something was not right with their son long before he took it upon himself to commit any such atrocity  before columbine happened i would have been one of those parents  if i had recognized that dylan was experiencing some real mental distress  he would not have been there  he would ve gotten help  i don t ever  for a moment  mean to imply that i m not conscious of the fact that he was a killer  because i am  klebold hopes to help parents who might be unknowingly missing the signs that they might be raising killers by speaking out  both in this interview  and the book she has written  entitled a mother s reckoning  which will come out next week  klebold says what we all know  that hindsight is always    i wish i had known then what i know now  that it was possible for everything to seem fine with him when it was not  and that behaviors i mistook as normal for a moody teenager were actually subtle signs of psychological deterioration  perhaps the most powerful lesson comes from an essay sue klebold wrote for o magazine  which is that you try to protect your kids from outside dangers  and can often fail to recognize the internal ones  she says in the essay   i taught him how to protect himself from a host of dangers  lightning  snake bites  head injuries  skin cancer  smoking  drinking  sexually transmitted diseases  drug addiction  reckless driving  even carbon monoxide poisoning  it never occurred to me that the gravest danger   to him and  as it turned out  to so many others   might come from within  most of us do not see suicidal thinking as the health threat that it is  we are not trained to identify it in others  to help others appropriately  or to respond in a healthy way if we have these feelings ourselves  hopefully  this brave mother accomplishes her goal of saving lives through telling her own story  and hopefully she can one day find some kind of peace with what her son did you can watch sue klebold tell her story in the clips below  courtesy of abc news  abc breaking news   latest news videos abc breaking news   latest news videos abc breaking news   latest news videos abc breaking news   latest news videosfeatured image from video screen capture via abc news
