yesterday  trae crowder  otherwise known as the liberal redneck  released an awesome youtube comedy segment celebrating the demise of ted cruz after his devastating loss in indiana on may   cruz solemnly resigned from the republican presidential primary race  while a few of his supporters booed at the announcement  the overwhelming majority of americans were anything but sad to see cruz drop out crowder devoted a short segment to the topic  beginning his monologue by announcing that  everyone s favorite murder lizard has dropped out of the race  he goes on to recite the story of how ted cruz came to run for president  explaining  the cruz family spent hours praying about about whether or not he should run  until god came down and spoke to his wife directly and said he should  continuing with the story  he says  and so ted hit his knees and offered himself up and said  i m your servant lord  use me in this as you see fit  now that ted has admitted that there is no possible way he can ever become president  crowder surmises what this means  saying  to ted  the use that his lord picked out for him was to completely destroy the republican party as we know it  while getting dusted by a carny handed mango man  it s comedy  but the liberal redneck makes some great points in the segment  honing in on the message that cruz s abject humiliation sends to right wing christian extremists that message is clearly  ya ll have lost  crowder points out that cruz could not beat a guy  who could come out tomorrow and announce hulk hogan as his running mate  but the ultimate message sent to the christian right by cruz s butt  spanking is that we re done with this  crowder sums it up by saying  we re done with you wasting our time on trivial bullshit like laws about who uses what bathroom and how gay a cake s allowed to be before you gotta call a prayer circle  we re done  watch the video below  courtesy of liberal redneck via youtube  featured image via video screen capture via trae crowder on youtube
