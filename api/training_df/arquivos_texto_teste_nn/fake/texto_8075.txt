house republican steve king received a lesson on what the constitution says during an interview with tamron hall the msnbc host and iowa rep  were discussing the death of justice antonin scalia and whether or not president obama is allowed to nominate someone to fill his vacant seat on the supreme court hall noted that republican senator chuck grassley also opposes president obama picking the next supreme court justice  but pointed out that grassley s past statement on the subject of nominating and confirming judges in the final months of a presidency is going viral during the final months of the bush administration  grassley said that  the senate has never stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a president s term  in addition  hall informed king that most confirmations only last on average under  days in the senate and there are still over  days left in obama s final year  hall wanted king to explain why republicans are running away from their previous position when it comes to doing their constitutional duty and king tried to spin what grassley said as if the supreme court is not part of the judicial branch  you ll find chuck schumer in his own words  and others also that contradict themselves  and you re going to see  if people have been in that senate long enough  that they have been on the opposite side of this equation  there will be arguments that are made on both sides of this  but if i heard chuck grassley s words right  he said judicial nominees  he didn t say supreme court justices  and that s when hall absolutely embarrassed king by asking him to actually read what the constitution says  and others would say please see the words correctly in the constitution  it clearly states the role of the president  and that of the senate  hall then ended the interview before king could spill any more bullshit out of his mouth here s the video via youtube republicans are always bragging about how much they love the constitution  but just like the bible  they apparently have never read it if steve king needs a refresher on what the constitution says  i suggest he read article ii section  which reads  shall have power  by and with the advice and consent of the senate  to make treaties  provided two thirds of the senators present concur  and he shall nominate  and by and with the advice and consent of the senate  shall appoint ambassadors  other public ministers and consuls  judges of the supreme court  and all other officers of the united states  whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for  and which shall be established by law  but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers  as they think proper  in the president alone  in the courts of law  or in the heads of departments the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate  by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session  featured image from video screen capture
