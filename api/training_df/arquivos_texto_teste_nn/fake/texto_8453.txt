it has been the life s work of senator ted cruz  r tx  to repeal the affordable care act  he s obsessed  really  and it really seems to stem from not wanting president obama to get credit for being the president that completely overhauled the healthcare system  proof of this is in his response to any question regarding what he would do instead  he wants to repeal it   to make it his own however  when cruz was asked directly about his plan for healthcare during the most recent gop debate  he answered  or rather didn t answer  the moderator s question fox news  bret baier asked cruz  today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from obamacare and they now rely on it  so the question  sen  cruz  if you repeal obamacare  as you say you will  will you be fine if millions of those people don t have health insurance  and what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured  and here s cruz s non answer  completely dodging the question  if i am elected president  we will repeal every word of obamacare  now  once that is done  everyone agrees we need health care reform  it should follow the principles of expanding competition  empowering patients  and keeping government from getting between us and our doctors  three specific reforms that reflect those principles  number   we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines  that ll create a true  state national marketplace while will drive down the cost of low cost catastropic health insurance  number   we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax advantaged way for more routine health care needs  and number   we should work to delink health insurance from employment  so if you lose your job  your health insurance goes with you  and it is personal  portable  and affordable  and i tell you  bret i think that s a much more attractive vision for health care than the washington driven  top down obamacare that is causing so many millions to hurt  to summarize  cruz wants to make it so healthcare is only available on the free market  and with regard to what his plan for those who become uninsured due to the repeal of obamacare  well  he doesn t have one one of the key components to the affordable healthcare act is making sure insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based upon preexisting conditions  if the law is repealed  healthcare companies will be able to go back to these harmful practices and leave control of coverage back in the hands of for profit care  thus  in the hands of those who see it in their best interest to deny care to those they may deem too expensive to cover  because it would harm profits  cruz seems to be in favor of this happening  since he didn t even touch upon it in his response in addition  cruz wants to make it so those who are covered by their employers are no longer covered  and would have to completely pay out of pocket for care  this makes it remarkably hard for those in low wage earning positions to even remotely dream of having care  the only people cruz s plan helps are the wealthy and business owners who will no longer be required to offer coverage to their employees  his plan is in no way whatsoever beneficial to the average american  however  he words it in such a smarmy  salesman type way that the average american won t pick up on the scam cruz wants the government completely out of healthcare which sounds great on paper if you only think of things in black and white  however  the reality of the situation is millions of people rely on the government subsidies granted in the affordable care act  millions also rely upon medicaid  and even more rely upon the fact that obamacare makes it so insurance companies can t deny a person based upon a preexisiting condition don t fall for the evils of cruz in his effort to bring america back to an era of people dying because they can t afford coverage  which is exactly what he is proposing   video featured image  slate
