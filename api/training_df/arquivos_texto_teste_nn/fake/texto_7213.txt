the fact that supporters of republican presidential front runner donald trump have a few screws loose is a widely known fact  however  considering all of the sexist  misogynistic comments that trump has said to and about women  most of us would imagine that most trump fans are white males  according to a recent study  trump isn t liked by   of american women because of his vulgar attitude toward them  and the other    well  you re about to see some of them cnn s martin savidge had the opportunity to interview a few arizona conservative women who were fierce trump supporters  and what the interview revealed is truly depressing and baffling  it turns out  that no matter how disrespectful and degrading trump is to them  there are still women who will not only continue to support him  but defend him at all costs one awful example of this was when savidge brought up fox s megyn kelly  whom trump had brutally attacked on social media and made several sexist remarks about just because she called him out on his misogynistic behavior  one of the women being interviewed said trump was completely justified in his bullying antics and said that kelly was guilty of  baiting him   another women jumped in and said   you don t know what his connotation was   when trump s crude reference to kelly menstruating was brought up  basically the group s justification for supporting trump despite his attacks on women was  because he insults men as well  i can t be upset that he insults women  the terrifying thing is that this group of women aren t the  uneducated  voters that americans and trump himself believes are supporting him  these are professional  educated women who have chosen to believe in a man who has violated basically everything they believe in one of the women  who is actually mexican american  said that she appreciated trump s  transparency   she said  i just find that what you see is what you get with this man  and that is what i want  another women  a church leader  said that she enjoyed that trump was  a strong man with a strong personality   although  it s hard to believe that she s even been watching the election when she says  he really does love his country  loves people  he really has respect for women  the women also blamed trump s rival  senator ted cruz  for the nasty attacks that the candidates have made on each other s wives  yes  these women excused this classy tweet from trump twitterone of the women   perhaps the only one with a little bit of common sense   admitted that she has  cringed on occasion when he s said a certain thing   she said  i wonder why  trump has  said a certain thing  but that s his personality  he s just   he just lets it roll  according to one of the women  only trump  going back on his policies and on the issues could stop her from supporting him   which is hilarious  considering that trump is infamous for flip flopping  another woman said  it s his policies that we admire  and that s really the crux of it and has nothing to do with what he might call somebody or what kind of terminology he uses  you can watch the video below  featured image via screenshot
