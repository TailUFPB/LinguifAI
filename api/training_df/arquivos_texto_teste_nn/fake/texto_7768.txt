megyn kelly became the only fox news host to take donald trump s endorsement by the kkk seriously when she cornered mike huckabee on monday night after mitt romney told kelly during an earlier interview that trump is  coddling  the kkk and their former leader david duke  mike huckabee feigned surprise that the former republican presidential nominee would say such a thing  trump has repeatedly disavowed david duke  disavowed the klan   huckabee claimed almost immediately  kelly put pressure on huckabee  when did he repeatedly disavow the klan   she demanded to know huckabee insisted that trump disavowed duke and the kkk on twitter  and further insisted that nobody he knows has ever called trump a racist but huckabee should probably read trump s twitter feed again because the republican front runner only weakly disavowed duke and said nothing about disavowing the endorsement of the kkk as i stated at the press conference on friday regarding david duke  i disavow  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    mentioned that it was weird how trump disavowed duke on friday but acted like he had never heard of him during the interview with jake tapper on cnn on sunday  and huckabee could only admit that he couldn t explain it huckabee then tried to excuse trump s terrible interview by claiming that his earpiece wasn t working  something kelly called him out on swiftly  but trump heard david duke in that ear piece  you know that  because he repeated back   david duke   to jake tapper   she brutally reminded the former arkansas governor huckabee responded by repeating his assertion that he doesn t believe trump is a racist and went on to trash the kkk as an  abominable  organization that he can t believe still exists kelly said that it s hard to believe that trump could fumble on something that is such a  no brainer   political candidates just do not accept endorsements from hate groups like the kkk  such an endorsement is damaging and is usually quickly denounced to protect the image and reputation of the person running for public office but trump took a long time to finally disavow duke  and it appears he only did so reluctantly kelly even reminded huckabee of other racist incidents involving trump  the most recent of which occurred when he decrided a judge for being hispanic as the reason why a court ruled against him in a fraud case against trump university  huckabee responded by calling this election  silly  here s the video via youtube kudos to megyn kelly for not joining her fox colleagues in defense of a racist  featured image via video screenshot
