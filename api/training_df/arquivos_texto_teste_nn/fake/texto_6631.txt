where congress isn t acting on gun reform  president obama is doing whatever he can  he knows that the ever present epidemic of gun violence in the united states isn t going to go away on its own  and it s not going to go away by adding more and more guns to the mix either  common sense actions need to be taken  and that s exactly what the president is offering   nra be damned the president wrote friday in a facebook post  today  i want to update you on some important progress we ve made to protect our communities from gun violence  as i said in january  these commonsense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy  but what if they prevented even one  we should be doing everything we can to save lives and spare families the pain and unimaginable loss too many americans have endured first  we ve jumpstarted the development of smart gun technology  today  many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen  misused  or discharged accidentally  as long as we ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone  then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun  so  my administration released a plan today to expedite the development of smart gun technology  including by identifying the requirements that smart guns would have to meet in order for law enforcement to purchase and use them effectively   and keep themselves and the public safer in the process second  we re doing more to make sure that those who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm can t get their hands on one  today  we re announcing a rule to ensure that federal mental health records about individuals prohibited from buying a gun are reported to the background check system third  the white house will convene state and local elected officials from all  states in may to discuss their efforts to prevent gun violence through legislative and executive actions  the goal is to figure out what works on the ground when it comes to keeping our communities safe  and then share those practices as long as i m your president  i will do everything in my power to make our communities safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands  that includes calling on congress to pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by the vast majority of the american people making progress on these issues is how we honor the lives that have been lost by gun violence  and it s how we leave behind a stronger  more secure nation for our children  the initiative president obama announced was just put on the white house blog in great detail  which can be found here the president laid out his hope for smart guns back in january as well  of course  though  the nra is already fear baiting their followers and getting people to be afraid of any changes that my take place   potus  new  guncontrol push is  alarming cops who say they don t want to be guinea pigs   https   t co     nra   nra  april    while the police have every right to be apprehensive  it s important to remember that something  anything  needs to be done to help push forth the effort for a safer united states  promoting safer guns is an idea that should be embraced by all  and you d think any group  like the nra  who says they re for  responsible gun ownership  would embrace an idea that made gun ownership more responsible within the same politico article that the nra tweeted out  it states   wouldn t prevent most mass shootings  gun crimes or suicides   currently the biggest driver of gun deaths  however  they could cut down on the roughly  deaths each year from accidental shootings  especially by kids  advocates also point to findings that most youth suicides are committed with a parents  weapon  and instances where officers  own guns are stolen in a scuffle and used to shoot them cause about  in  police deaths  it s important to note that this technology probably could have happened a long time ago had it not been for possible political backlash  the gun lobby currently owns several members of congress  which is truly the biggest obstacle to getting common sense gun reform passed what president obama has put forth isn t an attack on guns  it s not an attack on gun owners  and it s not going to limit any rights of those who do and should be able to own guns  what it does is put forth measures to make guns safer  less accessible to those who shouldn t have them  and start a national conversation the president is taking on the nra and doesn t really care what they have to say  because all they care about is profit for their gun manufacturer buddies  something needs to happen  and it needs to happen sooner rather than later featured photo by olivier douliery pool getty images
