former white house press secretary in the obama administration jay carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor  hillary clinton  president obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season  but  of course  like all major political players  he has his favorite  carney is sure that person is hillary  he said to brooke baldwin on cnn  i don t think there is any doubt that he wants hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved  i think the president has signaled  while still remaining neutral  that he supports secretary clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee  he won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee  i think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary  smartly  the president is refusing to comment on what jay carney has said  however  he s done all but given an official nod to hillary as the primary race heats up  president obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination  as we all want a democrat in the white house  however  he wants hillary to be that person  that much is pretty clear it s hard for anybody to speak for president obama  of course  but his former secretary of state seems to be his pick  hopefully  we find out for sure in short order  but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination  especially in a close  neck in neck race  he must be pretty antsy  though  being unable to endorse right away no worries  mr  president  the primaries will be over soon  and you can speak your piece then featured image via screen capture from flickr
