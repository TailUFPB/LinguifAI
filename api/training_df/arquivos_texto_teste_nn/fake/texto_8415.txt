when thinking about who would be the best fit for president of the united states  republican senator ted cruz should be nowhere near the top of that list  it s pretty much openly known that he s not well liked in washington  and the only thing he s really ever successfully done was shut down the government  which isn t a good thing  it puts thousands out of work and can be a potential national security risk  even former republican presidential candidate and longtime senator bob dole told the ny times regarding cruz  i don t know how he s going to deal with congress  nobody likes him  now  at a campaign stop  as cruz was greeting his daughters after they came off the bus  it was almost poetic how even his own daughter wanted absolutely nothing to do with him  he reached for her and she shooed him away  then as he went for a hug and a kiss  she tried as best as she could to get away from him keep in mind  what you re about to see in no way is meant to attack sen  ted cruz s daughter  it s just a video that caught a moment that seems worthy of showing  children  often times  won t want anything to do with their parents  with that said  here s the clip of cruz s daughter seemingly wanting absolutely nothing to do with her father  just like the rest of the country  ted cruz tries to get a hug from his daughter on campaign trail    varabbc  pic twitter com   breaking news feed   pzf  january    video featured image  twitter
