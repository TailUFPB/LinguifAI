during a recent appearance on good morning britain  donald trump made several claims about muslims that are  perhaps unsurprisingly to most people  completely bogus  during the interview  trump claimed that one of the biggest challenges in the fight against terrorism is that  good  muslims are withholding information about terrorist plots  it s like they re protecting each other   trump said during the interview   they have to report the bad ones  and if you report the bad ones  then all of a sudden you re not going to have the problems  here s the interview this statement does not hold up to empirical evidence  muslims do in fact quit often turn in radical extremists  vox reports  in   university of north carolina sociologist charles kurzman identified  cases since   where the police had publicly identified a muslim american as a suspected terrorist and disclosed where the initial tip came from  of those    individuals were brought to the government s attention via tips from members of the muslim american community  muslim americans were the single largest source of tips identified in kurzman s study  to further illustrate the stupidity of trump s claims  let s look at some other facts  trump is implying that it is the muslim population s responsibility to report  problems  to the authorities  by doing so he is placing responsibility for the actions of terrorists on muslim communities  shoulders there are approximately   billion muslims in the world  that s about   of the world s entire population  only about   million muslims lives in the united states  during this interview  and for the entirety of his campaign  trump has been using nearly a quarter of the world s population as a political scapegoat  the reality is that the islamic state and other terror groups are followers of salafi jihadism  they are a relatively tiny cult of extremists  that mainly live in concentrated geographic regions the chance that a muslim person would actually know a jihadist is pretty slim  the odds that they might stumble upon information about a possible terror plot is even slimmer  when we take that into account  and we look at the number of tips that come from muslims about possible terror attacks since   it becomes quite clear that muslims do almost always turn in information regarding possible terrorist activities when they come across it   and they know what they have come across it s almost as if muslims almost always do the reasonable thing that anyone would do if they were in that situation of course  none of this will probably matter to trump or his followers  if he says he saw a video of muslims cheering in new jersey after    that s what they saw too  featured image from video screenshot
