the westboro baptist church doesn t leave much room for dissension among its ranks  so when a phelps family member speaks on an issue  you can pretty well assume that their sentiment mirrors that of the entire cult  that s what makes the conversation the daily caller had with lee ann phelps  whose husband timothy is the late fred phelps  son  all the more interesting  talking politics at all with a cult family that hates everyone is typically a pointless endeavor  but in this case something stuck out that is just too good to pass up phelps said she couldn t support donald trump for president because he is  too fringe  yes  you read that right  still  you ll want to take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the laughter that is undoubtedly making its way to the surface when you read it again  donald trump is too fringe for the westboro baptist church  the same cult that pickets just about anything imaginable with such incendiary slogans as  god hates f gs  and   america is doomed  thinks that trump is  too far out there  on too many issues to be considered for the presidency according to merriam webster   fringe  means  not part of the mainstream  unconventional  peripheral  or extreme  there is nothing in america more unconventional  peripheral or extreme than the westboro baptist church  at least there used to be nothing that compared  now we have a failed businessman masquerading as a success declaring racism and hate to be what will make america great again  you could almost wager that if you were to ask just about anyone who their guess would be for a wbc endorsement  donald trump would win hands down while she says she isn t voting  phelps has declined to weigh in on the democratic candidates at all featured image from wikimedia
