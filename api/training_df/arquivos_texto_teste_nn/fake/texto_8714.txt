way back in   when fox s madtv was still on the air  an actress singer named nicole sullivan performed a three minute comedy sketch that so accurately predicts the donald trump campaign  we just had to write about it for the sketch  sullivan adopted the character of darlene mcbride  a huge haired country music singer  who is promoting her upcoming  take back america  tour as the video opens  sullivan s character can be seen strumming her guitar  while belting out the words to her new song   take back america  take back america to    she sings   take back america to when god was still alive  as the music fades into the background  mcbride is seen sitting at a mirrored dressing table  dressed in camo  an american flag displayed proudly on the shoulder of her military fatigues  truer words were never spoken  or sung   she says she then introduces herself  hi  i m darlene mcbride  you know i love this country  the way it used to be  simple minded  with simple values  simple people  but then the big government  the supreme court and those bleeding heart liberals just couldn t leave well enough alone  and now look at it  a big  ugly melting pot just boilin  over on what used to be a nice  white stove  from there  mcbride goes on to talk about her upcoming tour  where she says she ll  be coming to a city near you  to sing traditional songs with traditional values  she then provides the audience with a few samples tunes that you can hear during the tour for starters  there s a little ditty called the lord loves the nra  the lord loves the nra  he told me so the other day  he spelled it out in bullets in the sky  he s sitting up in heaven with his ak   he s a rough and ready  macho kind of guy  then there s the song called the back of the bus leading into that one she says  excuse me mr  negro  but i ve got a question to ask you  she then breaks into the song  asking in the lyrics   what s so bad about the back of the bus  next up is a song called nothing would be finer  nothing would be finer than to drop a bomb on chiner in the morning  she also has a song about illegal immigration called hey senorita to be fair  all of the songs in this sketch would work for any gop candidate  not just trump  the nra lovin   republican jesus fearin  racists and warmongers that vote for them would likely never realize they were listening to a musical parody of themselves watch the madtv video below  courtesy of migrainemaker on youtube while the sketch might seem like it was written to mock today s teapublican trump supporters  it s actually  years old it goes to show  no matter how much time passes  the republican party does not change  it s the same today as it was almost twenty years ago  and will most likely be twenty years from now featured image credit  video screen capture  madtv via migrainemaker on youtube
