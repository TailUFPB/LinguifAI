there s something stirring in the deep south that is reminiscent of when the south decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property  some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government texas governor greg abbott  r   knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states  due to this little thing called article  section  of the united states constitution  has decided to release a plan to change the constitution  this is in an effort to change the rule of law in the united states and prohibit congress  the supreme court and the president from regulating states  he seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws abbott  in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law   however  it seems he would rather not have federal law at all  honestly  the next step after this would be secession  it looks like abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another civil war abbott  with his own interpretation of the constitution put out a press release that stated governor greg abbott today delivered the keynote address at the texas public policy foundation s annual policy orientation where he unveiled his texas plan to restore the rule of law and return the constitution to its intended purpose  in his plan  governor abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the states and the united states  the governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a convention of states  the increasingly frequent departures from constitutional principles are destroying the rule of law foundation on which this country was built   said governor abbott   we are succumbing to the caprice of man that our founders fought to escape  the cure to these problems will not come from washington d c  instead  the states must lead the way  to do that i am adding another item to the agenda next session  i want legislation authorizing texas to join other states in calling for a convention of states to fix the cracks in our constitution  governor abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in washington  d c  stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the constitution  congress routinely violates its enumerated powers  while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another  the president exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy handed regulations  and the supreme court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation  governor abbott urged action by texas   and other states   to restore the rule of law in america governor abbott offered the following constitutional amendments prohibit congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one state require congress to balance its budget prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law allow a two thirds majority of the states to override a u s  supreme court decision require a seven justice super majority vote for u s  supreme court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the constitution give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds allow a two thirds majority of the states to override a federal law or regulation the full plan can be found here the one who seems to not want to follow the constitution is gov  abbott himself  if he did he wouldn t want to amend the constitution as it is written  he s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today  he wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government  if this isn t treason  i don t know what is what abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers  that is how we can change federal laws  we don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state  that s what the south did before the civil war when they wanted to own humans as property  and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality  what he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the united states of america  the south lost then  and he will lose now it looks as though abbott is trying to be the next jefferson davis and lead a new brand of confederate states featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
