urbandale high school students worked hard to get a presidential candidate come to speak at their school in urbandale  iowa  both bernie sanders and donald trump said that they would come speak to at the high school  trump ended up speaking during the school s homecoming  sanders was blocked by the administration the des moines register reports on the story  saying  the billionaire republican visited the high school s homecoming in september after students launched a month long campaign to recruit a presidential candidate to campus  students had also reached out to the campaign of bernie sanders  who couldn t make the fall homecoming dance  but expressed interest in a later visit  campaign officials recently tried to firm up sanders  visit  but were turned down by school administrators  students say they were told that another candidate visit would be too much of an administrative hassle  there were allegations of the school playing favoritism by only letting a republican candidate speak to the school  the move prompted a backlash from some of the students  we let donald trump come as a presidential candidate  but in reality the main focus of his appearance at our school was that he was a high profile celebrity   said josh ingham  a senior at the school   so we wanted a politician that is only involved in politics  so when the administration turned down this opportunity  we were kind of surprised and outraged since the campaign directly contacted our school  we had the opportunity  ultimately  the matter was resolved with a somewhat weak compromise  sanders wasn t allowed to speak at the school but some urbandale students were given reserved seats at a sanders  event  they were able to meet sanders back stage at the event the des moines register reports that ingham who  along with other students  was about to launch a petition to get the school s administration to reverse their decision  got a very special shout out from sanders at the event  sanders  iowa staffers reserved prime seats at his saturday evening appearance at the iowa state fairgrounds and set up a quick meet and greet with the candidate  about  urbandale students gathered backstage behind a black curtain that separated them from the crowd of more than   waiting for the vermont senator s arrival when sanders reached the venue  he handed a microphone over to ingham and asked him to tell the group what had happened at the school  he told them standing up to their school was  a very brave thing to do  it s great that those students who attended the event got to have that experience  however  it is antithetical to the idea of civics education to have only one candidate  from one party speak  representative democracy is about having candidates present their ideas  and then letting people decide who they agree with  when an institution only lets one side of the aisle speak  all they are doing is providing another bully pulpit for that party or candidate  which is totally not cool at least some of those students learned a valuable lesson  when the establishment screws you over   organize featured image credit by michael vadon  own work    via wikimedia commons
