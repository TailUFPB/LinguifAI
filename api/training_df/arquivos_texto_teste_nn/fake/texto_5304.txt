when donald trump first announced that he was running for the white house  no one took him seriously  we all laughed and joked about it  thinking it might be entertaining to watch his train wreck of a campaign for a few months before the other candidates left him in the dust  we watched him make racist  misogynistic  hateful remarks and didn t think he would last  but here we are  he managed to become the republican nominee  recognizing that we need to do something about that  president barack obama has a message for americans in an interview with today s savannah guthrie  obama doubled down on the dangers of trump getting into the white house  several months ago  it seemed that obama was brushing off trump s campaign just like the rest of us  but that has all changed as we near the general election  when asked if trump could win  obama didn t sugarcoat it for americans when he said   anything is possible obama s comments didn t come without a few jabs at the donald  as the president hammered the business mogul for being a pathological liar  obama said  he is someone that likes attention  he surprised himself that he got this far  as far as the threat of living under a president trump  obama said  i ve seen all kinds of crazy stuff happen  but overall stressed that  america is resilient  but just because america might survive   years of donald trump does not mean that we should give him the chance to undo all of our progress and threaten our country s future  obama stressed the importance of electing democratic nominee hillary clinton in november  and urged all democratic voters to take this election very seriously  obama said  so  my advice to democrats   and i don t have to give this advice to hillary clinton  because she already knows it   is you stay worried until all those those votes are cast and counted because you know  one of the dangers in an election like this is that people don t take the challenge seriously  they stay home  and we end up getting the unexpected  you can watch obama s interview below obama s comments to voters reflect the tone of the democratic national convention this week  as voters are urged to stay hungry and keep working hard right up to november  for the voters that are upset that vermont senator bernie sanders was not selected as the nominee  obama s message is especially for them  we can t afford to be upset  we can t afford to be so upset that we sit this election out  the stakes are too high  we cannot give our country to a sociopath and bigot like donald trump because he will destroy it  regardless of who you voted for in the primaries  we need to move on and do everything to prevent trump from getting into the white house  every vote for clinton counts featured image is a screenshot
