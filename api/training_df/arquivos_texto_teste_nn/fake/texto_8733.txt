carly fiorina is going to be in a world of hurt for this one  hillary clinton s email  scandal  or whatever you want to call it  doesn t even come close to what carly fiorina and her super pac have been doing the international business times reported on friday that they have email evidence proving that carly for america  fiorina s super pac   has been unlawfully coordinating with campaign stops where carly has been speaking  as everyone knows  it is a direct violation of fec laws for super pacs to coordinate with campaigns for any reason  yet  that doesn t appear to have prevented carly or her super pac from trying to work around that law up until this point  candidates have tried various measures to exploit loopholes in the law  the most popular one being waiting to announce their presidential runs formally in order to finance their campaigns early on  carly has done this and taken it to the extreme  her super pac now handles all the functions at her campaign stops that a campaign normally would  it s practically unheard of  this by itself isn t a violation  though  the new york times even said carly s campaign s strategy of posting her schedule online to alert her super pac of where she ll be giving speeches so that her super pac can show up and set up shop  has been a brilliant a run around of the law  that way  they can claim they haven t  coordinated   they can just show up and claim to be independent new email evidence shows this not to be true  in fact  if anything  carly s super pac has even helped organize the events  the international business times reviewed a handful of emails between employees at winthrop university in south carolina  where carly had a september event   staff for the fiorina campaign  and carly for america  they found that when an employee had trouble getting in touch with fiorina about correcting details on an eventbrite website for the event  that employee then decided to reach out directly to taylor manson  a super pac employee  who coincidentally  was also listed as a person of contact on the eventbrite page  the lines of campaign coordinating are being blurred more and more  i have a few questions about the location  what is the address of the building  where should people park  is there handicap parking available  do y all plan on putting something out to your students to let them know she ll be there  it didn t take long for manson to receive an advance walkthrough of the event location  while some might claim that it was the university that acted inappropriately  larry noble  a former fec counsel who works for the nonpartisan campaign legal center  says this is evidence that proves that the law has been broken  it s known as an  in kind contribution   and super pacs are prohibited from doing so  this fits the larger narrative that the super pac is basically running the campaign s events  the whole thing frankly makes a mockery of the law  when the super pac gets there  they hand out flyers  collect voter information  everything campaigns are known for  and   wealthy donors can finance all of it since they can make unlimited contributions to a super pac but only a few thousand dollars directly to a candidate that s not the only instance though that will plague carly s campaign going forward  an event at george tech last month also appears to be entirely organized by her super pac  as well  according to emails provided to ibt by the university reps for carly for america have repeatedly stated in the past that the group hasn t coordinated with fiorina s campaign  but this new information shows otherwise  at the very least  a formal investigation needs to be launched to verify these new allegations  it should be interesting to watch how the republican party responds to an email scandal that affects their own party  especially when campaign finance laws are being broken  double standard  perhaps featured image via facebook
