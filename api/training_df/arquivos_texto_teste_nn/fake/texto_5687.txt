ted cruz  who chairs the senate judiciary subcommittee on oversight  agency action  federal rights and federal courts  is holding a hearing on radical islam  this isn t just any hearing on radical islam  though  it s specifically investigating why president obama won t use the term  radical islamic terrorism  when he s talking about radical islamic terrorism seriously ted cruz  a united states senator  is using congressional resources  and taking up congressional time  to investigate words we wish we were making this up the hearing s goal is to amp up his message that obama s refusal to use those specific words has weakened our national security  and the primary accusation is that obama has been scrubbing the words  radical islamic terrorism  from public records in order  to pretend the threat doesn t exist  there is a metric ton of right wing news sites and blogs that pushed a conspiracy theory that obama censored references to radical islam from a video of a meeting with french president francois hollande  just after the paris attacks last year  it turns out there was a technical glitch with the recording equipment that dropped the audio at that point in the meeting  as soon as the white house became aware of the problem  they published an updated video with complete audio ted cruz  being the unintelligent  irrational individual we know him to be  would rather waste his subcommittee s time and taxpayer dollars on vapid conspiracy nonsense if it means taking obama down  the truth is that obama won t use those specific words because he s trying to isolate isis  and terrorists  from the broader islamic world  he s said  e are not at war with islam  we are at war with people who have perverted islam  that is the cold  naked truth that the cowering right won t accept  george w  bush said the same thing many times throughout his presidency  here s one example from   not too long after sept    this great nation of many religions understands  our war is not against islam  or against faith practiced by the muslim people  our war is a war against evil   ted cruz  whose brain is the size of a peanut  won t acknowledge that though  because reasons  others  however  will try to force him to acknowledge it  sen  dick durbin  d il  did that  saying at the hearing  i have plenty of disagreements with president george w  bush  but i still marvel that after all we went through   there s a serious problem when a democrat can make george w  bush actually look like a good president  these usurpers of american patriotism not only excel at ignoring pesky things like that  but they also excel at just plain looking foolish  cruz even had a witness there that went so far as to accuse reps  keith ellison  d mn  and andre carson  d in  of having ties to the muslim brotherhood  simply because they attended a muslim event once  ellison and carson are the only two muslims serving in congress what can we expect from the man who appointed noted islamophobe frank gaffney  of all people  to his presidential campaign team as a national security adviser  though  gaffney thinks that grover norquist is a secret muslim  it s hard to take anything he says or does any more seriously than we take the word vomit that spews forth from donald trump s mouth bottom line  cruz is pursuing a vendetta of some type against obama  either that  or he s desperate to cement his legacy as one of the best senators we ve ever seen before obama leaves office  he s only cementing his legacy as an out of control loon who complains about big government and wasted money  but has no problem using the government and wasting money to pursue fluff featured image by win mcnamee getty images
