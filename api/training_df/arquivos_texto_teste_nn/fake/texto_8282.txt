five time draft deferment donald trump tried to buy the love of american soldiers so he could use them at his rally  and it went about as well as one might expect it s obvious why donald trump would want to appear as if he had the troops on his side  he s spent much of his campaign insulting them  whether it was implying that pows were  losers  or mistakenly featuring the servicemen of other countries  including nazis and russian soldiers  in his political ads  it s clear that trump has only a surface deep appreciation of all the sacrifices america s military has made needless to say  his pandering in the face of his reprehensible actions didn t go over well  in a bombshell exclusive by the daily beast s tim mak  trump was exposed as having tried to bribe a veterans charity  to be his political prop  for a promise of    on friday  liberty house executive director keith howard received a call from a trump campaign staffer  who conveyed that trump would like to publicly present them with a six figure check at a londonderry rally on monday  right before the granite state primary it s an enormous amount of money for a small charity  but howard said he wouldn t do it risking the entire  substantial donation on a point of principle howard was right to question trump s donation  apart from being manipulated by the republican front runner to serve his agenda  the charity would have probably lost its  nonprofit  status by appearing at a trump rally  after trump s convoy pulled out and headed towards their next rally  the charity would have been left with a sizable check but without legal standing  not that trump seemed to care what would happen if the group actually accepted his bribe even worse  trump was running this bribe through his  donald j  trump foundation  which  as mak notes  is very likely considered an illegal campaign contribution to himself the campaign utilizing the foundation to help support and promote campaign events is a potential legal problem for both the campaign and the trump foundation   said larry noble  general counsel at the campaign legal center the value of the work the foundation did to assist the campaign event could be considered an illegal campaign contribution  and the foundation is barred from getting involved in political activity  such as supporting a campaign rally  he continued   neither the foundation nor other charities should be working hand in hand with the campaign to promote trump s campaign events  which is exactly what trump s charity is doing  it hasn t escaped the attention of some in the media when will republican congress have hearing on  realdonaldtrump foundation violating irs charity rule last night  https   t co   lawrence o donnell   lawrence  january     howard later called trump s campaign and told them that if they were serious about helping veterans  they wouldn t mind giving him the contribution behind closed doors and not  say  at a giant political rally  this of course would defeat the whole purpose for trump  what good is charity if you can t brag about it to pander to voters  for days  trump s campaign signaled that they were very disappointed that the veteran s group wouldn t help trump look good   but finally  sensing a losing battle  they relented  howard got his money  but on his terms so much for trump being an expert  deal maker   as he just got played by a small charity to the tune of    featured image via gage skidmore flickr
