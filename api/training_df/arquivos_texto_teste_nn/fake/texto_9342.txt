earlier today  president trump tweeted   we should have a contest as to which of the networks  plus cnn and not including fox  is the most dishonest  corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president  me   they are all bad  winner to receive the fake news trophy  not only is his latest tweet hilarious  but it speaks to the millions of trump supporters who are sick and tired of watching  fakenews networks like cnn  msnbc  abc  cbs  nbc  and pbs spew their vile  leftist propaganda  these over paid activists  who are posing as hosts of  news  shows  are so consumed with hate  that they don t even try to hide their embarrassingly biased coverage of our president we should have a contest as to which of the networks  plus cnn and not including fox  is the most dishonest  corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president  me   they are all bad  winner to receive the fake news trophy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    president trump correct when he says the media has treated him unfairly  well  an interesting study from the far left leaning harvard university  provided stunning evidence that proves president trump is   correct   chicago tribune  harvard university s shorenstein center on media  politics and public policy has come out with a study of media coverage of the trump white house in its first  days it is astonishing because it comes from harvard  not exactly the bedrock of american conservatism the study found that in trump s first  days in office  the tone of the news coverage of the president has been a whopping  percent negative to  percent positive so what does fair and balanced really mean  anyway  it confirms what most people understand   said tom bevan  publisher and co founder of realclearpolitics  one of the go to websites for media and political junkies bevan spoke as a guest on  the chicago way  podcast that i co host with wgn am radio producer jeff carlin  the response will be that trump is deserving of this kind of coverage because he s conducted himself inappropriately  and these are self inflicted wounds  and the press is doing nothing but covering him and his actions  but that s a little bit disingenuous   bevan said so how was president obama covered in his first  days  with a   positive to negative ratio  according to the harvard study  that s a significant shift  a significant difference   says bevan   i think this is reflective of the fact that the media does root from the press box and they do cheer for certain personalities and they do cheer against others  i have my own memory of the media s tone after obama took office  it wasn t merely positive  it was adoring  gushy  in the way a small child looks up to a beloved parent  or a dog to the master who gives it biscuits it was as if the media were hugging a magical unicorn  obama wasn t only given the benefit of the doubt  he was handed the nobel peace prize though he hadn t done anything to earn it  and critics were trashed as nothing but racists obama controversies  from his administration s gun running scandal in the  fast and furious  debacle to using the internal revenue service as a weapon against conservative groups  were covered  somewhat  but generally  the tone was muted  respectful  nothing like it was for trump or the clintons later  in hillary clinton s failed  campaign  leaks of democratic national committee email   whether hacked by the russians or not   demonstrated collusion between journalists and democrats  but that cozy relationship has never properly been addressed  and that avoidance undermines the credibility of journalism as the media challenges trump  because of the way the press covered obama  they lost so much credibility   bevan said   and because they did not take these things seriously  the irs scandal  fast and furious  you could go down the list of where they turned the other cheek    and now where they re giving trump the third degree on everything  that makes the contrast all that much greater  so you have a certain segment of the public  the people who voted for trump  who literally do not trust what the media says  and the divide between rigidly defined political tribes  one courted by the media  the other dismissed by it  grows even wider  it s not good for journalism  and it s not good for the country   said bevan
