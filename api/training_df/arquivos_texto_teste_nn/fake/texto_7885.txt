just when you thought republicans couldn t get any worse  they go and endorse something kanye west says  and not just any republican  mind you  speaker of the house paul ryan  r wi   you know  the man third in line to run the nation now  this ordinarily wouldn t be such a big deal  and we could just look at it as a politician trying to be cool by retweeting something a celebrity says  but this time around  the implications surrounding the quoted retweet are kind of huge here s the thing  republicans love to boast that they re all about  freedom  and  fiscal conservativism   but we all know that s a load of horse shit  the only  freedom  republicans want is the freedom to screw people over  whether it be by funneling middle class dollars to the top  or by using religion as an excuse to discriminate  no matter how you look at it  the only freedom republicans want  is the freedom to be assholes so  when west tweets out  what is your definition of freedom  there is no true freedom without economic freedom   and watching the person third in line to the presidency tweet it out as a  good point   it really leaves most sane people scratching their heads  via twitterfirst of all  neither kanye west nor paul ryan and his republican pals are good with money  west is currently begging for   billion from mark zuckerberg to help pay down his monstrous debt and fund his ideas  and republicans think they can lower the deficit by bringing in less revenue and spending more or wars and defense  both can scream about  economic freedom  til they pass out  but they are the last people in the world to be boasting it  neither are good with money looking at this from a broader lens  though  these two may be the perfect pair after all  since they are seemingly so similar  both are braggadocios  both are bad with money  both think they re shit doesn t stink  both are extremely difficult to work with  so  maybe it s not so odd that paul ryan retweeted him  but rather what should be considered odd is that paul ryan is thought of as capable to be speaker of the house hopefully this isn t the beginning of kanye s  run for the white house featured image  flickr wikimedia
