when sarah palin blamed president obama for her son s domestic violence charges pretty much everyone slammed her for it  including the veterans she referred to in her rant against the commander in chief  it s not only utterly inaccurate to blame obama for the actions of her son  but it s actual pretty petty and a definitely a cheap jab at the expense of both the president and veterans one person who has never held back from roasting sarah palin is real time host bill maher  on friday s edition of his show  he and his guests discussed track palin as well as his mother s lame defense of him  basically  maher pointed out that she shifted blame from herself and her obvious horrific parenting skills  after all  she has one daughter with two different baby daddies  and a son who has a history of violent outbursts and run ins with the law maher spoke directly about palin s ridiculous defense of her son  and also discussed the way she s trying to somehow insinuated post traumatic stress disorder was the cause of all her son s problems  he stated   just glossed over that  like  we accept that now  we send our sons off to stupid wars and they come back a bit different  because he beat up his girlfriend  was talking suicide  and she blamed that on obama  that s why i m sure his girlfriend was cowering under the bed   because of obama  her daughter has had two out of wedlock children  i mean  does it ever occur to anybody that the obamas are just so much better parents  and the obama s most certainly are  one look at the obama girls and they are pretty much the embodiment of the near perfection  the obamas keep those girls in check  and they are definitely well behaved maher also pointed out that it probably won t matter what palin says or does  because when it comes to the folks who actually find her as qualified to hold a valid opinion  they basically just look at religion  she s the worst  it s the most morally sloppy person going to iowa to convince the evangelicals   the supposedly moral people   to vote  that s why faith sucks so bad  because when you have the same faith as me  then whatever you do is off the table  right  here s the thing  if palin s son does suffer from ptsd  she definitely has the resources to get him help  ptsd also shouldn t be used as a political chew toy to throw around and take jabs at a sitting president because you have nothing else constructive to say  palin was trying to shift blame from her son and herself to that of the president and the war  it s not just wrong  it s kind of sad video featured image  youtube
