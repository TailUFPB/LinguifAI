the supreme court just decided that no  not everyone should have access to firearms  upholding the federal law that if you are a domestic abuser  you should not be able to possess a gun  seems like a no brainer  but if you re a domestic abuser  you ve already proven yourself to not have much cognitive ability the case in question was about a maine resident who was mad he lost his right to possess a firearm  according to cnn  stephen voisine pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge in  against a girlfriend  five years later  he was investigated for shooting a bald eagle and as part of the investigation he turned over a firearm to authorities  seems like a real winner  oh  and a bald eagle  really  and he thinks he should be able to own a gun well  guess what  mr  voisine  and all you other domestic abusers out there  you don t get to own a gun justice elena kagan read the opinion of the court  federal law prohibits any person convicted of a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence  from possessing a firearm  that phrase is defined to include any misdemeanor committed against a domestic relation that necessarily involves the  use       of physical force   the question presented here is whether misdemeanor assault convictions for reckless  as contrasted to knowing or intentional  conduct trigger the statutory firearms ban  we hold that they do  kagan then cited the gun law that was enacted by congress two decades ago  congress enacted some  years ago to  close  dangerous loophole  in the gun control laws  united states v  castleman  an existing provision already barred convicted felons from possessing firearms  but many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies  notwithstanding the harmfulness of their conduct  and  irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination   accordingly  congress added to prohibit any person convicted of a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence  from possessing any gun or ammunition with a connection to interstate commerce  guns and domestic violence are an incredibly lethal combination  kudos to the court for stepping up and doing the right thing  not every tom  dick or sally just deserves to have a gun just because of the second amendment  the amendment was written to arm standing state militias  that were to be trained and utilized by the federal government  it s pretty clear if you read the entire constitution  especially article  section   and not just the amendment added to arm the aforementioned militias hopefully this is just the beginning of the supreme court waking up and realizing guns are lethal and should be better regulated the whole way around  maybe congress can take a few notes featured photo by scott olson getty image
