john mccain really doesn t care what topic reporters ask him about  he only cares how president trump feels about it  so he can take an opposing view   if president trump agrees with a social or political issue  mccain disagrees with it  if trump disagrees  mccain thinks it s a great idea the cantankerous john mccain has become so predictable  it s almost laughable to hear his opinions anymore   he s become an embarrassment to the republican party but refuses to give up the r behind his name to save the party of the humiliation of his antics mccain s latest embarrassing interview happened today when tmz caught up with him to ask him his thoughts on the nfl players taking a knee in a show of disrespect for our flag  as a way to support the anti cop black lives matter movement   instead of standing up our flag  or for his fellow veterans and the country he once fought so valiantly for  mccain took the cowardly way out and made a statement supporting the nfl player s right to disrespect our flag  not surprisingly  mccain s remarks stood in contrast to strong admonition president trump had for the disrespectful athletes in the nfl watch
