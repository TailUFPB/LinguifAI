on wednesday  the democratic party staged a powerful sit in to protest congress  inaction on gun safety proposals after the tragic mass shooting in orlando last week  the sit in was organized by rep  john lewis  d ga  and received the support and recognition from president barack obama as well as americans all over the country who understand that the united states must become a safer place and that we can no longer allow innocent people to die as a result of senseless gun violence and relaxed gun laws during the sit in  rep  jim mcdermott took it upon himself to mock one of the gop s most prominent leaders  house speaker paul ryan  r wi   many gopers had decided to go to lunch instead of vote on gun control measures  so the democrats decided to have a little fun it just so happened that the sit in occurred on the very same day that ryan was going to introduce his republican alternative to obamacare  and mcdermott was reveling in the fact that the sit in had probably ruined ryan s day  mcdermott told his fellow dems  you threw a bomb under the door of his rolling out this health care bill  so if you re wondering where he is  he s up in his office crying  i mean  he had this thing all set  he had it all ready to go and we did this to him  you think you think there won t be payback  you don t know the irish  you can watch mcdermott slam ryan in the footage below  which was posted to facebook by mcdermott s colleague beto o rourke  d tx  sadly  mcdermott s insults toward paul ryan might have been the only tiny piece of justice the many gun violence victims and their families would get on wednesday  considering the fact that republicans  care more about their second amendment rights than protecting innocent american citizens  we commend all of the democratic politicians who participated in the sit in  and all who spoke out against the gop featured image via mark wilson   getty images
