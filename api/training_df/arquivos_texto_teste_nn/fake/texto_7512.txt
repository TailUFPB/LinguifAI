one of the greatest strategies to gain and hold power over a large population is to pit groups against one another  divide and conquer  it s a strategy that has been used since the beginning of time as the wealthy elites  knowing they are few in numbers  but large in political sway  can manipulate a populace to their liking so that they remain in power  it s a strategy still being used to this very day  and can be seen in full swing within the donald trump campaign donald trump has been using this us vs  them strategy since the start of his campaign  he s made a group of working and middle class blue collar folks think that the problems in this nation stem from  the other   the people who aren t just like them  that if those people weren t around  all of their problems would disappear  it s a mind game played by the wealthy and powerful to make groups of people do their bidding for them this strategy is especially successful when dealing with a group of people who somehow sees themselves as better than another group  and in the video you re about to watch below  author and activist tim wise explains this strategy perfectly  he points out that this has been a strategy used on working class whites  especially in the south for as long as one could possibly remember  the wealthy purchased black slaves  stopped hiring the poor working class white workers because they would need to get paid  and then blamed the problems of the poor working class white workers  including lack of jobs or income  on the black slaves  however  whose fault is it  certainly not the slaves  however  this skillful manipulation to make it so black slaves would get blamed got the poor working class whites to utterly despise black people  it got them to join militias to suppress slave insurrections  it was the ultimate scam  divide and conquer  wise also explains that the civil war was about states rights  sure  the rights for individuals in states to own slaves trump is using this same strategy blaming mexicans and muslims to rile up a base of poorly educated working class white folks who really just don t know any better  they ve had a rough go in life and trump is successfully shifting blame from those on top who manipulate the system to  the other  yet again  he s giving these working class angry white people a reason to feel superior even though they are totally being manipulated  it gives them a sense of power and entitlement that is  in all honesty  a ruse it s the ultimate in white privilege  when you can get people to believe that they are superior and deserve better and more just for being white  and if something is bad  blame the people who aren t white  or aren t christian  or aren t heterosexual  or aren t republican tim wise  even recently  posted about how donald trump his encouraging hatred  he said in a facebook post  regarding a story of a man who killed three people for not speaking english  this is the fault of nativist bigots like donald trump  encouraging hatred for anyone seen as insufficiently  american   even someone who  as with one of these victims  was puerto rican and thus an american citizen   something probably neither the killer here nor trump knows   this is the kind of america we re in store for  on a much larger level  if the trump movement is not defeated resoundingly quite honestly  you can watch this video ten times in a row and still want to watch it again  wise hits the nail on the head  bravo          if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt tim wise schools audience on white privilegedtim wise schools audience on white privilegedposted by reggie hood on friday  september    image via max goldberg  flickr
