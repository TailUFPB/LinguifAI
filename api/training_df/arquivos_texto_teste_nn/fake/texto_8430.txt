on january   the family of lavoy finicum released a three page statement questioning the fbi s narrative of his death  while there s no doubt finicum s family would like to remember him as a  hero  and a  martyr   the difference between what actually happened and the fantasy filled version of events outlined in the statement is both sad and scary lavoy finicum was a member of an armed group of militants who seized control of malheur national wildlife refuge in harney county  oregon earlier this month on january   more than three weeks after the group first seized control of the federal property  authorities apprehended seven of the militiamen  finicum was shot by fbi agents after he reached for a weapon  while attempting to escape arrest video of the shooting  taken from a helicopter which hoovered above the scene  was released by the fbi a short time after finicum was shot the video evidence destroys the narrative being pressed by right wing extremists  who claimed finicum was  gunned down in cold blood  while on his knees  with his hands in the air  thanks to the oregonian  we can see exactly what happened in the moments leading up to lavoy finicum s death the video below shows the crucial moments from the fbi s footage slowed down and magnified  there is no doubt that finicum went for a gun finicum s single  moment in the sun  came earlier this month  when he was interviewed by msnbc s tony dokoupil at the malheur refuge during the interview  an armed finicum told dokoupil that he had no intention of allowing authorities to arrest him  watch the interview here in spite of an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary  the three page statement released by the family of lavoy finicum attempts to portray finicum as an innocent victim of the evil government  they blame everyone except the criminals   from the fbi to oregon governor kate brown   for finicum s death the family claims that authorities were  not patient enough  with the militants  that s in spite of the fact that the armed group was allowed to remain at the refuge  unimpeded  for nearly a month  over that time period  they were given warning after warning  and provided with every opportunity to leave  they continued to break the law and threaten the community the statement also claims that a  peaceful solution was in the works  the first observation is that from what we understand  the occupation was on track toward a peaceful resolution  lavoy and those he was with were en route to a public meeting in an adjoining county when they were stopped in something far different than a routine traffic stop   as has been portrayed by the media  unfortunately  the powers that be were not interested in being patient enough for the occupation to come to a peaceful end  again  the truth contradicts this statement in this video  posted to his own youtube account on january   finicum assured his followers that the group was not  getting ready to capitulate   he went on to say  rest assured  we are not getting ready to leave   and  for those of you who are worried that we are about ready to negotiate with the fbi  that is not the case  that is not going to happen  the militants were also not on their way to any ordinary public meeting when they were apprehended by the fbi  they were on their way to hold a secretive mock trial of public officials  known within the sovereign citizens movement as a citizen s grand jury  in other words  the threat the group presented to the residents of harney county was escalating  not  being resolved  as the statement claims but of all the fantasy based ideas presented in the letter  the one that stands out the most is this  the fbi claims that lavoy had a loaded firearm in an inside pocket of his coat  after re reviewing the extended video  at this point we are not accepting at face value the fbi s statement that lavoy was actually armed  at no point during the group s occupation of the federal wildlife refuge was lavoy finicum not armed he holstered a   caliber pistol to his side and slept with a shotgun on his lap we know from his own public statements that he had no intention of being arrested alive while finicum s family is undoubtedly grieving his loss  the facts remain unchanged  the man was neither a martyr  a hero nor an innocent victim  he was not killed in cold blood by the fbi here s the family s statement  via fox  finicum family statement    featured image credit  video screen capture lavoy finicum on youtube
