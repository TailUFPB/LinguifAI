nobody can accuse king cheeto  a k a  donald trump  of being classy  even as he expects a classiness from his rivals that he ll never possess  at a rally in colorado springs  he bitched and moaned about hillary s speech  especially how she didn t congratulate him  her worthy opponent  for being so amazingly worthy seriously  we wish we were making this up  unfortunately  with trump  stories that sound like they should be from the onion are actually true  i was curious to see whether she would do a class act and not mention my name or mention it with respect i would like to congratulate my republican opponent for having something that nobody has ever done in the history of politics in this nation  and i would like to congratulate my opponent for having gotten more votes than anybody in the history of the republican party in the primary season  really  did he congratulate her for making history as well  as the first woman to secure the nomination of a major political party  no  at least  not anywhere we can find it  he went on a twitter rant against her instead  accusing her of having terrible judgment  creating isis  and continuing to call her  crooked hillary  and he expects her to congratulate him  please hillary instead told the world that  a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons   and gave us this warning   don t believe anyone who says  i alone can fix it    she also said other things about trump that he no doubt thinks are completely inappropriate  as if to emphasize his bruised little feelings on her lack of accolades blown in his direction  he also said  i thought she might do something like that  i thought she d give me a big  fat  beautiful congratulations  if she did that  wouldn t that be cool  wouldn t that be great  she s a woman and she owes him at least that much  apparently  it s more than he d ever give her  but then again  he s the king of the planet  or his planet  anyway  we must all pay homage to him  and someday  we ll all be able to fly all the way to mars by flapping our arms  too  featured image by joshua lott getty images
