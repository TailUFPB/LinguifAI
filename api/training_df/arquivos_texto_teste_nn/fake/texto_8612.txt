a colorado public school is facing the wrath of parents after they received an email urging them to bring their daughters to an event designed to turn them into pure christian wives who submit to their husbands mesa valley school district  sent an email to parents promoting an event called  wake up sleeping beauty  worship at his feet   and includes a bible verse from luke   which seems to tell women and girls as young as  years old to submit to their husbands  the event also aims to train girls to remain pure until they find a husband  in other words  indoctrinate them from a young age to hold strict religious views on sex  marriage  and gender roles  as she stood behind him at his feet weeping  she began to wet his feet with her tears  then she wiped them with her hair  kissed them and poured perfume on them  a video posted on wake up sleeping beauty facebook page suggests that fathers keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they remain virgins until marriage  and features a creepy image of a father watching his daughter put on makeup a girl then praises the event  especially going through the time that i was  being cheated on  that was really hard for me but it also made me realize a lot that i needed to forgive him and he didn t have the qualities i was looking for in a husband  the image of a woman crying at a man s feet before wiping the tears dry with her hair was of particular concern to one parent  the idea of a woman or girl crying at a man s feet  then using her hair to wash his feet  then kissing his feet  seems pretty demeaning to me  apparently the irony of this imagery used to promote an event which purports to strengthen or support girls women is lost on all involved  here s the video via youtube indeed  it s also a violation of the constitutional tenet of separation of church and state  because school officials used the district mailing system to promote a religious event but district  communications specialist jeannie smith made a bullshit claim about the email not being religious at all  having reviewed the flyer and khb r per your request  we do not find that the flyer promotes a religious organization or demeans a person or group on the basis of gender   she wrote in an email to an angry parent but the flyer did actually promote a religious event and a religious organization  the program is put on by wake up ministries  which is a religious organization so  mesa valley school district  flat out lied to parents schools are supposed to protect our kids from religious organizations  but mesa valley school officials allowed their own email system to be hijacked for religious purpose in an effort to indoctrinate young girls to their beliefs  it s outrageous and sickening  someone needs to lose their job for this  at the very least  an independent investigation needs to be waged female students already have to put up with enough sexist bullshit from school officials as it is  particularly from unfair dress codes that blame teen girls for how boys act around them  the last thing they need is a school that shoves religion down their throats featured image  pixabay
