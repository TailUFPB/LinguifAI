cancer can take a lot out of a person  especially once treatments begin  lelania chapman was hiking through the woods after seven months of cancer treatments when she stumbled upon four teenage boys who were stranded on a cliff  i ve never been in a situation like that before and you never know what you are going to be like   chapman  who had stayed home during the bulk of her treatments  told today   no matter what  you are a lot stronger than you think you are  for the bulk of her treatments  this amazing woman stayed home  only leaving to go to the doctor  but after her final treatment  she took her  year old son and three neighborhood children on a waterfall hike near her home outside of vancouver  canada   despite receiving bad news from doctors that more tumors had appeared and her cancer had spread  instead of focusing on the negatives she not only was able to show her son and the other children a good time  but she became an unlikely hero when an  year old girl in her group thought she heard someone shouting  chapman didn t hear it at first  but after investigating they found the teens trapped on a rock by the falls  their lips purple from the cold chapman tried to call for help  but there was no cellular service  she started to walk back to her truck to attempt to get service but she heard one of the boys cry  i just want my mom   deciding that she couldn t leave them there and despite being weakened from months of cancer treatments  chapman leaped into action  some people say it s a mother s instinct   she told today  chapman grabbed a rope from her backpack and climbed down the ravine to get closer to the boys  they then tossed her a length of their own rope  which she tied to the biggest tree she could find  wrapped it around her waist  and tossed it back to the boys  the biggest of the teens  who stands about  feet tall and weighs about  pounds climbed up first to help rescue the others  despite her smaller frame due to losing weight from the cancer treatments  chapman  who had difficulty lifting a watermelon at this point  managed to pull him up  i don t know how i picked him up by myself   she said   i don t really know to this day   chapman bashed her knee and some of the radiation burns and scars from her treatment tore open from the strain  but the heroic mom gave into her  mama bear  instincts and pulled the boys up one by one  when only the smallest of the boys was left  she feared her rope might break  but chapman didn t give up  she laid on her belly and talked to the final teen  who told her he was just going to jump  i told him it wasn t a good idea and if he jumped  i would have to jump  and he just really needed to trust me   she said  ultimately  the team was able to pull him up  she walked with the teens to the parking lot  where she called their mothers as chapman made dinner later  a  year old girl from her group said something incredibly inspirational  yep  that s just what we do  we fight cancer and save boys  this experience has greatly impacted her son  gwindin  though chapman has a long battle ahead of her  gwindin is no longer scared  he said  you know what  mom  you are going to  cancer because you are the strongest mom around    she said   that is probably one of the most important lessons that i learned that day  i do have the strength  here are some photos of chapman proving that a mother s ability to transform into an almost superhuman protector is not at all a myth   a gofundme page set up to help pay for expenses related to chapman s future cancer treatments has raised half of its    goal  if you have some spare loot  help her out featured image via today
