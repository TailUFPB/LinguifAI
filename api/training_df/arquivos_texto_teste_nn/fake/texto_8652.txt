on tuesday  president obama s veto pen  got some exercise when he dashed republicans  hopes of gutting clean water rules   a curious mission  given the fact that republicans in michigan literally murdered  people and poisoned hundreds of kids with the state s disgusting water supply  water their governor assured them was safe to drink the resolution  introduced by hog castrating waste of flesh joni ernst  had one goal  to block the epa s enforcement of the clean water rule and to prevent similar measures from being taken to protect our nation s water in the future  fortunately  president obama stepped up to kill the gop s dream of unregulated waterways teeming with dangerous bacteria and other nasty stuff  in his veto message  the president explained i am returning herewith without my approval s j  res    a resolution that would nullify a rule issued by the environmental protection agency and the department of the army to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the clean water act  the rule  which is a product of extensive public involvement and years of work  is critical to our efforts to protect the nation s waters and keep them clean  is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the congress  industry  and community stakeholders  and is consistent with decisions of the united states supreme court we must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our communities and the success of our businesses  agriculture  and energy development  as i have noted before  too many of our waters have been left vulnerable  pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers  lakes  reservoirs  and coastal waters near which most americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water  recreation  and economic development  clarifying the scope of the clean water act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health  because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water  i cannot support it  i am therefore vetoing this resolution republicans attempted to use a rarely invoked law known as the congressional review act to overturn the rule  but the president s veto ended all that  as they lack the votes to overturn the president s decision  ernst says that she intends to find other ways to curtail the epa s ability to regulate our waterways  we all want clean water   ernst said in a statement following the veto  this rule is not about clean water  rather  it is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land  this is exactly why we need to vote blue in november   do you think a republican president would have protected america s water featured image via white house
