right wing pundits on fox and friends this week went on a little tirade about the rules of twitter and how unfair they are to conservatives  host clayton morris joined national review writer katherine timf in shredding twitter s  abusive behavior policy   designed to keep people from bullying others on the internet  the problem the conservatives have with the rule isn t that you could be suspended or banned from twitter for a few malicious reports   it s that there isn t enough distinction between them and isis terrorists yes  really  conservatives are concerned that because the policy doesn t specifically mention isis that a bunch of other extremist loudmouths with violent agendas and histories may be targeted and removed from twitter  they don t argue the point at all from the perspective that there s no reason to compare right wing american  patriots  to terrorists because to suggest such a thing would be as ludicrous as any claim ever made about anything  ever right wingers are brash  crass  low information degenerates  occasionally you come across a right winger with an intelligence level worthy of a game of connect four  but nothing you d consider the upper middle class to wealthy american they vote to please  they are led by their puppet masters on missions to free the world from the tyrannical rule of barack obama  the evils of islam and atheism  and plain red christmas cups  they have no argument because the facts the party that rules them feeds them are fabrications and fear tactics if right wingers don t like the fact that they have an extremist problem and that their own kind become radicalized and commit unimaginable acts of terror  they should do something about their own message  you can t have people running around vowing to die for their country when their country needs them to just stay home and count their rounds of ammo nobody wants that kind of person near them  which extends to our online persona  when a right winger takes to social media and promises some  libtard   grains of chris kyle like justice  they ve just broken the rules and committed a crime  all at the same time they shouldn t be kicked off of twitter why  enough of those people together in groups become what terrorist organizations call  cells   here in america  we call them  militias   twitter is said to have deleted   accounts associated with isis  right wingers should be happy they aren t just denied access on general principle watch fox and cronies bash twitter for having rules about being decent human beings below featured image via liberalplanet com
