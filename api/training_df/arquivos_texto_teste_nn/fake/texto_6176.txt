how does the saying go  if we don t learn from history we re bound to repeat it  well  listening to donald trump s latest remarks the american people need to take a look back at their history books to realize what he may actually be saying  because it s outright terrifying we already know that white supremacists across the country are beyond excited for the possibility of a trump presidency  mainly because of his outright and unapologetic racism  now  he s just uttered something that should send shivers down all of our spines  unfortunately  most won t even notice what he s saying and it will sound appealing to them trump said  five   years from now   different party  you re going to have a worker s party  he said this with the following explanation  which will appeal to many  many voters  because in all honesty it s true  a party of people that haven t had a real wage increase in  years  that are angry  but here s the thing  using the language of  worker s party  is very reminiscent of another  workers  party  and would also fit with trump s general theme of his very racist and seemingly fascist campaign remembering history  let s recall the  national socialist german workers  party  otherwise known as the nazi party now  is trump willfully using this language without thinking about its history  possibly  should someone tell him that using this language is terrifying  definitely anyway you look at it  though  it fits with the general theme of trump s campaign narrative of excessive propaganda  slander  hatred  bigotry  and stifling of  the other   so  to hear him now say that the gop will become a  worker s party  is absolutely nauseating  and everyone should take heed donald trump is willing to say anything  not caring if he flip flops  to gain votes to get into power  he hasn t been able to solidify one thing that he s talked about except for the fact that he wants to be president  he  quite literally  has absolutely no qualifying experience to be commander in chief  with no policy experience  foreign or domestic  whatsoever wake up  america and realize a vote for trump is a vote against not only the best interest of the nation  or for that matter  the world  but also yourselves  the writing is on the wall  his use of language should terrify us all  let s not repeat history featured photo by spencer platt getty images
