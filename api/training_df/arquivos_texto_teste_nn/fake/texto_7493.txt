once again  the police demonstrate just how absolutely justified people of color are in not trusting them  after the violence and chaos that erupted and eventually resulted in the cancellation of a donald trump rally in chicago  illinois on friday night  some extremely vulgar and racist language was used between police officers just hours later over their dispatch radios  very clearly  on the tape that has been circulating on social media  the phrases typical f ing n s  and black lives matter  my a  are spat maliciously by two of chicago s finest  the disturbing words were uttered over the feeds from the far south side and morgan park areas   both of which are populated mostly by african americans here is a description of the vile exchange  via new york daily news the roughly   a m  exchange started with a dispatcher joking with a police officer that it was  too early to be bothering you   they said a friendly good morning to each other another cop asked   how many boyfriends do you have  the dispatcher replied with a joke   why you all in my kool aid  why you over here  another voice said   you can answer that again   and a muffled voice said something that sounded like   you got busted over the air again  two seconds later  a man s voice said   typical f ing n s  a police officer asked the dispatcher to  find out what radio that comment came from  and she said she couldn t track its location but had alerted her boss a few indecipherable noises followed before another voice said the ethnic slur again  black lives matter  my a   f ing n s   the voice said  the minute long recording then ended you can listen here now  of course  the chicago police department is in full on damage control mode  they have reduced this extreme racism to inappropriate transmission on a police frequency  and released the following statement  the statements made are absolutely unacceptable and superintendent  escalante has ordered an immediate internal affairs investigation into this incident   cpd officials said   should the investigation reveal that a member of the police department made the statements  he will be immediately suspended and disciplinary proceedings will be launched  considering that it was over police dispatch  it is highly unlikely that anyone but a chicago police officer or someone else who has access to that feed in such a position said it  further  forget suspended   fire these people once they are identified  they obviously cannot police neighborhoods for people of color in a fair and unbiased way  don t we have enough issues with police racism  don t we have enough racist cops using their position to literally murder people of color  shame on you  chicago pd  if you allow these racists to keep their jobs  then again  with the way things usually go in these cases  i won t be surprised if nobody is disciplined at all  let alone fired as they should be featured image via wikimedia commons
