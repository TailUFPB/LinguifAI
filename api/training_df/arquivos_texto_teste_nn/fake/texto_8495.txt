if you thought the republican party was going to drop their planned parenthood witch hunt after the indictment of their criminal  whistleblowers  david daleiden and sandra merritt  you don t know the gop very well  honest people might back away from the fraudulent baby parts videos and admit they d been had  but we all know that the right wing teapublican lawmakers aren t the brightest  nor most ethical  crayons in the box  instead of dropping their investigation  lawmakers have decided to keep wasting your tax dollars   all while claiming the country is broke according to the huffington post  rep  marsha blackburn  r tenn   released a letter in the wake of the indictment and assured her fellow pro fetusers that she would not give up the war against women  we will continue to gather information and get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts  these are issues of importance to the american people  we will study the laws on the books and follow the facts to defend life  what this is how great the chasm between reality and fiction is for these people  she knows that the videos have been debunked  and yet she continues to insist that the beloved women s health organization is selling baby parts  not even felony indictments can make her admit that her party was one hundred percent wrong and she s not the only one  rand paul  ted cruz  mike huckabee and a plethora of other republicans have all said that they support federal investigations into pp rep  brian babin  r texas  said he was  disappointed and shocked  by the grand jury s decision  he even went so far as to defend david daleiden for his illegal behavior  it s deeply offensive and ridiculous that those who illegally sell aborted human body parts get a pass   while these two pro life defenders are indicted for using aliases to expose planned parenthood s unlawful and disgusting practices of selling baby body parts  this decision begs the question  how else could they get the truth  the real question is  how much proof do republicans need before they stop attacking planned parenthood and women across the country  i guess that s stupid of me to ask  after all  how many benghazi hearings have we had perhaps the worst part of all of this is that they really don t care about decreasing the number of abortions in this country  if they did  they d support contraception and comprehensive sex education  if they were really  pro life  they d fully support things like wic  food stamps  free medical care and free education for all children  what it all really boils down to is that they loathe women and want to punish us in any way they possibly can   even if that means killing us by destroying a health care organization that provides critical care for millions of men too featured image via twitter
