when you try and fail at everything you do  try and try some more  right  that s how the saying goes  isn t it  no well  it looks as if failed half term governor of alaska  failed vice presidential nominee  failed fox news contributor  and failed reality star sarah palin is at it again  and this time around she s in talks for her own reality court show  yes  you read that correctly  clearly  juris doctor degree or any form of law experience be damned  palin is gonna tell it like it is  in whatever way the words come out of her mouth  to be deciphered later  according to people  the onetime vice presidential candidate has been tapped to preside over a new reality court show that would premiere next year  she signed a deal in february with montana based production company warm springs  a source close to the process tells people  it s a production deal   the source explains   what happens next is she ll meet with stations  make a pilot and sell it  warm springs first approached palin with the idea in  and has since put together a team that includes the tv executive who found judge judy and judge joe brown   warm springs production had this to say regarding the project  which apparently has been in the works since last year  palin s telegenic personality  wide appeal and common sense wisdom make her a natural for this kind of format and she was warm springs  top pick for this project  yes  you read that correctly  they said  common sense wisdom  and a  telegenic personality   because screeching incoherent ramblings is clearly what the people want  and who they d like deciding their fate in a courtroom if the show actually sells it would begin in the fall of   so  the good news would be if she got the show and trump were to become president  knocks on wood  she ll be held up in a contract that would make it impossible for her to be part of his cabinet  although  they d probably work something out  reality stars unite just when you thought things couldn t get weirder  this happens  god save us all featured image via flickr
