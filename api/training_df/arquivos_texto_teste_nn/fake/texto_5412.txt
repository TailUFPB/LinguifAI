you know what s even more stupid than blaming melania trump s plagiarism on my little pony  claiming that whites are the superior race  what s even worse than that  doing it again on monday  iowa rep  steve king replaced his dog whistle with a microphone and openly declared that whites are the superior race  responding to criticism that the republican national convention is filled with  loud  unhappy  dissatisfied white people  during an appearance on msnbc  king snapped  this whole business does get a little tired  i would ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about  where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization  than white people   chris hayes asked  than than western civilization itself that s rooted in western europe  eastern europe and the united states of america  and every place where christianity settled the world   king replied after realizing that he had actually uttered the words he was thinking   that s all of western civilization  on tuesday  king clarified his remarks  explaining that while whites are the superior race  people of other races have also made contributions to civilization  it s pretty close   what i really said was  western civilization  and when you describe western civilization that can mean much of western civilization happens to be caucasians  but we should not apologize for our culture or our civilization   king told abc news  the contributions that were made by western civilization itself  and by americans  by americans of all races stand far above the rest of the world  the western civilization and the american civilization are a superior culture  king says he was responding to  and correcting  political blogger charlie pierce but he s happy that he was able to start a dialogue about how awesome white people are  but what we have is people who are trying to parse something  to hyperventilate about that  i m ok if they do that because it starts the dialogue so we can open up more minds so people can think about what s right for america  so  there you have it  whites have contributed far more than other races  according to king  but he s now willing to admit that maybe others have done stuff too watch king s original remarks below featured image via getty images andrew burton
