last week  president obama made a historic trip to cuba and the right wing went absolutely insane  republicans were outraged that our president had the audacity to reestablish a relationship with the country more than fifty years after the cuban missile crisis  after the trip to cuba  the onion  a satire website  decided to post a fictional article about his trip home  but  in a hilarious turn of events  paranoid conservatives didn t get the joke and snopes actually had to debunk the article on march   the onion shared a doctored picture of air force one flying low with a bunch of people on its wings and the photo was captioned  hundreds of cuban refugees clinging to air force one on flight back to u s   the comment section under the article soon filled with people who thought it was real    i ve chosen not to blur out their names because the comments were all made in a public forum you ll notice that a lot of them blame obama for bringing more  illegals  into the country  well  apparently  the outrage didn t extend only to the onion s facebook page  people actually emailed snopes en masse asking the fact checker website if the picture was real this flood of emails forced snopes to actually debunk an article by the well known satire site  snopes gave an example of one of the emails the received there is a posting of a photograph with people on the wings of a plane and falling from the sky   hundreds of cubans clinging to wings of air force one on the way to the us  reference onion com i find this very hard to believe  i believe it was photoshopped we shall call them captain obvious when you read the comment section of the original article  you realize that donald trump s rise in the republican party makes a whole lot of sense  the people who thought cubans were actually clinging to the wings of air force one are probably the same people who think drumpf is a real smart man who is going to turn this country around  they suffer so greatly from obama derangement syndrome that they are falling for obvious satire  and as hilarious as it is  it s also really  really sad that our country is filled with this many stupid people featured image via screenshot
