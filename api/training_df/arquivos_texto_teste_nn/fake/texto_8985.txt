some of america s pretend patriots have taken over the federal building of a wildlife reserve in oregon  over the weekend as the internet and news organizations were abuzz with news of this outrageous and illegal activity  one entity was suspiciously and conspicuously missing from the equation  the federal government  yes  you read that right  at first  the government had absolutely no plans to take action against these people  why  because they are white christians  that really is it  look at how  in stark contrast  they treat black lives matter protesters  or think of how this situation would have played out if these people had been brown muslims instead well  finally  the government has decided to do its job  the federal bureau of investigation is now monitoring the situation with the malheur national wildlife refuge occupation by self proclaimed militia members and supposed defenders of the constitution  which they have clearly not read and understood  if they had  they would not be doing this at all the occupation is taking place in harney county  where the sheriff there  david  m  ward  has told his law abiding citizens to avoid the situation  while the militia members claim to be there defending local ranchers  ward says that the group s intent is something much more sinister  these men came to harney county claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers  when in reality these men had alternative motives  to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the united states  as per usual with such people  known anti government extremist jon ritzheimer has warned authorities that the group is armed  yes  there are some people that are armed  we need to defend our rights  that s what the second amendment is there for  people  senator ron wyden  d  oregon   who has been in touch with the local authorities on this ongoing situation  says that the fbi is definitely monitoring things  the fbi is on this every minute  but based on comments from what we ve heard in the community and what s been reported  we may be in just the early stages of this  indeed  these are right wing nuts  some of whom have already said that they are prepared to die here  they won t give up easily this is nothing more than bona fide domestic terrorism  arrest them  all of them  they really need to be made to realize that they are not above the law americans seem to be so worried about terrorism  well  we re growing it right here at home   and we aren t doing anything about it  and that s the problem featured image via video screen capture from raw story
