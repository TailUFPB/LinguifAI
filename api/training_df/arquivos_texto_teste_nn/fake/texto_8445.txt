mat staver  leader of the legal organization liberty counsel  has declared that gay people in america are imposing a  jizya  style tax on american christians  jizya refers to a tax levied on non muslim subjects living in a muslim land under islamic law since gay people have to date had zero successes in directly taxing only american christians  the context staver is trying to apply will need some explanation staver is trying to reclassify legal fines for  christians  violating anti discrimination laws as a tax on american christians for  living their life by their spiritual beliefs   a well known example of this is the case of sweet cakes by melissa  the bakery denied serving a same sex couple and ended up paying over    in state ordered damages and fines the line staver is trying to draw between these two issues is completely ridiculous  literally anybody who would deny service to a same sex couple or even a gay individual  simply because they re gay  would fall under these civil laws  they could be an atheist who just has an irrational hatred and fear of gay people  it also isn t a tax  because a tax is something you pay regularly regardless of bad behavior or lack thereof  these bigots only pay the penalty when they do something wrong liberty counsel has unsurprisingly been labeled a hate group by the southern poverty law center  due to the fact they devote most of their time to defending bigots and other forms of persecution by christians against americans  staver himself is a young earth creationist who believes that  intelligent design  should be taught in public schools  he denies evolution exists and has fought in the past to deny women rights to their own bodies  as well as trying to sabotage the affordable care act it s worth noting that gay people used to actually pay a fee for being gay in some cases  one person shared a story of how she and her wife paid an extra    per year because their marriage was not federally recognized  this was due to her being on her wife s health insurance plan  and the company she worked for had to treat it as additional taxable income due to doma  when it was still active  gay people didn t have a choice to pay this  bigots always have a choice  they just make the wrong one every single time  and that isn t our fault listen to stayers comments about gay taxation below featured image via youtube screen capture
