a quincy  il  man was shot in the hourly hours of thursday morning and then right after  did an interview while smoking a cigarette  in what appears to be one of the most interesting interviews of the year the quincy man  devon  was  in the room  kicking like i usually do  drinking   when someone fired bullets through his apartment  striking him in the chest despite the danger  devon said that he  wasn t trippin  it was a petty wound and sh t   the first thing he thought about wasn t his wound though  his main concern was to get his son out of the way  luckily  his son wasn t hurt during the interview  devon lifted his shirt to show his bandages from the wound  casually shrugging off the event  saying some people  probably want  dead  and are  on some other stuff  one can t help but notice how unaffected  calm  and desensitized devon seems to be  at least while conducting the interview  even the journalist  reyna harvey  who was interviewing him is calm  which lead chad douglas a broadcaster at the studio to lament that the entire event was  incredible  while the event is indeed incredible  there seems to be something quite eerie about the desensitization of all involved in this almost tragic event  let s hope that devon makes a full recovery from his wounds feature image via youtube screenshot
