republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee  in predictable conservative fashion  has just said something extremely offensive about people who aren t wealthy white men like him during thursday night s gop undercard debate  huckabee stated that it was only  common sense  to treat poor people with the same punishment reward techniques that people use to  train dogs  if we want to improve the economy  huckabee claimed that because  the tax system punishes them   the current system made it impossible for americans to really get ahead  he said  if you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder  you get bumped into a different tax bracket so the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do  it s time for something big  as an alternative  the former governor of arkansas suggested the  fair tax  plan  which would enforce a national flat sales tax of  percent  it s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids and train dogs  you reward behavior you want more of  and you punish behavior you want less of  that s how i raise kids  it s how i trained our dogs  and folks  it s not that difficult  even if you remove all offensiveness and privilege from huckabee s suggestion that poor taxpayers should be treated with the same systems we use to train our pet dogs  huckabee s  percent tax suggestion is still an awful one  last year  the tax policy center put the theory to the test and determined that huckabee s proposed alternative would actually be more detrimental and punish the nation s poorest americans  no surprise there   the tax policy center observed  the problem is that very high income households spend only a fraction of their income  while low  and middle income people spend all or most of what they make  a sales tax  by design  exempts a large share of income at the top  if it includes a prebate to protect people at the bottom and doesn t add to the deficit  then it must raise taxes on people in the middle  here s the debate footage where huckabee talks about treating poor people like dogs huckabee s attitude toward poor people echoes the rest of the gop s line of thinking  struggling americans are nothing to the republican party  and are often looked over and cast aside  if you learned anything from last night s republican presidential debate  it s that the gop candidates only have certain interests at heart  their own featured image is a screenshot
