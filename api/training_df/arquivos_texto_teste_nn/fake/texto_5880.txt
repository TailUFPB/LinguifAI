the last word with lawrence o donnell is seen by some as a rather dull msnbc talk show as compared to say  all in with chris hayes  or the rachel maddow show  however  they often have very important guests and discussions on there  and if you missed monday night s edition  boy did you miss a doozy of course  we all know that presumptive gop presidential nominee donald trump spent the whole of monday blaming president obama for the shooting in orlando   even going so far as to insinuate that the president secretly endorses terrorism  that is about as appalling of a piece of innuendo anyone   much less a presumptive presidential nominee  could throw at a sitting president  but it s donald trump so of course he did it well  o donnell s last word panel was having none of it  and they ripped trump a new one  this panel just happened to include peter wehner  who is a republican and a former adviser to president george h w  bush  here is the transcript of that part of the conversation via media matters lawrence o donnell  host   donald trump began the day today by saying what we knew he would say  that of course the massacre in orlando is president obama s fault  we all knew that was coming  donald trump was going to find some way to blame the president  but he didn t just blame the president s policies  he said the president actually is cheering for the other side  he said the president has something else in mind when it comes to fighting terrorism  meaning that the president doesn t really want to fight terrorism because he has something else in mind  those were his words  the suggestion that the president was really working for the other side was delivered in trump s classic imitation of joe mccarthy  innuendo on top of innuendo david  we knew it was going to be president obama s fault  but the details were interestingly crafted this time david corn  well we don t have details as you put it  we have innuendo  and this is just a continuation of the argument that made him a conservative favorite to begin with  birtherism  that there s something phoney and furtive and secretive and creepy about president barack obama  he s really a secret muslim  secret socialist  he doesn t like america  and trump doesn t say these things explicitly  but it s clear that the implication is that he wants the terrorism to succeed or happen  that he s not interested in stopping it  and he has this sort of a secret agenda  wink  wink  nod  nod  this is alex jones stuff  it s racist  and it feeds the base and the paranoia that brought trump to where he is  and it s just   the fact that other republicans don t come out  i mean  peter will   but other republicans don t come out and call him out on this in this moment of national tragedy is equally sad peter wehner  i think it s all that donald trump knows  this is the way the man is  he pulls these pins on these grenades and he rolls them and then it explodes and he says  geez  what happened  i think the guy has a personality disorder  i don t think he can control himself  so i think even if it s not in his interest to engage in this kind of stuff  he would do it  beyond that i think he does it because he is the most massively ignorant person ever to run for president and he cannot discuss public policy  so everything he s done from the day that he s gone in is to set up these debates that are on the ground of appealing to the darkest impulses of the country  that is what he relishes  and he wants to be in the gutter  the trouble is he s bringing a lot of people down there with him thank you  peter wehner  for not being one of those crazy gopers who puts party before country and supports trump despite the fact that an incompetent  racist jackass like that with his finger on the button would absolutely catastrophic for both the nation and world  hopefully  as we roll closer to november  more republicans will realize their mistake and un endorse donald trump watch the exchange below  again via media matters featured image via joe raedle getty images
