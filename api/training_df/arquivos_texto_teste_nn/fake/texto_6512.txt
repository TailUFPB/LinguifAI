never underestimate the impact a single person can have  just last weekend  one of the most powerful stands against racism we ve seen this year was performed by a lone black woman tess asplund  who is a  year old anti racism activist in sweden  took a courageous stand against hundreds of neo nazis from the far right group nordic resistance movement  as she saw the group of  white men marching down the street  asplund protested by standing in front of the advancing group of men  looked them dead in the eyes and raised her fist in an act of defiance  the group pushed her out of the way  but not before the iconic moment was captured on camera  this photograph has now been shared around the world twitter tessasplund sfida i nazisti svedesi con un pugno chiuso  immagine simbolo dell antifascismo  pic twitter com   antonio sicilia   siciliantonio  may    famous author j k  rowling was inspired by asplund s message twittertwitterwhat asplund did was more than courageous  and the impact of her protest was felt around the world  in an interview with the guardian  asplund shared what inspired her to take such bold action  it was an impulse  i was so angry  i just went out into the street  i was thinking  hell no  they can t march here  i had this adrenaline  no nazi is going to march here  it s not okay  although asplund said she s been  overwhelmed  and  extremely embarrassed  by the amount of attention the photo has gotten  she hopes that it will inspire others  asplund said  i have fought against racism for  years  i am  now  and if this is a thing that makes people pay attention to the fight against racism and xenophobia  then that s very good  but i don t want people to see me as a symbol  there were a lot of others who were there against the racists in borlange  because of all the attention the photo has gotten  asplund reveals that her friends are concerned for her safety  but it is a small price to pay if it gets more people to stand up to racism and hate  now it s a circus  i am in shock  the nazis are very angry  so i am a little  oh shit  maybe i shouldn t have done that  i want peace and quiet   these guys are big and crazy  it s a mixed feeling  but i am trying to stay calm  if this picture of me can get more people to dare to show resistance  then it s all good  the people must unite and show that it is not okay that racism is becoming normalized and that fascists are running around on our streets  the image was captured by david lagerlof  who happened to be the only photographer at the scene  even he was incredibly moved by what asplund did  he said  i happened to be at the right place  what i think people are reacting to in this photo is that she can t really pose a threat to them  but she puts herself in a very dangerous situation  because this group is violent  and she stands there all alone and faces them  it s like david and goliath  although this incident with the nordic resistance movement happened it sweden  it might not be too far from something that could happen in the united states  with the rise of presumptive republican nominee trump and his massive following of racists and white supremacists  we can only expect that the bigotry and hate is going to ramp up as we get closer to the general election  asplund is an inspiration to all of us  and a brilliant reminder that we should never let hate win  one person can have a massive impact  so there is no excuse not to stand up to trump s divisive rhetoric featured image via twitter
