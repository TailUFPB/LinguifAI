sweet cheese  donald trump is the gift that keeps on giving  i ve said repeatedly that i love trump because he s making it impossible for people to pretend that the conservative movement is not motivated by hate and rage  and like in the case of thomas robb  the head of the kkk  some people are not even trying to keep up the charade according to robb  trump has tapped into an underlying anger among white people  adding that white people in america  no longer identify with what america has become  this is fueling the anger in this country  and i think this is what we re seeing in this election   he said yes  thank you  that s exactly it  mr  robb is letting the cat out of the bag that fear and hate is the core of conservatism  a core that trump is exploiting to great effect  this  as i keep saying  is why the republican establishment is so mad at trump  they don t mind the racism  they mind of the overt nature of it  without the veneer of respectability  republicans will not be able to pretend they re not the party of old white racists  the corporate media is still working extra hard to avoid using the word  racism  when talking about trump s  inflammatory  rhetoric but no one s buying even that little bit of pretense why else is trump so popular with white supremacists  he s feeding into all of their fears and that helps their cause america is no longer the sole property of white people and it s driving whites  particularly conservative whites  into a frenzy of fear and rage  partly because they expect blacks and latinos to treat them the same way they treated blacks and latinos  but  more importantly  with minorities having equal or greater political power  white people are going to be forced to compete on a level economic  legal and social playing field  for people who are utterly convinced that they succeeded   due to their own awesomeness  this is a terrifying prospect  america s entire history has been influenced by the idea that white people are inherently superior  it will be quite the cultural shock to find out that without the system rigged in their favor  whites are just like everyone else there are a lot of white people who will grasp at any hope of stopping this awful future from coming to pass and trump is just the man to  make believe he can  do it  white power  indeed feature image via heavy com
