let s face it  republicans hate neil degrasse tyson because he is the obama of science  if the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters  they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  astrophysicists a great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the republican outrage mill breitbart  in it  the author implies that liberals are racist because they love tyson  this is followed up immediately by breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on tv tyson  whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on tv  hasn t published anything of note for years  the advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science he didn t get the phd he was studying for at the university of texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification  obviously  rather than take responsibility for his academic performance  tyson has blamed racism  in reality  tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays  typical science phd students are at any given time either studying  teaching or sleeping in   he said  i know these forces are real and i had to survive them in order to get where i am today  so before we start talking about genetic differences  you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity  he of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason neil degrasse tyson is on television at all  given his intellectual shortcomings  is that he is black source  breitbarthere is another famously liberal scientist  who republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings   that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt image  redstatequick fact check  tyson did not blame his lack of a ph d  from ut on racism  he was talking about racism on campus  like when he was stopped  times by campus police for walking near the physics building  it s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium  his ph d  pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee it took  seconds of google to find that information apparently breitbart is an authority in astronomy  physics  and astrophysics  because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough   in the fields  they also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying tyson hasn t published anything of note in years  tyson has published  papers  which is more than breitbart has done  and last time i checked breitbart did not do peer review of any published scientific material they also hate tyson because he thinks about something other than jesus on this day long ago  a child was born who  by age   would transform the world  happy birthday isaac newton b  dec     neil degrasse tyson   neiltyson  december    hasn t published as much work as some others  but there is a context to that  he made a choice to serve the public over himself  instead of being insulated within the scientific community  he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people  he went out and made science cool again when republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared it s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way  a black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative america  there has to be a conspiracy by liberal whites to foist his blackness upon america s heartland featured image via youtube
