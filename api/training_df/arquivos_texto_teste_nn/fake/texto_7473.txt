president obama thumbed his nose at republicans on wednesday morning and picked a replacement for justice scalia anyway  what s even better is that he picked someone who is such a centrist that the gop is going to look really silly when they oppose him obama held a press conference in the rose garden on wednesday and announced his support for the chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  merrick garland    as the next justice of the supreme court  president obama praised the judge in his speech  saying  i have selected a nominee who is widely recognized  not only as one of america s sharpest legal minds  but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency  modesty  integrity  even handedness  and excellence  these qualities  and his long commitment to public service  have earned him the respect and admiration of leaders from both sides of the aisle  he will ultimately bring that same character to bear on the supreme court  an institution in which he is uniquely prepared to serve immediately  today i am nominating chief judge merrick brian garland to join the supreme court  when justice scalia passed away in february  the right immediately said that they would oppose anyone who the president chooses to replace him  they have even pledged to not even open their doors for the nominee  this led a lot of pundits to speculate that president obama would pick a centrist who would make the republican party look ridiculous if they opposed his nomination and that is exactly what he did garland has spent nineteen years on the federal bench and is not known for deciding things based on his ideological views  although he is a moderate justice  he has ruled in favor of republican causes in the past in   for instance  garland ruled that gitmo detainees did not have the right to seek relief in civilian courts  this ruling was so controversial that when his name was floated as a replacement for supreme court justice john paul stevens  in   liberals were quick to speak out against him  meanwhile  the republican party praised him as a brilliant  judge  doug kendall  president of the progressive constitutional accountability center  said  he s won the admiration of everyone around him by taking the job of a judge seriously and engaging in conversation with his colleagues  rather than confrontation  carrie severino of the conservative judicial crisis network  said at the time  of those the president could nominate  we could do a lot worse than merrick garland  he s the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer  this was an incredibly smart move for president obama  although liberals are not going to be entirely thrilled with the moderate justice  he is a fine jurist with a long list of accomplishments  however  republicans are going to have a really hard time opposing a man whom even conservative orin hatch has called  a fine man  ultimately  they will oppose him because they are obstructionists who care little about the constitution and everything about blocking obama ultimately  they will oppose him because they are obstructionists who care little about the constitution and everything about blocking obama  but this will damage their credibility with the american public  maybe not their base  but definitely independents  all of the intelligent citizens of this country recognize that there is absolutely no place for politics when it comes to the highest court in the land watch obama s speech  featured image via video screenshot
