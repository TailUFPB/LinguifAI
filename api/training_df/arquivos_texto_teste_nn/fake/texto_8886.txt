today  i would hate to be a republican strategist  why  because with the election only  months away  i have to tell my candidate that the economy is still growing robustly and shows no signs of weakness  if anything  it still has room for explosive growth even after adding another   jobs in december the jobless rate  which has declined since topping the  percent mark in october   is now hovering just above what economists consider full employment   the point where further declines could start to push up inflation the average monthly gain in jobs last year were closer to the  average of   a month  but short of the   figure reached in   the remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years   said mark zandi  chief economist at moody s analytics   we re getting at least   jobs per month on a consistent basis  that s quite an achievement  the only downside to this report is that there was no growth to average hourly wages  that s been the  slow  part of this slow recovery  on the plus side  once we reach the  full  employment mentioned above  wages will grow and grow rapidly  companies will be competing for employees and the way to do that is by offering higher pay  this  by the way  is one of the reasons corporate america has not been all that gung ho about heating up the economy  high unemployment means low wages  the second favorite phrase next to  golden parachute  for ceos but  once wages start going up  people will have more money to spend and that increases demand  increased demand  of course  requires more people to fill that demand and that means more jobs which means more people have money to spend and so the cycle goes  slowing or reversing this cycle was the express purpose of the republican s austerity mania in which they insisted pulling money out of the economy would  help  it  a crippled economy is good for republican political ambitions fortunately  obama fended off most of their bullshit cuts and instead implemented policies to avoid inflating the economy on a fragile bubble  it may have been slow but the obama recovery is incredibly stable  did you even know the rest of the world s economy is a mess   and so far resistant to shocks  if we keep up this pace  obama will be handing his  democratic  successor a solid foundation from which to build a bridge to the future maybe they can find jobs for all the republicans that will be out of work come election day featured image via black water dog pete souza
