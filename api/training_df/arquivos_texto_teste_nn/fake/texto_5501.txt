it doesn t get any clearer than this that iowa rep  steve king is a racist during a story about king introducing sarah s law  a program that allows parents to check if someone around their child has ever been convicted of sexual offenses against children  cameras busted the republican openly displaying a confederate flag on his office desk here s the video via youtube  the flag can be seen at the  second mark this pretty much confirms that king is a racist who fantasizes about secession  after all  he is a vicious critic of black lives matter and has always hated president obama  whom he directly blamed for the dallas shootings in a post on twitter  dallaspoliceshooting has roots in first of anti white cop events illuminated by obama officer crowley  there were others   steve king   stevekingia  july     king tried to block the addition of harriet tubman  a former slave who escaped and became a prominent abolitionist who helped other slave gain their freedom via the underground railroad  to the   bill in defense of slave holder andrew jackson  who is going to be moved to the back king claimed that putting tubman on the   bill is racist while he tried to portray his effort as  unifying this is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories  and he s divided us on the lines of groups   king said   this is a divisive proposal on the part of the president  and mine s unifying  it says just don t change anything  king is also a fan of secession  when the united kingdom voted to leave the european union last month  he cheered the vote on twitter  congratulations to uk  especially  nigelfarage   ukip  for your noble   farsighted national decision to  breexit  westernciv can be saved   steve king   stevekingia  june    conservatives also cheered the decision and have used it to push their own secession movement democratic candidate kim weaver  who is challenging king for his seat  told the de moines register  like a lot of iowans  i m disgusted by his gross insensitivity to the millions of americans for whom that flag is a symbol of racism and division  and i join them in calling on mr  king to remove it immediately  even iowa s gop governor opposes king s display of the confederate flag because iowa was a union state during the civil war indeed    iowa men fought against the confederacy  iowans fought bravely with distinction at the battle of wilson creek in missouri and many are buried at vicksburg national cemetery  king s support of the confederate flag is an insult to their memory and the memory of the   iowans who died trying to defeat the confederacy  it s also disgraceful to the iowans who were killed by confederate bushwhackers who repeatedly raided the southern part of the state during the war iowa heavily backed abraham lincoln and the union  so steve king s display of an enemy flag is totally offensive  especially since he is supposed to be a united states congressman featured image  screenshot
