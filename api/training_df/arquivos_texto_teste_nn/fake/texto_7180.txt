i m often told that trump can beat hillary  and therefore she shouldn t be the nominee  it s a good argument   electability  and all that  but it s not true  even slightly  in fact  never mind hillary  we could nominate a potted plant on the left and trump would still lose how can i be so sure  easy  trump has to win   of the white male vote to become president good fucking luck with that i know what you re thinking  trump appeals directly to white resentment  how could he not have the angry white male vote totally locked up  honestly  he probably does  this is something that  as a white male myself  i find incredibly annoying  that more than half of all white males would support such a piece of trash is embarrassing to say the least  but more than half is not the same as   no one gets   of the white male vote  no  one that s a larger percentage than republicans have ever won before   more than the gop won in the landslide victories of ronald reagan and george h w  bush  and far more than they won during the racially polarized elections of barack obama of course  the argument often made by trump s followers is that he will win in november because he will bring so many disengaged americans to the polls  but they re talking about disengaged white voters  mostly mostly men   and unfortunately for him  the turnout rate for white men is already relatively high  got that  even when white america went completely insane at the idea of a black president  they still couldn t muster more than the   reagan and poppy bush took in  and  or the   dubya got in   more importantly  as the country gets less lily white  even that    is losing its punch by   however  winning  percent of white men barely got george w  bush past john kerry in a squeaker  and eight years later  romney won  percent of white men and lost to barack obama by   million votes so what happened  between reagan and romney  the white male share of the total vote had dropped from  percent to  percent ironically  the very thing trump is harnessing to propel his campaign  white resentment at the waning of white supremacy  is what will ensure he can never win  it s such a thing a beauty that i want to redefine marriage again so i can walk it down the aisle if you want a full breakdown of why trump needs   of white men and how women  latinos and black voters spell his doom  take a look at politico s excellent analysis featured image via ai archives
