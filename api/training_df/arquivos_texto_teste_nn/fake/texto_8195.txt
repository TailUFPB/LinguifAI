you may or may not know this  but the democratic national committee  dnc  has a system in place that s capable of overriding the will of the people when the popular vote doesn t quite match up with what the  establishment  has in mind  due to dnc rules put into place  party elites have chosen to award hillary clinton an equal amount of delegates in new hampshire even though bernie sanders won by an overwhelmingly large margin  pretty messed up  huh  yes  it is  but   there s more you need to know before panicking entirely  although you should panic a little  new hampshire has a total of   pledged  delegates that go to the winner of the primaries  since bernie won    of the vote  he was awarded  of those  and clinton only   but  party officials in the state are given   superdelegates  and are free to choose whichever candidate they like  six of those insider party officials are throwing their support behind clinton while two remain undecided  if you do the math  that means that the dnc is technically overriding the will of the voters and making the state an even call between the both of them pic via ap don t blame hillary clinton  though  while there is substantial evidence of dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz being personally tied to clinton  she was the co chair of clinton s  campaign after all   these rules were put in place back in   the whole point of the superdelegate system was to make sure  unelectable  candidates wouldn t get elected  that s a good thing  remember george mcgovern  he was beaten so bad by nixon  the democratic party felt like it needed to do something  and this is what they eventually came up with  bernie sanders is electable  though  and you d think the establishment is just now starting to get that  the momentum he s currently receiving  and fundraising  is unbelievable   far more than anyone could have ever imagined just six months ago the truth is  and no fault to sanders   but clinton began the race with an enormous amount of support still left intact from her  run against barack obama  due to her expansive campaign reach  she has been able to gain favor early on with most party insiders from the get go  and  yes  they still support her  bernie s momentum is definitely happening  but so far that hasn t changed how the rules are set up  and   right now  because of the rules  clinton has that advantage pic via new york times there is good news  though  even though technically clinton received the same number of delegates as sanders  taking away the kind of win needed to secure enough delegates from the state  he still won the popular vote  and that s important no matter what anyone claims to tell you  here s why  the popular vote will decide the election overall  clinton started with an overwhelming amount of support  true  but   of the ordinary  popular vote delegates are allocated based on the voters  not the party  and   it only takes   to secure the nomination  if it ever came down to it  and bernie somehow received more of the popular vote than clinton  the superdelegates should  in theory  back bernie  if they didn t  it would cause chaos  don t ever plan on that happening  though   the dnc isn t that stupid the dnc establishment  with their early superdelegate total factoring in  might make it seem like bernie has an uphill battle  but the voters will largely determine the overall outcome  unfortunately  as of right now  though  bernie didn t win the overwhelming majority of delegates like the citizens of new hampshire democratically went to the polls for  but  that s the dnc s rules for you featured image from flickr
