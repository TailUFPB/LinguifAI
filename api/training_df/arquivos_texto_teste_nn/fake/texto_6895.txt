donald trump has had a hell of a week having to accept that his closest friends and loved ones are abandoning him in his mission to single handedly destroy america earlier this week  trump s own kids   ivanka and don   broke the news that they won t be voting for their father in the primary  today  another harsh blow was delivered to trump   his top surrogate  michael cohen  has just revealed that he won t be voting for the business mogul either   because he s actually registered as a democrat cohen made this confession on thursday night to cnn hosts john berman and kate bolduan  who were absolutely shocked by this news  in speaking about rnc chair reince priebus and the nominating process  cohen let it slip that he wasn t really on trump s side after all  cohen  who is actually the executive vice president of the trump organization  complained about the so called  rigged  delegate rules and said  i think reince priebus has an obligation not just to the rnc but really to the american people     he s supposed to keep the republican party unified  that s what his job really is  and he s not doing that  and he s doing a terrible job at it  do i personally  as a voter  as a supporter of mr  trump  believe that the process is rigged  i do  i think that the   establishment does not want mr  trump to be the nominee  me  personally  i m actually a registered democrat  so i don t really care about reince priebus  berman and bolduan hardly expected this response and freaked out  berman cried  wait  you can t vote     and bolduan did a double take  asking   you re not voting for donald trump   cohen pretty much dismissed their questions and simply replied   not in the primary  amused  berman recalled how strange it was that trump s biggest so called supporters wouldn t actually be supporting him at all  berman said  so his kids can t vote  and you can t vote in the primary  cohen tried to cover up how baffling the entire situation was by launching into a bizarre conversation about how he wished trump could be his father  cohen said  well  i d like to be one of his children  i d like to be one of them  but no  i m not voting in the primary  i m a registered democrat  berman still couldn t get over how the candidate s own family and supporters wouldn t be voting for him  berman shook his head and said  man  he s losing votes from his family and the people who work for him  then  in a rant ignorant enough to be mistaken for something trump himself might say  cohen dismissed berman s concerns and claimed that trump didn t need those votes anyway  cohen  who previously supported obama in   bragged  you don t have to worry about mr  trump  he s polling at  plus percent  this is his hometown  you can watch this ridiculous interview below  featured image via gage skidmore
