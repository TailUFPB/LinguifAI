if there s one thing senator ted cruz will go down in history for  it s being a smarmy liar  he says whatever he can to make himself look good  and gives all politicians a bad name  what he seems to hate more than anything is being call out on his bullshit  and wednesday when asked a question about how he mislead carson voters in to thinking the candidate was suspending his campaign  thus trying to make voters believe they should vote for cruz  he went directly after cnn  saying  is it a dirty trick to pass on your news stories  you re in the business  would you think it was a dirty trick if i was forwarding an abc story  or is it just a dirty trick to pass on a cnn story  basically  he was pissed cnn was reporting facts  so cnn anchor brooke baldwin  while speaking with cruz surrogate rep  mark meadows  r nc   said  just so we re all crystal clear here  when sen  cruz  with all due respect  tries to throw my network under the bus  let me stand up for my colleagues and my journalists here in terms of this cnn report cruz keeps quoting  we reported it accurately and here are the facts  she then went on to say  dr  carson s staff told us that he would return home to florida to  quote  unquote  take a breath from the campaign before resuming his activities on the campaign trail  that accurate report was disseminated on television and cnn digital and that was that  that was that  then finished off with  forgive me  when someone tries to take down the media and misreport something it gets me fired up  then when meadows tried to twist the conversation away from the subject  baldwin brings him back to reality by saying  congressman  forgive me  but i m going to call out b s  if i hear b s  and that was b s  cruz was purposefully trying to blame the media for his actions taken against the carson campaign  it s lame  it s wrong  and baldwin was perfectly spot on calling him out on it  well done  video featured image  youtube
