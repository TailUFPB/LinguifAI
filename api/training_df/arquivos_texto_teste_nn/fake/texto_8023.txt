donald trump s appearance at an msnbc town hall event wednesday didn t go very well for him when host mika brzezinski played a little game with him  it was simple  she would describe a candidate and trump would guess who she was speaking about  pretty simple  right brzezinski gave the following description of a candidate  the candidate is considered a political outsider by all the pundits  he s tapping into all the anger of the voters  delivers a populist message  he believes everyone in the country should have healthcare  he advocates for hedge fund managers to pay higher taxes  he s drawing thousands of people at his rallies and bringing in a lot of new voters to the political process  and he s not beholden to any super pac  who am i describing  or any special interests or any donors   he said  adding   you re describing donald trump  actually  i was describing bernie sanders   brzezinski said as the audience burst into laughter  that s good   trump conceded  the billionaire  who has spent his career ripping people off  says that there is one area in which they agree   that  our country is being ripped off big league on trade    though he says sanders   can t do anything about it because he  doesn t understand  the problem trump  of course  doesn t understand much of anything past how to creepily talk openly about how much he wants to f ck his daughter  his rise in popularity has nothing to do with how much he can accomplish  his knowledge  or anything substantive  trump s ascension is linked to his talk of building walls  of rounding up muslims into concentration camps  of banning brown people from entering the country  his supporters are largely uneducated bigots who simply like him because he  speaks his mind    the same thing your irritating right wing uncle does at holiday dinners trump s harnessing of the anger of the stupid part of america is very real  make no mistake about it  he will absolutely be bringing voters to the polls in november  it is important that you register to vote  if your state has enacted voter id legislation in an effort to disenfranchise certain segments of the population  make sure you obtain all the required documentation to vote   and vote blue watch trump embarrass himself below featured image via screengrab
