the republican party is busy with a pitted civil war between those who are willing to jump on trump s crazy train  and those who realize the party has to be saved from the ultra conservative extremism which handed a trust fund tycoon the party leadership  but as the daily show attempted to report events this week  things were so crazy  the team couldn t keep a straight face noah begins by outlining the gop dilemma  now the voting is over  and republicans have chosen a mutant from a carrot juicing accident  as the party wakes up to that devastating reality  the gop is splitting along the trump fault line  noah describes their plight with typical relish  you ve got the people who support trump  you ve got the people who aren t ready to support trump  and the most interesting people are a group who spent the whole race throwing sh t at trump  and now  they re picking it back up  spreading it on a sandwich  and taking a big bite  the host then shows clips of come lately trump supporters railing against the candidate in the most personal and vivid terms earlier in the race  bobby jindal calls trump  weak  and a  narcissist   and claims he would not back him in the event of his becoming nominee  but the real gold comes from rick perry  who refers to trump as a  cancer  on the party and america  then chooses to back him  but even more insane  is that perry now even wishes to become trump s running mate  this left noah almost tearful with laughter  so wait  he says   you want to be running mates with cancer  that s what you re saying  i mean  i guess it has a pretty sturgeon history of winning  but still  noah goes on to compare the gop split like that of commuters waiting for a subway train  the doors open  and there s some crazy guy screaming  for some they think  well  it s my train  i m just going to have to  get on board the crazy train   while others simply refuse  and to hell with the consequences but when noah reaches out to his correspondents for their take on the situation  no one can keep a straight face  jordan klepper collapses laughing  saying  they were all such assholes for so long and they completely did this to themselves  noah turns to hasan minhaj in hopes of getting more sensible commentary  but he also falls apart when comparing the gop to  a dog that chewed its own balls off  you can enjoy the full section below https   www youtube com watch v  featured image via screengrab
