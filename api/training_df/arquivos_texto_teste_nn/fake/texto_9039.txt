after hillary clinton made the argument that donald trump s hateful rants against muslims were fueling islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate  republicans and the fox news crowd last their minds accusing her of lying   where were these videos   they demanded  a reporter just found one while isis s campaign of terror in the middle east gets most of the headlines  an equally horrific group is operating out of africa  al shabab  linked to al qaeda  has been responsible for a number of massacres  terror attacks  and other human rights atrocities  primarily in somalia and kenya  recently  the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of african governments  they are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as donald trump harun maruf  a journalist working with voice of america  has been closely following al shabab and its recruitment strategies  on january   he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   trump s recent call for a  total muslim ban  breaking  al shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting african americans and us muslims   somalia  harun maruf   harunmaruf  january     donald trump s recent speech calling for  total muslim ban  is on al shabab recruitment video   somalia  harun maruf   harunmaruf  january    video itself features an english speaking narrator telling young muslims that america is a racist nation  a clip of what appears to be an isis spokesman explains that jim crow laws targeting african americans have morphed into religious discrimination  then cuts to donald trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states    new  shabaab vid shows  trump proposing muslim travel ban   awlaki predicting bigotry    concentration camps  pic twitter com   rita katz   ritakatz  january    s easy to see why trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters  for years  terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear mongering about the west to get desperate people to join up with violent causes  the idea is to paint america as hostile to muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to muslims around the world  if america hates muslims  then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion  or so the thinking goes trump  with all of his small minded bigotry  is a boon for this propaganda  after all  just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that americans do hate muslims  nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves while republicans took potshots at hillary over her calling this spade a spade  her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny  even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance  she was unflinchingly calling out republican islamophobia  on december   she went so far as to release a statement warning all republican candidates  not just trump  to stop the hate this kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win  against a brutal  nihilistic enemy who twists islam to justify mass murder  these jihadists cannot be contained  they have to be defeated  and the vast majority of muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight  many are helping prevent radicalization  including here at home  so why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy  how does that help us  radical jihadists are telling people that the united states hates muslims and there s donald trump on tv screaming about how he s going to keep all muslims out  he s strengthening the terrorists  argument a desperate  losing terror group like al shabab is staking their future on trump  that should say it all feature image via youtube
