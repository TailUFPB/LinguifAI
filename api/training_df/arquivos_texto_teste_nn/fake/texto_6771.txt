republicans found their new election year wedge issue  since they lost on obamacare  marriage equality  and benghazi  the new rage source they identified is  harriet tubman being placed on the   bill this is the new big deal  it s practically an attack on the constitution itself  right it certainly seems to be for republicans  at least  so many people on the right are exploding over the idea of replacing jackson on the   bill now  however  this isn t new news  this has been planned for a relatively long time  they knew this was coming  and there was no outrage   right up until someone who was both non white and non male was going to do the replacing luckily  fox news  greta van susteren came up with the perfect response  her plan is to leave white people s money as it is and make separate money for non whites  no  that s not a joke  she literally said we should make a new   bill so that jackson could stay in place let s do a bit of critical thinking  based on a bit of history  a susan b  anthony dollar coin was released by the government a long time ago  everybody hated it  not only did it look like a quarter  and people got confused by that  but it was redundant  we already had a   bill that everyone was accustomed to  not every cash register has room for a new bill slot either  certain types of automated bill changing machines would have to be retrofit for a   bill as well the point is that a whole new denomination of money would be an annoyance and hassle  and the public would not have any patience for it  to put it into context  america has had a   bill with thomas jefferson on it for a really long time  do you know anyone who uses them  do you even remember the last time you saw one outside of some novelty situation for collectors to sum it up  the republican party thinks that the only place for a woman or a non white person when it comes to money  is on something that will be marginalized by society   just like how they ve marginalized women and non white people for decades  it really makes a lot of sense when you look at it that way  doesn t it watch greta prove that fox respects equality by hiring stupid employees of both sexes below  featured image via video screen capture
