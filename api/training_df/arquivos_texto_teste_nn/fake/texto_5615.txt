new york times conservative columnist david brooks is absolutely amazing  after years of sitting by while republicans waged a scorched earth campaign against democrats  the constitution and basic human decency  he suddenly laments the toxic level of discourse in america  why  because democrats are ascendant and republicans are teetering on total collapse  now  he says  we should work together and it would be bad for america if we don t brooks sets the stage by describing how we got here  he calls it  anti politics  and he s very upset about it  over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics  these groups   best exemplified by the tea party but not exclusive to the right   want to elect people who have no political experience  they want  outsiders   they delegitimize compromise and deal making  they re willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision making if it helps them gain power  i m guessing he s referring to bernie sanders  supporters as being the left wing version because i can t think of any other group on the left that even remotely fits the description  but bernie has been in washington for  something years  he s hardly an inexperienced outsider  his followers may like his rebel cred but they don t want him to get into office for the sole purpose of bringing the government to a grinding halt  this is brooks creating a false equivalency in order to absolve himself of his responsibility in creating antipolitics he goes on to describe the antipolitics people as being extremists that cannot compromise and increasingly damage the process of governing  essentially what the gop has been doing for years while brooks gave them ideological cover to wreck the country  brooks is especially put off by trump despite having enabled his rise in the first place so far  the column is the usual right wing shifting of blame  they are patently incapable of accepting responsibility for their actions  but then we get to this  the plaintive wail for sanity  the answer to trump is politics  it s acknowledging other people exist  it s taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements  as harold laski put it  we shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement  therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony   it sure does sound reasonable but the timing of this sudden epiphany is not coincidental  you see  republicans have spent the last   years polarizing the country to the point where the two sides cannot work together  while republicans controlled the white house  both chambers of congress and the supreme court  this was exactly what they wanted  they spent  years of ignoring the democrats and doing whatever they wanted  then they spent all of obama s presidency breaking the system so they could stop his agenda  they became the party of antipolitics but in november  republicans are going to be crushed at the ballot box  trump is going to going to lose so badly  he s going to cost republicans the senate by a comfortable margin  not a small number of house seats  a few governorships and control of several state legislatures  oh  and the supreme court is going to tilt left for the next  years  which will put the final nail in the coffin of the republican voter suppression schemes that are the only thing keeping republicans in power in many parts of the country so after decades of  i hate you  i hope you die  burn in hell  compromise is surrender  burn it all down unless we get   of what we want    we should stop playing by their rules of winner takes all  now that they re on the edge of losing everything  republicans want to play nice again  noooooope  fuck that  republicans don t get to kick sand in our faces and then demand we share our ice cream because they dropped theirs so sorry  mr  brooks  you had your chance and you blew it  you sat by and let your party turn american politics into a polarized blood sport  it s not our fault you lost and we re in no mood to give you the time of day much less any concessions  we re going to put you in a little box and undo all of the damage your policies have wrought since the   unions are going to grow in strength again  the minimum wage will become a living wage  workers will have their rights restored  women will have their rights restored  so will minorities and the victims of the drug war  most of whom are minorities anyway   wall street will still make billions but they won t be able to crash the economy again  all of your voter suppression laws will be repealed and extreme gerrymandering will end  all of this will happen without no input from you because you have painted yourselves into a corner where working with a democrat is grounds for being primaried from the far right  it won t happen in  years  or even   decades of damage will take decades to clean up  but it s going to happen and there s nothing you can do to stop it karl rove once boasted of a  permanent republican majority  in which democrats would be utterly powerless  while i m not so bold as to claim a permanent democratic majority  republicans will grow weaker and weaker until they can stop appealing only to white racists  in the meantime  we re gonna take it all while you  mr  brooks  sit and scream in impotent rage at how mean and unfair the left has become  ha  ha  ha  fuck you featured image via diginpix ina fr
