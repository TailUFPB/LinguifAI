john oliver absolutely humiliated mitch mcconnell and the gop for vowing to block any supreme court nominee picked by president obama during his show on sunday  oliver had wanted to recap the last three months he has missed since going on break  but due to the unexpected death of justice antonin scalia he changed the plan and focused instead on how republicans vowed to obstruct president obama from filling scalia s empty seat on the bench indeed  scalia s body wasn t even cold yet before republicans declared their willingness to desecrate the constitution he loved so much  and oliver ripped them apart for it  there is now a huge vacancy on the supreme court that needs to be filled  or if you listened to the republicans in the last  hours   not   oliver began before showing a clip of donald trump telling senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to  delay  delay  delay  until a new president can fill the seat in   and oliver really slammed mcconnell since he often obstructs anything president obama and democrats try to get done  well  that does not bode well because mitch mcconnell is actually pretty good at delaying things for people whether it s legislation  court appointments  or orgasms  believe me  if you ever need to  delay  delay  delay  an orgasm  just picture this face and i guarantee you nothing will happen   possibly for the rest of your life  oliver then took aim at the strom thurmond rule  an unwritten rule in the senate that supposedly dictates that presidents can t nominate supreme court justices in the last six months of their final year in office  yes  the strom thurmond rule  now  i m not surprised that there is one but i thought that it was always about hush money required to keep your secret family a secret or how racist an old person is allowed to become before their age is no longer an excuse  oliver then revealed mcconnell as a hypocrite for even bringing up this  bullshit rule  because he has condemned its use in the past  specifically in   and yes  there s video  which oliver happily played  our democratic colleagues continually talk about the so called  thurmond rule   under which the senate supposedly stops confirming judges in a presidential election year   mcconnell said on the senate floor   this seeming obsession with this rule that doesn t exist is an excuse for our colleagues to run out the clock on qualified nominees who are waiting to fill badly needed vacancies  yes  it seems the  thurmond rule  is a bit like god  when things are going your way  you don t bring it up a lot   oliver pointed out   but as soon as you re in trouble   it is all that you talk about  he also pointed out that the rule is about the last six months of a presidency  which for president obama doesn t begin until july   he also pointed out that republicans are shitting all over scalia s memory by disobeying article ii section ii of the constitution which says the president shall appoint judges of the supreme court with the advice and consent of the senate in other words  senate republicans must do their job just as president obama must do his but as oliver noted  leave it to republicans to honor scalia s memory by stretching the definition of  late term  here s the video via youtube  featured image from screen capture
