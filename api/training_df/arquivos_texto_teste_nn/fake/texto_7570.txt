 it was a slow burn  but president obama made the audience explode in laughter with the punchline during a state dinner in honor of canadian prime minister justin trudeau  president obama delivered lighthearted remarks that included humorous shots at the republican party primary race and the participants obama began by talking about how america and canada are lands of opportunity and then he turned the birtherism of the gop around and threw it right back at them in a burn ted cruz will feel on the campaign trail  this visit has been a celebration of the values that we share   obama began  we as a people are committed to the principles of equality and opportunity  the idea that if you work hard and play by the rules you can make it if you try no matter what the circumstances of your birth in both of our countries  obama started out serious and thoughtful  setting up those in attendance for what would be a hilarious joke at ted cruz s expense  thus once again demonstrating his mastery of comedy  we see this in our current presidential campaign  where else could a boy born in calgary run for president of the united states  here s the video via youtube for years  republicans have claimed that president obama is illegitimate because they say he wasn t born in the united states even though records clearly prove that president obama was born in hawaii to an american mother in  but during this gop primary  ted cruz has been running for president even though he really was born in a different country  and only donald trump has repeatedly pointed that out throughout the race while other republicans hypocritically remain silent but president obama also alluded to trump in a separate joke  mentioning how canada is welcoming americans into their nation if trump somehow wins the presidency and how our neighbors to the north refuse to build a wall to keep us out in our time of need  where else would we see a community like cape breton  nova scotia welcoming americans if the election does not go their way  and to the great credit of their people  canadians from british columbia to new brunswick have  so far  rejected the idea of building a wall to keep out your southern neighbors  we appreciate that  we can be unruly  i know  president obama s humor and quick wit will be sorely missed when he leaves office in  featured image via video screen capture
