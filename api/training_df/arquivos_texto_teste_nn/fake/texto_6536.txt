donald trump is now the unofficially declared republican nominee  congratulations  republicans  you went from abraham lincoln  to dwight d  eisenhower  to george w  bush  and now trump  we didn t think it could get much worse  but it did thankfully for the democrats and other sane americans  both clinton and sanders stand to beat trump in a landslide in a general election  the math favors clinton to be the democratic nominee  for she only needs roughly  more delegates out of the    left in the rest of the contests  no matter who you support  this is a good thing so  unless there is a divine intervention  on both sides   it s going to be trump v  clinton anti establishment republicans are elated though for some weird reason   their candidate is screwed take a look at the numbers  cnn has clinton beating trump   percent  a thirteen point lead  that s pretty sizable  and what s even more remarkable is the fact that trump leads clinton with white voters by only nine points      remember  white voters are supposed to be trump s saving grace in this election   the angry white voter  new age southern strategy  is supposed to carry the xenophobic buffoon  and he is only leading by nine points in   mccain garnered  percent of white voters to obama s  percent    point difference   and still lost in   romney nabbed  percent of whites to obama s dismal  percent   a  point difference   and still lost projections show that trump will have to win  percent of white voters if he wants to take the white house  and why is that  because clinton is absolutely crushing him among non white voters  in cnn s poll   percent of nonwhite voters are backing clinton  while  percent are backing trump  a  point difference that s not even taking into consideration the entire female vote  which trump is losing in historic proportions and it certainly doesn t help that republicans have lost ground with white voters  and white men  while democrats have picked up the republican s slack  reuters found among whites under   the shift is even more dramatic  in   they were more likely to identify with the republican party by about  percentage points  in   the advantage flipped  young whites are now more likely to identify with the democratic party by about  percentage points bottom line  the white vote cannot and will not save donald trump  the face of the nation has changed  the demographics have shifted  and it s no longer going to be the white man calling the shots  and no matter how many races and religions trump wants to ban  the rhetoric will not be enough for his racist base  of course never say never  there is always a chance he could win   if democrats get too comfortable and stay home  but if democrats get out and vote  trump will lose  and lose huge let s put the final nail in the white dominance coffin and send a message to the bigots on the trump train featured image via mark wilson getty images
