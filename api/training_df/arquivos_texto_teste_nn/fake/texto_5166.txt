republicans are flocking away from the gop s presidential candidate in droves  one group of republicans just joined the ranks of those who cannot support donald trump  the harvard republican club has decided that they cannot in good conscience support trump s presidential bid on thursday  the harvard republican club s editorial board published a press release that masterfully lays out the case as to why they cannot    and nor should anyone else   support trump  in every presidential election since   the members and executive board of the harvard republican club have gathered to discuss  debate  and eventually endorse the standard bearer of our party  but for the first time in  years  we  the oldest college republicans chapter in the nation  will not be endorsing the republican nominee donald trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as republicans  but as americans  the rhetoric he espouses  from racist slander to misogynistic taunts  is not consistent with our conservative principles  and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war  gold star families  and purple heart recipients is not only bad politics  but absurdly cruel  according to the harvard crimson  very few members of the harvard republican club planned on supporting trump  only   of their membership indicated that they support trump  an overwhelming majority       said that they will not support trump    of the club was still undecided at the time they were asked  you can read the full letter below dear members and alumni in every presidential election since   the members and executive board of the harvard republican club have gathered to discuss  debate  and eventually endorse the standard bearer of our party  but for the first time in  years  we  the oldest college republicans chapter in the nation  will not be endorsing the republican nominee donald trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as republicans  but as americans  the rhetoric he espouses  from racist slander to misogynistic taunts  is not consistent with our conservative principles  and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war  gold star families  and purple heart recipients is not only bad politics  but absurdly cruel if enacted  donald trump s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad  domestically  his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit  raise prices for consumers  and throw our economy back into recession  trump s global outlook  steeped in isolationism  is considerably out of step with the traditional republican stance as well  the flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the united states  responsibility to lead is alarming  calling for the us  withdrawal from nato and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation  donald trump s foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since world war ii perhaps most importantly  however  donald trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the united states through an increasingly perilous world  the last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year  in response to any slight  perceived or real  donald trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly  in trump s eyes  disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision  stupid  lying  fat  ugly  weak  failing  idiot  and that s just his  fellow  republicans he isn t eschewing political correctness  he is eschewing basic human decency donald trump  despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail  has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to americans like us  he speaks only in platitudes  about greatness  success  and winning  time and time again  trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters  meandering from position to position over the course of the election  when confronted about these frequent reversals  trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen millions of people across the country are feeling despondent  their hours have been cut  wages slashed  jobs even shipped overseas  but donald trump doesn t have a plan to fix that  he has a plan to exploit that donald trump is a threat to the survival of the republic  his authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy  he hopes to divide us by race  by class  and by religion  instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the white house  he is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor  friend against friend  american against american  we will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children president reagan called on us to maintain this  our shining city on a hill  he called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world  he called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents  he called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor he would be ashamed of donald trump  we are too this fall  we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the republican party from those who have done it considerable harm  campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the republican party for generations  we will work to ensure both chambers of congress remain in republican hands  continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this november we call on our party s elected leaders to renounce their support of donald trump  and urge our fellow college republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man  the conservative movement in america should not and will not go quietly into the night a longtime student of american democracy  alexis de tocqueville once said   america is great because she is good  if america ceases to be good  america will cease to be great  de tocqueville believed in the united states  americans are a decent people  we work hard  protect our own  and look out for one another in times of need  regardless of the color of our skin  the god we worship  or our party registration  donald trump may not believe in that america  but we do  and that america will never cease to be great the harvard republican clubgood going  harvard republicans  now  hopefully the gop leadership will follow suit featured image from
