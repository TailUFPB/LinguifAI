donald trump woke up this morning  sleepily grabbed his phone off his nightstand  saw one of his supporters had tweeted an anti jeb bush picture at him  and hit  retweet  unfortunately  that supporter happened to be a racist neo nazi with the account name  whitegenocidetm  seriously the love for trump from racist xenophobes is startling  but not exactly surprising  trump s current presidential run quite literally started with a racist screed against mexicans  and has been sustained by a torrent of anti muslim  anti immigrant smears  his rallies regularly feature his supporters beating people of color who come to protest his ugly rhetoric you can almost feel the sense of excitement in the racist  nazi loving dark corners of the country  finally  a candidate for us  and even better   if you happen to be a toxic racist   trump won t hesitate to give you free publicity if you just tweet something to stoke his ego it would have taken all of two seconds for trump to realize that the man he was tweeting was a despicable monster  if the  whitegenocide  name   based on the racist belief that white people are being systematically edged out of american society by minorities   didn t give it away  the account s biographical details should have even worse  just scrolling through the account s tweets shows a pattern of racist filth  some of it advocates for the deaths of political figures  particularly those on the left  last week  for instance  he tweeted a picture of trump in a nazi uniform with democratic candidate bernie sanders inside a gas chamber as of this writing  and more than an hour after he retweeted this scumbag  trump still has the tweet up  including a link to  whitegenocidetm s  account  giving him more exposure donald trump has surged in the republican polls  with even many of what we consider  mainstream  conservatives applauding his appalling comments  at the root of his support  however  is a thriving neo nazi and white supremacy contingent that believe trump might be the leader they were looking for  just hinting at racist ideology wasn t enough for them  they like a guy who will openly admit to it and never apologize certainly trump will eventually excuse the tweet and  likely  blame a  young intern  for the mistake  we shouldn t let him get off the hook that easily  this is a pattern of disgraceful behavior that puts real lives at jeopardy  it is extremely telling that the most toxic  violent people in society are cozying up to trump  clearly  what he s saying is right up their alley  trump may try to excuse his behavior  but his actions   and followers   speak louder than his words ever will featured image via twitter
