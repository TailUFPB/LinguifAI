on november      year old tamir rice was gunned down by cleveland police as he played with a toy gun in a park  the officers involved in the shooting were cleared of any wrongdoing  even though they shot the child within seconds of arriving at the park  now  a year and a half later  the city is doing something so outrageous that even the president of the police union is disgusted  billing his mother for his final ambulance ride on wednesday  his family s attorney subodh chandra spoke to the press about the   bill from the city  the callousness  insensitivity and poor judgment required for the city to send a bill   is breathtaking  this adds insult to homicide  not only is chandra horrified by the city s decision to send tamir s mom  samaria rice  a statement for the cost of the ride  so is police union president steve loomis  who said  subodh chandra and i have never agreed on anything until now  it is unconscionable that the city of cleveland would send that bill to the rice family truly disappointing  but not at all surprising  it s hard to imagine what the city was thinking when they sent his mother that invoice  ms rice said that she believes the city is harassing her because of the civil suit she has against them  and it sure sounds like that this isn t the first time cleveland has responded to the little boy s family with such callousness  when rice filed the lawsuit against the city they blamed tamir s death on himself  claiming he failed  to exercise due care to avoid injury   because apparently it is a child s responsibility to not be shot by a trigger happy police officer who had a history of mental health problems  this  year old was supposed to know that a cop  someone who was supposed to protect him  was going to shoot him without even speaking to him because he looked  scary  the department of justice is still investigating the department and we can only hope that this child finally gets the justice he deserves  we also hope that samaria rice prevails in her civil suit and teaches this disgusting city a lesson  featured image via addicting info archives
