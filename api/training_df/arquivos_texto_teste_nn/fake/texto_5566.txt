pregnant women throughout the america s are threatened by the zika virus  but house republicans couldn t care less and are still holding the bill that would fight the epidemic hostage  the gop released their latest funding proposal on wednesday and the plan proposes cuts to the federal grant that helps low income women access birth control and other family planning services the title x family planning program  which was established more than  years ago  provides reproductive healthcare services to   million patients each year  preventing approximately  million unplanned pregnancies  so naturally  conservatives are hell bent on eliminating title x the huffington post reports   the house appropriations committee proposed cutting the program in its draft labor  health and human services  education and related agencies funding bill for fiscal year   this is the fifth time republicans have attempted to scrap title x  under the gop proposal    million would be cut from programs that focus on preventing teen pregnancies the funding bill does allocate   million for the centers for disease control and prevention to fight the zika virus  but women s health advocates warn that the middle of a zika outbreak is not the time to cut funding for contraception  zika can be transmitted both through mosquitos and sexually  women who become infected with the virus while pregnant can have babies born with severe birth defects  including microcephaly  babies born with microcephaly have malformed brains and abnormally small heads  and they face a lifetime of challenges clare coleman  president of the national family planning   reproductive health association  said that cutting funding smack dab in the middle of the zika outbreak would be  particularly foolish  it is particularly foolish to target title x at a time when the nation is at the precipice of a public health emergency resulting from the zika virus  for the house to propose defunding the very provider network that is being called upon to address and control the risk to women who may be seeking to prevent pregnancy is absurd republicans in congress have such a dislike for title x because some of its funding goes to planned parenthood  which provides abortions among its range of services  none of that money pays for abortions  however  and federal law already prevents these grants from being used to fund abortions according to a statement released by house appropriations chairman hal rogers  r ky    the goal of the funding bill is to reduc discretionary spending by more than half a billion dollars  all the while prioritizing funding where it is needed the most  it follows the responsible lead of the legislation before it   investing in proven  effective programs  rolling back over regulation and overreach by the administration that kills american jobs  and cutting spending to save hard earned taxpayer dollars last month  the house passed a funding proposal for zika that also limits access to contraception  this completely ignores the request by the cdc for money to distribute birth control and condoms in areas stricken by zika dana singiser  a spokeswoman for planned parenthood  called the bill  shameful  politicians who want to eliminate these vital services are working against a solution  and are part of the problem  today s budget bill is shameful and exposes the republican leadership s targeted agenda against family planning providers like planned parenthood  despite their absolutely critical role in limiting the damaging effects of zika virus and continuing to provide access to reproductive health services for those most in need since last year   states have tried to defund planned parenthood  many of the states that are expected to be hardest hit by zika as temperatures rise and mosquitos flourish are also states where  lawmakers have slashed family planning services  chipped away at safe and legal abortion and declined to expand medicaid coverage  featured image via mario tama getty images
