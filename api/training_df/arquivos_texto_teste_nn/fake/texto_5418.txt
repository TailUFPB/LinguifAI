the era of roger ailes at fox news is definitely over after this devastating blow earlier this month  former fox news host gretchen carlson revealed that she was no longer with the conservative network  as it turns out  she had been fired by roger ailes because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him her lawsuit alleges that ailes relentlessly ogled her and treated her like a sexual object in the workplace  she faced constant sexual harassment from ailes and her male colleagues and when she tried to get the harassment to stop ailes told her it would all go away if she would just agree to let him have sex with her  she declined  so ailes fired her from fox   friends and moved her to an unpopular time slot with a pay reduction and more work in order to force her to submit to his demand  after she continued to refuse  ailes fired her from the network entirely  i have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career   carlson said in a statement   although this was a difficult step to take  i had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace  but other women on fox news were not as brave as carlson  they sided with ailes and threw carlson under the bus but the most powerful woman on fox news is no longer remaining quiet and that is bad news for ailes new york magazine reports that megyn kelly has met with attorneys representing the murdochs  who own fox  and told them how roger ailes sexually harassed her when she was a correspondent for the network according to two sources briefed on parent company  century fox s outside probe of the fox news executive  led by new york based law firm paul  weiss  kelly has told investigators that ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at fox  kelly  according to the sources  has described her harassment by ailes in detail as new york magazine notes  this is probably the reason why kelly had remained silent in the wake of the scandal  waiting for the right time to strike  and if the sources are accurate  kelly just delivered the death blow to ailes  career with fox ailes has reportedly been given an august  deadline to resign or he will be fired for just cause and murdoch s attorneys are not done investigating yet so there could be even more revelations to come meanwhile  the paul  weiss lawyers are attempting to interview former fox employees who have stories of harassment but haven t spoken because they signed settlements with ailes s fox attorney  dianne brandi   century fox is now waiving the ndas to allow women to speak if this report is correct it could spell the end of roger ailes at fox news and that would be a good thing for everyone  now let s wait and see how many of ailes  female defenders start attacking megyn kelly featured image via wikimedia
