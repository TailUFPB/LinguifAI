just days after melissa harris perry wrote a scathing indictment of msnbc s willful shift away from powerful and necessary opinions to that of just generic news  the network has responded perry wrote a letter that was released through one of her original producers of her show that explained what she was parting ways with the network  she wrote  here is the reality  our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season  after four years of building an audience  developing a brand  and developing trust with our viewers  we were effectively and utterly silenced  now  msnbc would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes mhp show distinctive  she left the window open  however  to msnbc if they wanted to pull their heads out of their asses  that she may return  she wrote at the end of her letter  while msnbc may believe that i am worthless  i know better  i know who i am  i know why mhp show is unique and valuable  i will not sell short myself or this show  i am not hungry for empty airtime  i care only about substantive  meaningful  and autonomous work  when we can do that  i will return not a moment earlier  i am deeply sorry for the ways that this decision makes life harder for all of you  you mean more to me than you can imagine  however  it looks as though msnbc now wants absolutely nothing to do with her and has cut all ties because harris perry had the audacity to do what she does best  voice her opinion  msnbc executives have now said  she s a brilliant  intelligent but challenging and unpredictable personality there was no plan to cancel her  but adding  it s highly unlikely she will continue   is destructive to our relationship  according to wapo  this executive disputed harris perry s assertion that msnbc executives had not communicated with her  although he said harris perry has never met andrew lack  the nbc news chairman who was rehired by the network last year after the controversy over williams  the decision to preempt harris perry s program for election news coverage over the past several months was made by msnbc s president  phil griffin  all in all  msnbc is blaming harris perry for her own departure  she wasn t willing to bend over backwards to fulfill a narrative set by a company desperate for ratings  and because she had the courage to stand up against it  she s getting punished for having a voice of her own  it s sad  really  melissa harris perry was a necessary and powerful progressive voice that often brought up subjects all too many others are afraid to bring up  she will be missed featured image  youtube
