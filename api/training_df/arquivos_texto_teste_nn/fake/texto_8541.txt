the tennessee house of representatives needs to find a new majority whip after their last one was exposed of having repeatedly sexually harassed young women while he trumpeted  family values  from his political office state rep  jeremy durham formally announced he would be stepping down from his leadership role  but not giving up his seat in the legislature  after an investigation by the tennessean found that he had repeatedly sent sexual texts to at least three women  oftentimes late at night one woman in her mid   who worked in various capacities at the statehouse  said during the  legislative session  durham repeatedly sent text messages and facebook messages  sometimes late into the night one text message  after  p m   says he misses her in another text  at about   a m   durham asks her for pictures another of durham s victims reported that the politician sent her  dozens  of texts in a similar vein  in fact  he seemed so persistent that it s a wonder he had time to work in between bouts of sexual harassment a text from durham  sent at about  a m   asks the woman for pictures  for me  i was just trying to engage professionally  from one professional to another  and he crossed the line  you don t text and constantly message on facebook and ask to meet up at bars in the evening   the woman said  he would come up with these ideas and i would just be like   are you crazy    all three women said they did not make formal complaints against durham because they feared what he and his fellow politicians might do when they found out  when one victim finally did alert leaders in the tennessee legislature  it became clear that their fears were well founded  rather than immediately attempt to get to the bottom of it  the politicians quickly convened with lawyers and concluded that the best course of action was to silence her  when a colleague floated the idea of letting the victim address the republican caucus  they dismissed it out of hand  i think the general response was that it would be a bad precedent  just to get somebody who shows up at a caucus meeting and goes after a member  without going through a formal process   mccormick said the  formal process  wound up accomplishing nothing  it took the explosive report in the tennessean to kickstart durham s downfall this isn t durham s first run in with scandal  just two years ago  the republican rising star was turned in by a pharmacist for trying to forge a drug prescription  when police arrived  durham had a meltdown that was   in all its glory   caught on tape   a grand jury later refused to indict him  shocking  right on cue  durham blamed the  liberal media  for his latest problems  having been let off the hook before  it s looking as if durham is expecting to weather this storm as well  he may have miscalculated  adding to the bizarre spectacle happening in the tennessee gop  durham appears to have been stripped of his post while he was busy watching football  when reporters called his house to ask about his resignation  it was all news to him  i m talking it over with my family but have not made a decision  nothing should ve gone out  watching broncos game at the moment  family values conservative getting caught doing anything but valuing families has become a painfully common hypocrisy for the republican party  while politicians of all stripes have moral failings  conservatives have long propped themselves up on the idea that they are ethically superior than their liberal counterparts  the concept  ludicrous on its face  has only become more absurd with every scandal feature image via wsmv channel  screenshot
