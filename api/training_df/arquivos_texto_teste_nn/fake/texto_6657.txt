actor  activist and one of liberal america s strongest social media advocates george takei has long supported the presidential primary campaign of bernie sanders  but this week  he has delivered a powerful message to his fellow bernie supporters  it s time to admit the campaign is over  and unite behind hillary clinton in a video released to his over  million facebook followers  takei made an impassioned plea to both bernie and hillary supporters  to treat each other with respect and civility  ultimately  we democrats know that a bit of a tussle isn t a bad thing   it makes us stronger  keeps us sharp   he said   and really  it s like a family squabble  where only family   those very close to us   can truly get under our skin  but remember this  too  it s precisely because we like and respect each other that the words and criticisms sting as much as they do  the video message came in response to hillary clinton securing victory over bernie sanders on four of the five recent primary states  as clinton moves ever nearer to victory  it seems the fight between supporters is reaching fever pitch   with fairly toxic commentary on both sides it s okay for us to argue passionately for our beliefs  we don t hold them lightly  the differences between the clinton and sanders campaigns are not cosmetic  they go to the core of sincerely held and contrary views about how we share this nation   wealth inequality  national security  foreign policy  israel  these are not marginal issues  and the candidates have very different proposals for the country for some on either side  those views are so contrary that they would rather vote republican  or not at all  than for the opposing candidate  while that feels extreme  it is understandable but takei advises that we consider what america will look like after election day if liberal acrimony secures a victory for the likes of donald trump or ted cruz  the common ground between sanders and clinton is something we should not simply take for granted as we argue over the other issues  the separation of church and state  women s reproductive rights  lgbt and civil rights   here is our common ground in   takei urges his fellow sanders supporters to recall the words of their own candidate   that on her very worst day  hillary clinton is an infinitely better candidate and president than the republican candidate on his best day  if bernie believes that  his supporters can  too   takei adds it s tough in a two party system  the churches on both sides of the aisle are broader than any single candidate can reconcile  the question is not  do we agree on everything   but  do we agree on enough  george takei and bernie sanders argue that we do featured image via screengrab
