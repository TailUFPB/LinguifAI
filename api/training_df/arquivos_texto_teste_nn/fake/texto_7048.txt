on wednesday night  daily show correspondent jessica williams took on the absolutely ridiculous  bathroom bills  that gop lawmakers have made their focus in their quest to harass and discriminate against the lgbt community  it seems that the more visibility that the transgender community gets  the more energy republican legislators put into proposing anti transgender bills to police what bathrooms they can and can t use to try to understand exactly why this is  williams spoke to several trans people and one of their biggest opponents  chaplain and state rep  gordon klingenschmitt  r co   williams confronted the transphobic lawmaker about his belief that transgender people are merely  confused   and completely destroyed him  in expressing his asinine and twisted religious beliefs  klingenschmitt told williams just why transgender people were such a threat to the rest of the country  they not only want to be confused about their own identity  but they want the rest of us to be confused with them  now they want the government to join them on that pretense  they re making us into liars  interesting   because when williams actually asked trans people what they wanted  all they said was respect  they weren t trying to  confuse  or trick anyone about their identity  and insisted that their gender identity was not actually a choice  research can confirm this  klingenschmitt wanted to go more into the discussion of religion  but insisted on changing first  he said  i would be comfortable talking about religious freedom  but i have to change into my alter ego  williams waited for him  to transition so he would feel more comfortable during our interview   while klingenschmitt remained completely clueless to how ironic the situation had become when williams questioned klingenschmitt about why he was so passionate about passing transphobic legislation  he replied  i mean  that is perversion  it s people who label themselves as transgender for the purpose of getting that access to violate the rights of others  williams then targeted his role as a chaplain and asked him   is it fair to say that if you re a priest you re a pedophile   klingenschmitt said no  and williams asked him why  he replied  because some people are criminals  and some people are not criminals  klingenschmitt then said he was unable to apply that same logic to the trans community because  they re apples and oranges  williams was able to gather that klingenschmitt s concern was that policies allowing trans women to use bathrooms that match their gender identity would result in sexual assault   even though there have literally been no reported instances where sexual assault has happened as a result of this you can watch her dismantle the gop s anti trans panic below the daily show with trevor noah get more  the daily show full episodes the daily show on facebook the daily show video archive featured image via screen capture
