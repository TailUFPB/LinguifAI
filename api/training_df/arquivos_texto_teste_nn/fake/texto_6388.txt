in an apparent attempt to prove to the world that he is the devil himself  george zimmerman recently decided to auction off the gun he used to murder trayvon martin  the move has been universally condemned by everyone who is not a heartless monster fortunately  some brilliant individuals decided to hijack the online auction for the weapon  mocking the gun s sale with fake bids  the top bid for the gun was made by someone named  racist mcshootface  in the amount of   million dollars  as hilarious as the monkey wrenching shenanigans are  it is saddening to know that there is money to be made  so the gun will eventually be sold and zimmerman will go on living his new life of luxury and infamy however  one individual released a plan to turn this terrible event in history into an opportunity to do some good in the world  shane claiborne  a christian activist released a post on his facebook page where he writes that he and others had planned on attempting to win zimmerman s gun in the online auction  from there  they would work with rawtools  a company that turns firearms into tools the idea of turning weapons into tools come from the biblical verse isaiah   he will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples  they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks  nation will not take up sword against nation  nor will they train for war anymore some christian peace activists live by this verse  encouraging nations and individuals to lay down their weapons and work towards creating world peace as claiborne points out in the post  there is one major flaw with this plan  there has been a twitter storm of folks suggesting we should acquire the gun and beat it into a plow with our friends at rawtools   claiborne writes   initially  that seemed like a powerful idea   to destroy this horrific icon of injustice  and make sure it doesn t take another life  we even had some donors offering to buy it  but then we heard the money was going to be used to fight many of the groups and movements we believe in  like black lives matter  claiborne then writes that a new plan was eventually formed  i have to say  as far as b plans go  it s a pretty good one  we are going to take a  pistol identical to zimmerman s  beat it into a plow  auction it off  and donate the money to trayvon martin s family foundation  last night we sent out the invitation to donate handguns and just got the news that we have had  guns donated overnight  thanks to benjamin l  corey and all who donated so far  and all  of the guns are  pistols   by the way  keep  em coming  email here to donate    my friends at rawtools  inc  will be transforming the pistol  and will start the bidding within the next week or so  what a great idea  this just proves that no matter how much hatred and misery some people put out into this world  there are others willing to push back with acts of love and compassion here is the original facebook post https   www facebook com shaneclaiborne photos a      type  theaterfeatured image from rawtools via facebook
