it what can only be seen as completely unacceptable  one of the top nfl draft prospects was just asked by an nfl coach if they were gay during a meeting  eli apple  star cornerback coming out of ohio state  met with an atlanta falcons coach last week  according to apple  the coach who has not yet been identified  asked him point blank   so do you like men  apple told comcast sportsnet  i ve been asked a lot of weird questions  i don t know if i could say on tv  the falcons coach  one of the coaches  was like   so do you like men   it was like the first thing he asked me  it was weird  i was just like   no   he was like   if you re going to come to atlanta  sometimes that s how it is around here  you re going to have to get used to it   i guess he was joking but they just ask most of these questions to see how you re going to react  how did this coach think that question would  in any way  be appropriate  if apple were gay  which he is not  what difference would it make  and for that to be one of the first things asked is just beyond odd fortunately  falcons head coach dan quinn was equally as appalled as pretty much everyone else finding out about this line of question and released the following statement regarding what happened with apple  i am really disappointed in the question that was asked by one of our coaches  i have spoken to the coach that interviewed eli apple and explained to him how inappropriate and unprofessional this was  i have reiterated this to the entire coaching staff and i want to apologize to eli for this even coming up  this is not what the atlanta falcons are about and it is not how we are going to conduct ourselves  hopefully  the coach who asked this inappropriate line of questions receives more of a consequence than just a stern talking to  but at least quinn is willing to acknowledge the fault in this line of questioning to any player  regardless of sexual orientation  add this to the long list of things the nfl needs to work on featured image  evan habeeb usa today sports
