when dr  ben carson was in the race for the republican nomination  donald trump unleashed a barrage of accusations against the neurosurgeon  going after him aggressively and even comparing him to a pedophile  that s why many were bewildered when carson endorsed trump after he dropped out of the race for the nomination  yet  not only has carson endorsed trump s candidacy  he defends trump and his vile campaign even at the worst of moments in the latest of a series of bizarre moves  carson defended trump s campaign manager corey lewandowski during a cnn interview on thursday  saying that being charged with assault against a female reporter did not make lewandowski  evil   carson said   i don t see any reason  quite frankly that we should demonize him  if you can come up with a good reason  i ll listen to it  co host john berman pointed out   well  look  he s been charged with misdemeanor assault  a lot of people think that is a reason   carson then went on a bizarre tangent saying   a lot of people have been charged with various things  you ve probably been charged with with something too  maybe with a misdemeanor or something  it doesn t mean that you are an evil horrible person  the stunned berman responded   i actually haven t been charged with anything  you have to ask   what in the world did trump offer carson to make him sell himself in such a manner  we have to keep in mind that carson is not only defending trump  who has spewed racism and bigotry throughout his campaign but in this particular case  he s defending someone who committed assault on camera the adage  if you can t beat them then join them  is clearly on display here but nothing is worth the price of selling your soul  something carson has clearly done in this case  watch video here   featured image via screencapture
