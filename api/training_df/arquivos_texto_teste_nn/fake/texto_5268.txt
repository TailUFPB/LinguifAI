by now  all of us know that trump is a complete a  hole  even his brainless  delusional supporters are aware of this  and it s one of the things they love most about him  perhaps this is the only thing we ll ever agree on when it comes to trump   that the guy is just a total douchebag  but according to some recent comments  there s actually one person who thinks trump has been pleasant and nice so far in this campaign   donald trump himself just a day after democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton wrapped up her wildly successful and historical democratic national convention  trump channeled his jealousy and rage into a ridiculous speech while at a rally in colorado  implying that trump felt he s been nothing but cordial this far  the brash business mogul said  i m taking the gloves off  take the gloves off  right  taking the gloves off  just remember this  trump is gonna be no more mr  nice guy  this of course  follows the epic temper tantrum trump threw on twitter  trump got himself all riled up as his rant continued  begging his followers to  tell hillary i m not gonna be nice anymore    as if clinton has somehow mistaken trump for a genuine  honest and friendly human being  he spewed  i ve been very nice to her  so you ready  actually  some of the folks i defeated they probably would say   boy  he was not very nice  they keep screaming  and you know what i do  i ve been nice  but after watching that performance last night   such lies   i don t have to be so nice anymore  obviously threatened by how much clinton is being praised not only by democrats but by republicans as well  trump used one of the only things he could against her by bringing up her email scandal  which has already been cleared by the fbi several times  trump said  i ve been saying let s just beat her on nov    but you know what  you know what  i m starting to agree with you  i ll tell you  sorry to say  you can watch trump s speech below it s hard to imagine how trump is going to manage being more offensive and awful  but he has always managed to up the ante in the past  so it looks like we re going to find out  either way  after the power and confidence we saw in clinton last night at the dnc  there s no one better to take on trump featured image via alex wong   getty images
