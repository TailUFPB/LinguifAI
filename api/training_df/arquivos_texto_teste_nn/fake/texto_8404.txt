on the day of the iowa caucus  sarah palin visited the today show to stump for her new best friend  donald trump  unfortunately  palin seemed under the impression that she was allowed to dictate what the hosts asked her about  hosts matt lauer and savannah guthrie weren t having it palin  who often claims the media is against her by asking her questions she doesn t know the answers to  got off to a rocky start almost immediately  when the hosts challenged her on several issues that made both trump and palin look like raging hypocrites  at one point  a frustrated palin asked the hosts  who are we to judge one another s level of christian faith     the scalding steam of irony coming from a person who once spent a great deal of time trying to suggest president obama was a secret muslim was hot enough to melt steel but things took a dramatic turn when guthrie asked about her son track  who was recently just arrested for beating his girlfriend and threatening to shoot himself in the head with an ar   palin  ever the spindoctor  blamed the ugly incident on wait for it obama  at a trump rally  the one time vice presidential candidate claimed track came back from iraq messed up because obama didn t respect the troops enough when guthrie asked her to clarify those baffling remarks  palin became extremely angry  you guys brought me here to talk about iowa politics and the caucus tonight  not to talk about my kids   she fired back  and that was a promise  but as things go in the world of media  you guys don t always keep your promises  evidently   palin added watch  sarahpalinusa speak out on today in exclusive interview   iowatoday https   t co   today   todayshow  february    went on to claim the media lied when they said she blamed obama then immediately doubled down  what i have blamed president obama in doing   she said  putting her foot slowly in her mouth on live television   is this level of disrespect for the united states military that is made manifest in gutting budgets and not trying to beef it up and let our military do the job that they are trained to do  to be clear  the  budgets  that obama has cut have been on the level of wasteful spending on  say  military vehicles that even the pentagon says it didn t need  on the flipside  republicans in congress have killed the budget for supporting veterans  like palin s son  when they come home  repeatedly  conservative lawmakers have cited  big government  and  out of control spending  to justify slashing funds to veteran s affairs and other bills meant to help wounded servicemembers  there is certainly a lack of respect for the soldiers coming back from iraq and afghanistan   but it s not coming from the white house as usual  palin uses her own victim complex serve as a security blanket she can hide under when questions get to tough  palin has repeatedly blamed president obama for hurting the troops  that s a serious accusation and a fair one for reporters to question  the criticisms themselves may be pathetic  but her refusal to tolerate any pushback on them is even more embarrassing if trump had hoped palin would be a big asset to his campaign  so far it hasn t appeared that way  at almost every appearance  palin s performance has been a trainwreck  on the today show  she was at least able to string two sentences together without devolving into a hopeless wordsalad  but it s pretty sad that this is considered a victory for her  she still came across looking angry  bitter  and clueless featured image via video screen capture
