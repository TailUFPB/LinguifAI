the founding fathers are rolling in their graves during an interview with leslie stahl on  minutes which will air on sunday evening  donald trump once again blamed president obama for isis and vowed to declare war on the terrorist organization since obama will not  we re going to declare war against isis   trump said   we have to wipe out isis  there s just one big problem with that promise  it s blatantly unconstitutional for some reason every republican in america seems to think that president obama has the power to declare war  and that means none of the republicans who proudly carry pocket versions of the constitution with them have never actually read it article i  section  clearly states that only congress has the power to declare war  the congress shall have power   to declare war  grant letters of marque and reprisal  and make rules concerning captures on land and water that s what the constitution says but just like fox news host jeanine pirro  who somehow became an attorney and judge  said on friday when she whined about president obama not declaring war on isis  trump seems to think the president has that power it s asinine  and it is something most people learn in middle school  if he wants to blame anyone for not declaring war he should blame republicans in congress  it s their job and if they are really that scared of isis they should do it oh  but there s more president obama can only do so much to fight isis without a declaration of war from the lazy bums who control congress right now and he s doing it by ordering airstrikes  sending military advisers  gathering intelligence  authorizing drone strikes  and working with our allies  all of this is combating isis to the point where they are close to being forced underground and their recruiting and finances are suffering and to hear trump talk  that s all he plans to do as well  trump avoided saying he would use troops in a ground war against isis but bragged that his intelligence network would somehow be stronger even though the american intelligence apparatus is the strongest it has ever been  i am going to have very few troops on the ground  trump said   we re going to have unbelievable intelligence  which we need  which  right now  we don t have  we don t have the people over there  trump also seems to think beating isis is as easy as surrounding them as if they are a country and he claims he ll get nato involved  we re going to have surrounding states and  very importantly  get nato involved because we support nato far more than we should  frankly  because you have a lot of countries that aren t doing what they re supposed to be doing  we have to wipe out isis  first of all  isis is present in several countries  you can t just surround them  it s more complicated then that  beating isis isn t going to happen in days  weeks  or even months  it s going to take a long time  we are talking about an organization that is scattered around and no american president can just force nato to do anything  and threatening to pull money or support from nato just because you aren t getting your way isn t how international cooperation works  that s how spoiled brats act mike pence then chimed in by blaming president obama and hillary clinton for isis  the larger issue here is declining american power in the world  i truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil  and whether it be the horrific attack in france  the inspired attacks here in the united states  the instability in turkey that led to a coup   i think that is all a result of a foreign policy of hillary clinton and barack obama that has led from behind and that has sent an inexact  unclear message  about american resolve  here s the video via youtube but president obama did not create the atmosphere in the middle east that allowed isis to rise in the first place  that responsibility falls at the feet of president bush  who pushed for war in iraq and the republican controlled congress that approved it the unnecessary war with iraq destabilized the region and created a power vacuum that isis took advantage of  plus  it was president bush who signed the status of forces agreement with iraq that led to the complete withdrawal of troops from iraq so not only does trump fail at american government  he fails at american history  too featured image via screenshot
