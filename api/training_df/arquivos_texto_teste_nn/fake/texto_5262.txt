he s a republican  he s anti gay  he s all about  family values   so of course he just got busted for having a sex video of himself on his work computer nebraska gop state senator bill kintner is being urged to resign by republican governor pete ricketts after the nebraska state patrol discovered a sexually explicit video of kintner on the government computer he uses for work according to the lincoln journal star a source familiar with the situation said kintner told investigators about the video when he asked the nebraska state patrol for help with computer problems in july  the patrol confirmed friday that kintner had sought help for  what he believed to be a potential internet scam that occurred while the senator was in massachusetts using his state computer  having such a video on his work computer is a violation of nebraska law  but it appears that governor ricketts and kintner both ignored the law and hid the investigation from the public since last november when the discovery of the video was made only on friday did ricketts actually publicly call for kintner to resign  due to the ongoing investigation of this issue  i have been unable to say anything publicly  if the allegations are true  senator kintner needs to resign  the violation and the cover up has democrats calling for more than just kintner s resignation  it is not enough for sen  kintner to resign in shame  anyone that knew this information and continued to let him sit in office must also resign   nebraska democratic party chair jane kleeb said in a statement   did gov  ricketts or his staff look the other way so they had  kintner s  vote in the unicameral  this is so serious  in fact  that the state patrol has turned out their findings to the accountability and disclosure commission and and ethics investigation is underway this is also incredibly hypocritical considering kintner constantly brags about being a conservative  christian  who has urged christian owned businesses to provide gay customers bad service on purpose and once told the journal star that his parents  taught me the moral absolutes of christianity  and i just applied those to everything  except himself  apparently featured image  youtube
