always eager to use a tragedy to erode the constitution  immediately after the terror attack in brussels  republican senator tom cotton renewed calls to pick out the  safe  refugees and let them come to america  what makes them  safe   why  they ll be christians  of course  i think the u s  has a moral imperative to try and save these christians and the other small minority groups   he said   so i would create a special kind of visa program that wouldn t take any access away from anyone else in the united states  but would recognize that christians   like jews in the soviet union   are being singled out for persecution and elimination  that s in our interest  as it is in combating the islamic state  that is  of course  total bullshit  isis has been slaughtering muslims by the thousands for not being extreme enough  sure  they re killing every other religion they find  but the majority of their violence is reserved for their fellow muslims curiously  cotton seems to be lacking any and all empathy for them  almost like he doesn t consider muslims to be people  that s really the only way to talk about  moral imperatives  while ignoring the bulk of the victims of religious violence that must be why he was one of the numerous republicans that demanded all syrian refugees be turned away from the united states   including children that were accused of being tiny terrorists  where was his  moral imperative  then of course  once this proposal fails  cotton will hold it up as  proof  that christianity is under attack in america  don t you see  the only possible reason for not granting special privileges to christians must be that liberals are trying to wipe out christians  there s no way the constitutional and  actual  moral prohibition against treating any one religion as superior  or inferior  could be involved i wish i could say that this is an isolated incident but the two leading candidates for the republican nomination  donald trump and ted cruz  were just as repulsive in the wake of the attack  one insulted the stricken city of brussels and the other attacked islam and obama  very classy by comparison  tom cotton almost seems like a human being instead of a callous monster featured image via ai archives
