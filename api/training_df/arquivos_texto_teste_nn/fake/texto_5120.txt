donald trump is hemorrhaging republican supporters faster than his casinos hemorrhage money  he s losing in almost all polls  including in many swing and republican states  but to trump  that means stay the course republicans in the public eye are making a very public appeal to americans  asking everyone to support hillary clinton  mostly for one major reason  trump doesn t have the temperament for the presidency americans agree  after a disastrous two weeks following the republican national convention  where trump attacked a gold star family  took a purple heart from its recipient and lied about ransom money being handed to iran  his poll numbers are tanking  he s now behind by double digits  did i mention he also ejected a baby from a rally it s even gotten to the point where many serious people  including president obama  are questioning trump s mental fitness  that s not something political opponents typically speculate about  but trump is clearly an exception yes  trump is having a really  really bad time  but to him  that means nothing  after all  he s gotten this far being a xenophobic asshole  why let a sinking ship tempt him to plug the holes in his campaign  trump  naturally  disagrees with his critics  i think that my temperament has gotten me here   trump said during a phone interview on fox business s  mornings with maria  we beat a lot of people in the primaries and now we have one person left  and we re actually doing pretty well there  but we ll see how it all comes out   the republican presidential nominee said  i certainly don t think it s appropriate to start changing all of a sudden when you ve been winning   trump said   i think it s going to work out well  source  the hillhere s the video the only real pivot coming from the trump campaign is that he s trying to sound like bernie sanders  he accuses all the republicans turning against him of being  insiders   whose opinions shouldn t matter to trump s angry anti establishment voters trump s refusal to acknowledge that he needs to win a broader support only adds fuel to the fire of the idea that he s unprepared for the presidency  he won  million votes during the primaries  which is a lot for primaries  but it s not even a drop in the bucket for the general election  where more than  times that many people will likely vote  if trump has a chance in hell of winning  he has to tone down his rhetoric  not that we re cheering for that featured image via joe readle at getty images
