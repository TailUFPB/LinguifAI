rick scott has been governor of florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism  while the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of hiv and the number of people dying from aids drops  florida is seeing the reverse in a comprehensive review of how scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding  the miami herald discovered two disturbing facts  florida now leads the nation in hiv cases  and its biggest county  miami dade  is ground zero new cases last year totaled    the highest since   miami dade and broward together account for  percent of that total although florida is among the nation s fastest growing states  scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force  and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the department of health the  county health departments  largely funded by the state health agency  have declined to   positions compared to   in the year scott took office  it s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services   said sen  oscar braynon  d miami gardens   we have a rise in aids and we have a reduction in public health spending  we re now cutting just to be cutting  indeed  scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers  he s a tax cutting superstar in the same vein as kansas governor sam brownback  who imploded his state s economy  and michigan governor rick snyder  whose neglect poisoned an entire city  however  he differs from his fellow conservative tax slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had  at least brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth  in a disturbing reminder of the reagan era  when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the aids epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy  scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in hiv cases  or perhaps he s just grown used to it  after his first year in office  the number of hiv cases has grown hand over fist making matters worse  scott has routinely fought against working with obamacare in his state  for years  all the while  hiv cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold  this spells disasters for the victims of hiv because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier aids illness is careful health management  you can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the president as we ve seen around the country  republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it  far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self determination  states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate   it s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad   but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful   oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay feature image via gage skidmore flickr
