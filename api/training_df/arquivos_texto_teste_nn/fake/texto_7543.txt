what s happening within the donald trump campaign is absolutely disgraceful  the republican front runner has been openly condoning violence at his rallies  going so far as to say he would even pay the legal fees of those going after protesters then there s the issue of trump s utter racism which is obvious and abhorrent  he s consistently going after minority groups  blaming them for all the nation s problems  and somehow trump and his overwhelmingly white group of supporters are apparently the ones who are being oppressed  this is literally reminiscent of another fascist ideologue from europe in the  and  and of course  trump s son  donald trump jr   is defending his father the whole way   and completely cementing the fact that they believe the aggression is against them and not the other way around  however  the brilliant and talented john legend took a moment to step in and school them on what is actually going on   donaldjtrumpjr i think they were protesting your racist father  this isn t complicated   john legend   johnlegend  march    of course  some jackass decides to just blindly call legend uneducated because he had the audacity to disagree with trump and trump junior  so the grammy award winner tweets out a very interesting and funny fact     donaldjtrumpjr the donalds and i graduated from the same university  funny enough   john legend   johnlegend  march    then drives the point home  after what can only be assumed hundreds of tweet replies telling him that he is really the racist  by posting an article about how donald trump turned away people of color  thus exposing who the true racist is  yes  trump trolls  i m the real racist  https   t co   john legend   johnlegend  march    is alive and well in america  in particular among those supporting donald trump  and this racism isn t new  it hasn t been brought about by anyone  it never went away  but rather into hiding  however  with people like donald trump openly spewing his racist rhetoric at any chance he can get  it opened the floodgates for racists everywhere to feel that behavior is now somehow acceptable but guess what  we are in the year   and racism will be called out  this isn t an infringement on any constitutional right  in fact  it is the right of the protesters to openly dissent and condemn racism where it stands featured image via instagram instagram twitter
