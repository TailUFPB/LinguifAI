donald trump is an unapologetic islamophobic bigot  he has called for a ban on all muslims   including citizens who might be abroad   entering the united states  and now  the donald is insisting on doubling down on the lie that american soldiers killed muslims with bullets dipped in pig s blood  this is particularly significant  because according to islam  eating or coming into contact with pork is forbidden during a rally on the campaign in charleston  south carolina  trump rallied his army of racist supporters  and doubled down on the blatant the lie that american general john pershing led the mass murder and added insult to injury at their time of death with the pig s blood  he took  bullets  and he dipped them in pig s blood  and he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the  people  and they shot  of those people  and the  person he said  you go back to your people and you tell them what happened   and for  years there wasn t a problem  ok  trump had the perfect crowd to sell his hatred to  as he always does   people who hate muslims with a passion and believe them to be the doom of america  the whole point behind stoking the fires of anger at that south carolina rally was to make sure people understood that he has as much contempt for muslims and their faith as his bigoted followers do this is a lie that was started during the rise of post    islamophobia  which trump has happily reignited  fact checking site snopes notes that the bigoted and untrue idea of subduing militant muslims by threatening to bury them with pigs has held currency for many years  well  despite the fact that none of this is true regarding general pershing  the idea still persists in the scary era of the very real possibility of bigot in chief donald trump becoming president of the united states  this is just another reason that trump s persistent front runner status should terrify us all featured image via screen capture from ai archives
