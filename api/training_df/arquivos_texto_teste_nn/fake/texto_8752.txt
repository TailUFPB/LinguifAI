fox business held their second republican debate  and things went off the rails almost immediately just a half hour in  donald trump was asked to address the comments he made alleging that fellow candidate sen  ted cruz was not legally allowed to run for president because he was born in canada  cruz defended his eligibility by pointing out that the constitutional requirement to run for president has always been interpreted to mean children of american citizens born in foreign countries were considered u s  citizens just like anyone else  in one of the biggest burns of the night  cruz went a step further by pointing out that some of the more  extreme  birther theories that trump s fans support hold that not only does a child need to be born in the united states  but both parents need to be born in the country as well  by that logic  cruz said  donald trump would be disqualified himself  because his mother was born in scotland trump was not happy feigning concern for cruz  trump claims that if he were to choose cruz as his vice presidential candidate  the democrats would  sue  because we can t take him along for the ride   trump later claimed that if cruz were to win the presidency  he would possibly face being kicked after a lawsuit over his eligibility  the entire auditorium was booing  but the jeers had been going on so long it was impossible to tell if they were meant for trump  cruz  or for the painful death of brain cells happening to everyone watching by this point  the republican debate had come to a complete standstill  no questions were being asked  no other candidates were allowed to speak  donald trump and ted cruz  the two front runners  were arguing on national television about birther conspiracy theories  as far as television goes  it was entertaining stuff  as far as the fate of the country goes  it was chilling watch the surreal fight below feature image via screengrab
