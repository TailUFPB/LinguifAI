the unexpected passing of justice antonin scalia has added yet another layer to the incompetence republicans display when it comes to governing  this time  however  it s not about a spending issue or an executive order they don t like  there s no looming shutdown or invented ebola crisis  this time  the gop is threatening the very core of our democracy rachel maddow is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and influential political minds of our time  her thoughts are insightful and her opinions intertwined with logic and reason  in other words  she s the anti hannity or o reilly  limbaugh  beck or any other of a host of propagandists spewing the lie of the day in this segment  maddow breaks down why republican obstruction of an obama supreme court nominee is not only incredibly arrogant  it s also very dangerous for us as a nation  our democracy is built on a government of three branches  when one of those branches can t function because of the ongoing threat of a tie  anything from abortion law to gun control and yes  even the outcome of a presidential election could hang in the balance watch rachel maddow make a case for just how dangerous it is to go into a national election with a vacant seat on the supreme court many of us wake up in a cold sweat after nightmares of the outcome of the  election  the supreme court was ultimately left to decide the fate of american politics for the next four years and the result was disastrous  but  there was a result what would happen if there was a   tie in the supreme court after a state like florida was contested  the decision would then revert back to the lower court s decision  which had already been accepted for review by the higher court the resulting circle of legal quagmire could leave us facing severe consequences  especially when republicans figure out they can send their appeals strategically to lower court judges they know will side with them automatically without the  seat on the supreme court filled we can expect legal battles to arise in districts where there should be none  simply because the judges of that circuit will be able to negate the wishes of the people with no recourse from the high court and the kooks of the right think obama had a good reason to have scalia assassinated featured image from screen capture
