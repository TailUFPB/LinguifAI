on wednesday  bernie sanders supporters showed just what classy and decent people they were when they stuck up for sanders  democratic rival hillary clinton   and also took a stand for women all over the world in the process this happened when a man was spotted holding a disgustingly misogynistic sign that protested the presidential campaign of former secretary of state at one of her rallies in buena park  california  his sign read   women are not fit to be president  and  president   man s job   here s the awful sign  as posted to twitter by abc s liz kreutz man holds  women are not fit to be president  sign outside clinton s rally pic twitter com   liz kreutz   abcliz  may     a group of sanders  fans were at clinton s rally to support bernie   and although they weren t backing clinton  they knew what needed to be done when they saw this misogynist in action  in the video below  you ll see sanders supporters confront the sexist anti clinton protester  and destroy his sign to show that sexism and leaving women out of politics is a thing of the past  he is shamed  mocked and berated for his oppressive attitudes toward women as sanders  supporters teach him a lesson he ll never forget  one woman can even be heard saying   he s a f cking teacher  did you see what his sign said  you can watch the video here  some of the sanders supporters protesting clinton tore up the man s  women are not fit to be president  sign pic twitter com   liz kreutz   abcliz  may    man wasn t identified  but kreutz reported shortly after posting the video that  the man would not give his name but some people here identified him as a local high school ap calculus teacher   this caused many people on social media to respond with things like   he needs to be fired now  there s no way girls in his ap calculus class are being treated fairly or constitutionally  later that day  kreutz was able to reach him   and his cowardly response was that his sign was a joke    which seriously makes me wonder if this guy might be a donald trump fan bernie sanders  supporters might not have been there for hillary  but they definitely did something honorable   not just for her  but for all women  thanks to them  this right wing nut has been properly shamed and this video has gone viral  hopefully  his school district will find out and he will be fired before his sexist attitude can threaten the futures of any more women and girls featured image via twitter
