ted nugent is a mentally unstable man with almost as many insecurities as guns  his frequent rants run the gamut of violent and racist talking points  he s threatened to kill hillary clinton  he s threatened to kill president obama  there isn t a minority group that he hasn t tried to incite his rabid all white  all conservative fanbase into attacking  verbally or otherwise  but something is happening that may finally make nugent shut the hell up following his latest racist rant  this time focused on jewish liberals  calling them  soulless sheep to the slaughter   and posting a picture of holocaust victims  just to make sure his low intelligence followers really got it   the backlash came not only from liberals   who are constantly calling nugent out for his disgusting views   but also from the people who typically defend him  fellow conservatives nugent must have assumed this was just another mundane backlash so he characteristically told his critics  eat me   he may want to rethink that  instead of just shouting at him on social media  they did something far more terrifying for the gun obsessed lunatic  they are calling on the nra to kick him out up until now  the nra could be forgiven for having tolerated nugent s excesses  he is  after all  a rock star rather than a politician  and his passion for the second amendment has been admirable  it takes all sorts to make a movement   those who can offer the visceral case are just as important as those who can crunch the numbers and parse the laws  but there is always a line somewhere  and nugent has unapologetically leaped across it as media matters documented  even far right gun groups have spoken out against nugent s latest anti semitic smears  if the nra had hoped to be able to weather this storm and continue to keep nugent as one of the members of their board  yeah  he s a board member of the organization    it doesn t look like they are going to get any defense from their allies  everyone wants him gone his  haters  were even more adamant  the coalition to stop gun violence released a strong statement condemning nugent and started a petition to have the nra drop him from their ranks  tell the nra  the repeated racist statements of nra board member ted nugent are grossly offensive and intolerable  remove him from your board of directors  which probably terrifies nugent who  underneath his tough talk  has always been a coward for him  the nra represents the last vestige of respectability  as more and more of his former supporters distance themselves from his ugly behavior  he needs the nra to be on his side  without them he will look like what he is  a has been musician who needs serious psychiatric help  he s not an  ambassador  for gun rights  he s not a  board member  of a large organization  just a sad  angry racist shouting into an increasingly empty room while it s frustrating to watch nugent repeatedly slur minorities  it will feel extremely gratifying to watch one of these unhinged rants finally destroy the only thing he loves  his nra membership card feature image via flickr
