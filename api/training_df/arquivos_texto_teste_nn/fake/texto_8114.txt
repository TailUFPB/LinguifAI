ever since the end of the ridiculous exercise in futility and extremism that was the armed occupation of a federal bird sanctuary in oregon  conservatives have been screaming from the rooftops that the evil federal government is persecuting patriots  sure  the militants repeatedly declared war on the federal government  sure  they were establishing a colony of armed and dangerous insurgents  many of whom couldn t legally own guns in the first place  sure  they were surrounding themselves with children they intended to use as human shields  sure  they resisted demands from locals that they leave and spent most of their time begging for free stuff and disturbing historical artifacts this anti government effort cost one person   a violent and dangerous individual whose foster children  or  as he called them  his primary source of sweet  sweet dollar signs  were taken from him after he abandoned them to join the revolution   his life  dozens of the terrorists are now facing upwards of a decade in prison  including the original welfare cowboy  cliven bundy  who attempted to join the occupation after most insurgents had turned tail and fled a message from    to the  harney county  oregon  burns  intel channel of messaging app zello reveals that conservatives have more in mind than simply hanging out with a bunch of ducks   they want to  lynch  the president like  i woke up this morning i woke up and went down to the coffee shop and sat around with a bunch of old ranchers and a bunch of people from the area this morning and had some discussions with them and all i can say is they re all ready to march into that white house and take that son of a bitch and lynch him publicly  and that s a matter of fact the message seems to be from a man by the name of dustin armour  who uses the same username and photo on facebook as the zello account from which the message originated  armour loves his confederate flag  hate  blacks   and proudly supports domestic terrorist lavoy finicum  who was shot by federal agents after he attempted to pull a gun on them     according to his okcupid profile  armour has no problem with  someone who has vocalized a strong negative bias toward a certain race of people   he has no problem with racist jokes  and he is an  all around redneck  who loves  a good horror movie and some snacks    the latter bit  of course  being something that would make him quite popular with the oregon terrorists  who also love snacks  posts to right wing extremist groups reveal that armour also believes the government controls the weather conservatives are crazy   especially the ones who are stupid enough to support armed terrorists  but to suggest that the president should be  lynched  is an unfortunate position for them to take  no matter what their political leanings listen to the clip below featured image via screengrab
