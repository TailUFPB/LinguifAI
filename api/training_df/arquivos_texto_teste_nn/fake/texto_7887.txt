donald trump made a pathetic appearance at regent university  where he spoke with televangelist pat robertson about antonin scalia  supreme court justices and uttered some pitifully stupid remarks about obamacare trump  seeking out any opportunity to blast his gop rivals  decided to focus his blabbering mouth on texas senator and fellow republican presidential candidate ted cruz  trump accused cruz of being  the one that pushed  for president george w  bush to nominate chief justice john roberts  who trump thought was an awful justice for a very specific reason   obamacare  and justice roberts was a terrible  terrible situation because he approved obamacare when everybody said it was going to be terminated  then he had a second time at it  which would have also killed it  and he passed it then too  placing the blame on cruz for president barack obama s health care reform law  trump insisted that obamacare was  killing everybody   the business mogul continued to blast cruz as the audience laughed  the one that pushed him harder than anybody was sen  cruz  so  sen  cruz gave us obamacare in a true sense  it s true  it s true no matter what he does  he s been a disastrous judge because obamacare is killing everybody  it s killing everybody  even though his audience full of  not very smart  supporters giggled along with him  trump has once again exposed himself as a complete moron  not only does he criticize obamacare  a major healthcare initiative that he wants to repeal yet has zero alternative for  but he s completely full of sh t  obamacare isn t  killing  anyone or anything  not jobs  not people and not the wallets of the american people thanks to obamacare  america now has the lowest uninsured rate ever  with  out of  americans being fully covered  in its first year  the affordable care act helped america see a  year high in job growth  last year was also a success  as   marked a hot streak that america hadn t seen since  and   and regardless of what republicans say  the private sector hasn t seen any loss of jobs since march   when obamacare was signed into law data has also proven that obamacare  which has enabled more people to receive quality diagnoses and treatments earlier  is saving lives and helping americans save money as well  the gop loves to complain about obamacare s premiums  but its implementation  unpaid hospital bills have seen a drastic decline in cost and number this is just another instance where trump goes off on something he knows absolutely nothing about  there s so much evidence that obamacare has done great things for our healthcare system  but the gop will never acknowledge it you can watch trump act like an idiot at regent university below  courtesy of raw story  featured image via michael vadon   flickr
