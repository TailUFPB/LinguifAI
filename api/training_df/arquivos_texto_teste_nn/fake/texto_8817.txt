when the right wing terrorists took over the malheur national wildlife preserve  the first thought many had was of the guy pointing his weapon at a blm agent from between jersey barriers when the cliven bundy incident happened  when we learned that it was bundy s own sons leading the charge to free a remote corner of southeast oregon from oppression  those fears were multiplied then something magical happened  within hours we learned that the  occupation  would be a gathering of nitwits the likes of john ritzheimer who were too stupid to bring enough supplies to feed themselves for a camping trip  never mind a  standoff  that ammon bundy said would last years we learned that the desperate plea for snacks was foolish not only because these were supposed to be those survivalists we all hear about being prepared for the zombie apocalypse but because the local authorities suggested they just go to the store since nobody was watching them the frightening became stupid and then completely ludicrous  now what we have left is a group of armed idiots in a standoff with nobody occupying a taxpayer funded retreat in a bird sanctuary  threatening to give the land back to the loggers  it was never going to go over well at least we can laugh  if nothing else the citizens for constitutional freedom have provided the internet with enough material for memes by the truckload  humor articles  op eds and satire pieces for miles and enough youtube parodies to last the winter if you re bored enough to watch them all one of the most enjoyable reads you ll have during this debacle has to be yelp  where  reviewers  have gone out of their way to make your tour of the preserve a memorable one  from large cheeto begging mammals spotted on the trails to toothless creatures in need of our support and protection  yelpers have made the incredibly ridiculous world of the bundy moron militia even more absurd   and it is magnificent here are some images of the best yelp has to offer  enjoy  toss in a few funny pictures for good measure and the humiliation of ammon bundy ands friends is just about complete  you can visit the comments here  yelp has been cleaning them as they come in  as their policy is to not take a political stance on anything  but new ones are popping up all the time  special thanks to elizabeth preston of winning democrats for these awesome screencaps featured image via yelp
