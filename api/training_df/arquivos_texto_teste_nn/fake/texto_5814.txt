massachusetts senator elizabeth warren once again took aim at donald trump and took no prisoners as she hilariously mocked the possibility of a trump ticket with her one time rival scott brown as his running mate warren began her speech at the new hampshire democratic convention on saturday by apologizing to the state for beating brown in her home state because she  never expected  him to become new hampshire s problem  and from there  warren proceeded to lampoon the idea of brown as trump s vice presidential nominee  i hear that donald trump is floating scott brown as a possible running mate  and i thought   oh  so donald trump really does have a plan to help the unemployed   the crowd erupted in laughter as warren continued landing punches with more jokes  scott brown for vice president makes a certain kind of sense  i mean that  i think of all the expert advice he can offer donald trump  making up lies about me and my family  saying weird stuff about his beautiful daughter  and let s face it  nobody knows more about losing to a girl than scott brown  think of it as the perfect reality tv show  celebrity apprentice meets the biggest loser  warren then set the jokes aside and took a more serious tone as she focused all of her fire on the republican nominee  every day we learn more about him  and every day it becomes clearer that he is just a small  insecure money grubber who doesn t care about anyone or anything that doesn t have the trump name splashed all over it  every day it becomes clearer that he is a thin skinned  racist  sexist bully  every day it becomes clearer that he will never be president of the united states  then she likened trump s scam university to a used car dealership  but pointed out that the comparison isn t really  fair to used car dealerships  here is a man who runs a business to profit off other people s pain   she continued before slamming trump for whining about the judge overseeing the lawsuit against him  poor little donald is shaking in his high priced italian loafers  begging the court to protect him   she quipped   are you scared  donald  you should be  here s the full speech via youtube donald trump just got his ass handed to him by elizabeth warren  and if he really is thinking about picking scott brown as his running mate he should probably think again since it s clear such a pairing would be lampooned in the same way for months leading up to the election in november  and that s not a good thing for the gop  it would be a disaster  just like it would be a disaster for this nation if trump somehow wins the election featured image  screenshot
