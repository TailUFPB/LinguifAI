security concerns were brought up after a black flag with a heart and arabic writing was spotted on citizens tower under construction in lubbock  texas  and yes  while it should be of concern that individual s  trespassed onto private property that was behind a fence  scaled a building  and hung the flag  the broader issue that panicked local officials needs to be brought up  they seemed to lose their damn minds here s a picture of the flag on the building lubbockonline comand if you zoom in lubbockonline comnow  with all that is going on in the world surrounding the horrific acts that isis is perpetrating  and seeing as their flag is also black with arabic writing  you can see where maybe these people had a point in being upset  however  not really  because what it really does is prove their utter ignorance  because once the flag is translated it literally reads   love is for all  pretty threatening  right  however  it is texas  so saying  love for all  in arabic mixes their hatred and fear of muslims with their hatred and fear of gay people  so really it was the perfect storm of panic for the texas city according to lubbockonline com  the flag  noticed on the building early monday  prompted  robertson to write a letter to city manager james loomis  requesting lubbock police notify the department of homeland security  the fbi and the lubbock county sheriff s office  oh  for goodness sake  maybe their first move would ve been to figure out what it said and then go from there  but being the reactive instead of proactive society we are  local officials seemed to slip into full panic mode straight away  however  mayor robertson did have the wherewithal to say  i am also requesting that we take whatever steps are necessary to secure the building and ensure that this does not happen again  i fully understand that we must gather more facts before we make a knee jerk reaction but i am concerned on several levels  please keep me informed as we learn more about this situation  now  seeing that it was just valentine s day  and this flag was spotted early on the day after valentine s day  and the flag reads   love is for all   maybe  just maybe  it was someone spreading a valentine s day message of love  however  that could just be a wild guess  albeit  this was probably not the best way to do it don t fret  though  the flag has been removed  along with the love behind it lubbockonline comin all seriousness  whoever hung the flag broke the law and should be charged with criminal trespassing  however  the knee jerk reaction to want to call homeland security because something was written in arabic  but was really just someone wanting to spread a message of love  still seems a little over the top  use your heads  people featured image from lubbockonline com
