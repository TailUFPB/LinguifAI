disowning your parents is an incredibly painful thing to do  these are the people who created you  the people who raised you and loved you and kissed your  boo boos  when you got hurt  unfortunately  sometimes it is necessary as aubrey perry  an australian based artist and author  recently discovered  in an article written for the sydney morning herald  the young woman explained why she had to cut her parents out of her life and the life of her child perry was perusing a list of california trump delegates when she discovered a horrifying name on the list  her mother s  i found her name when i was scanning the list to see if the white supremacist william daniel johnson had been removed  since he d said he would not be attending   there she was    on the list  she said her parents have always been racist  her mother  an esl  english second language  teacher and basic english teacher at the college level  often referred to her students with contempt when perry was growing up  she said  greaseball  wetback  spic  beaner  i grew up with these words in the house  not because that s what people called us  that s what we called mexicans  perry explains that she knew her parents believed ignorant garbage  but because she lives in australia and only speaks to her parents online  through text and on the phone it was easy to ignore   they never spoke about politics  however  after perry saw her mom s name on the delegate list she started investigating and what she found is what ultimately led to her decision to severe ties  and i don t use twitter much  but  wow  my mum does  i recently checked her twitter page for the first time in a while and was shocked  hateful memes  ugly language  and appearance based attacks  targeted at hillary clinton  stacked up  and not just hateful  but off topic and malicious calling hillary  ugly    old  and  screechy   an  unlikeable old bag  the  woman card  stinks   my mother wrote  my mother  a college instructor  she should know better  she s no internet troll  is she  she was  her mom was a trump troll and filled all of her social media accounts with racist  sexist  xenophobic memes and posts  she found videos of her mom being interviewed by fox news at a california rally  perry said the video shows her mom saying  he sounds like us  he talks like us   i m all trump  only trump  always trump  forever trump   the video reminded her of the imperial wizard of the kkk saying that the klan supports trump because  what he believes in  we believe in  perry isn t just an ordinary liberal who is disgusted with donald trump just because she is a progressive and he is a conservative  his beliefs hurt her family   my husband is black  we have a daughter together  my parents  support of a candidate who could not decide if he should accept the endorsement of the kkk is completely intolerable in our home and  ultimately  in our world  she finally confronted her mother  and her mom brushed her off  so  she decided to take screenshots of her mom s hate speech  saved the video clips of her interview on fox news and posted everything on facebook  slamming her parents for their ignorance  on twitter she said  your twitter feed makes me disappointed and embarrassed of you as a person  a supposed critical thinker  and my mother  shocked   her mom responded by blocking her on social media  her dad found out and sent her a threatening email  saying  i know you have never said anything you might not like to be made public   he wrote   so if you want to continue this attack mode  please remember all things have consequences  perry said her parents  response to her criticism hurt her but she wasn t surprised  more importantly  though  she said it was time to speak up and let them know that their hate and ignorance was not acceptable  her entire life she had kept her mouth shut and let their rhetoric roll off her back and that  she explains  is her biggest regret  by ignoring racism  xenophobia  and misogyny within our families  we are accepting it within our culture  to ignore is to accept  as my daughter plays on the floor in front of me while i type this  i think about her ancestry  i think about the suffering that has been endured so that she can live in a free and just world  and i feel a responsibility to the continuity of that humanity  if i don t oppose my parents  behaviour and objectives  if i don t reject trump and all that he stands for  if i don t change my family s vocabulary so that my daughter never knows the hateful words i heard growing up  i m undoing the progress that generations before me have fought and died for  and that  i won t accept  she s exactly right  as a white woman with a mixed race child and a husband who is from central america  i know where she is coming from  for a very long time i ignored the hate coming  not from my parents  but from other people who i was close to  people i d grown up with  gone to school with  it was easier to pretend they were not that stupid than to confront them and get into an argument  like perry  i came to the realization that by not telling these people how i felt  how their hate affected my son  my husband  our friendship  i was doing a disservice  i started speaking out  i m not friends with some of those people anymore and that s okay  they are not nice people anyway the point is that by not speaking out  we lead these people to believe that what they are saying is acceptable and it isn t  holocaust survivor elie wiesel explains why it is important to use our voices to stop this kind of divisiveness  better than i ever could  while speaking to a group of college graduates in   do not stand idly by if you witness injustice  you must intervene  you must interfere  you are now going into a world which is hounded  obsessed with so much violence  often so much despair  when you enter this world and you say the world is not good today  good  correct it  featured image via
