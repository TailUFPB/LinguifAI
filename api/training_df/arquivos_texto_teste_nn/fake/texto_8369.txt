if you ever find yourself struggling to explain to a foreign friend why the u s  congress is so universally reviled  look no further than this bit of political cowardice in an explosive report by the hill s alexander bolton  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s office freely and openly admitted that his party s legislative goal for the next  months is to do absolutely nothing senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky    seeking to protect his majority in a tough cycle for republicans  is leaning toward holding back several measures that have bipartisan support but are divisive in his conference some of these  divisive  bills that republicans want to shove under the rug until they win their re elections  a crucial justice reform bill  a long sought after authorization bill to combat isis  remember when republicans said they were serious about fighting terrorism  ha    a minimum wage increase  any action on immigration  nothing  they ll show up to their office to collect their paychecks  hold a few fundraisers  but don t expect them to do their jobs  not this year astoundingly  mcconnell s  do nothing  strategy is being praised by fellow republicans  here s the hill again  mcconnell is smart to wait on issues that divide us until such time as we can achieve a consensus   said a senior republican aide   there s no question that some members want to turn to some things sooner than others  but mcconnell s duty is to do what s best for the entire conference  seems what s best for the conference is to focus on the things that unite us  yeah  sitting on his hands until they go numb  what a hero but if cowardice permeates every corner of the republican party  it s not without reason  for years republican politicians have been held hostage by a radical fringe of their base that says any bipartisan cooperation means you aren t a  true  conservative  just passing a bill to give more support to veterans is considered a  betrayal  to the party if it means working with democrats  you accomplish exclusively conservative goals or you don t accomplish anything at all mcconnell  with all the backbone of a snail  isn t taking any chances  he ll wait out the election and hope that voters focus on how his party never once compromised with  the enemy   and not  say  on the fact that they hadn t done their jobs for  months how does he plan to cover his tracks  it s shameless   but kind of clever  mcconnell plans to intentionally slow down and string out the dozen annual appropriations bills  those can be addressed individually and  if time is properly squandered  can go on pretty much indefinitely  by the end of the year  with  appropriations bills in hand  he can brag about having done something  just not very much when we think about how the election cycle brings out the worst in politicians  we typically picture the attack ads  the rat race  the pettiness  there s another side  the craven attempt to cling onto jobs by a group of people who demonstrably do not deserve them  it means in this crucial year  when the united states faces a ton of major challenges  americans will be treated to nothing   and all because a few politicians are worried what their most toxic supporters would think if they actually bothered show up to work feature image via gage skidmore flickr
