republicans in the state of north carolina really need to get a better hobby  because legislating hate and constantly disparaging the lgbt community is getting really tired  it s almost as if they have nothing better to do  and they believe hating on people is just so much darn fun one of the ring leaders of all this hatred is republican state senator buck newton  he s very proud of the new discriminatory law   which prohibits transgender individuals from using the proper bathroom  he also doesn t care who thinks he s wrong about the law  because  you know  god  because his almighty would apparently want him to discriminate against others based upon misinformed opinions and personal distastes now  at a rally in raleigh  nc  newton is continuing the charge against the lgbt community  this time even being so bold as to say  go home  tell your friends and family who had to work today what this is all about and how hard we must fight to keep our state straight  yep  no beating around the bush  he just came out and said it  he doesn t want any lgbt people in the state of north carolina what s even scarier  newton is the republican nominee for attorney general newton also said  we all know that the folks that wave the rainbow flags and things like that are politically very upset about the way things are today  they re upset about the way things have always been in this state and they re bound and determined to try to change it  whether it s by winning elections in the city of charlotte on their city council or whether it s wining elections in november in the general assembly or whether it s winning elections in november for our governor  good  hopefully they do then  to reiterate his hatred and complete ineptitude of the trans community  newton said  now it s been said that there are many  many  many  many more sexual predators on the sex offender list than there are transgender people  and we can all feel sympathy for folks who are having difficult times  because we all know folks that have a difficult time  whether folks are struggling with drugs  are struggling with their marriages  figuring out what it is that they re supposed to be doing in life  we can all have sympathy for that  but that does not mean that we should expose our wives and our sisters and our children to the sexual predators in the bathrooms  what an asshole  no  seriously  transgender individuals are not  sexual predators   however  you know what group of individuals has been caught time and time again with their pants down  republican men this hate speech is merely going to fuel the fire of an already fiery war to combat  and its legislated hatred of lgbt individuals  businesses have already pulled out  performers refusing to perform  and the entire nation has its eyes on north carolina and what they plan to do next this man does not belong in public office  because he is not a public servant  but rather a self serving prick who writes laws to spread his own fear and hatred  disgusting featured image via video screen capture
