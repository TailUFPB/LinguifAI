clint eastwood will long be remembered for his influence in hollywood  but his legacy will always be tainted by his  speech at the republican national convention  when he spent the more than  minutes talking to a chair  now  trump wants political correctness and hillary clinton s voice to get off his lawn the  year old eastwood didn t actually say the n word during this interview with esquire magazine  but gosh darn  he s sure offended over the idea that rich old white guys no longer get to decide what s offensive and what s not eastwood has his own not so loving nickname for millennials  he calls them the  pussy generation   you know  because of that pesky insistence that everyone be treated with respect  he s doesn t agree with trump on everything  but as for all those racist comments coming from trump  well  americans should  just fucking get over it  i haven t endorsed anybody  i haven t talked to trump  i haven t talked to anybody  you know  he s a racist now because he s talked about this judge  and yeah  it s a dumb thing to say  i mean  to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to mexican parents or something  he s said a lot of dumb things  so have all of them  both sides  but everybody the press and everybody s going   oh  well  that s racist   and they re making a big hoodoo out of it  just fucking get over it  it s a sad time in history  eastwood isn t  percent sure who he ll vote for  but damn those millennials again  wanting an education  i d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody instead of calling everybody names  start being more understanding  but get in there and get it done  kick ass and take names  and this may be my dad talking  but don t spend what you don t have  that s why we re in the position we are in right now  that s why people are saying   why should i work  i ll get something for nothing  maybe   and going around and talking about going to college for free  i didn t go to college for free  i mean  it was cheap  because i went to l  a  city college it wasn t like going to a major university  but it was okay  and then  you know  i didn t finish  because i decided to become an actor  ruin my whole life   as for hillary clinton  it s unlikely the republican will vote for her  he s afraid she ll follow in obama s footsteps  but there s also another  far more sexist reason  her voice  when asked what he thinks of clinton  he said   i mean  it s a tough voice to listen to for four years  it could be a tough one  if she s just gonna follow what we ve been doing  then i wouldn t be for her  that s a tough one  isn t it  i d have to go for trump   you know   cause she s declared that she s gonna follow in obama s footsteps  there s been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle  she s made a lot of dough out of being a politician  i gave up dough to be a politician  i m sure that ronald reagan gave up dough to be a politician  i guess it s okay to make money from evading taxes  shady business deals and using bankruptcy as a way to pass debt on to taxpayers  yes  that s much more trustworthy  go trump featured image via kevin winters at getty images
