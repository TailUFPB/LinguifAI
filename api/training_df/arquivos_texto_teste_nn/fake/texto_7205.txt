donald trump spent wednesday morning trying to convince the american media that his campaign manager  corey lewandowski  is a really good guy who is being railroaded by some crazy woman  during one of his interviews with good morning america  though  he took it a step further and threatened to file charges on michelle fields  the reporter lewandowski is charged with assaulting  because she  touched  trump s arm the hosts asked trump if it was clear to him  after watching the video  that his campaign manager did touch fields  even though he has insisted that he didn t  trump responded  well  what s clear is that she was touching me and she broke through the secret service  and she was asking me questions when there were no questions we were leaving  the press conference was over  she broke through  she grabbed my arm  i think a couple of times  you see me trying to get her hand off my arm and he saw something and did very minor  her face wasn t that of a woman screaming in pain he didn t try to throw her to the ground  you look at twitter  people think it s a total disgrace she s filing charges  i would just like to point out that this is typical abuser behavior  instead of trump admitting that his campaign manager was wrong and he should have kept his hands off of this woman  he is trying to place the blame squarely on her shoulders  it s like when an abusive husband punches his wife in the face  then he and his buddies say  well  you shouldn t have mouthed off  after the long rant about how fields was to blame for lewandowski s actions  trump said  i m sure there will be a counter claim coming down the line  should i file charges against her because she touched my arm as well  his campaign manager did not just  touch her arm   he grabbed her so hard that she was left with bruises  that is not  minor   it is battery and that s why he was charged with a crime  clearly the police believed that he assaulted this reporter and it is disgusting the trump is defending him  however  this is what we have come to expect from the republican frontrunner  he and his campaign have zero respect for anybody  especially not women watch the interview https   www facebook com goodmorningamerica videos vb    type  theaterfeatured image via video screenshot
