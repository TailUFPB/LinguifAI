in another humiliating defeat that will have major ramifications for republicans going forward  all  justices on the supreme court upheld a lower court s ruling that texas republicans could not redraw voting districts to suppress the growing latino vote the  one person  one vote  case was designed by conservatives to exclude non voting populations when drawing the electoral map for the state  the immediate effect would be that districts with large numbers of non eligible voters  like  for instance  latino immigrants and children   would be lumped together  giving much more power to rural  mostly white and older  districts i m sure you ll be shocked to know that older white people tend to vote republican  but that surely wasn t the intent behind this move to consolidate power increase the fairness of elections for white people everyone if this all sounds a bit confusing  and it should   what republicans were trying to say is that people who can t vote  children  immigrants  convicted felons  etc  do not deserve the same kind of representation in their local government  because they re not really people or something  but really  this was just the latest gop attempt at rigging elections right now  the populations of large racially diverse cities mean that those cities have several  or more  voting districts and they tend to be far more liberal than rural  mostly white districts  that means that in a state like texas  the cities are threatening to overpower the rural areas in terms of electoral power and turn the state purple and eventually blue  the goal of this court case was to reverse that trend and greatly reduce the number of city districts  thus  making the rural  and conservative  districts more powerful but apparently this was a voter suppression tactic too far for even the conservatives on the court six justices signed on to justice ruth bader ginsburg s decision  and justices samuel alito and clarence thomas   the most conservative members of the court   concurred in the judgment  total population apportionment meets the equal protection demand  by rendering each representative alert to the interests and constituent service requests of all who dwell in the representative s district   ginsburg said even if scalia had still been alive  it looks like he might have been the only dissent  and maybe thomas after scalia had told him what to think the conservative justices were not opposed to the basic premise of the plan  stripping large cities of their voting power   just this particular method  once republicans come up with a new avenue of attack  and they will   they ll try it again and if republicans control the white house and put another scalia on the bench  they might get away with it next time see why voting blue is important featured image via wikipedia
