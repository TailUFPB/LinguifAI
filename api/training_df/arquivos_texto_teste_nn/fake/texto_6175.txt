paul manafort  donald trump s new convention manager  may not have gotten the memo that the campaign never openly engages in honesty  telling the truth inside the trump camp could start a chain reaction  bringing the whole shindig to a screeching halt  in an interview with the huffington post  manafort basically admitted that trump s  muslim ban  was nothing but a ploy to attract the fringe right weirdos who enjoy living in fear every hour of every day  he s already started moderating on that   manafort said   he operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle  within his comfort zone  he ll soften it some more  he ll still end up outside of the norm  but in line with what the american people are thinking  he starts those conversations on the  outer edges  because that s where the lunatics hang out  once you ve secured them with a good dose of fear  hate and lies it s ok to move more towards the center  where people who live in the real world tend to be  it s not a new tactic for trump  it s his status quo  his campaign began with a speech pandering to white supremacists  the wall he s never going to build whether he s elected or not will become legendary fodder for decades of election cycles to come manafort says the change will come at trump s discretion  because  you don t manage donald trump   trump has already begun the move towards the center  saying recently that the ban he has said he would institute was actually  just a suggestion  trump s  suggestions  leave little room for doubt on their translation  was he also pandering to the far right when he applauded torture and called for the u s  to kill the families of known terrorists  was he embellishing when he said that mexico is  sending us  their worst criminals  trump has and will say whatever he needs to say to keep those auditoriums stocked with hateful a holes willing to get violent with protestors for free media coverage manafort seems to have the ideal personality to work for donald trump  he is completely delusional  on the issue of trump s lagging support from women and latinos  he told huffpo  hillary is the one who s got a gender gap  and while we are behind among women over all  we re ahead among white women even now  we ll get some black and hispanic women as we go along  yeah  sure you will  as soon as trump steps onto that stage and tries to treat hillary clinton the way he s treated megyn kelly  carly fiorina and rosie o donnell  women across america will be faced with the startling  not really  truth that donald trump only cares about his bought and paid for wife and the daughter he seems to be secretly in love with  even his younger daughter doesn t get a whole lot of billing  which makes you think trump doesn t find her attractive enough to care about featured image by kenna betankur getty images
