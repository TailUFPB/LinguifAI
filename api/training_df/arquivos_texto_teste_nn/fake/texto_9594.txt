follow them  it s really pitiful that after so many months that all the democrats have is this lie the electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters would you want california and new york deciding our elections  that s what would happen without the electoral college  we bet that perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it

electoral college is not a creation of the constitution   perez said during a lecture at indiana university law school   it doesn t have to be there  the electoral college  a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the founding fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states  is clearly laid out in article ii of the constitution   each state shall appoint  in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct  a number of electors  equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress  perez has previously stated that president donald trump  didn t win  last november s election because hillary clinton won the popular vote following his comment  perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact   in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote  there s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says  we will allocate our vote  our electoral votes  to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling  electoral votes do the same   perez said   i m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was maryland  the main supporters of the plan put forward by perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the constitution  not an argument that the system doesn t exist the comment from perez came during a lecture honoring former indiana democratic sen  birch bayh  who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine  via  wfbour previous report on the electoral college please share this with the clueless left    if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote  small and rural states would become irrelevant  and campaigns would spend their time in large  populous districts    the electoral college remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the constitution empowered it to select presidents  though occasionally maligned  this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the american people the founding fathers created the electoral college after much debate and compromise  but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents  though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency  that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections        and  some see the electoral college as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few  select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the united states  others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones every four years  around election time  there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct  national popular vote the founders  collegeas one of the heritage foundations legal experts  hans von spakovsky  noted in a paper on the electoral college   in creating the basic architecture of the american government  the founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule  some elements of the electoral college  such as the indirect vote through intermediaries  were hotly debated at the  constitutional convention  it was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal  traitor  or similar kind of heinous person  the founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the american system  but they feared a kind of pure  unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past the product of the founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring  and we would be wise to leave it intact alexander hamilton defended the electoral college in federalist   he argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president  but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station  and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation  and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice  hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability  and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements  than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes  as students of ancient history  the founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy  and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch  they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people  the electoral college was a compromise  neither fully democratic nor aristocratic the constitution states each state shall appoint  in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct  a number of electors  equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress in addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule  the founding fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities  america s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states  not just the american people as an undifferentiated mass the total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the district of columbia included after the passage of the  amendment adds up to   the winner must receive a majority  or   of these votes to become president the system empowers states  especially smaller ones  because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers  farmers in iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in new york  a more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account the states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors  in the early days of the republic  most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors  rather than the people  but  over time  the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead  every state has opted for popular election at least since the civil war calls to abolishmodern opponents of the electoral college argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution  criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state by state system of voting calls to fundamentally change the electoral college reached a peak after republican george w  bush defeated democrat al gore in the tightly contested  election  gore narrowly won the national popular vote  and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the supreme court stepping in was unfair one organization  national popular vote  has worked toward eliminating the electoral college through an amendment to the constitution or a state compact  national popular vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country this plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support  but heritage s von spakovsky has called it bad policy  based on mistaken assumptions  swing states  he wrote   can change from election to election  and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable  many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote  those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote but this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers  swing states change over time  and the  election could be a prime example of swing state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map additionally  if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote  small and rural states would become irrelevant  and campaigns would spend their time in large  populous districts finally are the democrats proud of this disgusting man who curses and lies read more  daily signal
