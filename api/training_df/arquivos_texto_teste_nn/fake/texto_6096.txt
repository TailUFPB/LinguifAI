the republican party is not well   we know it and they know it after getting roasted in the last general election  the republican party conducted a fittingly named  autopsy  on what would need to change before  in order for the party to successfully compete with democrats  the overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities  instead  they nominated donald trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the ku klux klan but rather than mourn the loss of their party  republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning  like karl rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over  the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give democrats a massive advantage going into november and just how grim does it look for republicans  here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if clinton does get the nomination but you wouldn t know it if you worked in the republican national committee  their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters one prominent example  the current president of the united states  barack obama  has been a staunch democrat for his entire political career  recently  he has repeatedly said he would vote for the democratic nominee in november and he s lashed out against trump  calling him both hateful and ignorant  it s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable  and yet there s a  percent likelihood obama will vote in the  general election  the database predicts  based on computer modeling  it also shows an  percent chance obama will side with his party s nominee  while suggesting a  percent shot he ll back the republican candidate  by the rnc s metrics  obama has a  percent chance of voting for donald trump  and an additionally  there s roughly another  percent chance of voting for an independent candidate it s baffling to think about how the rnc arrived at those numbers  one humorous conclusion is that while republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling president obama a radical leftist  their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum  in other words  when they tell their supporters that obama is a socialist  they know it s a lie this is how the rnc fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance  the model doesn t go overboard  it simply puts its thumb on the scales a little  however  this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out  obama  along with millions of voters  will  in fact  vote for democratic candidates whether the rnc wants them to or not  as such  these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking it s becoming increasingly clear that the republican party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of fox news for years  the delusions get grander and more incredible  and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive  the right wing media has convinced even its own politicians that obama is deeply unpopular  a failed statesman and a radical  he is none of those things and so the republicans are perpetually stunned by his success by way of one example  let s consider the fact that mitt romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win  this flew directly in the face of all the known data  including nate silver s career making predictions   he and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated obama as much as fox news had told them they did and he got walloped featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
