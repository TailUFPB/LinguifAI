republicans claim to be  pro life   but one needs only observe to realize that they simply like babies   as long as they are in the womb  that is  sure  they repeatedly cut funding from programs that feed poor children and actively work to deny kids health care and other necessities   but they sure love promoting abstinence only sex  education   which actually increases unwanted pregnancies  and depriving women of the ability to decide whether or not to abort a fetus zika is believed to cause severe birth defects like microcephaly  which causes severe brain and skull deformities and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first year alone  as the gop wants to deprive poor women of health care  if they had their way these expenses would be crippling  this doesn t even take into account the extra care a child would need  the exhaustion involved in caring for a critically ill baby  or a number of other factors that would cause someone with the zika virus to make the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy the state of florida is currently facing a zika crisis  but that doesn t stop senator marco rubio from sticking to his guns on abortion  to him  women should never be allowed to have one  even in the cases of rape and incest   and not even if the mother has contracted the zika virus  he told politico on saturday  i understand a lot of people disagree with my view   but i believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws  and when you present it in the context of zika or any prenatal condition  it s a difficult question and a hard one  but if i m going to err  i m going to err on the side of life  obviously  microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with  and when they are  it s a lifetime of difficulties   rubio added   so i get it  i m not pretending to you that that s an easy question you asked me  but i m pro life  and i m strongly pro life  i believe all human life should be protected by our law  irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life  no matter how much the child suffers  right  marco rubio himself voted to fulfill president obama s request for funding  so he is aware that there is an issue  he s not hiding from that  but his belief in a book written by a bunch of men who couldn t figure out where the sun hides at night  as well as his devotion to the very party that actively fights to keep women sick  prevents him from accepting the fact that women have the right to make their own health care decisions   including terminating a pregnancy if they have the zika virus meanwhile  as republicans continue to hold funding hostage over gutting the clean water act and letting truckers drive for longer hours without a break  yes  seriously   rubio and his ilk will continue to fight against women s right to choose an abortion to save the child from a lifetime of suffering featured image via getty images joe raedle
