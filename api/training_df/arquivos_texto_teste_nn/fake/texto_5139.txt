the  nevertrump faction of the gop has longed for an independent conservative to run for the presidency in a last ditch effort to make sure that donald trump s nightmare of a presidential campaign does not become a nightmarish reality in the event he gets elected to a job he is dangerously unqualified to perform  well  they are getting their wish evan mcmullin is a longtime conservative  he is also firmly  nevertrump  like trump  the man has never been elected to any public office whatsoever  however  he is also a seasoned member of the central intelligence agency  cia   mcmullin currently serves as chief policy director of the house republican conference  and is certainly much more qualified to do the job of president than trump could ever dream of being  to that end  sources say that mcmullin is going to enter the presidential race with one goal in mind  stopping donald trump according to buzzfeed  this could turn out to be a very serious bid  as top gop operatives who refuse to back trump and openly criticize him  such as rick wilson  would firmly back mcmullin s attempts to derail trump s path to the white house  mcmullin might have a tough run  though  because he is pretty much invisible to be such an important inside player in gop politics  his twitter account has very few followers compared to most politicians and other public figures  and he also has no verification  however  that has not stopped him from sharply slamming trump to what following he does have  here is one such tweet authoritarians like  realdonaldtrump use promises of law   order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  july     regarding trump s increasingly divisive and bigoted statements against muslims  mcmullin posted to his facebook what all sane  educated people already know  trump s rhetoric makes us less safe  not more safe with regards to radicalized terrorists  as donald trump continues attacking muslims and as a former cia officer  i d like all americans to know the truth  american and other muslims have played a central role in virtually every counterterrorism win we ve had since    they are an indispensable asset in this fight  attacking them as a group makes america weaker  not stronger  while mcmullin s battle will be uphill  there are growing mutterings that he would have serious support  however  at this point  he will likely not be able to be on the ballot in all  states at this late date  and he will likely face campaigning and money issues  also  we all know the fate of third party bids at the national level now  make no mistake  liberals  this guy is not our dream come true  he is a true blue right winger who would still usher in social policies that would prove nightmarish for many groups  including women and lgbtq people  he is a mormon  and  like mitt romney  has strong support in utah  where trump is heartily disliked  our best hope is that mcmullin splits the gop even further than trump has  thus handing the election to democrats the only other option would be for the gop to dump trump in favor of mcmullin  which seems highly unlikely at this time featured image via evan mcmullin twitter
