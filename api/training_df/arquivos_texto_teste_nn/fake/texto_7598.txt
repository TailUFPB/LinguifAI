when watching donald trump speak  you d think he was running for prom king the way he assumes this election is all about himself and not the country  just count how many times he uses the words  me    i    my  or  myself  within a speech  he s not running to lead the nation  he s running to have the nation line up behind him  he has it exactly opposite of the true intent set forth by our founding fathers  the president of the united states serves the nation  it s not the other way around knowing this full well  barack obama  before he was elected as the  president of the united states  delivered a commencement speech to knox college in illinois back in   he spoke of who we are as a nation  and what should be expected of us  our nation and our government one part of his speech touched upon the very important message that we are all in this together  we re not a nation of  me   or  myself  like trump would like you to believe  but rather a nation of  we  and  us   after all  the nation s motto is e pluribus unum  which means  out of many  we are one here is that very poignant moment from then senator obama  in washington  they call this the ownership society  but in our past there has been another term for it   social darwinism  every man and woman for him or herself  it s a tempting idea  because it doesn t require much thought or ingenuity  it allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford   tough luck  it allows us to say to the maytag workers who have lost their job   life isn t fair  it let s us say to the child born into poverty   pull yourself up by your bootstraps  and it is especially tempting because each of us believes that we will always be the winner in life s lottery  that we will be donald trump  or at least that we won t be the chump that he tells   your fired  but there a problem  it won t work  it ignores our history  it ignores the fact that it has been government research and investment that made the railways and the internet possible  it has been the creation of a massive middle class  through decent wages and benefits and public schools   that has allowed all of us to prosper  our economic dominance has depended on individual initiative and belief in the free market  but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other  the idea that everybody has a stake in the country  that we re all in it together and everybody s got a shot at opportunity   that has produced our unrivaled political stability  bravo  that man should be president  oh wait  three years later he was we need to remember that we re all in this together  and we really don t need someone who thinks he s running for prom king as our next president  part of being an american is embracing the fact that we are all individuals striving for excellence  but recognizing that our excellence is only possibly because we have a society set up for all of us  not just the few  or rather  that s the way it should be  and what we need to get back to  electing trump would further destroy the fabric our the nation that republicans have been trying to tear apart slowly but surely since   so  come november  no matter who get s the democratic nomination  vote blue watch obama s speech here  with those remarks beginning at the   minute mark featured image via video screen capture
