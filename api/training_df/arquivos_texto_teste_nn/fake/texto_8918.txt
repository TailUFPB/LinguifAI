for seven years there s been several folks  let s call them birthers  who have questioned the validity of president obama s united states citizenship  these people refuse to believe that the president was born in hawaii  and refuse to believe that even if he wasn t  he was   that he was born to an american citizen  his mother  when it comes down to it  it s not that they question the validity of obama so much as they question the validity of having a black president  after all  he doesn t look like any other former president  so he must not be from here  right  wrong now  if birthers really wanted to go after someone vying for the oval office  they  quite literally  could go after senator ted cruz  you see  cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen  however  just like obama he was born to an american citizen  so he is  in fact  a natural born citizen as the constitution stipulates  but if you re going to go after anyone for being foreign born  cruz makes a much better target lately on the campaign trail  captain birther himself  republican presidential frontrunner donald trump  has brought up the legitimacy of ted cruz s ability to run for president  he s even gone so far as to want cruz to  go before a judge  to make a ruling on his citizenship getting a good giggle from all of this was none other than white house press secretary josh earnest  who  when asked about cruz and this line of questioning regarding citizenship  answered  it would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the president s birth certificate  if republican primary voters were to choose senator cruz as their nominee  somebody who actually wasn t born in the united states and only  months ago renounced his canadian citizenship  which is very true  if these republican birthers  who were so angry at the make believe possibility that obama was not born in the nation actually vote for a man who  in all legitimacy  wasn t born in the country  it would not only be ironic  it would be hypocritical  and prove the entire birther movement is steeped in racism it s impressive that earnest was able to hold himself together as much as he did after that question was asked  video featured image  abc news
