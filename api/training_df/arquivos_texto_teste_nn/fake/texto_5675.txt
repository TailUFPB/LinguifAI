the democrats in the house of representatives last week showed a level of spine that the slimy weasel we call the speaker of the house  paul ryan  will never know  they staged a sit in  led by civil rights icon john lewis  on the floor of the house of representatives  well  ryan seems to  have gotten his cowardly boxer briefs in a twist over the fact that his pals on the other side of the aisle made a fool of him and caused him to lose control of the house chamber  and has issued a stern warning to his democratic colleagues speaking with upfront with mike gousha on wisn  ryan said the following of what he would do if the democrats dared to disrupt his ordered  delusional life as speaker of the house by  oh  you know  standing up for what s right  we are not going to handle it the same way  we will not take this  we will not tolerate this  ryan could have  as speaker  had the democrats who staged the sit in arrested  but he chose not to do so  because  well  he s a coward with no spine  we already knew this  though  instead of admitting this  however  he blamed the democrats  saying  they said they were hoping to get arrested and hauled off the floor  they told a number of my staff that and so i did get a brief heads up about it  i highly doubt they were dumb enough to tell your staff  who they knew in turn would be obligated to tell you  sir  what they were planning to do to make sure the sit in was effective  you re just embarrassed that you lost control of the house chamber  and with good reason  you re always talking about doing the people s work in the people s house  yet you defy the gun control measures that    of the american people want  you are doing the nra s bidding  and we all know it  i hope house democrats tell you to shove your crazy ideas up your ass where they belong  should you ever have the gall to actually confront any of them featured image via win mcnamee getty images
