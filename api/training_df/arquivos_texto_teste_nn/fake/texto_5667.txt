canada is going to miss president obama when he leaves office just as much as most americans will but before that happens  the canadian parliament took many moments on wednesday to show republicans how president obama deserves to be treated president obama was a guest of our northern neighbor to attend a meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau and mexican president enrique pe a nieto to discuss the topics of trade and defense during a speech delivered to the canadian parliament  president obama spoke of the common bond between canadians and americans and envisioned the continued strength of that relationship in the future  we see ourselves in each other and our lives are richer for it  the enduring partnership between canada and the united states is as strong as it has ever been and we are more closely aligned than ever before  and president obama felt more adulation and love within the canadian parliament than he has ever felt from the hostile republicans who control congress throughout his remarks  president obama received multiple standing ovations and several chants of  four more years  even though he is restricted to two terms by the  amendment of the constitution it s the kind of treatment of the commander in chief that republicans have refused to do themselves over the last eight years because of their open racism and hatred indeed  republicans have never treated president obama with the respect and dignity the office deserves that was never more clear than in  when south carolina rep  joe wilson screamed  you lie   at president obama in the middle of the state of the union address it was a disgraceful moment in the history of congress and in the history of the republican party and while canadian lawmakers would love to see president obama serve another term in the white house  conservatives are paranoid to the point of stocking up on weapons just in case he somehow manages to circumvent the constitution  hell  republicans even refuse to acknowledge that president obama is still the leader of this country for another six months  they were already calling him a lame duck president in february when they refused to hold confirmation hearings for anyone obama nominates to replace deceased supreme court justice antonin scalia  it s like they believe a presidency ends after seven years instead of eight beyond that disrespectful treatment  president obama has had to put up with unprecedented obstruction and racism from the gop  not to mention endless investigations in an effort to find any kind of scandal they can make stick so they can discredit him  in addition  republicans have called him an arrogant tyrant and just about every name in the book you will never see republicans in congress treat president obama with respect and admiration but the canadian parliament did just that on wednesday to show americans how this president should be treated here s the video via twitter they are shouting  four more years   pic twitter com   roberta rampton   robertarampton  june    here s obama s full speech via youtube one day republicans will regret the way they treated president obama  especially since he has been one of the best leaders this country has elected to the office  his place in history is assured while republicans will always be regarded as the villains against progress who kept him from being an even greater leader featured image  youtube
