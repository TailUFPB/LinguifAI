as donald trump continues to attack mexicans  with his recent comments surrounding the trump university lawsuit judge  mexico s former president has one message for the gop frontrunner  debate me after chickening out of a debate with bernie sanders  vicente fox  who served as president of mexico from  to   challenged the frontrunner to a televised encounter in san cristobal  mexico  with a free lunch included   in an interview on rita crosby s radio program  election central   fox said  i m willing to come here  to come here  to the states  if it s for a debate  a direct personal debate with him  yes  we can use national broadcasting  public broadcasting  with you  we can do that debate  fox then went on to jab trump over his   million request for a debate  and said that a debate would be focused on ideas and not the overly sensationalist  one condition   that it s done in mexico   because i need him to see what mexico is all about  to see what we mexicans are all about  he will change his attitude toward mexico    would expect that he would listen to my arguments  that he would put his arguments on the table  but we both are obliged to document  to sustain with facts and numbers what we re saying  and not just lying or cheating to people  so  let s see if trump will take his first opportunity at being  presidential  and have a cordial  factual conversation with a foreign leader  when he s not busy praising putin or jong un  maybe he can take the time to actually listen to a real leader  one that doesn t rule with an authoritarian fist  but seeing how trump is a chicken  and doesn t like to engage in a mature manner  the debate with fox will be as likely as the one with sanders  and of course trump wouldn t dare take the bait  because once fox proves that his people aren t what trump paints them out to be  there goes his best talking point to his racist supporters featured image via flickr
