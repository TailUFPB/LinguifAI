there are some people in life that  if they are wise  will just keep their mouths shut and their voices out of public reach  donald rumsfeld is one of those people  yet  he can t seem to keep his mouth shut on twitter and likes to continue to remind us of what a horrific human being he is  and should likely really belong in prison on monday  rumsfeld decided to tweet out in regards to tax day at   i am close to losing hope that i will live to see a flat tax   donald rumsfeld   rumsfeldoffice  april     how terrible for him that a regressive method of taxation will never come to fruition during his lifetime  he apparently isn t done screwing over the american people  and would prefer the wealthy to pay less and the poor to pay more  what a peach we already knew this guy is a douchebag  though  he s one of the evil assholes who lied to get us into a war with iraq  a war that has subsequently killed thousands of american soldiers  wounded thousands more  killed hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians  and gave rise to isis  but really  who s keeping track   he knew we didn t have enough intelligence to back claims that there were weapons of mass destruction  yet  he as the secretary of defense under former president george w  bush  continued to lead the drumbeat towards war so rumsfeld  we as pissed off american citizens think your tweet should have probably read  at   i am close to losing hope that i will be tried as the war criminal that i am   and if you go to twitter and read the replies to his tweet  it seems many  many people agree with that sentiment  probably not wise for a man who s actions lead to so many deaths to tweet he s close to death himself  likely not gonna be received too well he truly is a person who should keep his mouth shut  because if he had kept it shut in the first place  so much worldwide would be different to this day featured photo by alex wong getty images
