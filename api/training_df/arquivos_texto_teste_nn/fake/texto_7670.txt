cnn money has released a report saying that donald trump violated fox news  rules during the last republican primary debate the claim comes from an unnamed rival campaign  apparently trump consulted with his campaign manager  corey lewandowski  during thursday s debate in detroit  this is a clear violation of the rules that were set before the debate  what s even more interesting  is that the report indicates that this is not the first time trump has broken debate rules  this is just the most egregious example cnn money reports  while that exchange was the clearest violation of debate rules to date  the sources said  it followed a pattern  at multiple debates  trump has consulted with his campaign manager corey lewandowski backstage even though it was expressly forbidden by the networks thursday night s debate in detroit marked a new extreme  however  as lewandowski went directly onto the stage to meet with trump during the commercial break  as in previous debates  fox news had explicitly informed the campaigns that candidates were not allowed to communicate with their campaign staff during commercial breaks  the sources said when lewandowski was asked by fox news staff to leave the stage  he refused to do so  according to a source at fox news unable to get lewandowski off the stage  fox news representatives informed the other three campaigns that  because the trump campaign had broken the rules  they too could consult with their candidates  it isn t surprising that trump would need assistance during a debate  not to imply that any of the republican candidates are particularly better than trump  in terms of policy  but trump can barely string together enough words to create a cohesive sentence  trump isn t a politician  he is a has been reality television star used to having people feed him lines  this just proves that he will do or so anything to become president featured image from gage skidmore via flickr
