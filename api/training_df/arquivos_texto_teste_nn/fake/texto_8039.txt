it looks as though republican presidential candidate dr  ben carson didn t thoroughly read his gop politicking handbook  because if he had  he wouldn t have said what he just did on the radio while discussing if the president should nominate a new supreme court justice after the passing of justice antonin scalia  carson basically told the folks over on wrnn   fm in south carolina that president obama should nominate someone  he was given the hypothetical question of if there was a republican president in office would all these candidates be asking them to wait to nominate  and carson replied   no  they wouldn t  continuing  he said  but then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn t be an ideologue also  however  carson never says that obama shouldn t nominate anyone  he instead said that supreme court justices should have term limits and not be able to endlessly serve until they either die or choose to retire carson is drifting away from the lockstep argument coming from republicans that obama should hold off and let the next president nominate  he clearly knows that the president is within his right as commander in chief to make the choice and pick someone new to put before congress  he also is seemingly admitting that the democrats have been right this whole time in their explanation of why the president should be nominating someone new to replace scalia  he undoubtedly sees the double standard they are throwing obama s way  that double standard being  it s okay for republicans to nominate in an election year  like reagan did   but not democrats truth be told  republicans are panicking  they know they just lost their most conservative voice on the supreme court and his replacement has been left in the hands of the very progressive president obama  the irony is palpable you can listen to carson here featured image  flickr
