when you think of who might be the perfect person to talk about who is black and who isn t  darrell issa probably isn t the first to come to mind  he s likely not the second or third or even   either  however  the congressman from california thought it wise to weigh in on ben carson s comments regarding president obama on an earlier politico podcast  carson had said that obama was  raised white  and can t relate to black americans  he s an  african  american  he was  you know  raised white  i mean  like most americans  i was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected  but   he didn t grow up like i grew up   many of his formative years were spent in indonesia  so  for him to  you know  claim that  you know  he identifies with the experience of black americans  i think  is a bit of a stretch  so  when cnn s chris cuomo brought up these remarks to issa and asked if this was the sort of rhetoric the gop should get behind  the congressman had the audacity to say that carson is  a wonderful human being and he was technically correct in what he said  issa did insinuate that this is the sort of thing better said by a private citizen and not if you re seriously considering running for the highest office in the land  also saying that carson isn t ready to be president  however  the fact that issa would have the gall to agree with carson s sentiment is absolutely appalling  yet somehow not at all surprising  video featured image via raw story youtube
