ted cruz was approached at a campaign stop in new hampshire and asked to give a response to trump s latest attack  in which he calls cruz a  canadian anchor baby   in and of itself  the question was not that fruitful   but what is important is how cruz handled it  basically  all it told us was that ted cruz is great at lying  not like we didn t already know that  senator cruz looked right at the camera and after giving out a jolly laugh  said  i like donald  and   he s welcome to say whatever he likes  i like and respect him  that s all i got to say and right now its up to the voters to decide  he likes and respects him  how can that even be believable for a second  he didn t even say it sarcastically  no wonder nobody likes ted cruz  he doesn t even respect himself with the truth while it s commendable that ted cruz would not resort to any further attacks  he s doing a greater disservice by lending further legitimacy to a guy that deserves zero political respect from the voters  and   he didn t even mean it  next thing you know this clip will be used in another campaign ad by trump as proof that he s a  respectable guy   yet   he s nowhere close to it  ted cruz needs to grow some balls while it is true that cruz and trump had a bromance before ted cruz started rising in the polls  whatever love and affection they had for each other effectively ended when donald began attacking him below the belt in every way imaginable  how can ted cruz respect someone who just a few weeks ago referred to him a  nasty guy   the full quote is much  much worse than that  look  the truth is  he s a nasty guy  he was so nice to me  i mean  i knew it  i was watching  i kept saying   come on ted  let s go  okay   but he s a nasty guy  nobody likes him  nobody in congress likes him  nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him  he s a very    he s got an edge that s not good  you can t make deals with people like that and it s not a good thing  it s not a good thing for the country  very nasty guy  video of trump calling ted cruz  an anchor baby in canada  https   t co   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  january    cruz doesn t respect donald trump  he just doesn t want to deal with any more attacks from him  he can t stand up for himself  pure and simple featured image via screen capture
