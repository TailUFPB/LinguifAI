daniel greenfield s take on why obama spied on trump is the best yet  he takes you through the twists and turns to expose obama and his cronies for the liars and cheats they are  we d love to know what you think about this take on why things happened the way they did last week  cnn revealed  and excused  one phase of the obama spying operation on trump  after lying about it on msnbc  susan rice admitted unmasking the identities of trump officials to congress acknowledged in a letter from nunes and gowdy rice was unmasking the names of trump officials a month before leaving office  the targets may have included her own successor  general flynn  who was forced out of office using leaked surveillance susan rice lying about the unmasking   is anyone surprised  i know nothing about this  i was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that count today  what she says is a lie but who is surprised by this  we know that susan rice lied  times on  different morning shows the morning after benghazi  why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including obama susan rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now  she claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it  yes  red flags are everywhere on this  the reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the trump presidency and embarrass him andrew mccarthy said it best  the national security adviser is not an investigator  she is a white house staffer  the president s staff is a consumer of intelligence  not a generator or collector of it  if susan rice was unmasking americans  it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on american interests  it was to fulfill a political desire based on democratic party interests  greenfield   laws were broken the bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked someone s in big trouble  while rice s targets weren t named  the cnn story listed a meeting with flynn  bannon and kushner bannon was trump s former campaign chief executive and a senior adviser  kushner is a senior adviser  those are exactly the people you spy on to get an insight into what your political opponents plan to do now the latest cnn spin piece informs us that secret fisa orders were used to spy on the conversations of trump s former campaign chairman  paul manafort  see clapper video below   the surveillance was discontinued for lack of evidence and then renewed under a new warrant  this is part of a pattern of fisa abuses by obama inc  which never allowed minor matters like lack of evidence to dissuade them from new fisa requests  its possible  president trump s voice was picked up in a wiretap of paul manafort  says former spy chief clapper https   t co   cnn   cnn  september    obama cronies had figured out that they could bypass many of the limitations on the conventional investigations of their political opponents by  laundering  them through national security if any of trump s people were talking to non americans  the foreign intelligence surveillance act  fisa  could be used to spy on them  and then the redacted names of the americans could be unmasked by susan rice  samantha power and other obama allies  it was a technically legal watergate if both cnn stories hold up  then obama inc  had spied on two trump campaign leaders furthermore the obama espionage operation closely tracked trump s political progress  the first fisa request targeting trump happened the month after he received the gop nomination  the second one came through in october  the traditional month of political surprises meant to upend an election the spying ramped up after trump s win when the results could no longer be used to engineer a hillary victory  but would instead have to be used to cripple and bring down president trump  headed out the door  rice was still unmasking the names of trump s people while obama was making it easier to pass around raw eavesdropped data to other agencies obama had switched from spying on a political opponent to win an election  to spying on his successor to undo the results of the election rice and power were used to  unmask  trump associates    all the president s women  notice how uncomfortable brennan is when asked about the ambassador power abuse of power by a sitting government had become subversion of the government by an outgoing administration  domestic spying on opponents had become a coup the democrat scandals of the past few administrations have hinged on gross violations of political norms  elementary ethics and the rule of law that  out of context  were not technically illegal but it s the pattern that makes the crime  it s the context that shows the motive obama inc  compartmentalized its espionage operation in individual acts of surveillance and unmasking  and general policies implemented to aid both  that may have been individually legal  in the purely technical sense  in order to commit the major crime of eavesdropping on the political opposition when the individual acts of surveillance are described as legal  that s irrelevant  it s the collective pattern of surveillance of the political opposition that exposes the criminal motive for them if obama spied on two of trump s campaign leaders  that s not a coincidence  it s a pattern a criminal motive can be spotted by a consistent pattern of actions disguised by different pretexts  a dirty cop may lose two pieces of evidence from the same defendant while giving two different excuses  a shady accountant may explain two otherwise identical losses in two different ways  both excuses are technically plausible  but it s the pattern that makes the crime manafort was spied on under the russia pretext  bannon may have been spied on over the uae  that s two different countries  two different people and two different pretexts but one single target  president trump it s the pattern that exposes the motive when we learn the whole truth  if we ever do   we will likely discover that obama inc  assembled a motley collection of different technically legal pretexts to spy on trump s team each individual pretext might be technically defensible  but together they add up to the crime of the century obama s gamble was that the illegal surveillance would justify itself  if you spy on a bunch of people long enough  especially people in politics and business  some sort of illegality  actual or technical  is bound to turn up  that s the same gamble anyone engaged in illegal surveillance makes businessmen illegally tape conversations with former partners hoping that they ll say something damning enough to justify the risk  that was what obama and his allies were doing with trump it s a crime  and you can t justify committing a crime by discovering a crime if everyone were being spied on all the time  many crimes could be exposed every second  but that s not how our system works  that s why we have a fourth amendment nor was obama inc  trying to expose crimes for their own sake  but to bring down the opposition that s why it doesn t matter what results the obama surveillance turned up  the surveillance was a crime  anything turned up by it is the fruit of a poisonous tree  it s inherently illegitimate the first and foremost agenda must be to assemble a list of trump officials who were spied on and the pretexts under which they were spied upon  the pattern will show the crime  and that s what obama and his allies are terrified of  it s why flynn was forced out using illegal surveillance and leaks  it s why mcmaster is protecting susan rice and the obama holdovers while purging trump loyalists at the nsc the left s gamble was that the mueller investigation or some other illegitimate spawn of the obama eavesdropping would produce an indictment and then the procedural questions wouldn t matter it s the dirty cop using illegal eavesdropping to generate leads for a  clean  case against his target while betting that no one will look too closely or care how the case was generated  if one of the mueller targets is intimidated into making a deal  the question of how the case was generated won t matter mueller will have a cooperative witness  and the democrats can begin their coup in earnest  it will eventually turn out that there is no  there  there  but by then  it ll be time for president booker there s just one problem if the gamble fails  if no criminal case that amounts to anything more than the usual investigational gimmick charges like perjury  the federal equivalent of  resisting arrest  for a beat cop  develops  then obama and his allies are on the hook for the domestic surveillance of their political opponents with nothing to show for it and no way to distract from it that s the race against the clock that is happening right now  either the investigation gets results  or its perpetrators are left hanging in the wind  if mcmaster is fired  which on purely statistical grounds he probably will be  and a trump loyalist who wasn t targeted by the surveillance operation becomes the next national security adviser and brings in trump loyalists  as flynn tried to do  then it s over and the dems finally get their watergate  except the star won t be trump  it will be obama  rice  power  lynch and the rest of the gang will be the new haldeman  ehrlichman and mitchell once obama and his allies launched their domestic surveillance operation  they crossed the rubicon  and there was no way back  they had to destroy president trump or risk going to jail the more crimes they committed by spying on the opposition  the more urgently they needed to bring down trump  the consequences of each crime that they had committed spurred them on to commit worse crimes to save themselves from going to jail  it s the same old story when it comes to criminals each act of illegal surveillance became more blatant  and when illegal surveillance couldn t stop trump s victory  they had to double down on the illegal surveillance for a coup the more obama spied on trump  the more he had to keep doing it  this time it was bound to pay off obama and his allies had violated the norms so often for their policy goals that they couldn t afford to be replaced by anyone but one of their own  the more obama relied on the imperial presidency of executive orders  the less he could afford to be replaced by anyone who would undo them  the more his staffers lied and broke the law on everything from the government shutdown to the iran nuke sellout  the more desperately they needed to pull out all the stops to keep trump out of office  and the more they did it  the more they couldn t afford not to do it  abuse of power locks you into the loop familiar to all dictators  you can t stop riding the tiger  once you start  you can t afford to stop if you want to understand why samantha power was unmasking names  that s why  the hysterical obsession with destroying trump comes from the top down  it s not just ideology  it s wealthy and powerful men and women who ran the country and are terrified that their crimes will be exposed it s why the media increasingly sounds like the propaganda organs of a communist country  why there are street riots and why the internet is being censored by google and facebook s  fact checking  allies it s not just ideology  it s raw fear the left is sitting on the biggest crime committed by a sitting president  the only way to cover it up is to destroy his republican successor a turning point in history is here if obama goes down  the left will go down with him  if his coup succeeds  then america ends read more from daniel
