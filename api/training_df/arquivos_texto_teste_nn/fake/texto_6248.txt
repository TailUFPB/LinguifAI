at this point  the arguments against the  alllivesmatter crowd s rebuttal against the  blacklivesmatter movement have been well documented  the point that  just because someone says  save the rainforest  does not mean that they are saying  f ck all other forests  should have ended the debate  however  the debate continues  one person on twitter saw the connection between the  alllivesmatter and the recent sale of the gun george zimmerman used to kill trayvon martin here s the tweet it should be noted that the gun actually sold for    dollars but that does not change the point at all there have been no major systemic changes to the institutions that have racism built into their core  since the beginning of the black lives matter movement  it has been proven again and again just how much it is needed many people have claimed that the gun is a piece of history and that s why people are willing to pay so much money for it  i have to wonder if the person who bought the gun would also be willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars for the hoodie that trayvon martin was wearing the night he was killed by zimmerman  i highly doubt that they or most of the people who put serious bids in for the weapon would be willing to do so  especially when it is taken into account that at least part of the money zimmerman will receive  will be donated to groups that fight the black lives matter movement that s because the gun isn t just a piece of history  it is a trophy for white supremacists  it is a symbol that a grown man can kill an unarmed black teenager  be protected by the state s legal system  and then go on to make a fortune off of the tragedy that person has caused featured image photo by joe burbank pool getty images
