a new poll released from abc washington post shows some very good news for democrats  not only is hillary clinton crushing donald trump  but president obama s approval rating has hit a five year high   topping off at  percent of people who approve of him   a five point gain from the last poll conducted  only  percent disapprove the last time president obama s approval rating was that high was when osama bin laden was killed in may   it s also worth noting that the president s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the orlando shooting  the deadliest terror attack on u s  soil since   but wait  there s more good news  not only does  percent of the american electorate approve of president obama s presidency overall   percent approve   disapprove  of his handling of the economy  considering trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy  the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call as the post noted obama is more popular now than republicans george w  bush and george h w  bush in the waning months of their presidencies  although obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former democratic president bill clinton s in   his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for hillary clinton on the campaign trail just think about it   clinton already has a huge lead over trump  and that s before the very popular president obama has hit the campaign trail  once americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them  one could expect to see not only clinton s poll numbers to rise  but obama s as well so what say you  republicans  a healthy majority of americans support the president and loathe your candidate  i don t think republicans get to talk about the  will  of the american people anymore  they have no ground to stand on  no leverage  and no one seems to be taking them seriously anymore president reagan s final year approval high was  percent  just nine points higher than president obama s  the president still has six more months  and considering how unpopular donald trump is becoming  america should expect to see it climb higher featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
