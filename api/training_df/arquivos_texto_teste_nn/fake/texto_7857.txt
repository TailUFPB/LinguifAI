a federal aid package was all set to pass the republican controlled senate  and then ted cruz blocked it to show how much he hates michigan  clean water  and human decency the city of flint  michigan has been dealing with a poisoned water crisis since  when republicans switched the source of the city s drinking water from lake huron to the polluted flint river ten people have already died from legionnaires disease and children across the community face serious neurological issues as they grow up due to high levels of lead in the water the man made disaster could have been avoided since it has been public knowledge for decades that the river water is unsafe for human consumption  but governor rick snyder and his cronies thought they could save a buck by switching to it anyway  and now they have a catastrophe that could cost billions of dollars to fix and the federal government was incredibly close to chipping in much needed aid when all of a sudden texas senator ted cruz decided that the people of flint can wait until he really studies the bill closely before they get a dime so he placed a hold on the bill  which is pretty damn ballsy or stupid considering the michigan gop primary in on march  and cruz is in a serious fight for his political life with donald trump  not a very smart move for a man who s going to be in a primary in michigan on march    michigan senator debbie stabenow   and in michigan this is a hugely bipartisan nonpartisan issue that everybody cares about  perhaps sensing that he was committing political suicide by looking like a total dick  cruz quickly removed the hold on the bill and let it move forward but it s just another example of why ted cruz should not be allowed to become president  as president  he could block any emergency disaster relief bill he wants  plus  at a time when americans are sick and tired of partisan bullshit in the senate  ted cruz demonstrated during this particular bipartisan support of a serious problem that he s the only one who is obstructing this legislation already had broad bipartisan support so there was no reason for ted cruz to hold it up beyond him just wanting attention from all the conservatives who support blocking anything and everything that might improve something in this country cruz eventually did the right thing  but he should never have put a hold on the bill in the first place  especially at a time when most americans already see him as the top asshole in the presidential race featured image  flickr
