donald trump has added pope francis to his very long list of people he is feuding with  during an episode of the late show with colbert  stephen colbert did a hilarious bit about trump s latest failure attempt to pander to christians the feud came after pope francis was quoted as saying that trump is not a christian  a person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not of building bridges is not a christian   pope francis said while traveling to rome from mexico  when asked if he thought people should or should not vote for trump  pope francis responded saying   as far as what you said about whether i would advise to vote or not to vote  i am not going to get involved in that  i say only that this man is not christian if he has said things like that  trump released an official campaign response  where said that pope francis is going to regret not supporting him and his campaign when isis attacks the vatican  during a campaign rally on thursday trump had this to say  as i m walking up here  they said   mr  trump  the pope made a statement about you   and i said   the pope  what did the pope say  i like the pope   was it good or bad  because if it was good  i like the pope  if it s bad  i don t like the pope  colbert mocks trump during the segment  saying  it s like jesus said   blessed are the poor  unless they said something bad about me   then screw them  trump is trying to pander to christians  he really needs them in order to secure his chances at receiving the republican primary nomination as i have pointed out before  trump is making himself look a fool doing it too  it s not just that trump isn t saying the wrong things to win over christian voters  he doesn t even appear to understand the basic concepts of christianity  this was shown trump publicly stated that he had not asked jesus christ for forgiveness you can the video below featured image from video screenshot
