coming into tuesday s republican primary in indiana it was pretty much do or die for ted cruz  he had to win or his campaign for the presidency was effectively over  and boy did he try  he put all he could into trying to win over the hoosier state  but try as he might  he failed miserably  donald trump won with over  percent of the vote and ted cruz was left with a tough decision to make by the end of cruz s speech after his indiana loss it was pretty damn clear that he was about to suspend his campaign  he spoke in broad  sweeping conservative analogies that had nothing to do with becoming president  and what seemed obvious became reality when he told everyone that he was pulling out of the race one person  however  saw the delicious irony in cruz quitting early  and that person was full frontal s samantha bee  she took to twitter to tell cruz what he should have done with his campaign bee wrote  shouldn t ted cruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term  shouldn t  tedcruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term   full frontal   fullfrontalsamb  may    course  this being a play on cruz s ridiculous stance on abortion rights  the man claims he stands up for women  but apparently that means loving women so much that he s the person to make all of their health decisions  he s also been one of the key reasons the planned parenthood myth of baby body parts has gone on for so long ted cruz is a liar and a smarmy salesman that just couldn t figure out how to sell himself to the american voting public  he was so bad  in fact  that he couldn t even make himself look good next to donald trump bee also tweeted at least the  tedcruz campaign died as it lived under trump s heel while republicans looked on with indifference   full frontal   fullfrontalsamb  may    on samantha bee for pointing out such delicious irony  never stop being you featured photo by frederick m  brown getty images   twitter
