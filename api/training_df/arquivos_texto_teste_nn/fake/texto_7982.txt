the world is scrambling to deal with fallout from the spread of the zika virus  the global pandemic which appears to be linked to birth defects in children when pregnant women are infected  president obama has requested that america help lead the global effort to fight the infection   which has reached our shores  republicans  who describe themselves as  pro life   are resisting house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers  r ky   is taking the lead among republicans in refusing to help in a letter to president obama s budget director  shaun donovan  rogers noted the department of health and human services has    billion allocated for the ebola fight of   and the state department has    billion left over  these funds can and should be prioritized to meet the most pressing needs of mounting a rapid and full response to zika   rogers and two other republican committee members wrote the white house will likely ask that  some  ebola funds be  repurposed  for the anti zika effort but not so much that it would  undermine  the response to ebola  earnest said  adding that amount  would not be sufficient to take on what we believe is a pretty serious threat from the zika virus  strangely republicans are arguing that funds already being used to fight the ebola outbreak now be used against zika  instead of a separate request  but these are the same republicans who attacked the obama administration s response to that outbreak along with their allies in the media  many on the right said obama was exposing america to ebola  with some even floating the conspiracy theory that obama wanted a mass infection of americans with the ebola virus instead  the administration s response to that outbreak has now been cited as a model of america using its superpower status to fight a global problem  ebola infections are down to nonexistent in many of the african nations where it killed thousands  in part due to the global alliance organized by president obama there were no outbreaks of the disease in america  and in fact americans infected with the virus survived and are now ebola free  thanks to american doctors  at the same time republicans and conservatives were harsh in their condemnation of the obama response the obama administration is asking for funds to show american leadership  to help the babies republicans profess to care so much about  and again they are dropping the ball featured image via youtube
