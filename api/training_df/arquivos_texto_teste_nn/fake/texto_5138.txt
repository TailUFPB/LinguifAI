in january  gop presidential candidate donald trump said   i try and pay as little tax as possible  because i hate what they do with my tax money  i hate the way they spend our money   donald has avoided releasing his tax returns to the public and now we know why in   donald signed off on a series of accounting changes that allowed his first hotel to shortchange new york city by nearly   million in rent just  years previously  trump made a deal which would free the hotel of   million in property taxes over the course of  years  while that sounds good so far  it was also supposed to guarantee the city a small financial stake in its success  new york city received annual rent payments tied to the grand hyatt s profits  according to cbs in   the hotel had its best year  raking in nearly   million  city officials expected to receive at least as much as the    million paid the year before but that never happened because a month after trump and his partners signed off on the accounting changes  the city was paid only    for two years  city auditors were stonewalled each time they tried to address the issue experts asked by cbs news to examine the city auditor s report  which was completed in   described the behavior of hotel and trump organization officials as  unusual  and  unheard of  something was fishy there   karen burstein  who was the city s auditor general at the time  said referring to the hotel s owners   this was not the behavior of an innocent party  i think that s what became evident to us  when a date was eventually agreed upon for an audit  it was cancelled by hotel lawyers in a rare move  it s one of those things you want closure on  why would you want this hanging over your head   said tobey  a partner at perelson weiner llp  which audits corporations  hedge funds  private equity funds and non profits   stonewalling auditors is not a common practice  you want to make them go away  when city auditors finally got a glimpse of the goings on at the hotel  they found missing books and unacceptable accounting principles  hotel officials tried to keep the audit from being released to the public  much like donald is doing with his tax returns now according to donald  he doesn t remember any of this  i sold the hotel many years ago for a tremendous profit  by building the hotel i created thousands of jobs  saved the grand central area  and helped to revive a dying  at the time  new york city   trump told cbs   the city was extremely happy with that development and you re now bringing up something thirty years later that i ve never heard about  donald may not really want to become president  because really  he s only into self promotion  he could be looking for a way out of this race  trump wants to make trump great again but now that he s in the spotlight  things may not work out well for him since his previous business ventures are becoming public  donald s self promotion may be his undoing  it s funny how that works photo by darren hauck via getty
