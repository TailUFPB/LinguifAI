democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders appeared on msnbc s the rachel maddow show this week and summed up the entire disastrous gop race for president in one glorious sentence   the republican party today now is a joke  maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues  in a show that aired on wednesday night  maddow invited sanders to comment on trump s comments to fellow msnbc host chris matthews that there  should be some kind of punishment  for women who have abortions  sanders recoiled at the comments  stating unequivocally  shameful is understating that position  first of all  to me  and most americans  women have the right to control their own bodies  but to punish a woman  for having an abortion  is beyond comprehension  one would have to say  what is on donald trump s mind  i don t know what world this person lives in  the interview continues with sanders crushing each pillar of the republican race  one after another  until finally  maddow asks sanders how he feels about the gop seeming to split  with the potential for the convention to refuse to endorse the winner of the primaries  it s worth seeing sander s full reply  which absolutely nails the crisis at the heart of the gop and conservative media today  well  uh  first of all  i don t necessarily take at value   face value what they say   i think at the end of the day  they probably will come together but the other point  i think the more   the deeper point  rachel  is the republican party today has moved very  very far to the right   uh  they are way out of touch with where the american people are and i think if we had a media in this country that was really prepared to look at what the republicans actually stood for rather than quoting every absurd remark of donald trump  talking about republican party  talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two tenths of  percent  cuts to social security and medicare  medicaid  a party which with few exceptions  doesn t even acknowledge the reality of climate change  let alone do anything about it  a party which is not prepared to stand with women in the fight for pay equity  a party that is not prepared to do anything about a broken criminal justice system or a corrupt campaign finance system  i think  to be honest with you   and i just don t  you know  say this rhetorically  this is a fringe party   it is a fringe party   maybe they get    percent of the vote what you really need in this country is a progressive party standing with the working class and the middle class of this country   and yes  a conservative party that  you know  has  you know  is more fiscally conservative   that is where we should be as a country but the republican party today now is a joke  maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues so that   that s my two cents on that  the republican party is in crisis  it s candidates have pulled so far to the right that even ann coulter is having a wobble  and it s hard to see how they could possibly gain the support of the wider american public in time for election  while the candidates  daily horrifying comments might be making lots of front page news  they would be foolish to expect this press attention to turn into votes   at least  not for them  there is such a thing as bad press  the revulsion by the majority of common sense americans at the gop parade of bigotry  sexism and theocratic zealotry could well crush the party come voting day   and the party will be left in tatters  it s grassroots to the right of ghengis khan  while the nation is moving far enough in a progressive direction that a democratic socialist like bernie sanders is able to maintain a solid campaign  something has to give  and as yet the gop has no answer  https   www youtube com watch v  image via screencapture
