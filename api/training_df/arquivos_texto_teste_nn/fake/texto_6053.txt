on thursday afternoon  hillary clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous donald trump would be not only to the nation  but to the world  she delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that trump simply cannot be our next president not taking too kindly to the fact that clinton was going after him  trump quickly took to his medium of choice   twitter trump wrote  bad performance by crooked hillary clinton  reading poorly from the telepromter  she doesn t even look presidential  bad performance by crooked hillary clinton  reading poorly from the telepromter  she doesn t even look presidential   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    only he knew how to spell teleprompter and does trump consider name calling  explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential  apparently so oh  and yes  trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well  and it was about as awkward as a  year old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling truth be told  trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a  year old boy  probably more along the lines of a five  or six year old  it s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people hillary has cooties  maybe he already has  who s to know  really trump can go after clinton all he wants on foreign policy  but the facts are the facts  and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience  for example  he has none  and she s a former secretary of state who is more traveled than any other secretary of state in the history of the republic  she s brokered peace deals  for goodness sake at the end of the day  it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done  and trump most certainly is not that person  no matter who the nominee is for the democrats  they need to win in november featured photo by spencer platt getty images   twitter
