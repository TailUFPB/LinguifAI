everyone knows donald trump is a thin skinned little whiner  elizabeth warren knows it  and has proven it   bill maher knows it  and has come up with quite a nickname   trump can dish it out all he likes but he certainly can t take it and who s gotten under his skin this time  the speakers at the dnc after the conclusion of the third night  in which v p candidate tim kaine shredded trump by invoking one of his famous lines   believe me   the  tough  gop candidate responded the only way he knew how   by being a butt hurt cry baby well  they don t all hit me  but some of them do  and they try to hit you as hard as possible  and it s mostly false stuff   i get it  it s the way it goes  it s called politics   i guess i take it a little bit personally cry me a river  you thin skinned demogauge  hillary has faced ceaseless personal attacks for decades   much  much worse than any of the  accurate  remarks made at the dnc  but has hillary clinton ever said she takes it personally  no  she hasn t  that s because hillary isn t thin skinned  she isn t a quitter  and she certainly doesn t lack confidence trump is offended for the things democrats said about him  that s rich  coming from the guy that has spread lies about women  muslims  mexicans  immigrants  working women  including hillary clinton  and tried to convince the world president obama wasn t born in america it s only a matter of time until donald totally loses it and says something he really shouldn t  as the campaign continues  trump shows his real colors  his insecurities  and his weak nature sorry the truth hurts  donald  maybe he shouldn t have ripped off all those businesses when he walked away from bankruptcy  maybe he shouldn t have mocked john mccain and that new york times reporter  maybe he should have never called women bimbos  pigs  dogs and every other name in the book his words will be his downfall  and he has no one to blame but himself featured image via john moore getty images
