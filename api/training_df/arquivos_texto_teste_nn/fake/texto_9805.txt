has the left and the leftist media managed to make americans forget why this whole  kneeling in protest against the american flag  in the nfl started  have americans forgotten the statement made by colin kaepernick when asked why he kneeled during our national anthem while every other player stood in respect for our flag when the san francisco  ers qb colin kaepernick was asked why he kneeled during our national anthem  his response was about police brutality  and about his belief that cops were essentially getting away with murdering blacks with no consequences here is kaepernick s official statement one day before  police officers were murdered in dallas  tx by a black lives matter supporter  cleveland browns player isiah crowell posted an image on his instagram account of a man wearing an isis like image of a man wearing an all black outfit and black mask standing behind a police officer and stabbing him in the neck with a knife the cleveland browns made the following statement on behalf of crowell for his disgusting actions  we have spoken to isaiah regarding his extremely disturbing and unacceptable social media decision  it was completely inappropriate and we have made him aware of our high level of disappointment  isaiah has apologized but also knows that just an apology is insufficient and that he must take steps to make a positive difference after a very negative and impactful post  the nfl made no apology for crowell s terrorist like post aimed to incite violence against our law enforcement officers  should law enforcement officers be forced to remain silent in the face of a movement created to disparage and discredit the amazing work they do every day because of a black lives matter  anti cop movement that has permeated the nfl stephen loomis  president of cleveland police patrolmen s association spoke out against cleveland brown s player isiah crowell  lommis said he thinks the  store bought apology  isn t enough   he needs to go to dallas  help the families who lost their loved ones last week  write them a check  look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology  loomis says crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical african american men being hung from a tree in the    he adds that if crowell doesn t go to dallas and make a donation   i will pull cleveland officers  sheriffs  state troopers out of first energy stadium this season if he doesn t make it right  as for crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage   loomis says   you re a grown ass man  and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong  think we ll accept your apology  kiss my ass     tmzon sunday  the patriots were booed wildly by fans when the team took a knee during our national anthem  today  the leftist detroit free press attempted to smear michigan state police col  kriste kibbey etue for sharing a message on social media criticizing the nfl players  protests here is the post that etue did not create  but shared privately with her friends on facebook  the message in this post is pretty clear  it s a message to the nfl letting them know that americans will not sit back silently and allow millionaires who are obviously not grateful to be living in the united states disrespect our flag  our law enforcement officers  and our veterans the detroit free press used a statement from one source  leonard mungo  a detroit attorney who  in   filed a class action lawsuit against the michigan state police  who mungo claimed were not hiring enough black and hispanic troopers  the detroit free press quote from mungo said the posting demonstrates  kind of a dangerous mindset for someone in her powerful position  it s  scary that they don t understand that america is defined by its freedoms  and one of these freedoms is freedom of speech   mungo said  it also  has implications for why the state police   don t have representative numbers of african americans in their ranks   he said shanon banner  a spokeswoman for etue  said the colonel s facebook post was not about race and was posted not publicly  but so that only etue s friends would see it  as a public servant  col  etue has great respect for the armed forces and those who fight to protect our freedoms  banner said in an e mail to the free press etue did not create the post  banner said   it s a meme that is posted in other places around the internet   she said etue  who heads the statewide police department  shared the meme entitled  dear nfl  on her facebook page sunday  it was a post widely shared on social media by those critical of hundreds of nfl players this past weekend who locked arms and or kneeled during the pre game playing of the national anthem  some forms of the meme are calling for a boycott of the nfl until these silent gridiron protests end the michigan state police issued an apology from etue on their facebook page  americans should be asking why etue has to apologize for standing up for law enforcement officers and veterans she defended in her post  while the left is screaming about the rights of the nfl players to disrespect our flag   perhaps someone should ask them when col  etue s first amendment right become null and void  as a side note  the detroit free press is home to stephen henderson  the race obsessed  angry editorial editor who attempted to label kid rock  the single father of a black son and naacp award winner  as a  racist   stirring up hate and negativity towards the beloved detroit rocker who does so much for the residents of the city of detroit
