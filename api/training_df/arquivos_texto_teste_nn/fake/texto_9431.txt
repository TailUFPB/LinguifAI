hollywood producer kingpin and mega democrat party donor  harvey weinstein s abusive sexual predator behavior has shined a light on all of hollywood  and in the process has shined an even brighter light on the hypocrisy of the democrat party and their media allies  the leftist media is now being forced to discuss how democrats have turned a blind eye to decades of criminal sexual assaults by bill clinton and given a pass to his wife hillary  who enabled him by threatening his victims to remain silent four days ago  the hard left msnbc host chris hayes made a stunning admission about the hypocrisy of the democrat party  and how they are  long overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against bill clinton that have been swept under the carpet  while the victims were shamed as gross and cynical and hypocrtical as the right s  what about bill clinton  stuff is  it s also true that democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him   chris hayes   chrislhayes  november     the atlantic came out with a damning article that blames the fake feminism movement on the left  as well as the democrat party  who has allowed a double standard to exist when it comes to blindly protecting and defending the clinton s against any  and all sexual misconduct allegations yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger bill clinton was very credibly accused in the   juanita broaddrick reported that when she was a volunteer on one of his gubernatorial campaigns  she had arranged to meet him in a hotel coffee shop  at the last minute  he had changed the location to her room in the hotel  where she says he very violently raped her  she said that she fought against clinton throughout a rape that left her bloodied  at a different arkansas hotel  he caught sight of a minor state employee named paula jones  and  jones said  he sent a couple of state troopers to invite her to his suite  where he exposed his penis to her and told her to kiss it  kathleen willey said that she met him in the oval office for personal and professional advice and that he groped her  rubbed his erect penis on her  and pushed her hand to his crotch it was a pattern of behavior  it included an alleged violent assault  the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks  but clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today s accused men have experienced  rather  he was rescued by a surprising force  machine feminism  the movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation  and it was willing eager to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur the atlantic went on to point out an op ed by the so called  champion of women s rights  gloria steinem  where she slut shamed and bashed the women who dared to come forward and accuse bill clinton of rape and other forms of criminal sexual assault the notorious  new york times op ed by gloria steinem must surely stand as one of the most regretted public actions of her life  it slut shamed  victim blamed  and age shamed  it urged compassion for and gratitude to the man the women accused called  feminists and the clinton question   it was written in march of  when paula jones s harassment claim was working its way through court  it was printed seven days after kathleen willey s blockbuster  minutes interview with ed bradley  if all the various allegations were true  wrote steinem  bill clinton was  a candidate for sex addiction therapy   to her mind  the most  credible  accusations were those of willey  who she noted was  old enough to be monica lewinsky s mother   and then she wrote the fatal sentences that invalidated the new understanding of workplace sexual harassment as a moral and legal wrong   even if the allegations are true  the president is not guilty of sexual harassment  he is accused of having made a gross  dumb  and reckless pass at a supporter during a low point in her life  she pushed him away  she said  and it never happened again  in other words  president clinton took  no  for an answer  steinem said the same was true of paula jones  these were not crimes  they were  passes   broaddrick was left out by steinem  who revealed herself as a combination john and bobby kennedy of the feminist movement  the fair haired girl and the bare knuckle fixer  the widespread liberal response to the sex crime accusations against bill clinton found their natural consequence  years later in the behavior of harvey weinstein  stay loudly and publicly and extravagantly on the side of signal leftist causes and you can do what you want in the privacy of your offices and hotel rooms  but the mood of the country has changed  we are in a time when old monuments are coming down and men are losing their careers over things they did to women a long time ago when more than a dozen women stepped forward and accused leon wieseltier of a serial and decades long pattern of workplace sexual harassment  he said   i will not waste this reckoning   it was textbook wieseltier  the insincere promise and the perfectly chosen word  the democratic party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected bill clinton  the party needs to come to terms with the fact that it was so enraptured by their brilliant  big dog president and his stunning string of progressive accomplishments that it abandoned some of its central principles  the party was on the wrong side of history  and there are consequences for that  yet expedience is not the only reason to make this public accounting  if it is possible for politics and moral behavior to coexist  then this grave wrong needs to be acknowledged  if weinstein and mark halperin and louis c  k  and all the rest can be held accountable  so can our former president and so can his party  which so many americans so desperately need to rise again watch gloria steinem several years after writing the op ed where she shamed bill s victims  helping to celebrate hillary s birthday while honoring the woman who threatened the women bravely stepped forward to expose her sexually abusive husband bill clinton grant j  kidney s video that he posted to twitter  really shows the slow  but necessary admission by the leftist media  that they too  bear responsibility for shaming bill clinton s victims  simply because believing them  or giving them any kind of credibility  would ve harmed the  democrat party they are beholden to  fake news cnn admits that bill clinton is a rapist  attorney general jeff sessions must launch an immediate criminal probe into the dirty dealings of the clinton foundation as well as into the sexually perverted past of former president bill clinton    pic twitter com   grant j  kidney     grantjkidney  november    can forget how the media attacked donald trump for bringing up the allegations of sexual abuse by bill clinton s abusers during his debate with hillary  will the media apologize to president trump  now that they ve come to the conclusion they are as guilty as the democrat party for hiding decades of sexual abuse  and then criticizing trump for defending bill and hillary s victims for anyone who is wondering if gloria steinem has had a change of heart  after having a significant time to reflect on her defense of the clinton crime family and slut shaming bill s innocent victims  you don t need to wonder anymore  on october     gloria steinem announced that she will be warding that hillary clinton would be the first recipient of her  wonder woman award  the women s media center  co founded by feminist gloria steinem  told us that it is giving the latest democratic presidential candidate its first  wonder woman award  for her  extraordinary accomplishments  and public service  like wonder woman  she seems to have superhuman strength  resilience  and courage   said the group in a reference to the famous comic and tv character  hillary clinton s actions have inspired and protected women and men on every continent   said steinem   she has battled negative forces and helped to maintain a fragile peace with her negotiating skill on behalf of this country and peace seekers everywhere  she has handled all this with grace  grit  determination  integrity  humor and fortitude while remaining a steadfast feminist  advocate  activist  sister and tireless leader in the revolution  with this award  the women s media center declares hillary clinton our wonder woman    the washington examiner
