on friday a federal appeals court overturned a  ruling which allowed the u s  navy to use sonar for training  testing and routine operations  the low frequency sonar employed by the navy has been shown to harm dolphins  whales and other marine mammals friday s decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by the natural resources defense council  which was later joined by environmental groups  the suit alleged that the lower court s decision to allow the use of sonar was a direct violation of the marine mammal protection act the court agreed that the navy s use of sonar in the atlantic  pacific  indian oceans and the mediterranean sea violates a section of the act which requires all peacetime oceanic operations to have the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammals  the court also found that guidelines set forth by the u s  fisheries service did not give adequate protection to areas of the world s oceans flagged by its own experts as biologically important   the court found the result to be that  a meaningful proportion of the world s marine mammal habitat is under protected  as scientific american reports here unfortunately for many whales  dolphins and other marine life  the use of underwater sonar  short for sound navigation and ranging  can lead to injury and even death  sonar systems first developed by the u s  navy to detect enemy submarines generate slow rolling sound waves topping out at around  decibels  the world s loudest rock bands top out at only   these sound waves can travel for hundreds of miles under water  and can retain an intensity of  decibels as far as  miles from their source studies show that the use of sonar can cause whales to swim hundreds of miles and even beach themselves in an attempt to get away from the sound  the use of sonar can also cause marine mammals to bleed from their eyes and ears  it can also cause temporary deafness  a condition which leaves animals vulnerable to predators and other threats  according to the navy s own estimates  the use of low frequency sonar is expected to kill   marine mammals and cause permanent injury to more than  whales  an additional   would experience temporary deafness the latest ruling  which bans the use of sonar entirely  is a huge victory for environmental and animal rights activists image credit  whit welles via wikipedia cc
