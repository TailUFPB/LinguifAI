professional douchebag ted nugent took his love of guns way too far on monday  demonstrating how conservatives really feel about jews much in the way adolf hitler scapegoated the jews to justify world war ii and the holocaust  nugent scapegoated jews to justify an extreme pro gun agenda on his own facebook page  nugent plastered several photographs of jewish activists and politicians  and warned his followers to memorize who they are and gave them marching orders to give them hell and shut them down  know these punks   nugent wrote   they hate freedom  they hate good over evil  they would deny us the basic human right to self defense   to keep   bear arms while many of them have tax paid hired armed security  know them well  tell  you know how evil they are  let us raise maximum hell to shut them down  here s the post via facebook         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs

defense  posted by ted nugent on monday  february    a comment below his own post  nugent wrote   never again  in reference to the holocaust conservatives often use the holocaust as a prop in their argument to oppose gun control laws  the problem with that argument is that it assumes the minority jewish population would have been able to stand up to the powerful german military  which included the brutal ss when ben carson made the same claim last year  politifact ripped him a new one by pointing out that the nazis actually loosened gun laws significantly for the population  but restricted jews from owning firearms german citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the nazis  jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized  but for most german citizens  the nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened  not tightened second  a lack of guns was not the issue  if the majority of germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the nazis  they could have  but they didn t in other words  the only form of gun control the nazis really liked was keeping jews from owning them but even if the jews were well armed and willing to fight back  the fact remains that the german population supported the nazis and hitler had powerful military forces under his command  it is highly unlikely that the jews could have prevented the holocaust by themselves despite the facts  nugent wrote another rant aimed at those who criticized his first post  referring to jews who don t agree with him as  nazis in disguise          if  d getelementbyid

gt just when you hope that mankind couldnt possibly get any dumber or more dishonest  superfreaks rise to the occasion  posted by ted nugent on monday  february    by nugent s nasty words  the anti defamation league blasted him and demanded the removal of the post  this is nothing short of conspiratorial anti semitism  regardless of one s views on gun control  this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality  it should go without saying that anti semitism has no place in the gun control debate  you should be ashamed for promoting anti semitic content  and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message  we hope you will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet  ted nugent talks tough about his dad  but apparently the apple fell far from the tree  let s not forget that nugent dodged the vietnam war by pooping in his pants and this isn t the first time nugent has attacked a people that suffered through genocide  nugent once referred to native americans as  unclean vermin  who don t qualify as people  and let s not forget his anthem to child rape that must drive family values republicans wild also  keep in mind that ted cruz is nugent s favorite republican presidential candidate in the  race  perhaps someone should ask cruz how he feels about what nugent thinks about jews who support reasonable laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill  because that s what we re really talking about here  better background checks that most americans  including nra members  support  nobody in our government has suggested seizing the guns of every american  and there have certainly been no suggestions of banning certain ethnic minorities from owning firearms  this is all in the imaginations of conservatives who have used such claims to push a guns everywhere agenda that has only opened our society up to more gun deaths and mass shootings than ever before but if anyone should have their guns taken from them  it s ted nugent  considering the fact that he has openly called for the assassination of president obama and other government officials on several occasions  featured image from flickr
