while donald trump has staked a large part of his campaign on being  tough on terror   one of his own supporters is going to jail for plotting a terror attack against muslim americans  trump is yet to release a single word condemning this genuine threat to life  and any right thinking world  that should end his campaign  year old william celli  of richmond in california  received a  day jail term and three years probation for a plot to explode a bomb in an act of domestic terrorism against muslims the court heard how celli yelled  i m going to kill you all   outside the islamic society of west contra costa county later  the bomb squad was called to his home  where they found an explosive device which celli had planned to use against the mosque  the would be terrorist accepted a plea deal the case is another cause of great concern for the muslim community  who have faced a spike in hate crimes since the san bernardino shootings  muslims are being attacked on the streets  and their places of worship are being violated and even burned to the ground  while responsible lawmakers and political leaders attempt to bring america together  donald trump has staked his campaign on quite the opposite after the attacks on paris  trump called for a ban on all muslims entering the us  even muslim americans attempting to return from holiday  after the brussel s bombings  he made further despicable comments against muslims in general while failing to even express sympathy with those who lost their lives of loved ones this attitude  the leveraging of fear into hate  has done wonders for his presidential campaign   but very little for social cohesion in the country  now  one of his own supporters has taken the next logical step inside trump s logic  he went to war with muslims as raw story reports he appears to be a strong admirer of gop frontrunner donald trump   who was stoking islamaphobic fears in the weeks prior to celli s arrest in the wake of mass shootings in paris and san bernardino  california  donald trumps on again i m happy leaders okay but this guys a great point man i ll follow this man to the end of the world   celli posted oct    donald trump s on again i m feeling good about myself   he posted oct    while trump commented immediately with gross generalization about muslims in the wake of terrorist acts half way round the world   he is yet to utter a single word on this attempted act of domestic terrorism  he has neither denounced celli  or the views the wannabe attacker espoused  he has also failed to reassure the muslim community of any actions he would take as president to protect their lives  businesses and places of worship from such domestic terrorists this is because donald trump fails to understand the central responsibility of being president of the united states  if elected  he has to be president of all of it  every man  woman and child in the country  whether they voted for him or not  whether they share his religion or world view or not this may fly straight over the heads of die hard trump supporters  willfully ignored  but it must not be overlooked by the broader american public  it is moments like this that will kill the trump campaign when his race to win over republicans is complete  and he is faced with the impossible task of winning over a very different kind of audience featured image via facebook
