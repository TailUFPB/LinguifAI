experts are saying that republican presidential candidate ted cruz is being deceptive when he responded to allegations that he had extramarital affairs with five women  allegations originally published by the gossip magazine national enquirer  one of the women apparently is donald trump spokeswoman katrina pierson  and the other is carly fiorina deputy campaign manager sarah isgur flores  so ted seems to have been quite busy  although the idea is quite gross to think about phil houston developed a model to detect deception when he was employed by the central intelligence agency  he has conducted thousands of interrogations for the cia and other federal agencies  houston said  behaviorally  when the facts are the ally of an individual  he or she almost always tends to focus on the facts of the matter at hand  in this case  if the key fact was that he had not had these affairs  cruz would almost certainly have been much more strongly focused on the denial  that is  he very likely would have made a point of explicitly stating something along the lines of   i did not have these affairs   yet at no point in either statement did cruz say that  he implied it by saying the allegations are false  and that they re lies  but behaviorally  such statements are not equivalent to saying he never had the affairs  even if we were to overlook that fact and consider his statements to be a denial  there is an overwhelmingly higher proportion of attack behavior compared to the effort expended at denial  this type of lopsided attack to denial ratio is very consistent with what we have historically seen with deceptive people when allegations are levied against them  houston was referencing cruz s two statements denying the allegations  the first of which he posted on his facebook page  i want to be crystal clear  these attacks are garbage  for donald j  trump to enlist his friends at the national enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low donald won t go  these smears are completely false  they re offensive to heidi and me  they re offensive to our daughters  and they re offensive to everyone donald continues to personally attack  donald trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow  he subsequently spoke about the scandal  you can watch the video below   cruz said  the national enquirer published a story  it is a story that quoted one source on the record  roger stone  donald trump s chief political advisor  let me be clear  this national enquirer story is garbage  it is complete and utter lies  it is a tabloid smear  and it is a smear that has come from donald trump and his henchmen  it is attacking my family  and what is striking is donald s henchman  roger stone  had for months been foreshadowing that this attack was coming  it s not surprising that donald trump s tweet occurs the day before the attack comes out  and i would note that mr  stone is a man who has  years of dirty tricks behind him  he s a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent  well let me be clear  donald trump may be a rat  but i have no desire to copulate with him  and this garbage does not belong in politics  the national enquirer has endorsed donald trump  has said he must be president  and so donald  when he s losing  when he s scared  when republicans are uniting against him  decides to peddle sleaze and slime  you know  donald is fond of giving people nicknames  with this pattern  he should not be surprised to see people calling him   sleazy donald  based on these two statements  houston concluded    given the lack of additional information upon which to conduct a more comprehensive behavioral analysis  this is nothing more than our initial opinion and assessment  and we will continue to follow this matter very closely  at the same time  we cannot help but conclude at this point that it s not looking good for sen  cruz  there are other factors as well  cruz is a known liar  in fact  he has lied repeatedly during his run for the republican nomination and has a reputation as a liar throughout his political career  at one point  it was his campaign that sent out mailers that confused voters into believing they had committed some type of violation because they hadn t voted in the previous election in order to scare them into voting for him   it was also his campaign that purposely duped voters into believing that ben carson had dropped out of the race during the iowa caucuses in order to steal carson s  votes in his defense  it can be argued that it s hard to believe that five women  yes five not one  would want to sleep with the likes of ted cruz  whose policies are not only draconian  but who isn t exactly a looker either however  if this expert is correct  then cruz  who touts himself as a conservative family values man  will go down as one of the biggest gop hypocrites in history and that s saying a lot because there have been quite a few gop hypocrites watch video here featured image via gage skidmore flickr
