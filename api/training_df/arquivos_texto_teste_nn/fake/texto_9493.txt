the word  crooked  doesn t only apply to hillary  sadly  america is finding out that there are very few people in positions of power who we can trust  perhaps the reason president trump has so many loyal supporters is that americans believe he s the only person in washington with the courage and ability to actually drain the cesspool of corrupt government agencies in washington dc early drafts of former fbi director james comey s remarks about former secretary of state hillary clinton s use of a private email server acknowledged that there was evidence she had violated a federal statute prohibiting  gross negligence   but that phrase was deleted  according to sen  chuck grassley grassley  who chairs the judiciary committee  has been investigating the formulation of comey s controversial july  remarks in which he announced that the fbi would not seek criminal charges following its probe into clinton s use of a private email server the iowa republican on monday said the fbi had recently turned over records relating to then director comey s statement  the fbi included in those documents what grassley said appears to be a may    draft of comey s exoneration statement the draft was written two months before comey s july    press conference in which he said that he did not believe clinton had broken any laws even though she had been  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive  highly classified material in the draft in question  grassley said the comey statement included the following sentence   there is evidence to support a conclusion that secretary clinton  and others  used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified material  the same draft included the following sentence   similarly  the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as secret at the time it was discussed on email  that is  excluding the  up classified  emails  support an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information  despite this reference to  gross negligence   grassley said the same draft statement goes on to determine she should not be prosecuted for a crime grassley asked for more details about the documents  including copies of the drafts in their original format and all records relating to discussions about why the edits were made  in a letter sent to fbi director christopher wray monday  as you are aware   u s c   f  makes the mishandling of classified material through gross negligence a criminal act   grassley wrote   although director comey s original version of his statement acknowledged that secretary clinton had violated the statute prohibiting gross negligence in the handling of classified information  he nonetheless exonerated her in that early may  draft statement anyway  arguing that this part of the statute should not be enforced  grassley said later edits   on or around about june   remove those two sentences and include the following sentence instead   although we did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information  there is evidence they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information  comey had the opportunity to charge a woman  who has been accused of breaking the law numerous times  with a crime  and in doing so  would have proved to all of america that nobody  even if their last name is  clinton   is above the law  once again  however  crooked hillary managed to wriggle off the hook of justice grassley and sen  lindsey graham   r   s c   said in late august that comey began drafting a statement rejecting the idea of charging clinton with a crime over the email issue two months before clinton was interviewed in the fbi probe  the senators released partial transcripts of interviews the judiciary committee conducted with u s  officials to back up the statement for entire story  wfb
