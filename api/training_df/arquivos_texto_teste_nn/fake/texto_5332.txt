there are plenty of politicians of many stripes who are very afraid of the idea of a donald trump presidency  and with good reason  one of them seems to be former new york city mayor michael bloomberg  bloomberg was once a democrat  but switched his party affiliation to independent circa the year   and ran and won the city s mayorship as a republican before formally becoming a member of the gop  however  bloomberg is definitely not a fall into line party guy in   he endorsed president barack obama s second bid for the white house  and now  here in   he is endorsing hillary clinton for president  bloomberg is not only endorsing clinton  but he will speak at the democratic national convention in philadelphia during prime time  that means he will be going on during the same time as democratic stars such as president obama and vice president joe biden  one of bloomberg s top advisers  howard wolfson  says of the decision  as the nation s leading independent and a pragmatic business leader mike  bloomberg  has supported candidates from both sides of the aisle  this week in philadelphia he will make a strong case that the clear choice in this election is hillary clinton  this isn t necessarily a huge surprise  as bloomberg has definitely gone after trump on some of his more alarming policy proposals  this is especially true of trump s plan to ban muslims from traveling across the u s  border  and his ideas regarding building a wall along the southern border and forcing mexico to pay for it  and the mass deportation plans  despite the lack of surprise  though  this is an important endorsement  bloomberg is a billionaire  just like trump  and he is a high profile gop politician  this is definitely a signal to the sane republicans that are left that they need to do the right thing and endorse and vote for hillary clinton it s not about betraying one s party or one s principles  it s about what is right for the nation and the world featured image via roy rochlin getty images
