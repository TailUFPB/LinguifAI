short and easy quiz  which of these things is not like the other   a serial rapist who drugged dozens of women in order to forcibly have sex with them without their consent    a serial adulterer who had  sexual relations  with consenting women    hillary clinton if you answered  none of these things are like any of the others   then you answered correctly  number one is  of course  bill cosby  number two is  obviously  president bill clinton  and number three is  well  you know  and yet somehow  donald trump and the traditional media have managed to conflate all three in order to taint numbers two and three with the rapey stench of number one that s really all that needs to be said  and by the way  i thought more than a few conservatives have been defending cosby against the growing list of victims who were allegedly raped by the one time television and comedy star  but trump is counting on the fact that his low information ignoramus voters won t know the difference or  in fact  bother thinking for themselves for a change  instead  they ll simply agree with trump in spite of the facts on sunday s face the nation  hillary clinton was asked point blank what she makes of this nonsensical line of attack from trump clinton  well  if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past  that s his prerogative  you know  so be it i m going to draw the distinctions between where i stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women  raising the minimum wage  which affects two thirds of the women  who are the ones receiving the minimum wage  protecting a woman s right to make the most personal health care decisions that s why i m so proud to have the endorsement of the planned parenthood action fund that i received today in new hampshire  because i m going to fight as hard as i can against any efforts to defund planned parenthood  something that he supports so  there are very clear distinctions  he can say whatever he wants to about me  let the voters judge that  but i am not going to let him or any of the other republicans rip away the progress that women have made  it s been too hard fought for  and i m going to stand up and make it clear there s a huge difference between us yes  i get it  trump is attacking hillary for being a hypocrite by supporting women s rights while remaining married to a cheater  but it doesn t really make any sense  guaranteeing continued access to affordable contraception and abortion services doesn t have anything to do with hillary navigating a patchy marriage  but it s still an attack  i suppose frankly  trump is attacking bill clinton more than anyone else  the message here is that a cosby like figure will have access to the oval office  and that s bad  furthermore  there s definitely a bit of trump racism on display here  bill clinton is just like a rapey black man  run away  trump s puritanical white voters won t like that  hence the trump ad  the irony is that trump s puritanical white supporters are also supporting trump himself  who s had a rather spotty relationship with marriage fidelity himself bottom line  the ad makes zero sense  and it makes even less sense to demand that hillary respond to it  bill clinton s behavior was bill clinton s behavior  hillary had nothing to do with it  full stop via crooks   liars featured image via video screen grab
