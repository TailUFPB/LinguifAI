crains chicago business   american democracy is fragile  and unless care is taken it could follow the path of nazi germany in the  mixed in with many softer comments  that was the somewhat jaw dropping bottom line of barack obama last night as  in a q a session before the economic club of chicago  the chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned  president donald trump obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and ariel investments president mellody hobson in the great batman vs  superman debate  for instance  we learned obama sides with batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts one thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel   obama said  speaking of the u s   no other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals       if the u s  doesn t do it  it s not going to happen  obama gave one specific example  but it was a solid one  ebola  to fight the virus the u s  did everything from build an airport tarmac in africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries   we probably saved a million lives by doing that   he said at least indirectly  those comments could be seen as criticism of trump  whose foreign policy focuses on an  america first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world  he argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures  bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t  used to  challenge your assumptions   as a result   nothing feels solid   he said   sadly  there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated  still  the u s  has survived tough times before and will again  he noted  particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter joseph mccarthy and former president richard nixon  but one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions  obama added  though he has problems with the media just like trump has had   what i understood was the principle that the free press was vital  the danger is  grow ing  complacent   obama said   we have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly  that s what happened in germany in the  which  despite the democracy of the weimar republic and centuries of high level cultural and scientific achievements  adolph hitler rose to dominate  obama noted   sixty million people died       so  you ve got to pay attention  and vote
