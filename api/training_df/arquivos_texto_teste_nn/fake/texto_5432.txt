the minimum wage hasn t been raised for nearly a decade  and a decade ago  the fight was just as nasty and contentious as it is now and donald trump s running mate was on the wrong side of the argument in   congress raised the minimum wage from a paltry    an hour to a slightly less paltry    an hour  mike pence  then a congressman  and now the republican governor of indiana and our potential next vice president  opposed the raise  a  percent increase in the minimum wage that is brought into the well of congress without providing any relief to small business owners and family farmers is irresponsible and unwise   he said   it will harm both the wage payer and the wage earner  an excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor  source  huffington posthere s the video note that the minimum wage increased occurred before citizens united  so before the koch brothers had such a toxic effect on our political system  still  as the above video proves  the strawman argument about the minimum wage has been around for a very long time  and it s very wrong  according to the department of labor a july  survey found that  out of  small business owners with employees support a gradual increase in the minimum wage to    the survey reports that small business owners say an increase  would immediately put more money in the pocket of low wage workers who will then spend the money on things like housing  food  and gas  this boost in demand for goods and services will help stimulate the economy and help create opportunities  fortunately  for the country  the  increase passed in a bipartisan landslide  for small businesses  the law included tax breaks not surprisingly  pence has strong ties to the koch brothers  who have long fought any minimum wage increases  or really  any minimum wage at all  no doubt that s why pence  even to this day  still fights raising the minimum wage  while trump vacillates on the issue and hillary clinton supports raising it to   to   an hour featured image via drew angerer at getty images
