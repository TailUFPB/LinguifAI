since president obama took office in   the right wing has been awash with claims that he is a secret  muslim foreigner who plans to bring sharia law to america  now  they are going to have the  proof  they ve been waiting seven long years for  the president is going to visit a mosque next week oh my sweet allah never has a president ever spawned as many conspiracy theories as barack obama  during his tenure in the white house we have heard all kinds of crazy things  but perhaps one of the most asinine is the assertion that practices the islamic faith  conservative nutters have taken his education and used it to peddle lies to their bigoted base  of course  even if the presof course  even if the president were muslim it wouldn t matter since we have this really old document called the constitution that grants every person in the united states the inalienable right to practice  or not practice  whichever faith they want to  furthermore  article vi  clause  of the constitution says    but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states they know that it doesn t matter if he is a muslim  but they claim that he is because islamophobia sells   just look at donald trump so  perhaps with all of this speculation out there it s no wonder the president has never visited a mosque over the last seven years  however  that is all about to change as the white house announced obama will make his first trip to a mosque on saturday to show the community support  the president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity   white house spokesman keith maley said   as the president has said  muslim americans are our friends  and neighbors  our co workers  and sports heroes   and our men and women in uniform defending our country  the gop will predictably go wild  i m sure the whole  super secret muslim kenyan dictator frenchman double agent  talk will rear its uneducated head again  luckily for us as he finishes out his time in office he gives less sh t about what the party of hate expects him to do and more about what needs to be done featured image via salon
