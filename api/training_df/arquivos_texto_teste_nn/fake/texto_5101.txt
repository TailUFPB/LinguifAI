something that donald trump needs to realize is that his words are now heard not only all over the nation  but around the world  he s currently the presidential nominee for the republican party  and the things that come out of his mouth need to be taken very  very seriously so  when trump decided he would say  second amendment people  should take out hillary clinton  it should not be taken with a grain of salt  but rather with the utmost scrutiny  where trump might think he s being funny  there could be some sociopath out there who listens to trump s words and finds inspiration  a person who could do unspeakable things for any number of reasons one person who knows exactly how dangerous people who are inspired to do horrific acts can be is patti davis  the daughter of former president ronald reagan  reagan was himself shot by a deranged man named john hinckley taking to facebook after trump s outrageous remarks  davis laid into trump as only a person with her life experiences can do  she said  to donald trump  i am the daughter of a man who was shot by someone who got his inspiration from a movie  someone who believed if he killed the president the actress from that movie would notice him  your glib and horrifying comment about  second amendment people  was heard around the world  it was heard by sane and decent people who shudder at your fondness for verbal violence  it was heard by your supporters  many of whom gleefully and angrily yell   lock her up   at your rallies  it was heard by the person sitting alone in a room  locked in his own dark fantasies  who sees unbridled violence as a way to make his mark in the world  and is just looking for ideas  yes  mr  trump  words matter  but then you know that  which makes this all even more horrifying   and she s absolutely correct  instead of doubling down on his remarks  or claiming what he said isn t actually what he said  he should have owned the fact that he misspoke  clarified his true intent  and apologized to not only hillary clinton  but to all those who have been affected by gun violence  however  the chances of that happening are slim to none  so  don t hold your breath featured image via joe raedle getty images  facebook
