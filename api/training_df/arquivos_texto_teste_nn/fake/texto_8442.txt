facebook announced that it will be banning its users from arranging private gun sales over both the main facebook site and its photo sharing site instagram while these new rules do not apply to licensed gun dealers  who can still post with the stipulation that they do not conduct purchases on the site  it does apply to private one on one sales that do not require background checks in many states what is very important is that the move covers gun parts and ammunition as well  the banning of ammunition sales is obviously effective since without massive amounts of bullets you can t have massive amounts of gun violence  the fact it applies to gun parts is significant as well  federal law doesn t currently cover some gun parts  like an  unfinished lower receiver   they are treated as  not a gun  if they are  percent or less complete  this allows them to be sold without serial numbers or background checks  if you provide the parts to someone who is experienced enough to complete them  you basically have what will make an untraceable gun  afterward  they can be assembled with other parts into a fully functional firearm  some websites even sell the machines to complete receivers and boast about the fact you can build unserialized firearms legally in your own home facebook s status as a non governmental entity gives it more control over what it can allow on its network  it simply doesn t matter if a person s slightly unfinished gun parts are legal to sell to anyone without background checks  facebook can restrict whatever they want  just like they do with marijuana  pharmaceuticals or other illegal material  this helps tremendously in curbing the ways federal law has failed us facebook s head of product policy  monika bickert  said  over the last two years  more and more people have been using facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another  we are continuing to develop  test and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution  do you think that any republicans will be boycotting facebook now  what will their alternative be featured image via wikicommons
