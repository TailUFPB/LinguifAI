when there are those who are injured and killed in terror attacks  there will also be those who stand behind them in solidarity to show their unending love and support  no greater example of this was exhibited than on tuesday night in london s  arena when adele dedicated a song to the city of brussels  belgium and got the entire crowd to sing along with her brussels is the latest city to feel the sting of those who see harming others as a means to be heard and get their way  these terrorists are cruel  yet unfortunately  no longer unusual  too many of these attacks are occurring and there needs to be a united effort to stop the spread of terror across the globe one way to show these inhumane monsters that their terror will not affect life as we know it  is by sticking together in times of need and moving forward with a bond that is greater than anything hatred can foster  by dedicating her song  make you feel my love  to the city of brussels and having the entire arena sing along while waving light proves that age old saying from martin luther king  jr   darkness cannot drive out darkness  only light can do that  hate cannot drive out hate  only love can do that  and this is  by far  one of the most perfect examples of such light and love  at the end  adele was so touched that she said   i don t think i ve ever actually been so moved in my life at one of my shows that was just so beautiful   and it really  truly was we re all standing with you brussels featured image via youtube
