who wants to deport  dreamers   not many people  it turns out  even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal  that s true even though a lot of what s said about the daca recipients is pr style hooey for example  it s often said   indeed  former president barack obama just recently said   that the approximately   of them were  brought to this country by their parents   well  many were  but that s not required to qualify as a protected deferred action for childhood arrivals program recipient under the various plans  including obama s  you just have to have entered the country illegally before age   you could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes  you re still a  dreamer  likewise  we re told daca recipients are college bound high school grads or military personnel  that s an exaggeration  all that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative   including online courses and english as a second language classes  under obama s now suspended program  you didn t even have to stay enrolled compared with the general population  daca recipients are not especially highly skilled  a recent survey for several pro  dreamer  groups  with participants recruited by those groups  found that while most daca recipients are not in school  the vast majority work  but their median hourly wage is only     meaning that many are competing with hard pressed lower skilled americans the daca recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal  they re valedictorians  they re first responders  they re curing diseases  they root for the yankees  they want to serve in the army  if daca recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally  these are the poster children for the poster children   chicago  republicans in congress are not about to let the pesky facts about obama s  dreamers  get in the way of lobbying speaker ryan to grant them permanent citizenship numbers usa reports  thirty four republicans in the house of representatives signed a letter to house speaker paul ryan calling for passage of a permanent daca amnesty before the end of the year  reps  scott taylor  r va   and dan newhouse  r wash   led the effort while the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a daca amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must pass spending bill  they don t insist on any other immigration related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory e verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to chain migration the letter reads dear speaker ryan we write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  recipients before the end of the year  daca recipients   young people brought to america through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy  for many  this is the only country they have ever known  they are american in every way except their immigration status since daca s inception  the federal government has approved approximately   initial daca applications and   renewals  since being approved for daca status  an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school  found employment  or have served in the military  studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product  gdp   that is why the business community  universities  and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution we agree with president trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue  as was done under the previous administration  and we believe congress should act  we are compelled to act immediately because many daca recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission  not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities while we firmly believe congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system  it is imperative that republicans and democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year  we all agree that our border must be enforced  our national security defended  and our broken immigration system reformed  but in this moment  we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard working young people  we must pass legislation that protects daca recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible  reaching across the aisle to protect daca recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do here s the list of  republicans who need to be drained from the swamp rep  scott taylor  va   rep  dan newhouse  wa   rep  mia love
