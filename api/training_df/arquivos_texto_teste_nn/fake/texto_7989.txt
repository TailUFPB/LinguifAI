it has been nearly fifty years since the landmark supreme court ruling  loving v  virginia  that made interracial marriages  relationships  legal in the united states  but apparently some people are unaware of the ruling  a teenager in texas recently tweeted an infuriating letter from her dad explaining the reason why he s disowning her  the relationship she was in with an african american male stephanie hicks    is dating a black male and apparently this pissed her father off so much that he disowned her  in a letter she posted on twitter  her father says  my belief is that interracial relationships are despicable  vulgar and reprehensible  there s nothing worse than a half black  and i m crushed that my own daughter has entered into such a disgusting relationship mistakes can be forgiven  but you have willingly and consciously chosen a lifestyle of sickening choices  and i won t tolerate it  her father then tells her that is she does not break up with her boyfriend  nike  that she is not welcome in his life any longer  if you choose this black kid over your parents fill  up and leave my house change your name as soon as possible  because i won t have any association with you  ever  first of all  as a parent  i am disgusted by this piece of garbage who has the audacity to call himself  dad   if he s are willing to disown his child over who they are dating  he never had any business raising a kid in the first place secondly  it is  and no matter how much the gop would like us all to believe racism is dead  it is clearly alive and thriving in the state of texas  her father called her relationship  sickening  but the only thing sickening about any of this is that guy s vile  hatred for a person because of the melanin he has in his skin  it is sad that this is even a battle that needs to be fought still  but it does like stephanie  i am super white  i m so white that you could all use me to guide your way through a dark forest and my husband isn t white at all  i also live in the south  just like her and know what it is like to have people stare at me with disgust because my husband and child are naturally tan  seriously  in  america really has changed that much in the last fifty years because we have an entire political party that campaigns on platforms of racism and hate   hell  just look at donald trump  and this is going to continue to be a problem until we all step up and fight back  that means that we all have to vote for progressive candidates who want to move this country forward  not back hopefully  stephanie takes this and uses it to become an even stronger human being  sometimes the best thing a toxic person can do for you is cut themselves out of your life  featured image via twitter
