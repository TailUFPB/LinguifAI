marco rubio is making a name for himself in the republican party  some think  actually most  that he s the gop s best chance to defeat the democrats in a general election  he s young  he s hispanic  he s from an important swing state like florida  and he s not as crazy as donald trump  at least by appearance  but  what most people don t know  is that rubio s views on abortion make him an absolute nightmare of a candidate  and  people within his own party even are calling him out on it  during saturday night s republican debate senator rubio made the craziest accusation against hillary clinton on abortion yet  he levied the charge that  hillary supports aborting babies on their due date  when hillary was asked on face the nation what she thought of the comment  here was how she described it  among other words  pathetic  that s one way to describe rubio  for sure we can t say these kinds of attacks are not typical of republicans  cause then we d be lying  hillary wasn t even surprised in the least and didn t even flinch when offering her rebuttal   here was her full response  i think it s pretty pathetic  this is something that illustrates how senator rubio is going as far as he can to try and buttress his credentials within certain parts of the republican constituency  i ve been on record for years of where i stand on making abortion safe and legal  the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into  and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to very excruciating kinds of decisions  and  to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season to try and raise false charges and look like he s going to try and make sure roe v  wade is overturned and planned parenthood is defunded is just a tried and true tactic by those on the right  clinton followed this up by pointing out that rubio should probably brush up on the law first before bringing this up again in the future senator rubio may very well be the gop s best chance to go up against the democrats  but with comments like those in a debate  you can be sure clinton will be ready to shut him down again if she has to  we rate her description of rubio as  pathetic  to be accurate and right on the money  featured image via screen capture
