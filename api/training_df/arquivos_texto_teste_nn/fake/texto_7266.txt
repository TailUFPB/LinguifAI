republicans are repulsive people  this is a known fact  but the latest attempt in indiana to legislate how we mourn takes it to a whole new level the law says that  a miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated by a facility having possession of the remains   and requires  a person or facility having possession of a miscarried or aborted fetus to ensure that the miscarried fetus or aborted fetus is preserved until final disposition occurs  it doesn t matter how far along the pregnancy is  normally when a pregnancy ends earlier than  weeks  the  products of conception   fetal tissue and the placenta  are treated like any other medical waste  after  weeks  the fetus is considered a  stillbirth  and the parents typically have the option to cremate or bury it if they choose so even if a woman has a miscarriage at  weeks of pregnancy at home  under this law she could be required to keep the blood and tissue  take it to a hospital  and have it buried or cremated by a funeral home several other states have also passed similar laws  care to guess what color they are on the electoral map   but why do this for the last several years  i ve asked pro  life  proponents who insist that fertilized eggs and zygotes and fetuses are fully realized people a very basic question  if this is the case  why is it that no culture on the planet hold funerals for miscarriages or abortions no one has been able to offer a coherent answer and for good reason  no one has a funeral for a miscarriage because miscarriages are not people so republicans are trying to redefine how we view miscarriages  they want us to consider them the moral and legal equivalent of the death of a child  even if the  child  in this case is an  week old microscopic collection of cells let that sink in for a moment  republicans  the party of  small government   are literally telling you how to grieve  i can t imagine a more intrusive abuse of government short of prima nocta sort of   was a rough year and my wife and i suffered two miscarriages  we buried the sonograms of two lost pregnancies  planted a tree and set up a plaque you d think that i would be proof that miscarriages are people worthy of mourning  but you d be very wrong  we were not mourning a lost child  we were mourning the lost possibilities  i have three children now and i can tell you without reservation that i would rather face  miscarriages than lose one of them  there simply is no comparison anyone that claims they would be just as hurt by the loss of a fetus as they would a child they held in their arms is  at best  a liar and at worst  a monster that thinks very little of their children that republicans would try to further traumatize women by legislating their grief is a reflection of how cruel and debased the party has become featured image via simplyoloni com
