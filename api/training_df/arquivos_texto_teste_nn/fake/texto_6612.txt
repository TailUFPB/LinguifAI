how many times more are we going to get to say this before    while republicans were bashing obama for  insert situation here   he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do   this is a common theme between republicans and president obama  every time president obama does something good  they call it the biggest disaster imaginable  do they think we re not watching remember during president obama s iranian nuclear deal  when republicans said  going easy  on iran  translation   not invading their country  would only make them a worse threat huge shock incoming  literally nothing republicans swore would happen from the iran deal happened  in fact  yet again the exact opposite happened the latest proof of president obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent iranian elections  supporters of hassan rouhani swept to power in run off elections that gave the iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the iranian parliament for the first time in over  years forty two percent of the total seats were won by rouhani s moderate supporters  independents took nearly  percent of the remaining seats  and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists  this leaves a paltry  percent left for the iranian hardliners  which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table   where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm the landslide success of the iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between president rouhani and the united states  the deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of iran  and rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the iranian people the seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate  president obama not only won on the iran deal  but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone as if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in iran  the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights  this is iran we are talking about  the idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding  considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades while iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the west anytime soon  just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how president obama did on the iran deal republicans just can t win when it comes to president obama  every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly  he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the gop  we sure are going to miss him featured image via getty
