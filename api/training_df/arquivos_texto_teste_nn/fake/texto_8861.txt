conservatives alongside right wing media outlets are trying desperately to spin the gun debate in their favor  they know that the majority of americans support president obama s executive actions on guns  so they need to make it look like people don t want them one conservative media outlet  breitbart  decided to run an article with this title  obama s quandary  nra gaining support  gun control losing it screengrab via breitbarthowever  within the text of the article they try to piece together some sort of magic way of showing americans support the nra  but instead fail miserably  stating  in   twenty seven percent of americans strongly supported the nra  in december   that number had risen to  percent  in order words  over one in three americans  strongly support  the nra  in other other words  two in three americans do not support the nra  it doesn t seem smart to write an article about how terribly obama is doing and then point out with numbers how more than half the nation is actually on his side and not yours  bravo for that  well done they also point out  in addition to these things  the american people are voting with their feet by walking into gun stores all around the country and buying firearms at a record pace  figures from the fbi show that  set a record for the number of background checks performed in a single year  with    checks performed  but then reiterate  so the nra enjoys the   support  of more than one in three americans while support for gun control is losing ground  wsj suggests that this put obama in a position where he had to go it alone  no  the nra enjoys the reward of paying off members of congress to make sure president obama and the rest of america doesn t get the chance to hurt gun profits  oh  and all this hysteria over fbi background checks really proves is a strong amount of paranoia from the one third of americans who actually think guns are a solution or are deceived into thinking they ll lose their firearms in regards to actual support for stricter gun laws  data proves that is actually up drastically with more than   of americans saying they want laws on gun sales more strict there are facts  and then there s how one interprets facts  breitbart chose to report only one third of americans strongly support the nra  but anyone with a rationally thinking brain can decipher that this also means that two thirds of americans don t  they also want you to believe citizens don t want stricter gun laws  but  in fact  they do truth is  we need stricter laws on gun sales to make sure the wrong people don t get their hands on guns  this includes mental health background checks  if you re a law abiding citizen without a history of mental illness  guess what   none of your rights will be  infringed  because you ll still be able to purchase your precious paranoia machines firearms  and just like laws regarding cars and driving don t stop every accident  they sure as hell prevent a lot  just like better gun laws would prevent unnecessary deaths as well featured image  gage skidmore  flickr
