donald trump has managed to attract the most racist and islamophobic of american voters  that was all on display in rock hill  south carolina  at a friday night campaign rally when a muslim woman   year old rose hamid  was thrown out by trump security rose  dressed in traditional islamic dress and a t shirt that read  i come in peace   was sitting in the stands directly behind trump when trump supporters  at the urging of his campaign staff  began to chant trump s name after rose stood up when trump suggested that syrian refugees were affiliated with isis  rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled  which eventually led to her removal by trump s security hamid later said that she  came to the rally to let trump supporters see what a muslim looks like so i figured that i d give them the opportunity to meet one  she said that many were shouting  epithets  at her  she said that one man yelled   you have a bomb  you have a bomb  trump made an ironic comment at her  making the victim of the night the victimizer  trump said  there is hatred against us that is unbelievable  it s their hatred  it s not our hatred  major steven thompson of the rock hill police department said that hamid was removed  from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that  anybody who made any kind of disturbance  should be immediately ejected however  it s clear from the video that hamid was not making a disturbance  it s become commonplace for trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country this is trump s america  and as can clearly be seen from the video  if this person gets to power  we are all in trouble featured image via youtube screenshot
