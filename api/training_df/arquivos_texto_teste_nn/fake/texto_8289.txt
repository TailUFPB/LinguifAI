saturday s gop debate got off to a hilarious start as candidates ben carson and donald trump both failed to appear on stage after their names were called video posted to youtube by the washington free beacon shows an obviously confused ben carson hovering off stage for several minutes  after he apparently failed to hear his name called during the introductions at this point we see a man at the end of the hallway frantically gesturing to carson to walk out onto the stage after a long  awkward pause  during which the cameras were honed in on carson  the announcer goes on to introduce ted cruz carson begins to walk toward the stage  then suddenly stops  realizing that it was cruz s name  not his own  that was called carson moves further off stage  and cruz walks past him  patting his arm after cruz takes to the stage  the man at the end of the hallway appears again  yet again he can be seen waving wildly at carson  prompting him to walk out but nope  carson remains dazed and confused the announcer then calls donald trump trump saunters slowly around the corner  but he also fails to walk out on the stage with carson and trump both hovering in the hall  the announcer goes on to introduce marco rubio rubio walks past both of the other candidates  as trump stands awkwardly near carson jeb bush is called next  bush glides right on past trump and carson  who clearly have no idea what they re supposed to doing after all of the other candidates have finally taken to the stage  the moderators personally invite carson to come out of the hallway a moment later they call donald trump  noting that  he s standing back there as well  trump misses it again  he finally gets it right the third time around watch the hilarious video  courtesy of the washington free beacon on youtube  those who watch the gop debates hoping for substance or serious policy discussion are sure to be disappointed  every time but those of us who watch expecting nothing more than a good laugh are rarely disappointed image credit  video screen capture via washington free beacon on youtube
