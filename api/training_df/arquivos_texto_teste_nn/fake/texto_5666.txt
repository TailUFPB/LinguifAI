if the way donald trump reportedly ran the mar a lago resort in palm beach is any indication  if he wins  he will be taking full advantage of every spy agency in his charge  just for his own agenda according to six former employees at the resort  trump had a telephone console in his room that allowed him to tap into every single phone in the place  he often listened in on staff calls  but he could also listen in on guest calls  although the gop frontrunner s spokeswoman denies it according to buzzfeed  who spoke to six former employees  four of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity because of non disclosure agreements  this is indeed true  those four said he listened in  from the private room he keeps  during the mid  they said he listened in on calls between club employees or  in some cases  between staff and guests  none of them knew of trump eavesdropping on guests or members talking on private calls with people who were not employees of mar a lago  they also said that trump could eavesdrop only on calls made on the club s landlines and not on calls made from guests  cell phones each of these four sources said they personally saw the telephone console  which some referred to as a switchboard  in trump s bedroom none of the four supports trump s bid for president  all said they enjoyed their time working at mar a lago the two other employees did not wish to remain anonymous  they are trump s former butler  the one who wants obama killed  and trump s former security director  both of whom support trump s run for president  said that the console was only to make phone calls trump  the presumptive republican nominee  is running at a time when americans are increasingly concerned about surveillance   both by the government and by their employers  some of his own campaign staff feared that their offices in trump tower in new york might be bugged  the new york times reported last month  trump has backed the nsa s bulk collection of metadata  telling conservative radio host hugh hewitt that  i tend to err on the side of security   trump added   i assume when i pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway  if you want to know the truth  if trump was listening in on guests  calls  that was certainly a violation of florida law  the law is less clear on calls involving employees  but since both parties in florida need to be notified  if the second party is not an employee  that is legally murky at best this accusation is frightening  i have always been of the opinion that trump is running for the job of dictator  hence his admiration of putin and kim jong un  this does not bode well  all i can say is i hope hillary clinton s offices are locked down tight or we ll have another watergate on our hands featured image via john moore at getty images
