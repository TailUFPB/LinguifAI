donald trump is someone who abuses the judicial system to help enrich himself  in fact  usa today has uncovered that trump is or has been involved in an eye popping   lawsuits usa today has been covering this for a while  as of may  they had uncovered over  lawsuits  in june  that number went up to over    now  he s up to more than   and many are as frivolous as you might imagine trump is an argument for why rich people should pay more in taxes  every single lawsuit that trump engages in to protect his business costs taxpayers money and he spends a hell of a lot of taxpayer money in the courts  he uses them to renegotiate his bills  to defend his refusal to pay taxes  to iron out personal beefs  and we all know how he racks those up  and whatever floats his litigious boat on any given day here s a breakdown the bulk of the cases involve his casinos  there are   casino cases and overwhelmingly  trump is the one suing there are  cases involving branding or trademark disputes there are  contract dispute cases and in more than   of them  trump is being sued there are also  employment cases  and in the vast majority  he s being sued  of them are related to his golf resorts  of them are either trump suing the government or the government suing him there are six cases involving his presidential campaign  including a class action suit over bulk text messages directed toward people who never signed up surprisingly  there are only  defamation cases  despite the fact that he constantly threatens to sue he s a defendant in  personal injury cases and a plaintiff in one there are  real estate lawsuits  where he is generally the defendant yes  hillary clinton is also involved in several lawsuits  about    but overwhelmingly  she is being sued by federal prisoners  political activists and other people looking to sue the government  it s not because she s hillary clinton  per se  it s because she was a high ranking member of the government trump  though  should not get anywhere near the white house  we cannot have him nominating judges  we already know how that could turn out  trump is incapable of taking his own personal feelings and his own personal business dealings out of anything  and that s not what we need as the leader of the free world featured image via ron jenkins at getty images
