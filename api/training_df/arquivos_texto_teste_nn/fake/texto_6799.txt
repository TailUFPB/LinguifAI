almost incessantly  conservatives remind us that president obama is weak  it s certainly not true  but we hear it constantly as the right attempts to diminish each and every one of his accomplishments  no matter how small or large  one particular target area is the war on isis   which is going quite well  in december  the president promised we will  destroy  isis   and since then  we have seen him make good on his word  in fact  the following month in december  the president promised we will  destroy  isis   and since then  we have seen him make good on his word  in fact  the following month  the united states bombed a building full of the terrorist organization s money   a move that probably did more damage than a direct strike on the extremist group s soldiers   destroying millions of the already cash strapped terrorists  dollars in the process  in addition  daesh has been rapidly losing territory  which means a drastic reduction in tax revenue by february  isis was forced to slash salaries by half  do away with bonuses  and eliminate other perks  no more free snickers bars and energy drinks  terrorists    now  things are so desperate that the terrorist group is literally killing its own people so that it can sell their organs  taking things a bit further than their earlier order to harvest non muslims  organs for transplant  the arabic language al sabah newspaper reports that isis has now begun harvesting injured fighters  organs to be sold on the black market  doctors were threatened to take out the body organs of a wounded isil militant   the report said  iranian news agency fars confirms the information  the terrorists are suffering a budget shortage after their recent loss of territory in the southern part of mosul and for the same reason it is reportedly killing its own militants who have been injured in southern mosul to take out their body organs such as hearts and kidneys to sell them in the black market  in addition  rather than kill prisoners for youtube propaganda  isis is now keeping them alive to harvest blood for transfusions things are bad for isis  in april  the afp reported that isis  monthly income has fallen to critical levels  in mid   the islamic state s overall monthly revenue was around   million   million euros    said ludovico carlino  senior analyst at ihs  which issues regular reports on is controlled territory  as of march   the islamic state s monthly revenue dropped to   million   carlino said an ihs report also said oil production in areas controlled by is jihadists had gone down to   barrels per day from   barrels per day before this was due largely to air strikes by the us led coalition and russia  although ihs warned the decline was only an  interruption of production  as jihadists were able to repair infrastructure quickly there s something strangely satisfying about watching isis in its death throes  while it is widely acknowledged that the united states  under obama s leadership  played a large role in the terrorist organization s fall  you will never see republicans acknowledge this  after all  why sacrifice a good talking point over a little thing like  the facts  just for fun  here s a video of the airstrike that destroyed isis  cash stockpile featured image via getty images pool
