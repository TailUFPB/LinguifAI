just when you didn t think the trump campaign could sink any lower  it does  twitter lit up on wednesday evening  because it appears that lawmakers from numerous countries have been being spammed with emails from the trump camp begging for campaign donations  none of them are too happy about this  first  british mp s tweeted out their frustrations and outrage regarding this  and many referenced the horrifying nature of donald trump s campaign trail rhetoric  australian parlimentarian tim watts tweeted the fact that it was mp s from bunches of countries that were on the receiving end of the trump fundraising email assault to tpm s josh marshall  joshtpm  patrickruffini from what i can see  every australian mp too  even the left wing ones  imwithher  tim watts mp   timwattsmp  june    you give us just roughest sense of how many youve received          https   t co   josh marshall   joshtpm  june    that  joanne ryan  also of the australian parliament  tweeted the following and indicated she would be deleting  timwattsmp maybe it s a westy thing  me too  just what i need popping up in the inbox   swiplefttodelete  joanne ryan mp   joanneryanlalor  june    s not just british and australian mp s either  parliament members from iceland   denmark and finland report the same  jensschott  joshtpm yes pic twitter com   ida auken   idaauken  june     joshtpm  tpm   spam mail also received by mp s in finland   anders adlercreutz   adleande  june    are also angering our canadian friends with this begging spam as well  and former canadian prime minister kim campbell tweeted rec d a fundraising email from trump campaign  says it is their first  aside from fact i am cdn  clearly they don t follow me on twitter    kim campbell   akimcampbell  june    fundraising letter said it wd match funds if i donated w in  hours   and wd give me a big discount on the brooklyn bridge      kim campbell   akimcampbell  june    seems that team trump did not heed the week s earlier warnings from uk officials to cease and desist with the email spam  several lawmakers in the united kingdom tweeted their aggravation  the best  though was from natalie mcgarry  who actually took the time to respond to donald trump  jr   who it seems sent the email  she was kind enough to tweet images of both the email and her absolutely awesome response may be donald trump bought lists   bizarre for grassroots campaign   but how does he opt out of foreign donations  pic twitter com   natalie mcgarry mp   nataliemcgarry  june    said  in part  to trump  quite why you think it appropriate to write emails to uk parliamentarians with a begging bowl for your father s repugnant campaign is completely beyond me  given his rhetoric on migrants  refugees and immigration  it seems quite extraordinary that he would be asking for money  especially people who view his dangerous divisiveness with horror  boom  the fact that this was the response that mini trump received when he dared to beg for money from foreign leaders should have been a cue to cease and desist  instead  they expanded the effort to multiple other countries  it also bears noting that it is illegal for other foreign lawmakers and other political types to donate to u s  elections  further  it is also a violation of the law to solicit such donations as well  trump has already been issued with a federal elections commissions complaint over this activity trump s campaign is pathetic  but this is a new low  do the world a favor and leave this race  mr  trump  you re an embarrassment to americans on the world stage featured image via ralph freso getty images
