paul ryan sat down for an interview with usa today on wednesday  during the interview  the house speaker revealed his thoughts on president obama s final state of the union speech  it was made immediately clear in the interview that ryan loathed a lot of what president obama had to say  ryan was so upset with one point in obama s speech that he said it  degrades the presidency  ryan was mad the president obama had mentioned how the hatred towards others that donald trump is fanning and exploiting for political gain is hurting the united states  in case you missed it  here is the part of president obama s speech that ryan is referring to  we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion  this isn t a matter of political correctness  it s a matter of understanding what makes us strong  the world respects us not just for our arsenal  it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith his holiness  pope francis  told this body from the very spot i stand tonight that  to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place   when politicians insult muslims  whether abroad or our fellow citizens  when a mosque is vandalized  or a kid is called names  that doesn t make us safer that s not telling it like it is  it s just wrong  it diminishes us in the eyes of the world  it makes it harder to achieve our goals  and it betrays who we are as a country  president obama received a well deserved standing ovation for that small piece of political sanity so why is ryan so mad  well  he says that agrees with president obama  saying that  putting a religious test on anybody coming to this country is wrong   but goes on to say that president obama is wrong for commenting on the politics of the republican party  i think it sort of degrades the presidency to then talk about primary politics in the other party  during primaries  that s not what presidents ought to be talking about in state of the union addresses   ryan said   speaking up for our values and speaking up for our beliefs is one thing  but kind of wading into the primary politics of the other party is just not really what presidents ought to do  if this were a normal primary election  ryan might have a point  however  this is not a normal election and trump is hurting the united states without actually being in any office  trump was even called out during the republican response when governor of south carolina  nikki haley said   some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference   a statement that could easily be seen as a chastisement of trump for his refusal to keep his racism on the down low  rather than for being racist to begin with this all boils down to the republican establishment being angry and scared over the fact that trump has the party s racist base out of the shadows  now that they are exposed  they can be criticized for it  at their expense  president obama did that in a super classy way  wrapped in a message that draws on the better ideals of the united states you can watch the interview  in full  below featured image credit  screenshot via youtube
