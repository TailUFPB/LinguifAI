in an op ed that puts to rest any notion that ted cruz knows what he s talking about when it comes to terrorism and national security  nypd commissioner bill bratton did not hold back in the wake of the isis attack on brussels  the texas senator went on camera to call for mass surveillance of muslims in communities across the country as well as increased police patrols in those neighborhoods  because spying on and treating muslims like criminals is going to somehow prevent them from radicalizing not so  says bratton  who wrote in his op ed in new york daily news that what cruz believes about muslims is  fiction  and that the outcome he seeks is a  fairy tale  recently  republican presidential candidate ted cruz called for police to  patrol and secure muslim communities before they become radicalized   we already patrol and secure muslim neighborhoods  the same way we patrol and secure other neighborhoods   bratton wrote we do not  patrol and secure  neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion  nor will we use the police and an occupying force to intimidate a populace or a religion to appease the provocative chatter of politicians seeking to exploit fear nor will we accept the fiction of sen  cruz s narrative as presented  cruz repeated the false reports surrounding the nypd demographics unit and my decision to abolish it because it wasn t serving any useful purpose  he tried to depict the demise of the unit  as other ill informed observers have done  as a knuckling under to the forces of political correctness rather than the sensible administrative decision that it was  the fact is that the former administration had allowed the unit to dwindle down to two investigators  why  because the work of the unit  which was to map the ethnic makeup of the city to better understand the domain of the new york metropolitan area  was finished  the two remaining detectives simply had little to do bratton then dropped the hammer on cruz  it is clear from his comments that sen  cruz knows absolutely nothing about counterterrorism in new york city  we have in this city  without a doubt  the most effective and extensive counterterrorism capacity of any city in this country and virtually any city in the world  bratton went on to literally list the taskforces that work hard to provide counterterrorism for new york city  including the joint terrorism task force with the fbi  critical response command  nypd counterterrorism bureau  nypd intelligence bureau  and the nypd domain awareness system in the end  bratton explained that over  police officers under his command are muslims who work hard to keep the city and their own families safe from terrorists every day and schooled cruz on the constitution before cautioning him to actually do some damn research before opening his mouth again sen  cruz s references to the discontinuance of the demographics unit shows he has been hoodwinked by a  century fairy tale that refuses to die  he uses it in tandem with his suggestions that the police create a looming presence to intimidate muslim neighborhoods with a show of force in new york city  we protect all communities from crime and terrorism   yes  muslim communities too   because like us  they are americans who own businesses  work hard  pay taxes and dream of a better life for their children  over  of them work in my police department as police officers  many of them in counterterrorism and intelligence  many of them have served in the military and fought for their country  we police our city not by campaign slogans or inflammatory rhetoric  but by an old piece of parchment called the u s  constitution and another called the bill of rights ted cruz and others seem to be willing to sideline these principles because what they stand for shifts with the tide of the campaign and the shrillness of the name calling  but as it has been said  when you stand for nothing  you will fall for anything  sen  cruz needs to do some homework before he speaks again enough said featured image via flickr
