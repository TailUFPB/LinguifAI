democrats in the state of maine appear to be on board with a sentiment that s been floated around by a lot of progressive voters and media personalities in   they are now going to be voting on whether or not to do away with having superdelegates be involved in their primary process starting in  state rep  diane russell introduced the rule  russel gave comment to the bangor daily news  saying  we have a system of government where you have one person  one vote  by and large  the primary system is not when that happens  and i think that we need to start moving toward a system that s more fair  that s more democratic and more reflective of the popular vote  russell s amendment would change things in the state to where all delegates   including people who are currently superdelegates   were awarded proportionately based on the caucus results of the state complaints about the superdelegate aspect to the democratic primaries have arisen in many election years  but in  they ve been particularly strong due to the fact that there is a perception they are having a disproportionate effect on the primary voting process as more voters have become aware of the concept of superdelegates  and the fact that they are unelected individuals many of whom are not known to the public and don t necessarily have to represent the people s will  there has been increasing push back towards the idea of the  progressive  party having what many are calling a partial rigging of primary elections this issue goes well beyond just the  election  some voters see the superdelegate issue as a party establishment that is increasingly out of touch with it s voter base  following a recent history of extremely questionable moves made by dnc leadership which are more republican than democratic rep  russell is also including a non binding but  strongly suggested  statement with the rule that maine delegates vote proportionately in  to better reflect the popular vote results  she chose not to include a mandatory change for   because it would put maine out of compliance with the rules set by the democratic national committee featured image via flickr
