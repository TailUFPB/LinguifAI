there s an age old question that has been haunting the american people for several decades now   is donald trump s hair real  and if it is real  how does it do what is does  and if it isn t real  where does he get it from well  folks  we may finally have our answer  it looks as though a donald trump  wig farm  has been spotted along the coastline of troms   norway  and of course he would outsource his hair to another country   what a hypocrite just kidding  the  hair  is actually just a form of bunch grass  but the resemblance to whatever that is on top of trump s head is remarkably uncanny there s currently a ridiculously hilarious video making the rounds from vgtv out of norway that has been asking this hair raising question  they  of course  explain what it actually is you are seeing  but the video itself it pretty damn gut busting as they super impose video and images of trump defending himself over and over  telling people his hair is  in fact  real  although  with as much lying as the republican front runner has been doing lately  who knows  really let s just say this is a nice break in the monotony of the insane that we ve had to endure for the past few months enjoy watch the silly video explaining it all here featured image via video screen capture  scott olson getty images
