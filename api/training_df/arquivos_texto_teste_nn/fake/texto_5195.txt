it appears the genius businessman donald trump will have another failure on his hands  while the mainstream media is focusing  and rightly so  on his vile comments aimed at a gold star family  his love affair with nuclear warheads  a crying baby at a virginia rally  and his upcoming intervention  they are quiet about another story brewing trump taj mahal and casino will be closing down  indefinitely  just after labor day as a union strike by members of unite here against the casino enters its  day  the union has said that there are no negotiations currently in the works and there are no scheduled negations for the future in september   a bankruptcy court allowed the hotel owners  trump entertainment resorts  to eliminate the union members health insurance and pension plans  trump and his business buddies contended that if the union members  which equated to roughly   members  did not meet those demands  the hotel would be closed  in december of the same year  the union and trump  reached an agreement  and the hotel remained open  but it was also discovered that the hotel wasn t on the verge of closing because of the union  but because it did not receive the state and local tax breaks it was hoping for well the unions rightfully went on strike  starting on july   to protest against the sheer greed of trump and his allies  it should be noted that trump no longer owns or has a personal stake in the taj mahal since february   giving up his power over the hotel and casino a mere five months ago  the hotel now belongs to carl icahn  a personal friend of the presidential candidate  who bailed out trump entertainment resorts from bankruptcy   and this is the guy trump will make treasury secretary should he win the presidency sounds like a real winner it should also be noted that the shady business deals coming out of the taj mahal that the u s  department of the treasury said was significant and long standing money laundering violations  which would allow exploitation from criminals  terrorists  and other bad actors   for that  they were given a   million civil fine this hotel has been nothing but a headache for everyone who has ever been involved with it  trump himself included  it was one of his bankruptcies  and the contractors who worked to make it all happen were stiffed  the stockholders were stiffed  the staff were stiffed trump s buddy icahn  who s worth   billion  couldn t even keep it afloat  let that sink in featured image via jessica kourkounis getty images
