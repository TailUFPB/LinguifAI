the media is reporting that donald trump and hillary clinton are two of the most hated presidential candidates in u s  election history  you have fox news saying clinton s bad numbers will destroy her  and you have msnbc saying trump s negative numbers will destroy him whereas the fact remains that  yes  they are both viewed unfavorably by america as a whole  there is way more than meets the eye for starters  it should be plainly said that no  hillary clinton and donald trump are not  equally hated  by the american people in fact  in  different categories representing a multitude of diverse americans  clinton is much more loved than the current republican nominee according to gallup polling basically anyone who isn t a white  christian male overwhelmingly supports clinton over trump  and all of these demographics have a majority positive rating for the democratic frontrunner the only people who have a more positive view of trump over clinton are  highly religious  protestant other christian  mormon  male  non hispanic white  married men  white males  white non college graduate  married  men over  and those who have some college experience  the only christian group that backs clinton are catholics according gallup s analysis at the risk of overgeneralization  we can say that the typical american who really likes clinton and doesn t like trump is a black  hispanic or asian female living outside the bounds of a traditional marriage and who is unreligious  the typical american who really likes trump and doesn t like clinton is a white male who is traditionally married  religious  and a protestant or mormon in today s america  a candidate will need a diverse electorate in order to win  and trump does not have a broad coalition to make that possible  but the media will continue to talk about clinton s  unfavorable  rating to discredit her candidacy so yes  trump and clinton are two most hated candidates in election history  but based on what information  well  considering the majority of this country is mad up of either whites  christians or men  it would seem that clinton is  equal  to trump when standard mainstream media polls are conducted featured image via spencer platt getty images
