it is no secret that the republican party is incredibly racist  it s also no secret that the people over at fox news frequently bring their token minorities on for interviews in the hopes that this will somehow justify their vitriol  that s exactly what they did on monday when crystal wright  founder of the conservative black chick blog  appeared on fox   friends  hosts steve doocy and anna kooiman asked the blogger if she believes there is a gop candidate who could steal the african american vote   percent in   from democrats  wright responded by saying that donald trump is that candidate because he is the only person running who is  bothering to talk to black people and ask for their vote   she explained that his help would come in the form of mass deportation of the undocumented immigrants who are  stealing  jobs from black americans nevermind the fact that there are few americans of any race who are flocking to farms to harvest crops   a job that is performed by and large by immigrants as if that statement wasn t stupid enough  she went on to say  i think it s so sad when it comes to the black vote  blacks have shown a slavish support for the democrat  party for over  years  and part of me wonders if the republican party should even bother asking for the black vote   wright added   because black americans seem to like being political dummies  we re the only race that has voted lock  stock and barrel for the same party for over  years  perhaps that has something to do with the fact that the democratic party is the one who supported the civil rights movement fifty years ago  while republicans retreated into racism   and please do not try to say that it was the gop who wanted equal rights for all minorities  we all know about the southern strategy  wright s ignorance is breathtaking  if this is who fox goes to for advice about the african american community  it s no wonder the democratic party has secured their vote watch the rest of her interview below featured image via video screenshot
