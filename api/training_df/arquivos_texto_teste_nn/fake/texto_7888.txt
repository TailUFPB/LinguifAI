many americans have suspected that the rise of donald trump  who launched his campaign attacking latinos and has gone on to demonize blacks  muslims  women and even catholics  is tied to bigoted beliefs among a segment of republican voters despite the protests from some on the right and even the mainstream media claiming that trump supporters are backing their man solely due to  economic insecurity   some new polling data has begun to confirm that the movement behind trump is simply a white supremacist movement mr  trump s popularity with white  working class voters who are more likely than other republicans to believe that whites are a supreme race and who long for the confederacy may make him unpopular among leaders in his party  but it s worth noting that he isn t persuading voters to hold these beliefs  the beliefs were there   and have been for some time mr  trump has reinvigorated explicit appeals to ethnocentrism  and some voters are responding based on the results of those polls  here are nine of the amazingly racist things trump supporters seriously believe when trump says  make america great again   it seems like many of his followers really mean  make america white again  featured image via flickr
