sometimes you could wonder if some of the people running for the republican nomination for president are actually serious  when people like donald trump and ted cruz are leading the pack   two men who if not in positions of power would be considered certifiably crazy   are able to say the darndest things and get away with it  it makes one wonder if they re stupid  or if the people they re convincing have the mental capacity of a stone while at a campaign event on friday  ted cruz invited his prized endorser duck dynasty star and bigot extraordinaire phil robertson to speak  cruz also  in a lame attempt at humor  sadism    decided that if he were to be president he may name robertson as ambassador to the united nations  this suggestion was probably in jest  but really  who knows anymore when talking about robertson  cruz says  you know there s a reason he terrifies the mainstream media  he says the things you re not supposed to say  he actually remembers who we are as americans and just speaks it with a joy  not with an anger  not with a hatred  with a joy in who we are  then after saying he d name robertson to the coveted position of un ambassador  he said  how much would you pay to see the russian ambassador s face when phil says   what is wrong with you people   okay  here s the thing  russia would probably really like robertson because they have the same stance on homosexuality  so  who knows  maybe it would be a budding bromance if robertson s views are  who we are as americans  then  quite frankly  we re up shits creek without a paddle  most folks who admire common sense and decency for all humans regardless of race  gender of sexual orientation would tend to disagree with the horrendous statements both robertson and cruz regularly state however  it is not at all surprising that cruz would pander to his idiot base of voters with such a moronic suggestion as robertson at the un  his pandering knows no bounds  as was evident when he went full camo in robertson s official endorsement of him needless to say  this is something we should not fret over  because ted cruz will not be president if the american voters have anything to say about it featured image via flickr
