ann coulter is one of those blatantly offensive conservatives that most of us wish would just go away  but she continues to find a way to make herself seem somewhat relevant by spewing inflammatory remarks and hate speech on news shows on friday  bill maher had coulter on real time  where she probably thought she was going to succeed in spreading her ignorant views and praise for donald trump  but maher s show took another turn   instead  coulter was mercilessly bashed by one of maher s other guests  sex columnist dan savage savage  being more than familiar with coulter s anti immigration stance  which basically makes trump her political soulmate   called coulter out and brutally exposed the stupidity behind her beliefs  he asked  why do we want to throw these  million people out of the country  they contribute more to our economy than they take out  they pay more in taxes than they receive in services  illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita  coulter cut savage off  interrupting him with made up  facts  even though she claimed that his points were  untrue  and  false facts   she added  not only are they false facts  but if they are true facts then you need to go and elect people who will change the laws  savage didn t let up  referring to trump s obsession with building a wall at the u s  mexico border  savage fired back and took coulter s smug smile right off her face when he said  but your rationale for building this wall is bullsh t  coulter argued  no  the rationale is that he  the commander in chief  he protects the borders  those are the laws  savage also made sure to rip the gop as a whole just as hard as he railed against coulter  earlier in the conversation  coulter made a comment that savage  should be the spokesman for hillary clinton  because he was so judgmental and critical of the republican party  she   once again passing off lies as facts  said  that s gonna be a big hit with the american people   who are overwhelmingly voting for trump  savage didn t sugarcoat the truth for coulter  he countered  no  the gop base   which is overwhelmingly rubes  idiots  sexists  racists   are overwhelmingly voting for trump  truer words have never been said you can watch savage and coulter s tense exchange below featured image is a screenshot
