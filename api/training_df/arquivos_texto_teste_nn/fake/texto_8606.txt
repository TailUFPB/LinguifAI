ted cruz would like us all to believe that john f  kennedy would be a republican today if he were alive  jfk s grandson not only disputed cruz s claim  he torpedoed it in an op ed for politico  jack kennedy schlossberg repeatedly demonstrated that the republican presidential wannabe and jfk fanboy is full of bullshit cruz has referenced jfk on several occasions throughout his presidential campaign insisting that the late former president would not be a democrat today  but would instead join the republican party  jfk campaigned on tax cuts  limiting government and standing up and defeating soviet communists   he said in new hampshire earlier this week   jfk would be a republican today  he stood for religious liberty  and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern democratic party  not so fast  says schlossberg  as kennedy s grandson  and as a student of his life  legacy and administration  i find this notion and the suggestion that ted cruz is somehow taking up his mantle absurd  were my grandfather alive today  he d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since   he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a republican  indeed  according to schlossberg and the historical record  john f  kennedy was  and still is  a liberal hero who stood in stark contrast to the conservatives who have overrun the gop in the present day for instance  here s schlossberg on kennedy s record on science versus cruz and the gop  kennedy gave science and technology the highest national priority with his expansion of the space program  most of the republican party denies climate change and has fought all efforts to address it  and here s schlossberg on what religious liberty meant to jfk  kennedy believed in religious liberty and the separation of church and state  he did not believe in the right of elected officials to impose their religious views on others  and considering how jfk was attacked because of his catholic faith  schlossberg pointed out that  he would be horrified by the attacks made against muslim americans by leading republican candidates for president  schlossberg didn t stop there either  he continued to obliterate ted cruz s fantasy of a republican jfk even further on voting rights  he championed legislation to ensure that all americans could exercise their right to vote  he did not spend his time devising ways to disenfranchise certain segments of the population  on immigration  as a senator and president he supported immigration reform that would welcome more hopeful men and women to america s shores  he did not try to close our borders  demonize foreign nationals or separate families by deporting parents with american children  even jfk s stances on foreign policy differ from cruz s by a wide margin when it came to projecting american strength and power around the globe  jfk  didn t substitute bluster and bombast for statesmanship and resolve   and he certainly  did not propose a perpetual war footing or unilateral displays of force  jfk would be particularly pleased about how president obama has used diplomacy to reach common ground with iran and cuba and schlossberg called out cruz by name for irresponsibly forcing a government shutdown in  and leading the constant obstruction in the senate as things his grandfather would despise  kennedy believed government could help organize the best of america s energies and skills  he created new federal programs with ambitious goals  such as the peace corps  he did not spend his years in the house and senate devoted to obstructing the opposition  he certainly did not lead an effort  as cruz did  to shut down the federal government to score political points and deny health insurance to millions  and in a final knockout blow to ted cruz  schlossberg described how if the texas senator had listened carefully to jfk s nomination speech in   he would know that his claim about kennedy being all about lower taxes  talking tough to the soviet union  and supporting limited government is totally wrong  as it turns out  kennedy admitted that taxes would not always be low because it would take everyone chipping in their fair share to make government work better for everyone and promised that he would not deliver harsh rhetoric against the soviets   clearly  cruz hasn t read that speech   schlossberg wrote in conclusion  schlossberg said   today  my grandfather would be  years old  he d have no idea how to use a cell phone  and he d be shocked by just how far the republican party has lost its way  it s safe to say that ted cruz should probably keep his damn mouth shut the next time he thinks about bringing up john f  kennedy as an example of a president who would be a republican today featured image  wikimedia
