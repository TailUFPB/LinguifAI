george zimmerman  the infamous neighborhood watchman violent wannabe cop who murdered unarmed black teen trayvon martin is in the news again  and as usual  it is for nothing good  showing once more that he has absolutely zero remorse regarding the fact that he killed an unarmed teenage boy who was carrying nothing but skittles and a can of iced tea  zimmerman is now auctioning off the gun he used to kill martin for more fame and money however  zimmerman s efforts to sell the murder weapon have been quite rocky  first he tried to use a gun dealer called gunbroker com to sell the kel tec pf  that he used to gun the teen down in cold blood  but the site has now removed the advertisement  in which bidding for the gun started at     don t be too happy with gunbroker com just yet  though  this is the same website that allowed targets that strongly resembled trayvon martin available when the controversial shooting was still in the news  the social media sites of gunbroker com are now down  including their facebook and twitter  because they know how wrong they are for allowing zimmerman to list this gun in the first place  the listing on the site now reads  sorry  but the item you have requested is no longer in the system  as if this cowardice isn t bad enough  another gun dealer has taken up the cause of allowing george zimmerman to continue to profit from his murdering without remorse of an unarmed child  a site called united gun group has taken up zimmerman s fame whoring  murderous  money making cause  and they have released the following statement regarding the listing of zimmerman s weapon  via tmz  a spokesperson for unitedgungroup com says he got in touch with zimmerman through a mutual friend once the initial listing was removed  he tells us unitedgungroup com s stance on the controversial item is if it s legal  they have no objections and it  comes down to a moral decision for george to do what he wants with his property  but  as we are all well aware  acquittal and or legality does not always   justice  then again  we really can t expect gun nuts to know or care anything about these simple facts  or about the crazy and unjust law that allowed this goon to literally get away with murder  george zimmerman is a murderer  and he has profited without remorse for being a murderer  and these events show that he continues to do so shame on anyone who helps this despicable excuse for a human being continue to get rich quick and rub salt in the wounds of trayvon martin s grieving family featured image via pool getty images
