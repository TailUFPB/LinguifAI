it appears that several voicemail messages were obtained by the website gawker showing republican presidential frontrunner donald trump s extremely close relationship with the supposed  liberal  media  despite the fact that during many of his rallies he s openly badmouthed the very media he adores covering him according to gawker  while gawker was unable to independently verify their authenticity  the recordings certainly appear to be genuine  in addition to those from the msnbc personalities  there were messages from longtime barack obama advisor david axelrod  new england patriots quarterback tom brady  and boxing promoter don king  all of whom spoke to trump in a friendly and familiar manner  and this tweet from joe scarborough seems to verify that the transcripts seem to be legit oh my god  i just read the transcripts  trump must have contributed to a children s charity  scandalous    https   t co bxczcdskqb  joe scarborough   joenbc  march    woman who identified herself as t  hall  is allegedly tamron hall from msnbc  she s reported to have said  i celebrated by going to gucci  and i m going to use your discount  because there s a green dress that s like     and i need a discount bigger than the one my discount  apparently wanting trump s discount for the gucci store that his located inside trump s  avenue building  she also apparently said  i hope you re bracing for romney to get his butt whipped tomorrow by obama  showing that the message clearly dates back to the  election  an election that hall was covering  however  in yet another message  she s clearly upset with trump over his birther nonsense  i saw the youtube video today  i wanted to chat with you about it  since you know that i m a huge fan  and i think the world of you  but i think that thing today was not good not becoming of who i think you are as a person  as a statesman  like your award  i just thought it was just kind of crummy  other voicemails indicate  as already previously talked about  trump s relationship with joe scarborough and mika brzezinski  it looks as though trump donated to one of their charities  here s the alleged transcript via gawker brzezinski  hi  donald  it s mika and joe calling  say hi  joe scarborough  hey there  donald  how you doing brzezinski  we re just leaving you a message because we re trying to get in touch with you  but you must be  like  on your jet or something  we d love to talk to you  so call one of us  what s your other number  joe scarborough  i m at   and the kids want to scream  thank you   to you  donald  say   thank you  donald  children  thank you scarborough  we are so  so grateful for everything  donald  and we just want to call you and tell you how much it means to us brzezinski  it was amazing  thank you  donald  hope to talk to you soon  bye gawker also reported that hackers were able to not only access trump s voicemail  but change his outgoing message the original outgoing message is here  via abc and here is the alleged audio of what the hackers were capable of doing  all of this is very alarming considering trump is apparently incapable of securing his cellphone and voicemail  if he allows this sort of thing to happen  what sort of ineptitude would he bring to the white house if elected  yet one more reason to remember that no matter who  vote blue featured image  flickr
