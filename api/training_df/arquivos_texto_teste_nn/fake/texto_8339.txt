it s pretty rare that a presidential candidate would regret getting an endorsement while on the campaign trail  but such might be the case for goper marco rubio after what former pennsylvania senator rick santorum did to him having recently dropped out of his own race for the white house  santorum decided to throw his support behind the flordia senator yesterday  giving the candidate his best wishes and a passionate endorsement  this endorsement followed rubio s third place win in iowa on monday  and the candidate is picking up speed for the new hampshire primary taking place next week but on thursday morning  santorum s endorsement had the complete opposite effect on rubio s campaign  instead of being a great boost  it just made both politicians look incapable and stupid  thanks to santorum s appearance on morning joe  host joe scarborough simply asked the question  what do you list as marco rubio s top accomplishment   and it all went downhill from there  you can watch the awkward  embarrassing footage below santorum not only squirmed and danced around what was an understandable question  but failed to finally give any sort of satisfying answer  some of santorum s meek side stepping remarks were that rubio  a tough election in florida  pull people together from a variety of spots  and that  he s someone who brings people together  meanwhile  the morning joe panel couldn t help but laugh at how absurd the situation was  in a final attempt  scarborough firmly pressed the former senator  he s been in the senate four years  can you name his top accomplishment  and santorum proved that even with the help of the show s hosts  he just couldn t come up with even one thing rubio had done  defeated and tired of smiling and shaking his head  santorum eventually said   the bottom line is there isn t a whole lot of accomplishments  joe   and accused the host of asking him something  i just don t think it s a fair question   even though it was completely straightforward and logical  this interview was so awkward that at one point  scarborough s co host mika brzezinski said  hold on  this is disturbing  featured image is a screenshot
