the aids crisis is far from over  but thanks to medical advancements  the diagnosis is no longer a death sentence as it was in the  and   in those days  the lgbt community was blamed for the epidemic and our pain was largely ignored by those in positions to help  in fact  bigots often mocked the suffering of people they clearly viewed as less than human  one such person was rebecca bradley  who was a student at marquette university at the height of the crisis  she also happens to be the newest justice to make it to the supreme court in the state of wisconsin one wisconsin now  a left wing activist organization  managed to dig up some of this woman s more interesting articles  in which she expressed some truly disturbing opinions  in one such article bradley slammed aids activists and their misdirected compassion for the degenerates who basically commit suicide through their behavior  she also opined that having aids was better than having cancer because those afflicted with the politically correct disease will be getting all of the funding   as if that weren t bad enough  bradley topped it all off with an even more disgusting opinion  how sad that the lives of degenerate drug addicts and queers are valued more than the innocent victims of more prevalent ailments  here are screenshots of just a few choice quotes from rebecca bradley  via one wisconsin now it is also worth noting that this woman believes that abortion is the equivalent of nazism and slavery now  sure  this was more than two decades ago  but it s quite likely that bradley s opinions haven t changed all that much  hateful tigers generally don t change their stripes  in response to the controversy  bradley only said that what s in the articles have nothing to do with who i am as a person or a jurist  and they have nothing to do with the issues facing the voters of this state  with all due respect madame  that is a load of horseshit and you know it  there s no way you could be fair on any matter involving lgbt people if those are the views you hold on something as serious as the aids epidemic  further  your use of dehumanizing slurs is truly beyond the pale  you  my dear  have no business being on any judicial bench  or in any position of power whatsoever  anywhere wisconsin  rise up and reject this hateful excuse for a supreme court justice  or you ll be stuck with a bona fide bigot making decisions for you for the next decade featured image via screen capture from queerty
