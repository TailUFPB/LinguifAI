new york city officer matthew langone sure does love his instagram account  it is also the reason he is now facing an investigation while off duty  langone moonlights as a producer of pro cop merchandise  there would be nothing wrong with this  except for one little fact  the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community  in fact  at least one t shirt is the very definition of fascism the latest shirt from the langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart  with the slogan   i  protesters   the  ot  in protesters is in blue  clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever increasing number of protests  keegan stephan  an activist against police brutality  discovered the photos on langone s instagram account and uploaded them to twitter  here is the image officer langone of the   doesn t think much of free speech  except of course as  ot   pic twitter com   keegan stephan   keegannyc  january    you think that s bad  you ain t seen nothing yet  suspecting more horrible content lay within the confines of langone s instagram  stephan kept looking  he found it to be full of horrible memes and derogatory language directed at the very people this cop is sworn to serve and protect  here are just a few in fact  his whole instagram account is pretty unbecoming of an officer  imo     https   t co  pic twitter com   keegan stephan   keegannyc  january    be clear  this appears to be an active duty cop w the   posting this filth  https   t co  pic twitter com   keegan stephan   keegannyc  january    s the last meme  in which langone refers to community members as  hoodrats   that got the attention of rory lancman  of the queens city council  lancman called on the  precinct  at which langone works as an active duty officer  for an investigation  lancman said of the posts  i m deeply disturbed by the reprehensible instagram posts of a police officer in the  precinct  which covers a significant portion of my district  it s completely unacceptable for someone who has sworn to protect our city to post messages advocating violence and referring to community members as  hood rats   such comments erode public confidence in our police and undermine our efforts to improve police community relations  i urge the nypd to take immediate disciplinary action and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated  but of course  the blue wall of silence is always more important  than  you know  keeping the community safe from a cop with fantasies of fascism and violence and who clearly has nothing but contempt for the people who live there  the cops at the precinct only had this to say  we want to make sure that the posts are his  how many fake instagram and twitter pages are out there  someone may have been putting this out in his name  how convenient  even more insidious is that they have now blocked keegan stephan from following their precinct on twitter  stephan posted the proof wow  way to deal with the problem     pic twitter com   keegan stephan   keegannyc  january    think  after this  it is safe to say that their  investigation   will just be another in a long line of countless cases where they investigate themselves and determine that there was no wrongdoing featured image via screen capture from raw story
