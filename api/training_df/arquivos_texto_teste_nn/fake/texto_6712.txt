 during the days of the old west shooting an an unarmed man violated a code that cowboys lived by and brought shame as well as arrest and prosecution for murder but in the conservative version of the old west we are being forced to live in today  codes and the law mean nothing as long as you re a christian gun nut during the morning church service on sunday at keystone fellowship church located within montgomery county in pennsylvania a parishioner with a concealed carry permit shot and killed  year old robert braxton in the chest during some sort of altercation as members of the congregation ducked for cover after the shots rang out  it sounded like three pops  almost like a champagne bottle opening three times   said congregant breeana somers   everybody s trying to make themselves as small as possible  you could hear some screaming and some crying but it was pretty silent  i went under a chair in a fetal position  i tried to make myself as small as possible  it s really frightening that anything like this could happen here  despite the fact that the gun toting churchgoer openly murdered an unarmed man for what is sure to be a ridiculous reason  the man has not been arrested or charged  according to montgomery county district attorney kevin steele  there s no one in custody   he told nbc    the individual involved in the shooting is cooperating with police at this point  yeah  and he s the only one who gets to tell the story because the other guy is dead ironically  the keystone church had written a facebook post earlier announcing that an anti government evangelical pastor would be a guest speaker that day and banned photography and video  for our guest s safety   apparently  church leadership was not concerned about guns or the threat they pose to the safety of their congregation here s the video via nbc  again  a man literally shot and killed an unarmed man in the middle of a church service and he gets to walk free  this is sickening  featured image via wikimedia
