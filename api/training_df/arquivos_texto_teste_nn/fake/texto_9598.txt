u s  rep  maxine waters attacked president trump about  seconds into her speech to  homeless lgbtq youth  at the ali forney center in new york city earlier this month she began her speech with   wow  what a moving evening this is  i m sitting here listening  watching  absorbing  thinking about ali even though i never met him  and with this kind of inspiration  i will go and take trump out tonight   she said  pumping her fist as the crowd roared with approval on monday  waters offered no apologies for her promise to  take out  trump during an interview with cnn s  new day   and instead doubled down on her commitment to impeach the president  those words have been interpreted as an attempt on the president s life   cnn s chris cuomo told waters   how did you intend them  that s absolutely ridiculous  nobody believes that   waters said   a  year old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in congress and politics for all these years talking about doing any harm  the only harm i may be doing to the president is i want him impeached   waters said she alleged the folks who oppose her efforts to unseat the president  and the people who want her out of office  are racists  and those people who are so opposed to my leadership on impeachment are organizing the right wing  the white nationals  the kkk  they have organized an effort to try and  of course  defeat me in my election coming up and to discredit me   waters said  everybody knows that i m on the front lines not talking about any physical harm to anybody  but i am talking about impeachment and i m not going to stop  she then went on to name all the reasons she hates trump  though none of them include a legal justification for removing the president  i believe this president is not worthy   she said   i believe this president should not be representing our country  he has alienated our allies  he continues to lie  day in and day out  he creates controversy  he can t get along with the members of congress  he needs to be impeached  i want him impeached  and i m going to continue my efforts to call for his impeachment  cuomo pointed out that waters  comments represent  ugly talk   and questioned whether those who oppose trump should  be the change that you want to see and have   a high level of decency in how you discuss those whom you want to criticize  especially when it s the president of the united states  waters alleged she s been  extremely responsible in laying out the case for why this president should be impeached  the problem is racists  she said  i know that the right wing  the white nationalists  all of those who have organized around this president  do not like this  and people are not accustomed to a woman  in particular an african american woman  taking this kind of leadership   she said   how dare me challenge the president of the united states  but we have never witnessed a president who has been as irresponsible and as dangerous as this president  and i think that we need to step up to the plate and tell the truth and speak truth to power and that s what i m doing and that s what i m going to continue to do  waters has used every platform available to her to continue her crusade against president trump it s only making her look totally unhinged
