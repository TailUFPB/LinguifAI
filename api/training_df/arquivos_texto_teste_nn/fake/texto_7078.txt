the full economic impact of the horrific new anti gay law passed by north carolina s bigoted legislature will not be known for quite some time  but we are already seeing numerous ways that the geniuses who place hatred over the needs and the good of the people are damaging their state north carolina s public facilities privacy and security act   something that came into existence as a response to the city of charlotte s attempt to create a fair and equal environment for all citizens  including transgender individuals  by granting the lgbt community equal rights pertaining to public accommodations as the rest of the world enjoys  nullifies the charlotte ordinance and bans localities from expanding protections for the lgbt community  it also requires everyone to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender at birth this horrific and blatant attempt to deprive a segment of the population of equal rights has not only angered the public  but the obama administration as well  at this moment  the justice department is in the process of determining if the law violates federal civil rights statutes  if it does  the state could lose billions  with a b  of dollars that would otherwise go to fixing highways  education  and housing funding cities and states have banned taxpayer funded travel to north carolina and production companies have left the state over the law  depriving the state of tax dollars and a boost to local economies where filming took place  recently  lionsgate films canceled filming of a new hulu show and moved production to canada in short  yes  on tuesday  paypal announced that it has withdrawn plans for a new blogal operations center in charlotte   the city that attempted to be inclusive in the first place   that would have employed  people in skilled jobs  the new center was announced just weeks ago  in the short time since then  legislation has been abruptly enacted by the state of north carolina that invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender citizens and denies these members of our community equal rights under the law   paypal said in a statement   our decision is a clear and unambiguous one  but we do regret that we will not have the opportunity to be a part of the charlotte community and to count as colleagues the skilled and talented people of the region  as a company that is committed to the principle that everyone deserves to live without fear of discrimination simply for being who they are  becoming an employer in north carolina  where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law  is simply untenable  the company says  the new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of paypal s mission and culture   leaving them unable to open a center in the state  paypal is in the process of determining where the new location will be  and says it regrets not having the  opportunity to be part of the charlotte community  they remain committed  however  to  working with the lgbt community in north carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation  alongside all those who are committed to equality  paypal is not the first to refuse to do business in north carolina  nor will they be the last  this new law will ultimately be damaging to the state  and everyday people will be the ones who are hurt the most featured image via getty phillymag
