earlier this year  presidential hopeful jeb bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in baltimore and ferguson  which were tied to predatory policing of african americans that led to murder by cop via think progress during a q   a with employees of the pharmaceutical company nephron  his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in ferguson and baltimore  kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning   bush said   they ve never been challenged to achieve far better  they ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better  you see what happens in baltimore and ferguson  you see the tragedies play out  you see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific  jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege ridden republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the african american community   blame the parents fast forward  months later during an interview with cbs miami  the topic of jeb s daughter noelle came up  jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs  the interviewer specifically asked if jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as governor   if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems listen to jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via cbs miami   i can t blame myself  that s not gonna solve any problems  and you just can t do that  jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity  however  as you saw above  if you are black and live in a city that means it s your family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity here is some history on jeb s daughter  in   noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a xanax prescription in tallahassee  a judge sentenced her to rehab  in july   she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program  in october   noelle was jailed again for  more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center  in   she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since these are  crimes that were drug related in less than one year  she spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it it s relevant to know that during jeb s first year as florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors  including a  year minimum for as little as  grams of heroin  he also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses  bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed   drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs  somehow jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield one final bit of annoyance jeb s son george p  bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex girlfriend s home while drunk when he was  years old  he walked when charges were not pressed what an elitist republican jerk   jeb bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems  while laying all the problems african american people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders featured image via flickr
