while there has never been a confirmed instance of transgender people as child predators  this year s republican pearl clutching is directed toward transgender people and their rights to use bathrooms  states are even passing laws trying to ensure that somehow  people s bathroom habits match up to their birth certificates yes  it s absurd  and some retailers are telling their customers exactly that by opening their bathrooms to any shopper  regardless of genitalia  target was the first major retailer to do that and now  starbucks and barnes   noble are joining them starbucks  hudson s bay co  parent company to lord   taylor and saks fifth avenue and barnes   noble have all come out in support of trans people s rights to use the bathrooms that best align with their gender identities  hbc respects and affirms each person s right to self identify and access facilities that reflect their gender identity   said spokeswoman tiffany bourr  starbucks spokeswoman jaime riley stated that the company is  looking into additional opportunities to have more gender neutral signage in our restrooms where jurisdictions allow it  as a company  barnes   noble treats all employees and customers with dignity and respect   spokeswoman mary ellen keating said   for our transgender employees and customers  that means that they are allowed to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with  source  newnownextof course  whiny conservatives are  well  whining thanks to starbucks s idiotic gender neutral bathrooms  i won t be going there anymore   maggie holmes     may    hey  boycotttarget peeps   barnesandnoble and  starbucks have the same policy on bathrooms  that needs more attention   dj   formadeo  april    ingodidotrust   target bathrooms are fast rivaling starbucks as a libtard safe haven  clayvis   hamneggwillie  april    most starbucks shops  this is little more than thumbing their noses at right wing nut jobs  most starbucks bathrooms are single stall  so privacy is kind of a given if you recall  it was just a few months ago when starbucks was being boycotted by presumably some of the same people   people who objected to the fact that their christmas cup didn t have jesusy images like snowmen and christmas trees  it was just blank here s the video and still  republicans don t get it  they don t get the point of our government  young conservatives  for example  said this  which sums up much of the argument against gender neutral bathrooms it is very strange how many large companies are willing to completely ignore the safety of their customers just to pander to less than   of the population ironically  this is the argument used every time liberals suggest equality for everyone  it s true that transgender people are a tiny minority  but that s why they need legal protections  we have never been a true democracy  we don t bow to the tyranny of the majority  when african americans were legally integrated into society  the majority of citizens were white and the mouth breathers objected to their little girls being in a stall next to a little african american girl  obviously  integrated bathrooms didn t cause problems then and they cause no problems now  they are just the latest desperate grab at an ugly past when the only people who counted were white  male  cigenders and protestant featured image via getty images
