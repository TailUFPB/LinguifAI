our beautiful first lady michelle obama used her final commencement address to take aim at gop presidential nominee donald trump  and it was absolutely glorious  taking to the stage at the city college of new york before the graduates  mrs  obama pulled no punches  there was no need to mention trump by name  as there could be no doubt as to whom she was talking about  she began  here in america  we don t give into our fears  we don t build up walls to keep people out  because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home  after that  mrs  obama continued to take aim at him  some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective  they seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped  they tell us to be afraid of those who are different  to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree they act as if name calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate  as if anger and intolerance should be our default state  rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress i have seen what happens when ideas like these take hold  i have seen how leaders who rule by intimidation  leaders who demonize and dehumanize entire groups of people  often do so because they have nothing else to offer  that is not who we are  it seems that no one  even our first lady  can resist slamming trump  michelle obama has largely been quiet on the  race  she has endorsed no one  and she has slammed no one   until now  that really says something about how out of control trump is  that she felt compelled to do so  this speech also makes a huge impact with its timing  because everyone is still talking about thursday s brilliantly fiery speech from hillary clinton  in which the democratic frontrunner laid into trump like no one has ever done before of course  mrs  obama could not  as a sitting first lady rather than a political candidate  use a commencement speech to go after trump by name in the brutal fashion that secretary clinton did  however  that doesn t matter  her message was loud  clear  and true  trump s ideas are dangerous  and they have no place in america at all  much less in the white house watch a few clips of this incredible speech below  via the hill  featured image via video screen capture
