the move by a twitter employee last week to ban president trump from the social media platform for  minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like what did not get a great deal of attention  however  was the fact that twitter s acting general counsel  sean edgett  admitted in a prepared statement to the senate judiciary committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the clinton campaign and dnc in negative lights writing for newswars  jerome corsi notes at a hearing of the senate judiciary committee subcommittee on crime and terrorism on tuesday  sean edgett  acting general counsel for twitter  admitted in his prepared testimony that twitter employed in the  election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical  of  hillary clinton  including the hashtag  podestaemails and the hashtag  dncleaks  is anyone surprised twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even usa today brought it up  noting that twitter s behind the scenes team was quick to ban right wingers like milo yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever so entertaining actress leslie jones yet  conservatives say  nothing happened to rapper talib kweli and his followers when they attacked black breitbart reporter jerome hudson with racial slurs  when breitbart contributor kassy dillon complained about a twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages  twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot dillon in the head  now  the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to hrc and the dnc during the  election  the twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people  one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place  but that s a different matter   but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise for example  dr  corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the judiciary committee  edgett stated for example  our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated tweets promoting the  podestaemails hashtag  which originated with wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the clinton campaign chairman john podesta s gmail account  the core of the hashtag was propagated by wikileaks  whose account sent out a series of  original tweets containing variants on the hashtag  podestaemails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the wikileaks website so  automatically  what mr  edgett has admitted tells us that twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user  wikileaks  offering authentic information that wikileaks had published revealing real  confirmed e mails sourced from john podesta and the dnc  those e mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the dnc that worked against bernie sanders  campaign  and in favor of mrs  clinton s campaign  and later revealed extremely important information about what mrs  clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of syria and the underlying  unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of qaddafi in libya edgett also testified that twitter hid   of the   podestaemails  tweets  andas described in greater detail below  our systems detected and hid just under half     of the tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag   dncleak  which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the democratic national committee  those would be the e mails that revealed towering corruption at the dnc and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the clinton campaign to offer her easy questions  things like donna brazile  then an employee of cnn  feeding hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman  bernie sanders these are issues that were real  and the more people knew about them  the more they disliked mrs  clinton   and the more she and the dnc hackmeisters pushed the spurious  russia hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance for entire story  mrctv
