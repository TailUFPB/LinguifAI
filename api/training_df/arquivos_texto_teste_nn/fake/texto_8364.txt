not a day goes by when a prominent figure on the right doesn t remind us that  good guys with guns    basically anyone carrying a firearm at any given moment   will act as our saviors whenever a  bad guy  threatens  these glorious figures  sent from god herself   act as paladins of justice  dispensing it in the form of hot pieces of lead at a speed of   feet per second  unfortunately  at a moment s notice  someone thought to be a  good guy  could easily reveal himself to be anything but that police in murray  utah were called after a mcdonald s drive thru customer pulled a gun out and threatened to shoot employees  the unidentified man can be seen on video arguing with an employee  at first  a white subaru outback can be seen pulling away  but the vehicle stops about  feet from the window  three men exit the car and the driver of the vehicle walks back to the window  pointing his gun inside  i don t need this   the gunman yelled  apparently failing to realize that he probably didn t need to bring a second amendment solution to an argument over food fortunately  one of his friends pulls him away before he has a chance to open fire  it makes you think  if he was going to shoot one person  how do we know he wasn t going to jump through and do the rest   employee michela spikes told    i ve got a  month old son i got to think about  watching the video  she remarked that it   looks like he was actually serious about to do something  right before the man in the gray hooded sweatshirt pulls the angry ammosexual away from the confrontation it s nice to think that the average human is responsible enough to carry around a weapon that can end numerous lives in seconds  unfortunately  all too often guns are used to resolve minor conflicts  to chase down shoplifters  end abortion forever  solve disputes over roadkill  express displeasure at getting stuck behind a snow plow during a blizzard  or check who s downstairs  everyone wants to think of themselves as a  good guy   in fact  in many situations  the  bad guy  still views himself as the opposite  think about it  the average man can t be trusted to put the toilet seat down reliably  and we re trusting him to carry around something that gives him the power to decide life or death  a study published in the american journal of public health notes that for  each percentage point increase in gun ownership  the firearm homicide rate increased by      researchers could not determine causation  but  found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm related homicides  of course  it s also important to consider that the presence of a gun in the first place increases the likelihood of this sort of incident  guns not only permit violence  they can stimulate it as well   leonard berkowitz  emeritus professor of psychology  university of wisconsin  said after conducting a  study on the effect of weapons on aggression   the finger pulls the trigger  but the trigger may also be pulling the finger  psychology today notes in   leonard berkowitz and anthony lepage conducted a fascinating study  first  participants were angered by a person pretending to be another participant  called a confederate   next  participants were seated at a table that had a shotgun and a revolver on it or  in the control condition  badminton racquets and shuttlecocks  the items on the table were described as part of another experiment that the researcher had supposedly forgotten to put away  the participant was supposed to decide what level of electric shock to deliver to the confederate who had angered them  and the electric shocks were used to measure aggression  the experimenter told participants to ignore the items on the table  but apparently they could not  participants who saw the guns were more aggressive than were participants who saw the sports items  this effect was dubbed the  weapons effect  fortunately a  good guy without a gun  stepped in and prevented his friend from doing real harm watch a report on the incident below featured image via screengrab
