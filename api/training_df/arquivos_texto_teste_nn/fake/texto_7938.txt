virginia s voter id law is being challenged in court and with the loss of a conservative majority on the supreme court  this might just be the first domino to fall  signaling the end of wide spread voter suppression by republicans  reuters    a virginia law requiring voters to show photo identification goes on trial in federal court on monday  with democratic officials claiming it is discriminatory and aimed at keeping party voters from casting ballots defenders of the  virginia law say that it is aimed at preventing voter fraud  the trial  in u s  district court in richmond  virginia  is one of several voting rights legal battles in process as democrats and republicans square off ahead of november s presidential election the democratic party of virginia and two party activists are suing the virginia state board of elections and want judge henry hudson to strike down the law the problem for the right is that the premise behind these laws has always been a lie  republicans only became  concerned  with  voter fraud  when it became clear that their white hegemony was in immediate danger  adding to this problem was the over the top way republicans attacked people s ability to vote  if voter id had been a stand alone law  then republicans might have been able to maintain the fiction that it was just about voter fraud  however  they also cut voting hours  the number of polling places  but only in democratic leaning areas   made the ids difficult to get and  of course  kept bragging about how it would hurt the democrats and just to be absolutely clear that voter id laws are bullshit  here s my favorite quote from the new york times      five years after the bush administration began a crackdown on voter fraud  the justice department has turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections  according to court records and interviews although republican activists have repeatedly said fraud is so widespread that it has corrupted the political process and  possibly  cost the party election victories  about  people have been charged and  convicted as of last year widespread voter fraud does not exist the only way for a court to uphold voter id is to willfully turn a blind eye to the glaring pattern of voter suppression republicans have openly laid out  if you re wondering why they were so brazen  it s because they were quite confidant that the supreme court would back their partisan attack on democracy  after all  they gutted the voting rights act by claiming  in all seriousness  that racism in america was over and keeping  mostly southern  states from blocking minorities from voting wasn t necessary  southern states immediately responded by passing laws blocking minorities from voting now that republicans no longer have a friendly scotus to allow their shenanigans  the number of lawsuits against voter id and the laundry list of voter suppression tactics is going to grow  according to yahoo  kansas and north carolina s id laws are also under fire  not a great time to be a republican featured image via onewisconsinnow org
