wednesday  january  was the day of the world s largest gun show  held in las vegas  nevada  the shot show  shooting  hunting  and outdoor trade  is where arms dealers gather to show off their best and newest instruments of death  understandably  the event sponsors have to keep a tight grip on media at the event  lest journalists ask questions that might make people think just a little bit that s why when the guardian s rupert neat went to the show to ask people questions that are indirectly related to gun control  he must have known it would be only a matter of time before he would be thrown out of the event  neat s experiences were documented on video  and then posted online in the beginning of the video  neat says that he was specifically asked not to talk about gun control with any of the more than   hundred exhibitors at the event  despite this warning  neat actually talked to many of the exhibitors and attendees of the event about questions indirectly related to gun control  before being kicked out of the show  neat asked people what they thought was driving the huge boom in gun sales that were seen last year they re answers were nearly identical   fear  fear is what is driving the record sales of firearms in the united states  it has been well documented that mass shootings drive gun sales  so does talk of gun control  when president obama is elected reelected  and when minuscule actions on gun control are taken  in december of   after president obama announced he would be taking executive actions to slightly increase gun regulations    million guns were sold  the only other month that has topped that record was in january of   which coincided with both the sandy hook elementary massacre  and obama s second term but those types of questions are not what get neat kicked out of the gun show  while talking to an exhibitor with smith   wesson  neat was shown a mp  sport rifle  neat held the gun and casually asked the exhibitor  so  is the same gun used in the san bernardino shooting   neat asks the exhibitor dodged the question  simply answering that the gun is mp  sport rifle  he then promptly removes his microphone  at that point neat gets an e mail asking him to come speak to the communications director at the event  neat and his crew are told multiple times to stop filming  and refused to answer any questions while the camera was rolling  neat then left the gun show the truly disturbing   and important   aspect of the encounter between the journalist and man from smith   wesson is that it shows how dangerous breaking the fantasy that the nra and other lobby groups sell  is to gun manufacturers  the goal of public relations is to sell a credible version of reality  the reality that weapons manufacturing industry wants to sell is that their weapons are tools to fight dangerous people  not tools used by dangerous people   or toddlers  any questioning that can potentially unravel the credibility of their meticulously crafted version of reality must be silenced  or disregarded as the deranged ramblings of lunatics you can watch the video  in full  below https   www facebook com guardianus videos  featured image credit  video screenshot via facebook guardian us
