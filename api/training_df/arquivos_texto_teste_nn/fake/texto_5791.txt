as the donald trump campaign shows signs of going broke  it s no surprise as to why  instead of paying staffers  building a political machine and reaching out to voters  trump is using the measly dollars his campaign collects to pay himself and his businesses  the money has even gone to his personal entities  including his jet plane and his florida estate  mar a lago in total  trump has paid himself over    million while trump continues to paint himself as the champion and savior of the middle class  hillary clinton  the presumptive democratic nominee  reminds people that trump is only in this for himself  his image  and his brand   nothing else what is trump spending his meager campaign resources on  why  himself  of course  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  june    conservatives and liberals accuse clinton of being beholden to money  it s good to remember that there s nothing illegal about this  clinton does it too  and so does every other candidate with any of their own businesses that provide even the smallest service to their campaign  because the law requires them to pay for it  even if the candidate owns   of that business  what makes trump different from clinton and anyone else doing this is the sheer amount of money he s paid himself and how much he does it  he s not following the law like clinton  he s bending and manipulating it as clinton calls it  trump s meager campaign resources aren t being used to actually win a presidential election  this is all a charade for the  billionaire  mogul  who recently went on the record saying he d drop out of the race if someone offered him   billion  that s how much the presidency is worth to him  it s a game  and it s all about money while clinton gets endorsements from unions that represent millions of blue collar workers  trump continues to line his pockets with the money of the people he s pretending to care about featured image via angelo merendino getty images
