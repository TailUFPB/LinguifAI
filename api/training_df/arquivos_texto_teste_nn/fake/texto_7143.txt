if you ve been privy to any form of a donald trump rally  then you re likely aware that they can sometimes get violent if anyone were to dare speak up in dissent of the republican frontrunner  in fact  trump himself will encourage the crowd to get the protesters out  even going so far as to incite violence  this has been going on for some time now  and many have been waiting for him to be held accountable for his actions and words  well  it looks like that time is now on thursday  a lawsuit was filed by three people who assert that they were attacked  and or called racial slurs during a trump campaign event on march  in louisville  kentucky  according to nbc news  the lawsuit filed thursday was on behalf of kashiya nwanguma  a  year old college student  molly shah  a  year old activist  and henry brousseau  a  year old high school student  according to wdrb out of louisville  three people who claim they were assaulted at the donald trump rally on march  have filed a lawsuit against trump  his campaign  a white supremacist and a korean war veteran  those who claim to have been assaulted say they were there to peacefully protest  but trump stopped his speech to tell the crowd to  get  em out of here  wdrb reports  nwanguma  a  year old university of louisville student  claims she was protesting non violently  carrying a sign depicting trump s face on the body of a pig  the lawsuit alleges nwanguma was called racist and sexist slurs and repeatedly assaulted  heimbach and bamberger both shoved and struck her  according to the lawsuit  a video of the incident went viral soon after the rally shah claims after one of trump s five comments urging supporters to throw out protestors  heimbach and others rushed at her small group  shah said she witnessed someone punch brousseau and then she was shoved from behind by heimbach as she began to leave brousseau  a  year old high school student  alleges he was punched in the stomach by a one of the traditionalist worker party comrades   the suit includes unknown defendant  as a party  you can read the full complaint here seeing what s been happening at trump rallies nationwide  hearing about these incidents really isn t too hard to believe  these three individuals just finally took truth to power and are filing a much deserved lawsuit listening to donald trump at any rally isn t like listening to any sort of politician who truly wants to serve the nation  he s clearly in this election for himself  and this is evident by how much he talks about how great he is throughout any speech  he doesn t want anyone around him to dare question his motives and he s very manipulative with the press  keeping them in pens and only fielding questions that will best suit his own interests  if you dare speak up against him  he ll slander you  and he doesn t seem to be capable of apologizing or owning up to his own mistakes  this is all on top of the fact that he only speaks in applause lines and bumper sticker phrases while encouraging his crowds to be violent  he s literally taking a crop of blindly misinformed nitwits and using them as his own personal brownshirts  reminiscent of another harsh dictator from germany who came into power in the  trump must be stopped and he must be held accountable  this lawsuit is hopefully the first of many in the quest to make sure he never sets foot inside the oval office featured photo by joe raedle getty images
