republican presidential front runner donald trump has claimed that he loves veterans and he loves the military  to be sure  most of the expressions of this supposed love have come in the form of trump arguing that he would use the military to execute the innocent relatives of terrorists and that he would force members of the armed services to engage in torture practices banned by the geneva convention but now it has been revealed that one of trump s companies treated a military veteran in a disgusting way republican presidential front runner donald trump has been vocal about the need to take care of u s  veterans  he s said that if elected  he ll  put our service men and women on a path to success as they leave active duty  but that s not what the trump institute  a get rich quick real estate seminar  did for richard wright  a senior master sergeant in the air force reserves who worked for the company in  and   wright was deployed to afghanistan in the spring of   when he came home to his job  the trump institute fired him   all of your absences   wright s boss at the trump institute told him  had forced the company to  reevaluate your position with the trump institute   it is a violation of federal law to penalize an employee for absences caused by military service wright provided the huffington post with proof he was awarded three medals for outstanding service during his time serving in afghanistan stories about the shady and sometimes unethical business practices trump engaged in or lent his name to over his career will continue to plague the candidate as he tries to restart and remake his image in preparation for the general election it is unlikely to work and trump s rhetoric will continue to be exposed as empty words hiding behind the military featured image via flickr
