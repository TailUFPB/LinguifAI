if msnbc had referred to donald trump as a rich asshole  fox news would have thrown a collective hissy fit about it  but the conservative network has no problem insulting the former secretary of state with a level of vitriol that does not belong in broadcast news after interrupting hillary s live speech on wednesday  in which the democratic nominee was talking about how real successful businessmen are able to succeed without destroying the lives of others to achieve their goals  fox turned the commentary over to antonio sabato  jr   who was eager to disrespect her  just give her a broom so she can fly away  that witch   he said   oh  we cannot stand her and please stop talking  i m not sure who the  we  he was referring to is  but the calvin klein model then demonstrated why he is paid to keep his mouth shut and pose for the pretty picture by professing his support of the racist republican nominee  she s talking about trump  she s talking about mistakes  what has she created  what has she done in the last   in her entire life  she s done absolutely nothing  i can t stand her talk anymore and i think the american people have to wake up  donald trump is the only way  here s the video via youtube it s outrageous that this kind of rhetoric is allowed to be used during a live news broadcast  it s even more outrageous that there were four women sitting with sabato  jr  and none of them bothered to smack him down for using such a term to describe the potential first female president of the united states make no mistake  this was a sexist attack against hillary clinton by a donald trump shill who seems to have no problem with trump s anti semitism and anti immigrant stances despite the fact that he and his parents are immigrants and his maternal grandmother was a jew who survived the holocaust it doesn t get more hypocritical than that featured image via screenshot
