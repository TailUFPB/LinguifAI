trump s business prowess is his major selling point with his followers  and he s trying to sell it to the rest of the world  after all  he s made tons of money  right  that makes him such a brilliantly successful businessman  and he s so smart that he can translate that enormous fount of skill and knowledge into politics  and  make america great again  what he doesn t talk about are his many failures  and how he turned those failures into money for himself  even while his employees suffered  atlantic city suffered  and his investors suffered  what did he suffer  oh  that s right  the stigma of fleecing  which isn t a stigma at all as far as he s concerned how did he do it  he put up very little money of his own  shifted his personal debt over onto his casinos  and let the consequences of his failures fall onto his investors  who had bet that he was actually a good businessman  while all that was going on  he sat back and collected millions in salaries  bonuses and other payments as a result  his casinos suffered from too much debt and too little revenue  he borrowed money for them at such ridiculously high interest rates that there was almost no chance his casinos could ever succeed  he did this after telling regulators he wouldn t  too  he filed for chapter  bankruptcy four times  and then continued with the expensive loans in fact  he filed for bankruptcy on the trump taj mahal twice  and trump plaza casinos once  he then reorganized into trump entertainment resorts  inc   which ended up with    billion in debt  yes  that s with a  b    and then he filed bankruptcy there  too  each time  he convinced his bondholders to accept much less money while he continued to pile on the debt he also took money out of his casinos in atlantic city to invest in his manhattan properties  and then from his smaller atlantic city properties to try and prop up the taj mahal  he called atlantic city a  very good cash cow for me for a long time   the lesson he learned from all that  don t leave yourself on the hook for loans  so he shifts debt to everywhere else he can to avoid having to pay for it himself in other words  he s a diamond level master manipulator  nobody without his skill at manipulation could have walked away from that many failures with millions in their pockets his casinos aren t his only failed businesses though  he also has that s a hefty list of businesses at which he s tried and failed  his casinos are probably the worst  though  because they had the biggest negative impact  the impact was made worse by a weak kneed board that allowed him to rake in his own dough even though his casinos couldn t draw in enough people to create a sufficient revenue stream  let alone deal with the debt they were carrying when trump left atlantic city  many people were happy to see him go not just because he was a blemish on their industry and city  but also because he failed to pay contractors and other workers for the work they did on his casinos  that s so sadly typical of trump as president  his business acumen would be his greatest liability  not his greatest asset  all he knows is manipulation in favor of himself  he doesn t actually know how to do anything real  as this demonstrates featured image by joe raedle getty images
