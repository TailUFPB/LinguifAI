bette midler has made her distaste for the gop s  clown car perfectly clear  usually via her twitter account  on monday morning  we woke up to the gross hashtag  cruzsexscandal trending on twitter  and on tuesday  the divine miss m made her thoughts on the matter perfectly clear in hilariously appropriate tweet  the tweet reads  i don t know if ted cruz really has  mistresses  if he does  let s hope they have better access to birth control than he would propose  here is the tweet i don t know if ted cruz really has  mistresses  if he does  let shope they have better access to birth control than he would propose   bette midler   bettemidler  march    is right  of course  now  to most of us  the idea that ted cruz could find five women who would voluntarily sleep with him is pretty gross  not to mention downright unbelievable  however  that s not the point here  ted cruz is no friend to women  he is completely against easy access to birth control  and he is adamantly pro birth  we re talking about a guy who would make rape and incest victims give birth  no matter what  if he could  the idea that a man like that wants to be president of the united states in this day and age is downright scary  cruz wants to get inside our bedrooms and uteri  but then again  that s the entire gop s idea of so called small government hopefully  if this is true  the women cruz is stepping out on heidi with think twice before they crawl into bed with him again featured image via twitter
