charles koch sat down with abc news and did an interview  during which he said it was  possible  that hillary clinton could be a better president than some of the republicans still left  it was in no way an endorsement of clinton  it was a well worded question that elicited a noteworthy and honest response  that  seconds of reporting dominated the already slow news cycle while the meat of the charles koch interview went largely ignored charles koch doesn t come across as many people think he should  he shows up in sweaters and comfy shoes looking like mr  rogers and being extremely passionate about his policy positions  what many people don t understand is that the koch brothers  while massive and powerful beyond belief  are libertarians  libertarians want taxes gone  they want money out of politics because they think the government should be almost non existent  in order to achieve this libertarian utopia  they first have to conquer the republican party  the only people who will give them a flat tax and deregulate everything charles koch admits that he benefits from a  rigged system   he admits to all the money that is spent on corporate welfare and tax shelters for the wealthy  he admits that cronyism runs our country and he knows that the rich are getting richer and the poor have no chance  if you were to attach charles koch s belief system to a liberal set of values you d have bill gates meets warren buffet  unfortunately  what you actually end up with is a grandfatherly figure whose sheer power won t be stopped  it ll be chatted about nicely in the den the kochs lean to the right on enough issues that their money gets thrown at the republican party  they want to eliminate the tax code  thinking it will put people on level playing field   or maybe just to keep more profits  they want regulation out of business  so free markets could thrive and regulate themselves   or maybe just to cut corners and save money  they want money out of politics  so they pour money into politics  the kochs aren t in danger of being aligned with democrats  but if you listen to charles tell it  if the democratic party would come around on just a few things  they would see more koch money  yes  that s a ridiculous notion  charles koch sits and talks about everyone taking care of one another while it was he and his brother who created the tea party and their bigotry and went to work in  to see to it that everyone hated the poor and ebola enough to vote red the kochs have always backed republicans  an investment charles calls  disappointing   he remembers the one time he asked for a political favor to shoot down a bill that was nothing but corporate tax breaks and fewer than  percent of the people they backed on the campaign trail came through when it was time to vote  the one time  somehow it seems unlikely that a man who just confessed to raising half a billion dollars for political purposes has asked for more than one favor  but we ll let mr  koch s good character speak for itself  wink  wink  they have apparently gotten tired of the republican party  at least this time around  charles is adamant that the mud slinging ad hominem festival of stupid that has been the gop primary has not received a dime from their war chest  not a single campaign on either side has reaped the benefits of koch support  the only candidate koch mentions by name is bernie sanders  who he says is at least addressing the issue of the two tiered system and wealth inequality  though he can t understand his methods  it s difficult for a man who professes to be a  classic liberal  to consider putting the needs of the less fortunate first  if his barn is stocked with horses  his cupboards and refrigerator with food and his home stocked with creature comforts he ll be in a much better position to help those who have struggled all in all  this interview doesn t bode well for the gop  they re looking for almost a billion dollars from koch s pac  which by his own estimate has only raised   million so far this year  the republican party has certainly shown that it knows how to screw up a free lunch  when you can t do something as simple as keeping your number one source of income in the game  you know the end is near  featured image from screen capture
