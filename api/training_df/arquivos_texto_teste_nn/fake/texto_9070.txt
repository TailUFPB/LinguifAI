the left has locked onto a stat that  school shootings have happened this year  this is fake news that needs to be shut down  bernie sanders and others referred to this statistic right after the parkland mass shooting anti gun groups included in the statistics a suicide at a school in michigan that had been closed  this fake statistic trivializes the horrific crime that happened at parkland or any other true school shooting  everytown for gun safety  tries to hijack the narrative everytown for gun safety  the michael bloomberg backed anti gun group founded after the  school shooting in newtown  connecticut  was the original source for that particular statistic  the group s initial tweet claiming that the attack at marjory stoneman douglas high school was the  school shooting in  has now been retweeted more than   times our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland  florida today this is the  school shooting in the u s  in   https   t co   everytown   everytown  february    group defines a school shooting is  any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds  accidental gun discharges and suicides aren t  school shootings it turns out that  everytown s database turns up ridiculous examples that are not school shootings on january    gunshots  which most likely originated off campus  hit a window of the visual arts building at california state university  san bernardino  classes were immediately canceled as the university went into lockdown  though a police search failed to turn up any shooter on campus   on february   in a suburb of minneapolis   a school liaison officer was sitting on a bench talking with some students when a third grader pressed the trigger on the officer s holstered weapon  causing it to fire and strike the floor   those were no doubt terrifying incidents for the people involved  and they may even have policy implications  but they are not what anyone thinks of when they hear the phrase  school shootings  but the media and several prominent politicians  such as sen  bernie sanders  i vt    eagerly regurgitated the context free statistic in the aftermath of the shooting in florida  apparently without stopping to wonder why they hadn t heard about the other  school shootings that supposedly had happened since january  this isn t just an embarrassing case of confirmation bias  spreading such misleading statistics affects how americans from ordinary working people to elected officials understand and cope with these terrible incidents
