you probably can recall the huge diplomatic mess that republicans made last year  by sending an  open letter  to iran in an effort to sour president obama s negotiations on the iranian nuclear program  the letter was a clear shot at the deal the white house had been working on since the very early days of president obama s time in office  republicans attempted to frame any agreements iran would make with obama as  not guaranteed  to continue once he leaves office  this  in addition to the invitation of benjamin netanyahu to address congress without the approval of the white house  put negotiations at a real risk  many thought that it would push circumstances to where israel would unilaterally conduct military strikes against iran  which is a situation nobody wanted to see happen the reaction was fast and harsh by many in america  who saw it as an unprecedented move that bordered on outright treason by republicans  it got so bad that even some republicans who signed off on the letter were having second thoughts as to how bright of an idea it was benjamin netanyahu openly admitted to lobbying congress for help to scuttle the deal  however  he never discussed direct contact that the israeli government had with congressional members or the offers that were made to them  now  with these new revelations  it shows damning evidence that this is exactly what israel and republicans did scathing new reports  which were made possible from leaked nsa wiretapping  show how israel communicated directly with members of congress  it proves that netanyahu and his cohorts were attempting to essentially bribe republicans into sabotaging the diplomatic efforts of a sitting united states president  a u s  intelligence official who was involved in managing the nsa intercepts said israel s communications with republicans included such questions as   how can we get your vote  what s it going to take   what further denial of treason can be made by either republicans or israel at this point judging from the republican course of action on this matter  we can see that israel met with success  while no  smoking gun  has been uncovered yet in these releases  you don t have to be any kind of political genius to understand that america s broken campaign finance system would allow for israel to pay handsomely for republican services  all israel and netanyahu had to do was send money through middlemen  or call in some favors stateside requesting donations be sent to certain interests even though israel continues to deny that they were spied upon  the implications are obvious  a foreign government directly accessed elected members of the u s  congress and offered them bribes to sabotage diplomatic processes in place with another nation  there is no more clear a case for treason that can be made thankfully  israel and the republican party did not succeed this time  the deal is in place  and iran just released tons of its stockpile of enriched uranium to russia  ensuring that it would not be crafted into a bomb  iran will not be enriching any new uranium for the next  years  it will be reducing its centrifuge capacity for future enrichment by two thirds  and it will diminish its current stockpile of enriched uranium by an estimated ninety seven percent there is a poetic justice to be had by president obama on this issue  when he received the nobel peace prize early in his first term  practically every republican erupted in jealousy saying he didn t deserve it  admittedly  anyone can see the prize was given to obama as well as america for moving off the path of the bush warmongering years  now that president obama has achieved nothing short of a historic victory in dealing with iran  nobody can try to suggest he has not earned his prize featured image via flickr
