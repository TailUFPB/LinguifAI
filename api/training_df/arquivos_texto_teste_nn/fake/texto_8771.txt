politicians have been known to do a lot of things to get elected  they usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor  in the case of republican presidential candidate senator ted cruz  those he s decided to cater to are the residents of idiot america cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra religious  absent from reality  guns and god group of folks who love to hunt  hate gay people and live far away from populated areas  people otherwise known as extreme  right wing republicans perfectly pandering to this demographic  cruz paired himself up with duck dynasty and their bigot in chief phil robertson  robertson is about as anti gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be  so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president   ted cruz in a new campaign commercial for cruz  robertson  with his face painting black camo for hunting  tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president  is he or she godly  does he or she love us  can he or she do the job  and finally  would they kill a duck and put  em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo  i ve looked at the candidates  ted cruz is my man   let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that robertson said  he or she   got to at least give credit where credit is due now  as far as cruz being the man for the job of president of the united states  yeah  not so much  he s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way  this includes  but is not limited to  likely not even being as religious as he says he is  or as  constitutional  as he claims to be cruz tends to do things for show  and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface  pardon me  hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that  and sits down to hold his gun and  hunt  with robertson cruz is all like   look at me  i m just like you  i like to hunt and play make believe rambo  too  ignore the fact that i m insanely wealthy and married to goldman sachs  vote for me   he knows exactly what he is doing  he s a smart guy  gotta give him that much  which also makes him irrefutably dangerous  he knows how to play the game  get what he wants  and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way however  this ad right here  as funny as it may be  because it s pretty goddamn funny  also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population  in this case  idiot america  video featured image  youtube
