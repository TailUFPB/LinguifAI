earlier this week  as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the flint water disaster  michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the national guard to help deal with the escalating crisis on january   those troops arrived in the city of   people  all seven of them  yes  seven  as in one less than eight doing the math  snyder s response equates to one guardsman per    people the city of flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions  thanks entirely to the snyder administration  water poisoned with lead  and water that is potentially contaminated with the legionella bacteria  which has already caused  serious illnesses and ten deaths  is just one aspect of what is happening in flint after the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the flint river  they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures according to researchers from virginia tech university  flint is the only city in the u s  that did not have these measures in place as marc edwards of the virginia tech water study described to michigan radio back in october  what we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive  meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water  without controlling the corrosion  and this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like flint  he went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source  before you switch to a new water source  six months to a year ahead of time  you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water  and the chemistry   the ph  the alkalinity  and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water  edwards explains that flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place  otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population  the decision by rick snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that   an uncontrolled experiment on a city s population  the amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized this photo from flint water study researchers ni zhu and siddhartha roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation image credit  flint water studyaccording to a new report released today  researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria  such as the legionella bacteria which causes legionaire s disease  along with a host of other potential pathogens because of the nature of the legionella bacteria  which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air  virginia tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water  that includes people who smoke  the elderly  people with diabetes  people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease about   flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster in response  governor snyder put on a big show of  sending in the national guard   now we know that only seven guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city after being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city  the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as  or  national guardsmen sent to flint by the end of the week during his pr conference on tuesday  snyder told the people of michigan  as we work to ensure that all flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water  we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further  the michigan national guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of flint  he neglected to mention that he was sending seven guardsmen as reported by fox   the governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in flint  gov  rick snyder called in the national guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of flint  just seven members of the national guard showed up to help the nearly   people in flint  watch this video on governor snyder s pathetic response to the flint water disaster  via fox    what an absolute joke image credit  video screen capture via fox
