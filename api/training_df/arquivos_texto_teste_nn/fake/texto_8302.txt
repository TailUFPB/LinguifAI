barbara bush recently accompanied her youngest son to a campaign rally in new hampshire  and judging from his performance she probably wishes she d stayed home  republican presidential candidate jeb bush tried to make a joke about his childhood and instead turned it into an incredibly awkward moment for his entire family  even worse  he made his mother look like a child abuser talking to his supporters  jeb commented on how many people tell him how much they love his mother  jeb s mother smiles in the audience  but quickly starts to look uncomfortable as she hears her son say   she s not as great as everybody thinks she is  i can tell you that one   he continued  i jokingly say  that when we were growing up in midland and houston that mom was fortunate not to have a child abuse hotline available  because the discipline of learning right and wrong was her doing  jeb then goes on about how amazing of a man his father  former president george h  w  bush  was   and almost chokes up while doing so  you can watch this disaster of a family moment play out below  bush has told awkward stories about his family before   even about the father he speak so favorably about  last year  bush disturbed a bunch of middle schoolers by venting to them about how his fear of disappointing his father would send him into a  deep depression for days  and to this day  it seems that bush is still reliving his childhood struggles  last night  bush and his mother gave an interview with cnn  which resulted in even more crippling family criticism  during the interview  bush s mother actually started giving jeb advice on how he should be running for president  and shamelessly pointed out his weaknesses  accusing the media of not mentioning jeb nearly as much as the other gop candidates because he is a  non person   she said that jeb was too nice   too polite  and needed to interrupt more  as this was happening  jeb looked completely defeated and helplessly sat in silence featured image via gage skidmore and cbs screenshot
