republicans love to say that they are the party of god  more than a few gop presidential candidates in the last year have said that god values their bigoted  conservative  family values  and assorted despicable  principles  and points of view  but the death of antonin scalia really calls all of that into question  scalia was about as much of a far right nut as anyone could ask for  and now that he is dead  the right is terrified that president obama will nominate someone with a bit of sense  compassion  and knowledge of the constitution to the court to replace him however  the fact that scalia died when he did completely undermines the idea that some kind of higher power favors far right nonsense  and movie executive extraordinaire jim vejoda brillianatly pointed that out on twitter  vejoda pointed out that the stars could not have aligned more perfectly for liberals with the timing of scalia s death he s right  of course  if conservatives are claiming that some divine power is on their side after this one  they really are delusional  get it through your heads  right wingers  nobody  including the universe  likes ugly  and you folks are as ugly as they come  most folks are saying good riddance to antonin scalia   apparently  including your so called god featured image from twitter
