buffalo bills coach rex ryan has one job  to introduce donald trump at his rally in buffalo  new york  but ryan s rambling  creepy intro left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry i fairness  ryan did attempt to set dial expectations down to zero with the opening sentence of his speech  in which he warns  obviously  we all know i m not a politician  i m not a public speaker  i m just a football coach  the crowd yells  screams and applauds in typical trump style frenzy    he s just like us  yeah  but then ryan moves into the words longest  most meandering personal anecdote   all to deliver a joke which raised little more than a trickle of laughter from the crowd  he went all the way back to the    describing different players and a particular play  ryan takes literally minutes to explain that his then team  the generals  supplied the ball to a fullback instead of star running back  herschel walker  at the goal line trump owned the generals at the time and called ryan with a warning  the conversation went like this   ryan said  working up to his pay off  the next time you give the ball to maurice carthon instead of herschel walker  you re fired   that is a true story  because no one s tired of the apprentice jokes yet  right the grand conclusion to ryan s speech was meant to be his reasons for endorsing donald trump  so hold onto your hats  here it is  he ll say what s on his mind   he said   you ll see people that want to say the same thing  but the big difference is they don t have the courage to say it  donald trump certainly has the courage to say it  that feels more like the entry level requirement to apply for any job in the world   the ability to speak  how will he attempt to sell trump next  with the fact that he s potty trained whelk the trump rally was boring   folks to tears in buffalo  bernie sanders was holding a   strong  energizing rally in prospect park over in brooklyn  it was hollywood actor danny devito which delivered the introduction for sanders  and it was somewhat different   i doesn t take a genius to see where the momentum is heading as the race for president heats up featured image via screengrab
