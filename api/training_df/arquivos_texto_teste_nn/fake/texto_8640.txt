ammon bundy and his band of armed domestic terrorists attended a meeting of harney county residents on tuesday night  and discovered they are universally loathed during the meeting held in the gymnasium at burns high school  residents took turns telling bundy and his pals to get the hell out of their home as they looked on in silence the militants had made an unexpected appearance  which is why residents made the most of the opportunity to slam them to their faces since the beginning of the month  bundy and friends have occupied the malheur national wildlife refuge after seizing a federal building on park grounds and turning it into their own personal compound from which they have threatened law enforcement  used federal vehicles as their own  and torn apart federal property bundy claims his group is doing all of this to force the government to reverse the five year prison sentence of dwight and steven hammond  who were convicted of setting fire to federal lands  five years is the minimum mandatory sentence for committing arson  something a resident angrily pointed out while also noting that minimum mandatory sentencing affects everyone and were put in place by republicans  it has been around for  years and it was the republicans who put them in place   resident isabelle fleuraud said   for  years mostly inner city  poor  minority men have been unjustly jailed for endless sentences  the hammonds committed the crime  and they got the sentence that was appropriate for that crime  and it is very sad  but it is sad for everybody in america who has an unfair sentence  not just the hammonds  she went on to blast bundy for invading the community and told him he belongs in a jail cell on woman told bundy to give them back their home so people will stop stressing out over the occupation indeed  the local area has been basically on lockdown since the standoff began  schools have been closed and area businesses have taken a hit ed brown told bundy that he agrees that the government is too big but even he wants the gunmen to leave   but the same hand  get the hell out of my yard  look what you did to this county   he said and when oregon judge grasty stood toe to tow with bundy and told him to get the hell out of his county to his face  the residents cheered and chanted  go  go  go  go  it is time for you to go home   grasty declared   i don t care if it s utah  go home will you  we got families  we need to move on  here s the video via youtube bundy and his armed band are unwelcome by the local community they claim to be fighting on behalf of  that alone should be enough to convince them to leave with their tails tucked between their legs  but so far  they have refused to budge  and frankly  their treason is tiresome and would have been put to a swift end if they weren t white rednecks  that being said  it s time for the justice department to arrest all of the members of this group and throw the book at them  something one oregon lawmaker has already ripped them for failing to do during a speech on the house floor featured image  twitter
