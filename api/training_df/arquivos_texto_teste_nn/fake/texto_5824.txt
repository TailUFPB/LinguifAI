this is one of the most epic smack downs of a gun nut you ll ever see during real time on friday night  host bill maher was joined on his panel by guests lawrence wilkerson and emily miller to discuss the orlando mass shooting and the role guns played  this tragedy was brought to you by guns and religion   maher said to kick off the discussion maher and conservative reporter emily miller agreed that only followers of islam commit acts of terrorism  forgetting mass shootings that were perpetrated by white christian males such as dylann roof  who killed nine black people at a church in charleston  or timothy mcveigh  who committed the oklahoma city bombing in   he grew up a roman catholic and took the last rites prior to his execution  and there are so many other examples that they could literally fill this article and more  and here s a list of violence against the lgbt community  some of which were committed by anti gay christians with guns but it was republican retired army colonel lawrence wilkerson who stole the show when he buried miller and her gun nut views  much to maher s amusement  we need some kind of control on the weapons in this country   wilkerson said   we do not need large capacity magazines  semi automatic weapons in the hands of anybody in this country  other than possibly law enforcement  wilkerson admitted that he owns  guns at home because he inherited many them from relatives who passed away  but he only uses them for hunting and is very selective about who he sells a gun to if he wants to let one go miller immediately volunteered to buy some guns from wilkerson and he quickly rejected her   i wouldn t sell them to you   he said wilkerson went on to hold republicans responsible for the shooting to some degree because they have refused to pass a law banning people on the terrorism watch list from buying and owning guns miller then attempted to defend guns as a necessary tool for home defense but wilkerson  who served in the vietnam war  didn t buy that malarkey either  saying that he doesn t own guns to shoot people and pointing out that we have law enforcement to deal with home invasions  when miller attempted to discuss law enforcement response time  wilkerson shut her down  i m  years old  i ve lived in this country for seventy one years  except for the years i was deployed fighting for this country when i did need my guns  and nobody has ever entered my house and tried to kill me  after that  miller was stunned into silence here s the video via youtube featured image via screen capture
