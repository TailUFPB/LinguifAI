donald trump recently went after the gun nut vote in a hard way when he declared during the national rifle association s annual meeting on friday that he  as president  would get rid of  gun free zones   of course  trump didn t mention during his pandering that many of the properties that he owns could be described as gun free zones  he also just backtracked on the issue to a large degree  days after the meeting an official with the trump organization told abc news that there are  no restrictions on licensed individuals carrying in our hotels or golf clubs  that statement turns out to be completely false  here is a rundown of properties that abc news discovered that do  in fact  have restrictions on carrying guns  mar a lago  trump s posh florida club  doesn t allow guns  a hotel staff member told abc news trump national doral  in miami  florida  doesn t allow guns either  a security official told abc news  the resort would  much rather not  have guns on the property  said a security official with the hotel  who noted that guns are  not to be carried on our property  we ve had guests that have brought them before   he said  but those guns  had to remain in their safe the whole time in the room  a security worker at trump national in jupiter  florida  said  no  when asked if guns were allowed on premises by citizens who are licensed to carry them  asked about exceptions for people like off duty cops  the staff member directed abc news to a supervisor  who said the hotel had no comment at all on guns at the property trump international golf club in palm beach county  florida  also doesn t allow citizens with concealed carry licenses to bring their guns on the property  a golf shop worker told abc news  now  of course  these policies make sense  who would want to go to a resort or golf club to relax only to be surrounded by insecure people carrying around firearms  the same could be said for any establishment  why should the staff or patrons at a restaurant or retail store have to deal with the person who just walked in carrying an assault weapon so  once again we find a clear disconnect between what trump says and reality  maybe trump just wants to ban all gun free zones except those that are enacted on premises that primarily serve the wealthy  as he has recently stated in another attempt to pander to the  the second amendment is the only amendment that matters  crowd  trump stated that he thinks that teachers should be able to carry firearms on school premises except that  since he trump  he can t even seem to make up his mind on that matter  on sunday  trump was questioned about his stance on letting teachers carry firearms during an interview on fox   friends  that s where he stated that  i don t want to have guns in classrooms  although  in some cases  teachers should have guns in classrooms  that means absolutely nothing and is a far cry from what he was preaching just a few days ago and his pledge he made in january when he said  i will get rid of gun free zones on schools   you have to   and on military bases  my first day  it gets signed  ok  my first day  there s no more gun free zones  trump appears to be willing to spout any nra talking point in an attempt to pander to anyone willing to be pandered to   in some cases  does not in any way mean a blanket throwaway policy like he has been describing for most of his campaign  instead  he now offers this ambivalent stance on a topic that impacts millions of lives featured image from  photo by scott olson getty images
