donald trump s primary goal in life seems to be to sh t on everything  this is something the brain dead gaggle of right wing propaganda pushers at fox news have learned the hard way since the year began  for years  the network as struggled with sagging ratings as republicans who are  when compared to the uneducated masses who make up the network s core audience  have abandoned fox   in spirit  if not physically unfortunately  the same people who have traditionally eagerly slurped up megyn kelly s claims that pepper spray is a food product  jesus and santa are real  and white   and the rest of the nonsensical babble that regularly fills the schedule of what can loosely be called a news organization  have developed a rather negative opinion of the network   unfortunately  fox has managed to condition its viewers to believe quite literally anything so well that they have hopped aboard the trump train to stupidville   and that train has left the station without fox yougov reports that  while fox has been struggling to keep viewers for years  the network lost half of its audience in a single month  no  they didn t stop watching   after all  is there a news network that displays unabashed  willful stupidity with the degree of expertise fox does    but they hate it  besides  fox still has the  muted television in a doctor s office  and  sleeping grandmother  demographics locked  since the first gop presidential debate last august  fox news channel seems to have lost its perception mojo with its core right leaning audience   yougov s ted marzilli notes  adding that things only got worse in january august  of course  was when trump s war with fox news  megyn kelly began   a battle that amped up through the year and was rekindled just before the final gop debate leading up to the iowa caucuses  and  of course  this was when yougov noticed the sharpest drop in fox news viewership  between january  and february   fox s  buzz score    the way yougov rates network popularity   among republicans dropped from  to  via yougovto put it in perspective  fox s buzz score among republicans was  on january    in terms of the general   crowd  fox isn t doing much better  the picture hasn t been rosy in terms of the general population either  since last may  fox news channel s perception levels with adults   have uncharacteristically been drawing significantly more negative feedback than positive  at this point  both fnc and cnn are scoring at similar perception levels and they are both negative to measure perception of the two networks  yougov brandindex used its buzz score  which asks respondents   if you ve heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks  through advertising  news or word of mouth  was it positive or negative   a score can range from  to   with a zero score equaling a neutral position  via yougovnaturally  as fox has been attacking the absolute worst person the right has to offer fairly regularly  the stupid part of america has tuned out  declaring fnc to be too  liberal  for their tastes is fox still the highest rated news network  absolutely   but not for long  if it keeps infuriating its base by attacking the kkk s choice for president  this  of course  places the dummies at fox in quite a predicament  going forward  do they support republicans who don t openly call for putting groups of americans in concentration camps  or do they begin trumpeting support for trump featured image via screengrab
