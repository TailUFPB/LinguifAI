the democratic infighting between bernie sanders and his supporters and hillary clinton and her supporters is about as useful as a fart in a jar  we re all on the same side  fighting for the same changes  fighting to make sure everyone gets a fair shake  fighting for the american people and against republicans who want to tear us further apart so  when false narratives are spoken that hillary clinton is somehow  copying  bernie sanders on some of his policy platform ideas  it serves absolutely no purpose other than to divide what needs to be a united front  tell everyone what you re for  instead of trying to be ridiculously petty and disparaging in an effort to bring someone else down one of the latest lies about hillary clinton is the remark that she somehow is copying bernie sanders on raising the minimum wage  however  if anyone has access to the internet  they can easily find a record of her accomplishments  as well as what she s proposed and advocated for   including a minimum wage increase watch the video below and you will see hillary pushing for a raise in the minimum wage back in    that s over  years ago  she s clearly been pushing for a better standard of living for workers nationwide long before she even remotely dreamed of running for president this election needs to be about what each candidate brings to the table  their experience  their plans  their ability to get it done  what this election should not be about  is trying to dissuade people from voting based on lies and if we re going to really try to get real about wages  we need to think about solutions that will actually work  a flat minimum wage increase  while sounding great on paper  simple to understand  and is a great place to start  won t be as effective as tying wages to the cost of living nationwide  mit even put out a living wage calculator to help the process along  this may mean higher than a   hr wage in some regions  and lower in others  the cost of doing business is different in different regions as well  and that also always needs to be taken into consideration  if businesses are shuttered because they can t afford to stay open  that doesn t help anyone  but it is true that more money in people s pockets puts more money back into the economy  and is the trickle up economy that will serve to help everyone  that s just basic economics solutions are there if we re willing to look for them  and we need to figure this out  but that s not going to happen through the noise of trivial political games         if  d getelementbyid id   return  js   d createelement s   js id   id  js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml    version     fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk           gt hillary in   raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do  hillary in   still true posted by hillary clinton on tuesday  april    image via video screen capture
