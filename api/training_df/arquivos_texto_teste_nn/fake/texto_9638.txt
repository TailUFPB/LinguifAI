the new report on the number of missing afghan trainees draws attention to the current policy that obviously needs to be changed  the terror risk is bad enough and the cost to train these soldier is huge  remember when obama was famously called out for the outrageous cost per trainee  reuters reported in october of  that  washington has allocated more than   billion since  to train and equip afghan troops  this is a waste of taxpayer dollars  immigration agents say they re  worried  about the terror risk with these awol trainees while other foreign troops on u s  military training visits have sometimes run away  a u s  defense official said that the frequency of afghan troops going missing was concerning and  out of the ordinary  more than  afghan troops brought to the u s  for military training have gone awol since   with  of them still unaccounted for and perhaps living as here illegal immigrants now  an inspector general said in a new report friday part of the problem is that the u s  never puts the trainees through an in person interview and exempts them from registering as aliens when they arrive   both steps that other visitors would normally have to go through in person interviews and requiring the troops to register beforehand would help the government gauge whether someone is likely to go absent without leave  and would give immigration officers information about relatives in the u s  as starting points when someone does go awol  the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction said but the state department rejected those suggestions the audit said that while no acts of terrorism have yet been traced to the trainees  immigration agents say they re worried because a number who go awol end up trying to claim asylum in the u s   stymieing any national security investigation into their behavior beyond the potential danger  american taxpayers also miss out on the investment in the troops  the inspector general said  it is clear that afghan trainees go awol while in the united states at a far higher rate than do trainees from any other country  and we believe that the state department  as well as other government agencies  should use all the tools at their disposal to reduce these occurrences and ensure that afghan trainees return to afghanistan and make use of the substantial u s  taxpayer investment in training   the audit concluded the number of troops going awol surged in  and  as security back home deteriorated some afghan troops currently being trained in the u s  said the taliban threatened their families back home once it became known they had a relative training here  many of them said the training made them bigger targets when they returned investigators identified  afghan trainees who have gone absent without leave under the training program  seventy of them fled the u s    managed to obtain legal status here  three returned to duty   were arrested and put in deportation proceedings  and  remain unaccounted for the largest number disappeared from training at lackland air force base in san antonio  but four went awol from training in d c   three disappeared from quantico  virginia  and one from arlington the state department and homeland security said they don t think there s a reason to be concerned read more  wta previous report on two afghan trainees that went missing the two
