donald trump has watched from the stage as his rabid supporters have brutally assaulted the people who come out to protest him  oftentimes  he even urges them on   whipping his followers into a violent frenzy with unfounded accusations that the protesters are working for isis or were sent by bernie sanders and  deserve it  after this week saw nearly every trump rally end in assaults and racial and ethnic slurs  the question turned from  will someone be killed at a trump rally   to  when  trump has done absolutely nothing to tone down the rhetoric  in fact  he s stepped it up  lately  he s begun using his supporters as a personal goon squad  when he accused bernie sanders fans of forcing him to cancel his rally in chicago  he threatened to  send them  out to harass sanders supporters  the supporters themselves seem downright eager to oblige this call to violence  the only thing missing are literal brown shirts this again came to a head  this time in north carolina  where trump rallies in concord and fayetteville  in one disturbing  but not uncommon  incident  a black man was attacked as the crowd roared  a cowboy hat wearing trump superfan beamed as he told reporters that he was proud for sucker punching an african american protester as he was being escorted out  he was eventually charged with assault  but not before vowing to  kill  the man if he ever saw him again trump doubled down on his claim that these protesters were  bad people  and possibly isis terrorists  he then encouraged his followers to be more violent when faced with protesters  again saying they were  bad  and deserved it  his supporters in the media also parroted this call to violence i would like to see a little more violence from the innocent trump supporters set upon by violent leftist hoodlums   ann coulter   anncoulter  march    north carolina authorities are now coming out strongly against trump attempting to turn their state into a breeding ground for fascism  following the violent rally  the cumberland county sheriff s office announced that it would be looking into charging donald trump   the current republican front runner for president of the united states by a wide margin  with inciting a riot just in  north carolina police considering filing charges against trump for potentially inciting a riot https   t co   msnbc   msnbc  march    look at north carolina s law against inciting a riot shows that trump appears to check all the boxes  it s a wonder he hasn t been charged yet here s north carolina riot law  pic twitter com   matt pearce   mattdpearce  march    the protesters who brave a trump rally  the fact that the man on stage is using a microphone to actually call for the thousands of supporters in attendance to verbally or physically attack him or her  the  clear and present  danger is real  and this isn t just a thought exercise  people have been repeatedly hurt trying to escape the events  one man was pushed down and kicked  another was elbowed in the face  even reporters have faced violence  a time photographer was choke slammed by trump s secret service agent  a former breitbart reporter was thrown to the ground by trump s campaign manager  leaving bruises on her arm from where he grabbed her  the list goes on when trump comes to town  you can count on two things happening  the racists crawling out of the woodwork waving trump flags and violence directed at the people who oppose trump  that s not a way to run a democracy  if authorities don t begin to stand up to trump s calls for violence with criminal charges  the chances of a deadly incident happening are nearly total the authorities in north carolina caution that they may not charge trump  however  unfortunately   inciting a riot  is known in legal circles as being notoriously difficult to prove  given how vague its language is  trump will no doubt respond with an army of lawyers to descend on north carolina should he find himself charged  so it is clearly making the sheriff s office gun shy  in a statement  they said they were looking into but won t make an official decision until after they ve run down a few more leads featured image via wral
