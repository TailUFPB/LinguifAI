the shooter in orlando  omar mateen  was enraged when he saw two men kissing  apparently  that was enough reason for him to go on the worst shooting rampage in u s  history at a gay nightclub  which has left dozens dead  and dozens more wounded  while conservatives are busy blaming radical islam  along with middle eastern refugees and president obama   one man has the most rational tweet there is on this quite simply put  mateen may have pledged himself to isis  but isis hates the lgbt community and so did mateen  who else hates the lgbt community if  omarmateen was motivated by radical islam  his hatred of lgbtq people is consistent with us religious right and  religious freedom  laws  captain renault   johnmonch  june     that s right  our own right wing christians hate the lgbt community  of course  they cover their hatred and bigotry with pretty  all american phrases like  religious freedom   and  the first amendment   but they re motivated by the same hate that motivated mateen take a look at north carolina s anti lgbt law  which requires people to use the restrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate  state representative dan bishop  the primary sponsor of that law  compared lgbt equality advocates to the taliban as justification for that law  he also damned the lgbt community itself as a major threat to freedom his constituents support and spread these dangerous ideas  and he gave them their mouthpiece when he authored that law ted cruz  who rose to prominence as the primary architect of gop obstruction in the senate  and solidified his reputation as a hard right christian bigot while running for president  has also spewed hate about the lgbt community  he wants to reverse the supreme court s marriage equality decision  and he flat out lies about the  threat  that transgender women pose to little girls in public restrooms when he voices his support of these idiotic bathroom laws while mateen was very likely not influenced by these people  he was influenced by isis  hatred of the lgbt community  yet the attitude is the same   islam and christianity both consider homosexuality to be a sin  both have their radical sects that twist these things into something vile and sadistic that they then use to justify hate crimes and terrorism against the lgbt community for right wing christians to condemn anybody for this shooting  when they themselves spout the same baloney that causes that very hate  is hypocritical at best  before pointing the finger at radical islam  they need to take a good  long look in their mirrors  and remove the logs from their own eyes first featured image via myspace and twitter
