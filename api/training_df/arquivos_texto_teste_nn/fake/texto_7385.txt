president obama  accompanied by first lady michelle along with his two daughters  just landed in cuba and he is looking to thaw political differences between the two countries that has spanned decades  obama  who has made reaching out to cuba one of the main objectives of his presidency  earned the ire of the republican party which has preferred divisive politics rather than open dialogue and understanding between the two countries  florida senator and former presidential candidate marco rubio was upset after obama had announced the visit  he said  rather than achieving several long standing u s  goals and national security interests  you have methodically squandered this opportunity  legitimizing the castro regime and enriching it in the process  a presidential visit to cuba absent of any concessions from its government is a dangerous idea  and i urge you to reconsider  with that lack of innovative thinking  one can see why rubio was trounced in his home state of florida by donald trump  then there s ted cruz  whose father is a cuban american  the creepy cruz also disagreed to the visit  he said  he has alienated and abandoned our friends and allies  you know  one of the first things he did when he became president was send the bust of winston churchill back to the united kingdom  that was shameful  despite republican resistance  the president and dozens of u s  lawmakers and business leaders joined him in cuba for the visit  air force one touched down at havana s airport on sunday after a three hour flight from washington  while deep differences persist  obama s approach in thinking outside of the box on cuba will bring fruitful economic and political ties for both countries in the future instead of embracing the president s ingenuity  the republicans will always be republicans here s the video
