another day  another black teen s life lost at the hands of cops  this incident took place in austin  texas  where a naked black teen was killed by officers who were checking out complaints about   get this   a suspicious black suspect austin s chief brian manley held a press conference and tried to calm the public and the media surrounding the shooting  in which he  of course  deemed it necessary because the  year old disobeyed the officers  conveniently  he also says that the guy charged at the cops  whether this is true or not is unknown at this time  further  the top cop would not tell reporters whether or not the teen was armed in any way  this likely means that he was not  because if he had been  they d be rushing to tell every reporter in the country that the scary  naked black guy would have shot them if they hadn t shot him first the police department has also refused to say who the officers who fired the fatal shots are  only that they are on leave while the shooting is checked out  in other words  they ll investigate themselves and find that they did nothing wrong the local chapter of the naacp is on the case  and rightfully so  because the likelihood of this being an illegal execution by cop  rather than a justified police shooting  is  as per usual in these cases  quite high  the chapter s president  nelson linder  said of the shooting  we see a rush to judgment and as a result  somebody is dead  normally it s always somebody black  in this city and this country  i don t see how a young man who s naked  and not hurting anybody  winds up being dead  when in reality  those things require constraint and understanding  as opposed to deadly force  the question is  how do you address your policy now  the problem with these shootings is often times apd  they don t appear to enforce their own policies  if that s the case we have a major problem because if you have a policy and don t follow it  then what good is it  he s exactly right  so  now   disobeying  a cop is a capital offense  then again  it always has been if you re black in america  despicable  but true watch a video news report on the incident below featured image from video screen capture via raw story
