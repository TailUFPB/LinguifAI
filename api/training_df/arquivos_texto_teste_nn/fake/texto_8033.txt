it can be said that senator bernie sanders is one of the most sincere politicians in all of politics  he s ambitious with a gusto for progress that is really unmatched  however  this gusto for pushing forward an economic agenda that is unparalleled by everyone running against him has left several leading economists scratching their heads  including paul krugman in krugman s recent post in the new york times he brings up a challenge to the economic thought of both sanders and professor gerald friedman  who makes the claim that the vermont senator s economic plan would make jobs and income soar  friedman states that real economic growth under sanders would grow to    per year  that s as opposed to where we are now  which is at around   krugman writes  ok  progressives have  rightly  mocked jeb bush for claiming that he could double growth to  percent  now people close to sanders say      even those of us who believe that there s still significant slack in the us labor market are aware that much  probably most  of the decline in labor force participation since  reflects an aging population   prime working age lfpr has reclaimed most of the lost ground since the great recession  and there s probably a long term downward trend even there  it s possible that we can get unemployment down under  percent  but that s way below any estimates i ve seen of the level of unemployment consistent with moderate inflation  krugman goes so far as to even say that if this sort of line was being perpetuated by a republican  it would be described as  deep voodoo   he continued  saying  sanders needs to disassociate himself from this kind of fantasy economics right now  and  he concluded by stating that if his campaign disagrees with this assessment  which is backed up by fellow leading economic advisers  we ll be looking at a trump presidency for sure in a letter to sanders and friedman from  former chairs of the council of economic advisers for presidents barack obama and bill clinton  alan krueger  austan goolsbee  christina romer  and laura d andrea tyson  they state that they  have worked to make the democratic party the party of evidence based economic policy   continuing  they wrote  we are concerned to see the sanders campaign citing extreme claims by gerald friedman about the effect of senator sanders s economic plan claims that cannot be supported by the economic evidence  friedman asserts that your plan will have huge beneficial impacts on growth rates  income and employment that exceed even the most grandiose predictions by republicans about the impact of their tax cut proposals as much as we wish it were so  no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes  making such promises runs against our party s best traditions of evidence based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic  these claims undermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda and make it that much more difficult to challenge the unrealistic claims made by republican candidates  with goolsbee even going so far as to separately also say   they ve evolved into magic flying puppies with winning lotto tickets tied to their collars  when he was commenting on another summation of sanders  proposals by another progressive analyst it seems pretty harsh  but it also seems they clearly to want to get their point across featured image from flickr
