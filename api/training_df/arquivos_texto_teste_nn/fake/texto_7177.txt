the people insisting the only thing standing in the way of donald trump s path to the nomination is donald trump himself may have finally been vindicated  in an explosive story first broken by time  republican officials in south carolina floated the idea that trump may have given away his landslide victory in the state by brashly announcing that he would no longer adhere to the  loyalty pledge  if he didn t get the nomination south carolina republican party chairman matt moore gave credence to the anti trump claims  breaking south carolina s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer   he told time   however  a court or national convention committee on contests could resolve them  it could put delegates in jeopardy  what does this mean for trump  the  delegates he won in south carolina could simply walk away   and over to his opponents  that sends his delegate count a lot further away from the crucial   finish line  and maybe give his opponents the push they need to realistically challenge him at a brokered convention  and adding to the problem  other states which include the loyalty pledge in their bylaws could also move to strip trump of his delegates all of this to say  trump s massive ego is costing him the election  having early on floated the idea that he wouldn t support a republican candidate if it wasn t himself  trump eventually caved and signed a document stating  i  donald j  trump  affirm that if i do not win the  republican nomination for president of the united states i will endorse the  republican nominee regardless of who it is  suddenly  with opposition to his nomination mounting  trump has returned to saying he will not adhere to that pledge  telling anderson cooper matter of factly   no  i don t anymore   arguing that he s been treated unfairly by the gop trump has repeatedly ignored conventional wisdom and used his gut to direct his campaign   early on  trump s campaign manager told staffers that the motto of the campaign would be  let trump be trump    and while it often works to his advantage  who would have thought calling john mccain a loser for being a pow would pay off    his increasingly erratic behavior makes him a ticking time bomb  cracks are beginning to emerge  his polls are tanking and there are signs that the  anti trump  members of the republican party are finally coalescing around his chief rival  ted cruz  he may have enough momentum to get the nod  but needlessly handing away delegates isn t doing him any favors in the end there was only one serious contender against trump and that was himself  for all of his arrogance  it is fitting that his own misplaced hubris would be the one thing that got the better of him  having run as an outsider for his entire campaign  trump is learning that bashing the party you plan to run for isn t welcomed with open arms  they let trump be trump and he didn t disappoint featured image via darren hauck getty images
