as people head out to celebrate america s independence  some people have more to celebrate than others  a lot more even as the economy recovers from the financial collapse engineered by the rich  those same people managed to reap almost all the rewards  leaving the rest of us to scramble for the scraps  and while the rich whine about how persecuted they are  a new study shows that income inequality in america is at an all time high with no signs of slowing down how bad is it  very while the past two years have been good for the majority of americans  income growth  they still haven t fully recovered from the recession  for the bottom  percent  incomes fell   percent during the height of the recession from  to   afterward  they grew just   percent between  and    not enough to make up for the downturn  incomes for the  percent have only recovered about  percent of what they lost but the rich are doing great  the incomes of the  percent grew  percent between  and   they captured more than half of all the income growth in the country over that period  leaving just  percent to spread out among the bottom  percent of families the washington post writes about a study of income inequality throughout the entirety of america s existence and the two researchers found that today s inequality is the worst it s ever been and steadily getting worse  even when the country was first founded and most people lived on farms  the rich were not far separated from the poor  in fact  even the  gilded age  which saw obscene amounts of wealth concentrated in the hands of the few was not as obscene as it is now  here s the chart they used  excerpted from unequal gains  american growth and inequality since   courtesy of princeton university press if you ll notice  the sharp upturn of income inequality started in the  when unions started to dwindle and corporations started to increase worker productivity while refusing to share the profits from it  you ll also notice that the sharpest climb came after the  financial crisis this hoarding of wealth is what has lead to the   attempting to completely co opt our system of government by buying politicians outright  the bad news is that this is going to get much worse before it gets better  the good news is that the rich always lose these fights in the end  the british lost when they tried to bleed the colonies dry  the southern slave holders lost when they tried to maintain their control over their  property   the robber barons lost when they tried to turn america into their own personal playground  and the current crop of greedy  soulless  ers will lose this time as well soon to be hillary clinton may not go after the rich with both barrels blazing  but she  like obama before her  will lay the foundation for the   to take our country back  by quietly rebuilding the government institutions and courts the gop crippled  we re going to have the tools we need to wrest control away from the corporations and stop the decline of the middle class and the suffering of the poor so light those fireworks  america  we re almost ready to declare our independence from the   featured image via jeff j mitchell   getty images
