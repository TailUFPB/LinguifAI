stand your ground laws are reasons for legalized murder  literally  and here south carolina has given you proof  this is no murky case a la michael brown or trayvon martin  though  to sane people  those weren t murky  either   but no   one  year old james edward loftis of goose creek  south carolina  is using the state s  stand your ground  law to literally get away with cold blooded  pre meditated murder  it looks like it could work  too reports say that loftis had called a cab to take him home from a strip club  but failed to pay the fare  that s when all hell broke loose  the cab driver   year old guma oz dubar  along with his friend who was present at the time   year old cody newland  insisted that loftis make good on the money they owed him for the cab ride  loftis has provided many different details regarding what transpired next  but his story is the only ones the police have  as newland and dubar are dead  by loftis  hand  the only thing the defendant will confess to is shooting both victims before burning their bodies in graves he dug in his own yard to hide his crimes deputy solicitor bryan alfaro said of loftis s actions  they were essentially just slow cooked inside the grave site  after that  loftis s attorney decided to use the state s so called  stand your ground  law to try to get the defendant off  the law says you can kill people invading your property  however  these people were not invading  they had picked this dude s drunk ass up from a strip club  and he didn t want to pay for the ride home  doesn t sound like much of an  invasion  to me  this defense  however  got the judge to decide that loftis is not a flight risk  and  despite his cold blooded commission of a double murder  loftis is now out on   ooo bail loftis s lawyer  stephen harris  continues his ludicrous defense  saying  he s a human being  he freaked out and thought he was going to prison  so he tried to hide the bodies  nobody knows how you re going to react when you kill two people well  mr  harris  most folks would just pay the cab fare and go in  instead of stiffing the driver and then killing him and his friend  but i suppose that is irrelevant to you and your client  right  two innocent people are dead over this insanity  and you re going to use south carolina s insane gun laws to get your client off when he should clearly rot in prison for the rest of his life i wish there were a hell so you and mr  loftis could burn there  condolences to the families of the victims your client murdered featured image via mugshot screen capture via raw story
