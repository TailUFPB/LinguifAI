a new ad from a conservative super pac absolutely destroys donald trump  and it uses his own words to do the job  the commercial comes from our principles pac  and it showcases ordinary everyday women reading a series of horribly sexist and misogynist quotes from current republican presidential front runner donald trump a few choice quotes from the ad include these are the sorts of quotes that have terrified the republican establishment about what trump would do to the party in the general election  even with candidates without misogynist comments like these on the ballot  republicans have struggled to convince female voters  in    percent of women voted for barack obama  a number that was almost the same at  percent in   even when john kerry lost the election in   he still got  percent of the women s vote you can hear the audio of trump himself making many of these sexist comments in a story compiled by buzzfeed  they went through trump s appearances on radio shows like howard stern trump appeared upwards of two dozen times from the late   through the  with the shock jock  and buzzfeed news has listened to hours of those conversations  which are not publically available  the most popular topic of conversation during these appearances  as is typical of stern s program  was sex  in particular  trump frequently discussed women he had sex with  wanted to have sex with  or wouldn t have sex with if given the opportunity  he also rated women on a  point scale this super pac ad is designed to derail trump s path to the republican nomination  but it may be too late for that  but a similar ad  broadcast from coast to coast by democrats and their affiliated super pacs would likely be extremely devastating featured image via youtube
