if there s one person in this entire nation who does not deserve a seat at the state of the union  it s kentucky county clerk kim davis  her reckless abuse of her position of power to deny same sex couples the right to marry was outright unconstitutional  so unconstitutional  in fact  that it put her in prison to top it off  she s not even attending to listen to the president  but rather just be a bigot counterweight  in the crowd  according to her lawyer  mat staver  she is not so much looking forward to going so much because of what president obama has to say  she doesn t have much interest in that  as much as just to be there  to be a visible counterweight  the most bizarre part of her invitation is that the congressman who invited her didn t even know that s who he was inviting  house freedom caucus chairman jim jordan  r oh  apparently didn t have a clue  he told huffpo  i didn t invite anyone   jordan initially said late tuesday afternoon  as he was jogging to house votes  when pressed on whether he had given his ticket to the family research council  which then gave it to davis   which is what a democratic aide told huffpost had happened   jordan said he would have to confirm with his office   i don t know   he said when jordan was seen later  he confirmed the invitation  yeah  so we gave a ticket to   at the request of the family research council   we gave the ticket to kim davis  family i found out today  i m being totally honest with you  that s   family research council asked us  her family wanted a ticket  and we said  ok   jordan seems clearly okay with the decision  because even though she s a criminal who didn t follow the law  conservatives nationwide see her as some sort of religious martyr doing her due diligence in the name of the lord  constitution be damned should davis be able to attend one of the most prestigious annual events in the nation  of course not  but leave it to republicans and their quest to bring bigotry front and center as part of their party platform featured image  youtube
