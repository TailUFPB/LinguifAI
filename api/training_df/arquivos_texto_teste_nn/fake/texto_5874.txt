according to donald trump and far too many on the right  the biggest problem in this country is political correctness  and if it weren t for the damn refusal of everyone to narc on their neighbors  we d have no problems whatsoever  in san bernardino  people knew what was going on  they knew exactly  but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it   trump said during a speech in the wake of the orlando mass shooting it wasn t people  exactly  it was one neighbor  who noticed only that the family received quite a few packages and that they were doing work out of their garage  of course  that describes every socially awkward amazon junkie neighbor i have  or nearly everyone in the  century  but hey  the woman should have reported that to the police  right  according to trump  that should have been her legal duty a man who claimed to be friends with this neighbor said she did not report the packages and the behavior to authorities because she  didn t want to do any kind of racial profiling  in trump s america  however  that woman would face serious consequences   we need to make sure every single person involved in this plan  including anyone who knew something  but didn t tell us  is brought to justice   trump said in new hampshire   these people need to have consequences  big consequences  source  huffington postthink about that for a moment  this is coming from the same party that thinks we shouldn t have hate crime laws because gunning down over  lgbt people is just a  thought crime   trump  who also wants to ban all muslims and deport anyone with dark skin  wants anyone who hates their neighbors and all their damn ups packages to call the cops  or perhaps go to jail  maybe we can call that the  minority report  law  which would serve two purposes  we can turn in neighbors for crimes we imagine might happen  and bonus points if the neighbor we report belongs to a minority there is actually a law on the book that would deal with neighbors who are aware of a crime happening or about to happen  it s called aiding and abetting  it would take a big stretch of the right wing of the law  though  to call knowledge of package delivery and tinkering in one s garage  as helping commit a crime  trump  though  appears to have no issues with throwing down the gauntlet of the law over virtually every offense  if you ve ever needed proof he s running for dictator in chief  this should be it truthfully  trump s entire reaction to the horrific shooting in orlando  in which  people were slaughtered and  people injured  shows how unqualified trump is for president  first  he congratulated himself  then  he reaffirmed his ban on muslims  then  he blamed the president  now  he s blaming neighbors  he ll blame everyone but the hatred that he s directly fueling featured image via gerardo mora at getty images
