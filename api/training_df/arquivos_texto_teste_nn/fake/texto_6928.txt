likely the last thing you d ever want to envision is republican presidential candidate ted cruz with adult toys  or doing things to himself  but hey  this is america  and hypocrites need to be called out as mother jones just reminded us  ted cruz defended a ban on adult toys  in fact   he helped defend a law criminalizing the sale said toys  you see  texas  the state where the senator is from  besides canada   has a law that outlaws these  obscene  devices  ted cruz found it un american to self stimulate yourself with such a thing  and according to the week  cruz s office defended the obscenity law by saying that  any alleged right associated with obscene devices  is not  deeply rooted in the nation s history and traditions  i m sure this is what the founders of our nation were thinking about when declaring war on england  and writing up the constitution  jefferson was probably all like   oh  yes  we mustn t forget the devices used for self pleasure  they must be strictly prohibited   probably not anyway  all of that aside  enter craig mazin  ted cruz s freshman roommate at princeton  he just took to twitter with likely the best burn ever to be written calling out the texas junior senator s hypocrisy  he wrote ted cruz thinks people don t have a right to  stimulate their genitals   i was his college roommate  this would be a new belief of his   craig mazin   clmazin  april    that you ve picked yourself up off the floor after laughing incredibly hard  you ll now have that image in your head for the rest of your day  but knowing ted cruz was just utterly humiliated in such a pretty amazing way may make it all worth it featured photo by scott olson getty images   twitter
