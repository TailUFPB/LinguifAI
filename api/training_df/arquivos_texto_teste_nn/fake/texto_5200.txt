another day  another billionaire and or republican refuses to endorse the train wreck that is donald j  trump  while a slew of influential republicans   elected or not   have rescinded or flat out refused to endorse the gop presidential nominee  others have stubbornly remained by his side even after being stabbed in the back but as trump continues to say any outrageous  offensive and grotesque thing that comes to mind  one influential mega donor in the party is saying  enough  and is endorsing trump s rival  democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton instead  and her endorsement of clinton isn t a  i guess i m with her  mentality  either   it s a full blown  ready for hillary  sentiment meg whitman  a self made billionaire who didn t have any help from her daddy  posted a stinging denouncement of trump on her facebook  earlier this year  during the primary  whitman expressed concern that trump s rhetoric would hurt the party and turn off the electorate   it turns out she was right  as hillary clinton has taken the lead  for now  by margins of  points to  points nationally whitman referred to trump as  uninformed    unsteady    authoritarian   and a  demogauge   she also praised clinton for being an experienced  level headed leader as a proud republican  casting my vote for president has usually been a simple matter  this year is different  to vote republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that i believe has exploited anger  grievance  xenophobia and racial division  donald trump s demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character trump s reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues   from immigration to our economy to foreign policy   have made it abun dantly clear that he lacks both the policy depth and sound judgment required as president  trump s unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security  his authoritarian character could threaten much more therefore  i have decided to support hillary rodham clinton  it is clear to me that secretary clinton s temperament  global experience and commitment to america s bedrock national values make her the far better choice in  for president of the united states  in a tumultuous world  america needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership secretary clinton can provide  i urge all republicans to reject donald trump this november whitman  who is seen as a more moderate republican given her positions of abortion  gay marriage and immigration  did the unthinkable  she put country over party  and for that republicans are already denouncing her like they did romney  kasich  christie todd whitman  and so forth this also shouldn t come as a huge surprise  whitman has donated to and aligned herself with california senator barbara boxer  considered one of the most liberal members of the senate good for meg whitman in denouncing trump and doing what is right  hopefully more republicans will take action featured image via andrew burton getty images
