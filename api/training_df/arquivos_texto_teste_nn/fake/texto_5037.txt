trump s war on the media isn t earning him any allies  and now it s cost him one of the biggest  most well known conservative outlets we ve got  the wall street journal  their editorial board published their opinion  paywall  of trump late sunday afternoon  and they didn t hold back at all  the cutting editorial tells trump to shape up  or ship out wsj blasts trump for his reliance on his rally turnouts and social media followings for indications of how he s doing  they blast his refusal to actually work in the battleground states  they blast the disorganization and sheer incompetence of his campaign and his unpopularity  mr  trump has alienated his party and he isn t running a competent campaign  mrs  clinton is the second most unpopular presidential nominee in history after mr  trump  but rather than reassure voters and try to repair his image  the new yorker has spent the last three weeks giving his critics more ammunition  keep in mind that wsj isn t anything like close to liberal  they re fun to cite when their stories contradict typical right wing talking points because they lean so far to the right  now  though  it looks like they feel  the donald has betrayed them  even with more than  days left  mr  trump s window for a turnaround is closing  the  trump pivot  always seemed implausible given his lifelong instincts and habits  but mr  trump promised republicans   at some point i ll be so presidential that you people will be so bored  and i ll come back as a presidential person  and instead of   people i ll have about  people and they ll say  boy  he really looks presidential   he said in april  and then they ended with an ultimatum  if  can t get mr  trump to change his act by labor day  the gop will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the senate and house and other down ballot races  as for mr  trump  he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president or turn the nomination over to mike pence  wsj obviously doesn t want to see hillary elected because the democrats hardly represent conservative views  however  as far as they re concerned  any republican would be better than trump at this point  no candidate has been in this position  at this point in an election cycle  in the modern polling era  and gone on to win the november election  his  window for a turnaround  may actually be gone from trump s point of view  this editorial is likely going down as more of the  very biased  press lying about him  he spent seven tweets blasting the press  and claimed he d be way ahead of hillary if the media would stop protecting her and cover him honestly and fairly the only honest and fair media in trumpland is the media that says he s the god of being right about everything  his followers have all been transported to trumpland  and they re eating up his complaints about the media like candy  trump does not see any reason to change when his followers worship him  and when he thinks they re a sufficient measure of his progress he should keep this in mind  you know you re in bad shape when you re a republican and the wall street journal is this unhappy with you featured image by jeff swensen getty images
