donald trump kicked off another round of republican mind explosions at a campaign stop in south carolina when he teased the idea that as president he would  illegally  leak a series of damning classified documents about what  really  happened on september    the republican party  whose official line is still that george w  bush was a great president and the iraq caused    have begun freaking out over trump because unlike the other candidates  who are comfortable with that lie  trump has increasingly criticized the bush administration for their disastrous foreign policy  things reached a head at trump s latest rally trump says if he is elected   you will find out who really knocked down the world trade center  it wasn t the iraqis   he explained   you may find it s the saudis  they have papers in there that are very secret   he also said  referencing the  still classified pages of the   commission report   but you will find out  it s been a common belief among both reporters and the public that the classified pages in the   commission report really do implicate saudi arabia as having some involvement in the attacks  following the attacks  bush s administration was put in the awkward position of either confronting their middle eastern ally  and oil provider  or scapegoating a different middle eastern country which they hated  they invaded iraq when trump says he ll prove the saudis were involved in   he isn t turning over any stones that haven t already been turned over  but he is reminding america that george w  bush ran his administration based on a neverending torrent of deceit  false pretenses and fabrications  as such  the only people who still believe that iraq was responsible for   are republicans themselves it reinforces the fact that the republican party has now become completely detached from reality  in a surreal moment at the last republican debate  trump   a candidate who has previously mocked a disabled reporter  suggested muslims be barred from entering the united states  claimed mexico was sending rapists across the border  advocated for bringing back torture  and any number of other outrageous things   was booed  because he pointed out that the iraq war was a terrible idea  obviously the war in iraq was a big  fat mistake  all right   said trump   george bush made a mistake  we can make mistakes  but that one was a beauty  the crowd didn t like that one but trump continued   they lied  they said there were weapons of mass destruction   there were none  and they knew there were none  there were no weapons of mass destruction  and the boos got much louder republicans cheer trump when he lies to their faces about mexicans and boo him when he points out the obvious  welcome to the modern republican party feature image from gage skidmore flickr
