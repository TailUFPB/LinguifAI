one of the cornerstones of donald trump s campaign for president has been that he s going to keep jobs here at home  he s made it one of the key talking points at his many  many rallies  however  it doesn t seem like he really gives a rat s ass about preventing outsourcing when it comes to his own wallet back in march  trump said  our companies are leaving our country rapidly  rapidly frankly i m disgusted with it  although  that really doesn t seem to be the case considering he s making a profit off investing in the companies he s very  disgusted with  according to bloomberg  trump has denounced units of united technologies corp   ford motor co  and mondelez international inc  on the campaign trail   and has received income of as much as    from bonds issued by all three since january   according to his latest financial disclosure form released tuesday  he also has invested in apple inc  s stock and bonds even though in february he called for a boycott of the company for refusing to help the federal bureau of investigation unlock an iphone used by a terrorist in san bernardino  california  in fact  only last month did trump call out ford motor co  by name when he said  carrier has to know that if they do that   and i m not only speaking to them  i m speaking to nabisco and ford and hundreds and hundreds of other companies   they have to know that there are consequences when you want to leave and fire all these people you re not just going to go to another country  make your product  sell it across our really weak borders  yeah  trump hates it so much  just like a dog hates a peanut butter covered bone  mmmhmmm the man is a walking and talking lie machine  his face could literally be next to the word  hypocrite  in the dictionary  not that any of his supporters have ever opened a dictionary  or for that matter  a book trump is not only bad for the united states  but for the entire world  if he were to actually win the presidency  the rest of the world would look at us as thought we re crazy  we re only now getting over the embarrassment of george w  bush  and trump is a million times worse  at least bush had policy experience  trump doesn t even have that enough is enough  america  trump is bad news and only has his own self interests at heart  and all the proof you need is in the fact that he s profiting off american loss  he also made a point of saying back in  that he hoped the real estate market tanked so he could buy up all the properties to make a profit he only wants to be president for himself  and not to  make america great again   because guess what  america is already great  and that slogan is just coded language that means  go back to the time before a black man was president   and don t say it s not  because many of his biggest supporters are white supremacists if you care at all about the well being of the many and not just the few   vote blue featured photo by joe raedle getty images
