if there was any doubt about whether or not hillary clinton had the black vote locked up  said doubts are sure to be squashed now  the congressional black caucus will formally endorse the former secretary of state for president on thursday morning  according to the washington post  endorsing isn t all they are doing  either following the planned meeting with the democratic national committee to officially hand clinton their nod  caucus leaders will send their troops out into states where the black vote is a make or break situation to make sure that they have as much support for their candidate as possible  they are intensely focused on south carolina  where getting the black vote out will definitely be a boost for whichever candidate takes that state s primary  from the washington post  it s one thing to endorse and do nothing  it s another thing to endorse and to go to work   said rep  gregory meeks  d n y    chairman of the cbc pac  these lawmakers are  meeks said   people that can actually testify  the work that hillary clinton has done  this is so true  endorsements hold power  but the work that goes along with them is just as   if not more than   important  a whopping  percent of the congressional black caucus is on board with endorsing clinton  rep  g k  butterfield  d  nc   who chairs the caucus  says of the endorsement of clinton over sanders  despite the fact that sanders  message is popular with young progressives  many of these are first time voters and senator sanders  message resonates with the younger generation because of the promises that he is making  but mrs  clinton and others are going to challenge the message by suggesting that it is unrealistic to believe that we can accomplish all of the things that senator sanders proposes  they need to understand that when a candidate presents a message  you ve got to pierce the message to determine whether or not it s realistic  given the political climate that we live in  it s not a negative  it s not an aspersion on the new voter  it s the fact that many of them are inexperienced and have not gone through a presidential election cycle before  and that is what is important   they aren t against sanders just because they are for clinton  it is important for folks here on the left to realize you can support one candidate over the other during the primary  but to ultimately vote blue in november congratulations  secretary clinton featured image via hillary clinton twitter
