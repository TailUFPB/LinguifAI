donald trump s wife was the headline speaker on the first night of the republican national convention  it was supposed to be her big moment  she was supposed to be convincing everyone that she was first lady material  but that all went straight down the toilet when she got busted for stealing an entire paragraph of her speech straight from michelle obama s  speech to the democratic national committee here is the suspicious section of melania s speech my parents impressed on me the value of that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise  that you treat people with respect  show the values and morals in in the daily life  that is the lesson that we continue to pass on to our son we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow   because we want our children in these nations to know that the only limit to your achievement is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them and here are the words from michelle obama s speech in  and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values  that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do  that you treat people with dignity and respect  even if you don t know them  and even if you don t agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values  and pass them on to the next generation  because we want our children   and all children in this nation   to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them you can listen to the plagiarized portion of melania s speech here plagiarism is never acceptable and if this is the level of incompetence with which trump s campaign is being run  just imagine how he and his administration would run the country featured image via alex wong getty images
