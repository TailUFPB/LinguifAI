as conservatives rushed to find excuses for melania trump s plagiarized speech at the rnc convention on monday night  joy reid pointed out the hypocrisy the festivities got off to a rocky start on the first day of the convention  which is definitely not what the republican party had in mind melania trump auditioned to be the first lady by stealing part of michelle obama s dnc convention speech from   and it s pretty obvious that the similarities are not just a coincidence here are passages of both speeches side by side via the new york times ms  trump  monday night  from a young age  my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise  that you treat people with respect  they taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives  that is a lesson that i continue to pass along to our son  and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow  because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them  mrs  obama  in her  speech  barack and i were raised with so many of the same values  that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do  that you treat people with dignity and respect  even if you don t know them  and even if you don t agree with them  and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values  and pass them on to the next generation  because we want our children   and all children in this nation   to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them  clearly  this is not just a mistake  but trump apologists and even members of the media are blaming speechwriters and campaign staff even though melania trump told matt lauer prior to the convention that she wrote it herself  so melania is either a liar or lazy or both and the hypocrisy was too much for joy reid to stand by and say nothing  reid pointed out that if michelle obama s speech had been plagiarized she would not have been given a pass  i ll start by quoting a guy called tom nichols  who s a conservative and very prominent on twitter  who said   ask yourself if michelle obama would have been given a pass had she done the same thing in    i think we re all very quickly passing the responsibility onto staff  clearly  this is a campaign that is poorly staffed  i think that has been clear for a long time  but they sent melania trump over to matt lauer to say that she wrote it   but we re immediately dismissing the idea that she had anything to do with it  i doubt that we would dismiss the idea that michelle obama had anything to do with it she s an adult woman  she s grown up  she has participated in the delivery of this speech  she gave the speech  so i think you have to give responsibility   sure  to the staff  the campaign management has been poor here   but melania trump did give the speech and michelle obama wouldn t have gotten a pass  here s the video via vidme indeed  conservatives would have howled in rage had michelle obama plagiarized her speech  they would have said that it proved she is unqualified to be first lady and they would not have tolerated any excuse  let s face it  the difference here is that melania trump is the wife of the republican nominee and her skin is white and that somehow makes it okay that she plagiarized her speech  once again  conservatives demonstrate clearly that they are hypocrites who don t have original thoughts featured image via video screen capture
