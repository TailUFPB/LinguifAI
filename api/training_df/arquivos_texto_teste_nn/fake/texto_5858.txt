after the horrific terrorist attack in orlando  which became the deadliest shooting in american history  a new poll from cbs shows that support for banning assault rifles has skyrocketed across the nation the poll  conducted june  and   shows that  percent of americans support banning them  while  percent oppose  but the most surprising thing about these numbers is that in december of last year  only  percent of americans supported a ban  that s a thirteen point difference in just six months the poll also shows a shocking statistic   almost half of republicans   percent  support the ban  while  percent of democrats and  percent of independents do according to the poll on whether laws governing gun sales should be made more strict  americans seem split along party lines  a majority    percent   believe that laws should be stricter  while  percent believe they should be less strict  about three in ten americans think they should be kept as is not surprisingly  republicans were in the minority on this issue as well the overwhelming majority of americans support such a ban  and only one candidate wants to see that happen   hillary clinton  donald trump doesn t because  in his own words  there are already too many of them on the streets so it would be fruitless  but deporting  million immigrants in this country  no problem  there is no doubt that the number has risen thanks to the ever eminent threat of mass gun violence plaguing this nation  and the attack in orlando certainly didn t ease any fears when it comes to the issues of expanding background checks  all political ideologies are in agreement  over  percent of republicans   percent of democrats  and  percent of independents support stricter  universal background checks if this trend continues  guns will become a serious policy point in the upcoming election  as it should be   and with the two candidates taking completely different approaches  the difference could not be starker featured image via david mcnew getty images
