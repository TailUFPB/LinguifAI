donald trump loves to brag that he is the strongest republican candidate ever  as proof  he offers the fact that he received  million votes during the primary  reagan  trump says  had fewer than  million votes  he also bypassed romney by about three million here s what trump says about it  look  you know the republican party has largely come together  they agree with me  and they believe in me  and i got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections   trump replied   nobody s ever even gotten close  the republicans  i got more than ronald reagan  i got more than richard nixon  i got more than dwight eisenhower  i got more than anybody but i have to say  the republicans better get smart  they better start sticking together   source  breitbart comtrump s claim is absolutely true  do you feel that  that s a collective chill going down the spines of every sane person on the planet  fortunately for all of sanity  it s not as simple as trump or some in the media claim  trump did not bypass ronald reagan or even mitt romney in the popular vote  and here s why  in the simplest of terms  we have a lot more people than we did when reagan ran in  and even when romney ran in  the truth doesn t bode well for trump in   ronald reagan won   million votes in the republican contests in a country that had more than  million fewer people of voting age  further  more than a dozen states held non binding caucuses that the candidates largely ignored  adjusting for the population increase and the number of meaningful primary contests today  reagan likely would have won close to  million votes   significantly more than trump received  according to a huffpost analysis adjusting george w  bush s  million votes from  the same way suggests he might have won   million votes  and adjusting  s numbers  eisenhower might have received   million votes  while taft might have won   million   both more than trump received but the biggest gop winner in modern times  according to the huffpost analysis  was richard nixon in   when the sitting vice president won  million votes in just  contests   suggesting nixon could have won   million votes with today s voting population and primary schedule source  huffington postlet s compare that to hillary clinton  in   both she and barack obama nearly tied with more than  million votes each  this year  her vote totals are lower  about  million  but they are still greater than donald trump s of course  like most of trump s boasts  these numbers mean absolutely nothing  primary voters tend to be a different group of people than general election voters and we are still several months out  but we do know that he s not in a position to do better than ronald reagan or even than mitt romney featured image via sara d  davis at getty images
