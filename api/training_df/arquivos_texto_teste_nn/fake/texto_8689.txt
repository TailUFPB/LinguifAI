a man affiliated with the illegal occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge in the oregon standoff with police was out and about driving around town in his white  ford van  when he ended up crashing his vehicle into a barb wire fence  completely flipping the car over in the process we re not sure if he was out looking for snacks  but the oregon state police posted a picture of the crash on their twitter page on sunday  now  get this   not only was he being an unsafe driver on icy roads  propelling the car more than  ft  away from the road   but he was also driving without a license  fortunately  he wasn t injured  we wouldn t wish that on anyone  but safety issues aside  all the police did was cite him for operating a motor vehicle without a license  that s it  he wasn t arrested  as many would presume state police spokesman bill fugate wouldn t provide more details about the incident  other than to say  oregon only cites for no operator s license  we do not arrest  pic via twitter it looks like the police aren t too concerned with mr  burke s activities of occupying federal property  perhaps one reason is that he wasn t driving a federal van from the property  it appears to be his own just a few days ago  another militant by the name of kenneth medenback left the compound for a  snack run   state police decided to arrest him for theft of two government vehicles  not the occupation itself  and  that was the very first arrest of the occupation so far  at this rate it s going to take forever to arrest all these guys  so  while law enforcement doesn t appear to be taking an active stance of ending the illegal protest itself  they are still somewhat concerned with upholding some of the laws on the books  that s some good news  at least featured image via twitter
