george stephanopoulos allowed presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump to phone into good morning america on friday morning only to be grilled for not releasing his tax returns  do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision   stephanopoulos asked  i don t think they do   trump replied before claiming that he will  gladly  release his returns once the irs completes an audit against him  of course  the audit may not be over until after the election  a fact that even trump conceded despite feigning hope that it will end before november stephanopoulos didn t buy that argument  however  pointing out that an audit didn t prevent former president richard nixon from releasing his tax returns  the irs has made it very clear that an audit is not a bar to public release   stephanopoulos said   it s entirely your choice  president nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit and when you were seeking a casino license in pennsylvania and new jersey you released your returns to state officials even though you were under audit  trump repeated that he will not release his returns until after the audit is complete  which may or may not be completed until after the election  so the audit is a rather convenient excuse for trump trump then erroneously claimed that many presidents have not released their tax returns  and stephanopoulos didn t let him get away it   every single nominee since  has released his tax returns   the abc host informed trump trump went on to claim that his release of his  financials  should be enough  but stephanopoulos noted that such documents fail to show what his tax rate is and how much in taxes he pays that really set trump off as he began to complain about having to pay taxes and he admitted that he  tries very hard  to pay as little in taxes as possible  as we all know  the reason why bernie sanders has been so popular this election season is because one of his goals is to force the wealthy  percent to pay their fair share of taxes testiness on trump s part dominated the remaining part of the interview as trump repeated that he would not release his returns until the audit is complete and claimed that he shouldn t have to release his returns until hillary clinton releases nonexistent missing emails  when pressed further on his returns  trump said curtly that it s  none of your business  here s the video via youtube but it is stephanopoulos s business because he is a journalist  it s also the american people s business because they deserve all the information before going to the polls in november  trump can claim all he wants that he doesn t have secret overseas accounts or that he pays low taxes  but the american people won t know if he s lying or not until he releases the returns to the public  and since trump is playing this game of hide and seek with his returns  the only conclusion we can assume at this time is that he has something to hide and he is doing everything he can to keep it hidden until after the election featured image via screen capture
