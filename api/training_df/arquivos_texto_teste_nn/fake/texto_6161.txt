on thursday  the inspector general of the state department released a stinging report on hillary clinton regarding the use of her private email server  as expected  republicans pounced on the  findings  in an effort to paint her as an incapable  dangerous criminal  like they haven t already   democrats  on the other hand  are taking a different approach and surprisingly have a strong defense from the conservative forbes  saying the newest findings in the  email gate  vindicate rather than harm her  contributor charles tiefer  who served as solicitor of the house of representatives and as an attorney for the senate legal counsel  says the  scandal  may not lie with hillary clinton but really with the bush administration it does not add any new serious charges or adverse facts  and  it shows she was less out of line with her predecessors  notably colin powell  than has been charged  powell s handling of his email was so similar  in fact  that when house republicans drag this issue through hearings up to election day  powell should be called as a witness   a witness for clinton  to put it differently  she is having a double standard applied to her if there is any person in the history of american politics that is the poster child for having double standards applied  it would be hillary clinton  for obvious reasons  she s a woman   clinton seems to bear the brunt of rage from people who remain silent when men  or members of their own party  do the exact same thing  embassy security  mere ambition  votes  think crime bill   paid speeches  and now email procedures once again  hillary clinton is put on blast for an  page report  in which only half a dozen pages actually address the secretary s personal emails   the rest of the pages are appendices  historical context and precedence established by predecessors including albright  rice  powell and now kerry  and the few pages that do mention her emails mostly discuss broad cyber security policies pertaining to emails no new information has come out of the report  just a scathing slap on the wrist for clinton  who has already admitted that she could have gone about a much better way of handling her emails  but still you ll find republicans  and indeed some left wing liberals  cry out  smoking gun   as tiefer points out o the extent that she is criticized because  she did not comply with the department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the federal records act   the report is making a legal judgment that is not particularly strong  note how she is not labeled as violating any statute  but rather  a real mouthful of mush    the department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the federal records act   so we are talking about obscure  dull  bureaucratic policies  not a criminal statute  not even a civil statute   just the bureaucratic policies the fact of the matter is that this is not a smoking gun   just a politicized report of things we already knew  based on the ig s report  clinton did nothing illegal  she just created a bureaucratic headache  shouldn t republicans be giving her a medal given their intense hatred for the rules and procedures established by bureaucracy so how does this help her  well  for starters  it doesn t really hurt her  there s no legal framework established for an indictment  yet  unless we are counting on the fbi or the doj to somehow find a smoking gun   second  it s more ammo for clinton to use against a very sexist double standard that is applied to women in politics and not men  third  it s another light shone on the bush administration  a penchant for lies  crooked shenanigans  and again  double standards featured image via justin sullivan getty images
