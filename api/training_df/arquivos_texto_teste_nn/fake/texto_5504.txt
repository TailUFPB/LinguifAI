presidential elections are won by well prepared  well organized multimillion dollar efforts that are executed at the state level  some of the best models of this have been president bush s campaign in  and president obama s campaigns in  and   what needs to be done and how it should be done are known by seasoned campaign operatives and candidates who put the people in place to make it happen donald trump s presidential campaign  and the republican party s planning to help his campaign in multiple states that are key to winning  are a complete disaster with only four months to go until the election  according to a new report from the associated press with early voting beginning in less than three months in some states  the review reveals that the national gop has delivered only a fraction of the ground forces detailed in discussions with state leaders earlier in the year  and that is leaving anxious local officials waiting for reinforcements to keep pace with democrat hillary clinton in the states that matter most in  the republican party s massive failure gets even worse when you zoom in to swing states  as the associated press has some examples of republican shortfalls  ohio republicans thought they were going to see  paid staffers by may  in reality there are about   plans for pennsylvania called for  paid staffers  there are about   iowa s planned ground force of  by may actually numbers between  and   in colorado  recent staff departures have left about two dozen employees  far short of the  that were to have been in place ap even found that trump s headquarters in florida  one of the most important states in the fight for the electoral college  was closed and its voice mailbox full  florida has  electoral votes and in  was decided by a margin of   percent   on the ground organizing is key to winning it these failures at the state organizing level don t even take into account the massive disparity in campaign advertising between clinton and trump  while she has been pumping out ads in important states like ohio  pennsylvania  florida  colorado  and new mexico along with super pacs that support her  trump hasn t been advertising at all  in   mitt romney s campaign was outspent by president obama  but he was actually spending money   trump isn t spending on much  besides many of his own entities who showed up as campaign vendors republicans  especially in   derided president obama s background as a community organizer  but they could do with one right now to organize for their candidate in the communities he needs in order to have a chance at winning  that doesn t seem to be happening featured image via flickr
