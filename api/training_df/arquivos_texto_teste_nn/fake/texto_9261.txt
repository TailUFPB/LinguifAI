after it was announced that president trump was seriously considering moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem  he was roundly criticized by the anti trump media  today  democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers  pope francis appealed to president trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone  in his appeal  pope francis said   jerusalem is a unique city  sacred to jews  christians  and muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions  and has a special vocation to peace    and yawn in gaza  where the more things change  the more they stay the same  palestinians burned the u s  and israeli flags the media will try to make everyone believe that palestinians loved us when obama was president  even though there is no truth to that fantasy   see image below daily mail   president donald trump announced wednesday that america formally recognizes jerusalem as israel s capital city  changing decades of u s  policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve  not derail  aspirations for regional peace appearing in the white house s diplomatic reception room against an elaborate backdrop of christmas decorations  he also said the united states embassy in israel would  over time  be moved there from tel aviv israel is the only country where the united states has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital  i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel   trump said   while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise  they failed to deliver  today i am delivering  when i came into office i promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking   he said  leaning heavily on a mid  federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation  we have declined to acknowledge any israeli capital   at all   trump added   but today we finally acknowledge the obvious  that jerusalem is israel s capital  this is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality  it is also the right thing to do  it is something that has to be done  matthew continetti of the washington free beacon seems to think so  continetti wrote the best piece on trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date not only is president trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and begin the process of moving the u s  embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency  it is one of the boldest moves any u s  president has made since the beginning of the oslo  peace process  in   that process collapsed at camp david in  when yasir arafat rejected president clinton s offer of a palestinian state  and the process has been moribund ever since  despite multiple attempts to restart it that is why the warnings from trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow  there is no peace process to wreck  the conflict is frozen  and the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in u s  or israeli policy but in palestinian autocracy  corruption  and incitement  have the former obama administration officials decrying trump s announcement read a newspaper lately  from listening to them  you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the middle east but for trump  in fact  the region is engulfed in war  terrorism  poverty  and despotism  israel faces threats in the north and south  its sworn enemy  iran  is growing in influence and reach  and the delegitimization of the jewish state proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses  i forget how the obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world  maybe someone will remind me a similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over jerusalem  every israeli knows jerusalem was  is  and will remain his capital  every recent president has agreed with him  and the u s  consensus has been bipartisan  the last four democratic platforms have said the obvious  that jerusalem is israel s capital  the senate voted   only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city  were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote  was it all virtue signaling  a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of u s  diplomacy it is a sign of the disingenuousness of american foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning  president trump has no background in or admiration for the routines  manners  and norms of the u s  foreign service  especially that part of it which specializes in the israeli palestinian conflict  this has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid  jerusalem is israel s capital  full stop  his transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition  in march   at the aipac policy conference  he pledged that  we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people  jerusalem   his remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro israel community i wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of u s  law as  disruptive   have they not paid attention to this man  donald trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the u s  capital for decades  in this sense  his jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm  he is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion  what trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one  by keeping his campaign promise today  he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the united states could have its cake and eat it too on the question of israel s capital  and by moving our embassy to jerusalem  the united states will acknowledge israel s right to determine its own capital city  that is not something to condemn or fear  it is something to be proud of
