on december   an unidentified  year old mother was killed in a hotel room during an attempt by five family members to exorcise a demon which they claim was possessing her according to authorities  the woman s family exerted massive force on her chest and stomach area   as well an extreme amount of  violence to her neck   a towel and a clothes hanger were shoved down her throat  reportedly to keep her from screaming prosecutors say that the woman was subjected to at least two hours of  pain and agony   before she finally died from a combination of asphyxiation and traumatic injuries  all of which were sustained during the  exorcism  the killers include a  year old female relative  along with the relative s children  a  year old son   year old daughter and  year old son  the  year old son of the woman who was killed is also suspected of participating in the violence instead of calling police or paramedics after the woman died  the family called a priest the priest immediately notified authorities  who ultimately discovered the woman s body at the frankfurt intercontinental hotel a second victim was later found  another  year old woman  who is believed to be another family member  she was discovered inside a garage according to fox  in phoenix  the second victim was taken to a hospital  where she was treated for hypothermia  dehydration and undisclosed injuries the family involved in the woman s murder is south korean  and had recently relocated to the frankfurt  germany area the practice of exorcising demons  known as anchal gido  is common among charismatic christians living korea as reported here and here  the western media often refers to these exorcisms as  shamanism  when in fact they are legitimized by the protestant church in korea as kyung hong explains in the international journal of religion and spirituality  anchal gido rituals are their own kind of abuse  since they often involve forms of physical violence against those deemed to be possessed   the intensity of the healing prayers for cleansing demonic spirits also often accompanies intense physical contact in the belief that physical assaults intimidate and assist to expel demons  thus  the healing ritual may well become so intense as to involve physical striking  beating  poling  or choking the possessed individual  though each action is viewed by the healers as attacking the demon  not the person  there is a similarity between korean exorcism and shamanic rituals  but the latter often lacks the violence and is more about appeasing unfriendly nature or ancestral spirits than outright spiritual warfare  religion watch reports that in korea  protestant women  who are seen as demon possessed are often viewed as disobedient to their husbands and are subject to shame and condemnation  even in their deaths  the facts about anchal gido don t fit in with the western narrative of the christian religion when  year old rayoung kim was killed in her home during a similar exorcism in fairfax county  virginia  the media reported that her death was due to a  shamanistic exorcism   although the facts in the case show that she died during the type of violent exorcism that is associated with anchal gido  not kut or mudang  as the media routinely reported the shamanistic ritual of kut involves singing  dancing and offering sacrifices  it is not associated with the violent  driving out of demons   seen in these cases that is far more typical of korean charismatic christianity in the case of the women killed in frankfurt  the most telling sign that the family was conducting the kind of violent  christian exorcism associated with anchal gido is that the first person they called was a priest here in the u s  we are constantly subjected to right wing propaganda about the violent nature of the muslim religion  at the same time  the media often presents us with a filtered version of current events  especially as they pertain to the christian religion whether this is done purposely or out of ignorance and unconscious bias is up for debate either way  had this family killed a relative during a religious ceremony associated with islam  the right wing would be all over that  in this case  however  the narrative will no doubt seek to shift the blame away from the christian church and onto  shamanism   without a shred of evidence or single fact to support that theory  featured image credit  michal via flckr  cc
