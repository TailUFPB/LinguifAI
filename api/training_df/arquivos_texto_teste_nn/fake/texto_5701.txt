cnn was quick to scoop up corey lewandowski after donald trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager  but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly not only has lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for trump  but his defense of the disgraced gop candidate isn t being received well  earlier this week  lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize the donald  even after being fired from the campaign  today  lewandowski got called out by hillary clinton surrogate christine quinn for hyping trump up to be an expert on the brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false on monday s edition of cnn s new day  lewandowski made another pathetic defense of trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to brexit  where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his scotland golf resort  lewandowski s defense was  obviously the u s  dollar has become much stronger now against the british pound  if you re going to spend money in europe  now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound what you have is a world view  so what you have is someone who is saying   let s look at this from the u s  perspective  if you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar  quinn wasn t having it  she ripped into lewandowski  firing back  donald trump is not running to be travel agent of the world  he s running to be president of the united states   she continued  what he said wasn t a commentary on international markets  it was   when the pound goes down  more people will come to my golf course  donald trump s main concern isn t the international markets  it isn t the impact that brexit will have on hard working americans    it s himself  how can he make more money  how can he put more money in his bank account  lewandowski compared the brexit decision to trump s rise in the gop  and quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place  she said  trump touted that he saw this coming  that s ridiculous because when he was first asked about brexit by the press  he didn t appear to know what it was  lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that people are too smart  they are tired of being told what to do   he then tried to commend trump for being a selfish moron  you know what donald trump said about brexit  what he said was  you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision  he didn t weigh in like hillary clinton did  like barack obama did  saying that you can t do this  quinn fought back  because he didn t know what it was  lewandowski was fighting a losing battle  trump s reaction to brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that trump knows nothing about foreign affairs  and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy  if only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on twitter were being used for learning about how the world works  but instead  he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for president  and when people like lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy  they only make themselves look equally foolish you can watch the embarrassing video below featured image via screen capture
