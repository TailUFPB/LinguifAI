art halvorson  a tea partier with a major agenda  is running for office against rep  bill shuster  r pa   who is the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee  ordinarily  this wouldn t be news  except that halvorson is literally willing to do anything it takes to beat shuster  even if it means running as a democrat there s a reason to gag here  because it s like halvorson is actually willing to infiltrate the democratic party in order to accomplish his aims  in fact  the worst kind of tea partier is one who will literally do anything  no matter how slimy  to win an election    kind of like donald trump  there s a reason the tea party is such a problem a spokesperson for shuster hit the nail on the head on halvorson s absolute buttfuckery  by running for congress as a democrat after beating the other democrat by  votes in the primary  art halvorson has proved that he cares about one thing and one thing only   himself   said casey contres  a campaign spokesman for shuster   not only is he betraying democrats by calling their party godless while forcing them to accept him as their nominee  but he is also betraying the will of the republican primary voters that have twice rejected his attempt to get a job in congress  he s betraying the will of the republican primary voters   that have rejected him  here s a clue that he s unhinged  halvorson lost his primary against shuster  but he doesn t think that s the end of it  that s disgusting right there  because the tea party is supposed to be all about the will of the people over tyranny  they want small government  and think the people should hold the power  does halvorson think that the primary didn t reflect what the people of pennsylvania s  district somehow  how is this kind of manipulation in keeping with what the tea party stands for simple answer  it doesn t halvorson is sick  like the entire tea party the oddest thing is that he wants to let voters know that he s a republican running as a democrat  so they know they need to actually swallow their pride and  gasp   vote blue  but he faces a ridiculous battle  gillian kratzer  chairwoman of the blair county democrats  which is where halvorson is running  says that democrats won t be fooled  she believes he should know that democrats won t support him  republicans probably won t  either halvorson embodies tea party desperation at its finest  many don t see how he ll win  but all that matters to him is himself  who knew a tea partier could be so selfish  oh wait featured image via art halvorson s twitter account
