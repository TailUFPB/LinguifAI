trump knows the art of the deal like no one else  he d had enough of do nothing paul ryan so he went around him and made a better deal with democrats that actually helps the hurricane victims  the three month deal was much better than the commitment of  months that speaker ryan had proposed  president trump shocked and angered republicans on wednesday by agreeing with democrats on a bill to suspend the debt ceiling for three months  but by thursday  republican lawmakers and aides were acknowledging that trump s plan was better for republicans than the plan put forward by house speaker paul ryan  r wis many republicans weren t all that happy with either proposal  ryan was proposing an  month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed  and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stability but democrats said they could only agree to a three month suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks  trump s decision to take the democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of republicans  and a sign trump was abandoning the gop on a key legislative package after the dust settled  however  republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the three month plan as a slight improvement over ryan s plan the reason was simple neither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing  something many conservatives wanted to see  with that key piece lacking  many republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason democrats did  it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription  in this case  spending cuts a source with the conservative house freedom caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that trump settled on wednesday  but this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts  lots of members think the three month deal is bad  but so is an  month deal   this source said  but the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon  and in that way  is better for republicans   members don t want to sit on their hands   the source said hfc members  in particular  see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included  when the battle heats up again  the hfc is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of u s  gross domestic product the hfc is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with house gop leaders  the republican study committee  in contrast  is more mainstream and is comprised of most house gop lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policies but even the rsc indicated wednesday that trump s deal is better for republicans than what ryan was pushing  for example  rsc member tom cole  r okla   said wednesday that he preferred trump s plan over ryan s  i think a short term deal is much easier to vote for than an  month or two year extension with no offsets   he said on msnbc  describing the choices that were put before the gop  cole cast the deal trump reached as a slight delay that will let republicans try again soon for spending cuts  i think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts   he added   so we live to fight another day  for entire story  washington examiner
