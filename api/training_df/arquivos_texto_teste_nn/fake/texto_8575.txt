donald trump s heavily conservative base is filled to the brim with stupid people  it s one thing for polls and studies to prove that trumpfans are absolute morons  but it s another for the billionaire  hopeful to actually admit it on saturday at an iowa campaign rally  trump told his fanatical followers to their faces that they are so stupid they would even support him if he shot someone in broad daylight  in front of a crowd of people  i could stand in the middle of  avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn t lose voters  ok  it s  like  incredible  yes  it is incredible  it s incredible in the first place that anyone regardless of political leanings could support a man who wants to ban muslims from entering the united states  even if they are returning from vacation   waste taxpayer dollars to build a gigantic wall  make followers of islam register in a national database and wear special badges to let everyone know their religion  and throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure  it s almost baffling but what is more baffling is that trump standing before a crowd and telling them they are so stupid they would continue to support him if he murdered someone in cold blood in a scenario in which there is no question of his guilt does absolutely nothing to dissuade them from supporting him he is right   the loyalty of his fans is iron clad  and it is clear that they love him no matter what he does or says  no matter how horrible trump is probably right  he could probably shoot someone in front of a crowd of people  and his followers would defend him   especially if the victim was black  gay  muslim  jewish  or anyone who wasn t a white christian conservative  even then  it is unlikely their support would waver because they re f cking stupid watch trump tell his followers how stupid they are below featured image via screengrab
