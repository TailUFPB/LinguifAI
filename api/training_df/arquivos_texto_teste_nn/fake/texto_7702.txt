last night  the republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size this happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh gop debate  when trump addressed rival marco rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring america that there was  no problem with the size of his junk  no one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature  petty discussion   but you can always count on trump to help the country sink to new lows while many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state  wallowing over the fact that a nationally televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke  twitter swooped in to save the day  as soon as trump made his ill timed joke  twitter was flooded with the most clever  hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much needed perspective to keep us afloat as trump continues to dominate the republican polls here are some of the most amazing responses to trump  to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the gop debate might actually win the nomination twittertwittermany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment twitterthe new york post and huffington post didn t disappoint twitter twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwitterlast night s gop debate was less about policy and the future of america than it was about trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle  america cannot risk having someone like him fronting the gop  even though it would be an easy win for the democrats  the fact that trump has been able to gather the support of so many americans is depressing  for most americans watching the gop debate last night  this tweet sums it up twitter featured image via screenshot
