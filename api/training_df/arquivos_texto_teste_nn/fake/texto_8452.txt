bernie sanders just picked up one of the most important endorsements of his campaign  no  it isn t a politician  pundit  or  celebrity  it is eric garner s eldest daughter  erica garner  she  like too many others  is a family member of one of the victims of police brutality  and the racism that drives it  her father s death helped catalyze the black lives matter movement  erica garner has since worked as an activist  she is the founder of the garner way foundation garner s endorsement comes in the form of a powerful essay  published in the washington post  in the endorsement  she writes about her disillusionment with a system that has for so long been able to pretend that the life of her father  her own  and all people of color s lives have mattered she writes that  if our lives really mattered  we d have equal access to decent jobs  good schools and affordable housing  if our lives mattered in this country  we d have equal access to clean air  clean water and real investment in black neighborhoods  if black lives mattered in america  those who routinely brutalize us wouldn t be the ones paid  with our tax dollars  to keep us safe i trusted establishment democrats who claimed to represent me  only to later watch them ignore and explain away the injustice of my father s death  i trusted the system  then i watched as politicians on both sides of the aisle   from chicago s democratic mayor rahm emanuel to michigan s republican gov  rick snyder   disregard the will of the people they were elected to represent and abdicate their responsibility to protect them  i ve watched as our system criminalizes blackness while allowing wall street to bilk the american people with impunity  sanders has met with quit a few family members of family members of high profile victims of anti black state violence  after taking a tour of the neighborhood freddie gray lived in  sanders was disturbed  if unsurprised  by the deplorable economic conditions that people survive in  anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you are in a wealthy nation  you would think you are in a third world country   sanders said after the tour then of course  there is the chance meeting with the mother and sister of sandra bland that occurred  and was not initially reported to the media  where sanders promised to keep saying bland s name  sanders was the only candidate to say her name during the first democratic debate  the lawyer for walter scott s family publicly endorsed sanders in her endorsement  garner lays out who she think s will be the best candidate to serve black people  by saying  who will address the criminalization of our people  who understands that we re experiencing an economic crisis made worse by structural barriers to jobs and education  who will bring us closer to real safety  freedom and power  who has clearly shown us where they stand the answer is someone who started this work well before campaign season  who understands our deaths as tragedies   not political talking points   and someone who will speak out against the wars being waged against our communities  not someone who only pays attention to our concerns when it s time to collect our votes  not someone who gives us bread crumbs and expects us to be full black americans   all americans   need a leader with a record that speaks for itself  and to me  it s clear  of all the presidential candidates  sen  bernie sanders is our strongest ally  earlier in january  eric garner s mother  gwen carr  endorsed hillary clinton  her endorsement was put our in the form of a press release by the clinton campaign  in the press release  carr writes  hillary seems to be the only candidate right now who s talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem  that s why i m endorsing her for president  in contrast  garner sees sanders as similar to president obama  she writes that president obama was decried as being too extreme and too inexperienced  i remember another candidate who dared me to believe in hope and change  his opponents said he wasn t ready for leadership  they said he couldn t win  he said  yes  we can   and we did  i still believe we can  that s why i endorse bernie sanders for president  there has been a stark generational divide between clinton and sanders supporters  this divide between two different members of the garner family fits that pattern and shouldn t shock anyone  both candidates have had some trouble when it comes to racial justice issues  sanders has had trouble recognizing the non economic ways that violence is inflicted on people of color  clinton   somewhat unfairly  has had to distance herself between the policies that her husband  former president bill clinton  ushered in in the  s  those policies led to the dismantlement of welfare as it was known  and in some ways helped create our current era of mass incarceration  both candidates have  put out criminal justice reform packages  here is clinton s and here is sanders  for some  the idea that anyone who works within the current political system will truly be an ally for people of color may be seen as wishful thinking  the politics of any movement that built on a collection of diasporic communities can be hard to nail down  black lives matter is no different  but one thing is for sure  for many the  black vote  is no longer a guarantee for the democratic party   that isn t to say that people of color are jumping ship to vote for republicans  however  with snake people  especially those in more radical activist communities  you have to earn people s votes  and support   garner feels that sanders has earned the title of being people of color s  strongest ally   that status has a lot to do with sanders  reaction to criticism of his racial justice package whether that proves to be true or not  only time will tell  regardless of who is the eventual nominee  the public must continue to work towards pushing candidates to do more than pay lip service to traditionally marginalized communities  change does not always come easy  but it does come when people remain persistent that their communities matter  you can read garner s full endorsement here featured image credit  gage skidmore via flickr
