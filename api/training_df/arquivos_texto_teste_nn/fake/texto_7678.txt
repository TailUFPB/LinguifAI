john mccain was already walloped by barack obama in a presidential election  so it s only natural that the president would be at the center of what very well end mccain s political career entirely the man responsible for bringing sarah palin into our lives isn t exactly known for his impulse control  but it appears he massively overplayed his hand in his latest rush to bash president obama  in the days after long time supreme court justice antonin scalia passed away  mccain became one of the de facto cheerleaders for the senate republican plan to spend the next year preventing obama from fulfilling his constitutional obligation to nominate a replacement he announced that he would be standing with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in opposing any nomination until after the election   which means the seat would remain unfilled for nearly a year  and perhaps a great deal longer  for republicans  this knee jerk obstruction was so automatic that it seems almost nobody thought it through beforehand  so quick were they to oppose obama  that they didn t stop to think about how it would look for the party already known for saying  no  to issue blanket opposition to a constitutional mandate mccain  like many of his colleagues  is now discovering that his headlong rush into obstruction may be a career ending blunder  a new poll conducted by public policy polling found that his constituents in arizona are fed up with his antics  and his already low favorability numbers are tanking hard as to mccain s position   percent said it made them less likely to vote for his re election this year   percent said it made them more likely to vote for him  and  percent said it wouldn t make any difference the poll  which had a margin of error of plus or minus   percentage points  also indicated that just  percent approve of mccain s job performance while  percent disapprove and  percent were unsure in short  nobody in arizona seems to have any respect for john mccain  that s not a good position to be in  because mccain is facing a tough primary and an even tougher democratic challenger in november  congresswoman ann kirkpatrick is running for mccain s seat  and wasted no time calling out the senator  members of the u s  senate have an obligation to uphold the constitution and fulfill their duties  including voting on supreme court nominees regardless of party affiliation   kirkpatrick told the press via a prepared statement   john mccain used to take that responsibility seriously  care to hazard a guess what mccain s reaction to the poll was  here s his campaign spokeswoman  this fake  poll from liberal activists is the creation of partisan democrat hacks who have tried and failed for years to defeat john mccain  liberal bias  right on cue at this point in his life  mccain isn t just fighting for his continued career in politics  he s fighting for his legacy  rather than go out with a modicum of integrity  he decided to listen to the lemmings in his party that promised him that salvation was just beyond that edge of that cliff they were headed towards  it s painful to watch  sadly  for politicians  you are only as good as the last thing you did  mccain will go out being remembered as a deeply unpopular senator who was so blinded by his hatred of obama that it prevented him from accomplishing anything featured image via gage skidmore flickr
