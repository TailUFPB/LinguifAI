since john oliver left the daily show to take a spot on hbo  his is one of the few satirical news shows to regularly follow international news  as it turns out  dictators don t generally respond well to satire and oliver has found himself in a bit of a brush up with the kremlin backed ruler of chechnya  ramzan kadyrov   all over a lost cat in a segment on hbo s last week tonight  oliver ridiculed the friend of putin after kadyrov took to instagram to ask the world to help find his cat  which he called a  toyger   which as you might guess  is a cat that has been bred to look like a tiger cub                                                                                                                                                                                                                            a photo posted by ramzan kadyrov     on may    at   pdtunfortunately  without the help of unreliable translation software  we don t know exactly what the post says  but he did ask for help and he did say that  we have begun to seriously worry   asking people who have seen the cat to get in touch now  kadyrov is not a nice person  despite his apparent love of cats  so oliver couldn t leave it alone  not only did he release the video  but oliver trolled the leader on twitter here s the video and this    rkadyrov is this your cat  pic twitter com   john oliver   iamjohnoliver  may    image via twitter  kadyrov was not happy  apparently  he follows american social media as carefully as the equally thin skinned donald trump  he once again took to instagram to mock oliver  this time in english  although the text reads like he ran it through one of those terrible translation programs recently my  tiger cat  has left the house  it happens in spring from time to time  he also needs to meet with friends  mingle and share news  by cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she cat with which he s going to start a family  i m sure that after spring affairs  the cat will return to native walls  perhaps  he ll bring his sweet love with him  i got used to share with my friends in instagram with all news  including cat issues  and this time i didn t want to leave as a secret the cat s adventures  i receive lots of photos  some people say that they saw the cat in vladivostok  japan  iceland  new zealand  and even in the oval office of the white house  i am grateful to all  but this is not my cat  it became known that even the american tv channel  hbo  joined to search  the anchorman comedian   john oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat  i knew long ago that in the usa unevenly breathe to my younger friends  one day horses aren t allowed to jump  the other   a cat is a real star of a show  oliver laments a fact that we put on t shirts with a photo of the president of russia   vladimir putin  yes  millions of people rejoice t shirts with the image of the national leader  for this purpose  there is a good motivation  vladimir vladimirovich is a wise  courageous  resolute head  who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign  which is conducted by the usa and its assistants  thanks to putin  we have crushed terrorists among whom there were also citizens of the usa  and european citizens  the country directed by obama under the guise of peacekeeping operations spark new wars and bloody internal conflicts  in which die millions of people  afghanistan  iraq  libya  syria  that s why there is nothing surprising that oliver also got a wish to appear publicly in a t shirt with an image of putin  but not obama   kadyrov  russia  chechnya  usa  hbo  oliver  findkadyrovscat  ihavenotseenyourcat  ihaveseenyourcata photo posted by ramzan kadyrov     on may    at   pdtthis would all be funny  and well  it actually is  but kadyrov is one of the most notorious human rights abusers in the world and if he has his way  he ll have a lot more influence in the coming months and years  at just   the anti muslim activist is looking for a position to be made for him in the kremlin critics accuse the leader of kidnapping  torture  torching of homes and other human rights abuses  according to human rights watch  kadyrov shuts down all critics in chechnya and now he s trying to shut one down in the united states  kadyrov is also a strong admirer of russian strong man dictator  vladimir putin he said it was no surprise that he liked to wear putin t shirts  and that  millions of people rejoice t shirts with the image of the national leader   this  said kadyrov  was because putin is a  wise  courageous  resolute head  who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign  which is conducted by the usa and its assistants  source  the guardianas for the cat  well  he s apparently okay  he s apparently just a catanova  by cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she cat with which he s going to start a family  i m sure that after spring affairs  the cat will return to native walls  perhaps  he ll bring his sweet love with him   kadyrov wrote for now  though  perhaps oliver should have his food tested for polonium   kidding  sort of
