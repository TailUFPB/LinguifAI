whole foods is a store that many people love  they love the organic food  the appearance of cleanliness and health  and the impeccable customer service  however  lately  this popular chain has found itself under fire for creating and marketing products that are excessively expensive and completely unnecessary   often at the expense of the environment due to the packaging  and at the expense of its customers  budgets everyone remembers the absolute shitstorm caused by the asparagus water last year that the chain sold     a bottle for water with a couple of stalks of asparagus in it  apparently  that did not teach the folks at whole foods a lesson  because they have now just had a similar reaction to another ridiculously expensive product   oranges that are already peeled  which are going for a whopping   a pound needless to say  the public has not taken kindly to this move  and many people have taken to twitter to blast the chain  here are just a few choice critical tweets firstly  it was pointed out how environmentally irresponsible this is if only nature would find a way to cover these oranges so we didn t need to waste so much plastic on them  pic twitter com   nathalie gordon   awlilnatty  march     awlilnatty fucking hell  that makes me unbelievably angry actually  talk about necessarily contributing to plastic taking over the planet   swiftie be   stephaniebe  march    pointed out how ironic the chain s antics are  given its name  ajdomanico  awlilnatty the irony of this being whole foods too  mollie goodfellow   hansmollman  march    made fun of the obviously lazy nature of the people who would purchase this  conors  awlilnatty  mistervivian next logical step  half eaten       jemppu  march    was pointed out that it could be ableist to assume that everyone can peel an orange  however  that point was quickly followed by the obvious fact that such people are not who whole foods is targeting  in fact  due to the fact that most disabled people are not exactly well to do  they likely could never even afford to shop at whole foods  making that particular point moot  otherbecky  awlilnatty you know  as well as i do  that that is not who that is marketed towards  also  the packaging is still superfluous   swiftie be   stephaniebe  march    of this and more is true here  this is simply outrageous  shame on you  whole foods  you market to organic food eating  hippieish  health conscious liberals  and you expect us to put up with this  to not notice  well  for the second time in their price gouging attempt  whole foods was forced to backtrack  calling the marketing and selling of these pre peeled oranges a  mistake   awlilnatty definitely our mistake  these have been pulled  we hear you  and we will leave them in their natural packaging  the peel   whole foods market   wholefoods  march    re damn right it was a mistake  hopefully you people have learned your lesson this time featured image via flickr
