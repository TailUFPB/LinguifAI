by his own admission  donald trump screwed up his answer in an msnbc town hall meeting hosted by chris matthews  in the event  trump said he believed abortion should be banned  and that if such a law had come to pass  women who had abortions should be  punished  trump was immediately condemned not just by pro choice groups  but by conservative republican groups  who push for making abortion illegal but don t like to deal with the unpopular fallout that would come with making those laws  if abortion is murder  both women and their doctors would be committing a crime  trump walked back the statement soon after  perhaps he was too intoxicated with wrapping up the nomination on wednesday morning  but msnbc s willie geist asked him about the abortion question and his response  and absolute gibberish came out trump  he was asking me a theoretical  or just a question in theory  and i talked about it only from that standpoint  of course not  and that was done  he said  you know  i guess it was theoretically  but he was asking me a rhetorical question  and i gave an answer  and by the way  people thought from an academic standpoint  and asked rhetorically  people said that answer was an unbelievable academic answer  but of course not  and i said that afterwards  everybody understands that he would have probably been better off with his deeply unpopular answer in the first msnbc interview  or even the subsequent apologies and tapdancing  instead  as he so often has during the campaign  trump tries to sound smarter than he is and gets tied up of course  especially  the very trump friendly morning joe  he wasn t asked to clarify his comments or even tell viewers what planet he beamed them in from in order to make heads or tails of it featured image via youtube
