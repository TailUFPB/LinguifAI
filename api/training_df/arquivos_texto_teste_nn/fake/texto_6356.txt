during an interview with new york times columnist maureen dowd  republican presidential candidate donald trump referred to massachusetts sen  elizabeth warren as  pocahontas  in the piece published on saturday  dowd says that she asked trump if trump had received any negative comments from republicans about him and sen  elizabeth warren s twitter feud  trump responded to the question with a question  saying   who  pocahontas  the jab is a part of a conservative conspiracy theory that alleges that warren does not actually have the native american heritage she claims she does  apparently conservatives are not capable of understanding that a person can have a mixed racial and ethnic background  which shouldn t be surprising considering tea party types aren t capable of understanding that a man named barack hussein obama isn t automatically a muslim terrorist sleeper agent sent here to destroy the united states from the inside once again  trump has denigrated a person based on racial lines  when pressed on any issue trump falls back to posturing as a bully  he ll take any ridiculous notion and just run with it because he knows that his followers will simply laugh it up however  even the republican candidate who seems impervious to gaffes and criticism should reconsider accusing someone of inventing an identity after recent reports of trump s bizarre  john miller  scandal  the washington post s marc fisher uncovered audio recordings that show that trump invented a fictional spokesman for himself named john miller back in the  s   s and  s  during that period  trump would pretend to be miller or on occasion  john barron   and call reporters where  miller  would say wonderful things about trump  in an attempt to inflate trump s personal brand trump has denied the allegations  though the post reports that there is courtroom testimony where trump himself had admitted to creating the fictional personality featured image   photo by david becker getty images
