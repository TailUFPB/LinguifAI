much to the republican party s dismay  bigotry and intolerance doesn t sit well with even the most god fearing american voters anymore  according to data from a new pew poll on religion and this year s election  the gop is actually striking out with catholic voters   a demographic that the party used to have in the bag  and it gets worse   not only are catholic voters leaving the gop in droves  but they re opting to support democratic candidate hillary clinton instead pew reported that clinton is leading trump among catholic voters  and trump is partially to blame   much of the demographic that is supporting her are latino catholics  which trump has insulted and offended throughout his campaign currently  clinton also holds a  point advantage among catholic registered voters  driven largely by overwhelming support for clinton among latino catholics  by contrast  at a similar point in the  campaign  catholics were closely divided between support for obama     and romney      exit polls conducted on election day in  found that catholics ultimately split their votes between obama     and romney     here s a chart that outlines how different religious groups are currently voting  compared to the  election between president barack obama and former presidential candidate mitt romney thanks to his divisive campaign and moronic behavior  trump is striking out with every demographic that should be his strong point as a gop candidate  he s succeeded in dividing the republican party and turning conservative voters away from the gop  and now he s turning off religious voters that are usually very receptive to conservative values and talking points it s entirely possible that when election day comes  trump won t even be considered a threat to the former secretary of state  if he cannot rise to the performance level of romney in  in winning over america s religious voters  he doesn t even have the slightest chance  currently  clinton is ahead of trump by  catholic voters and  unaffiliated voters  if she keeps it up  the gop is in big trouble when november arrives featured image via gage skidmore
