former republican speaker john boehner has launched a blistering attack on gop presidential hopeful ted cruz  in which he describes the texas senator as satan incarnate  and a  miserable son of a b tch  boehner was asked about his views on cruz and other presidential candidates during an event held at stanford university this week  the stanford daily reported that boehner replied  i have democrat friends and republican friends  i get along with almost everyone  but i have never worked with a more miserable son of a b tch in my life  adding that he considers cruz to be  lucifer in the flesh  this was in sharp contrast to his views on the other candidates  boehner revealed that he is on friendly terms with frontrunner donald trump  stating that the two are actually  texting buddies   one can only imagine the contents of those texts and how does boehner feel about outside challenger and fellow ohioan john kasich  not much apparently   requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends  but he s still my friend  and i love him  boehner went on to state that in the event of a run off between ted cruz and donald trump  he would throw his vote and support behind a trump candidacy  of course  the frontrunner may well be forced to consider that with a friend like boehner  he may require no enemies  the former speaker is  like trump  a fairly divisive figure in the republican party and wider conservative movement of course  as addicting info s matthew desmond pointed out earlier today  this is all becoming a moot point  like it or not  the campaigns of ted cruz and john kasich are essentially over  donald trump is the de facto republican candidate for president the gop clown car has delivered perhaps the most repugnant presidential candidate since barry goldwater  the party will have to live with that  but america still has the chance to repeat the landslide of  against trump in    and remind the world that the u s  is committed to progress  not hate featured image via flickr creative commons flickr creative commons
