as much as he and his supporters want to say the media is against donald trump  it s clearly not  trump has gotten a ridiculous amount of media attention  and it would be easy to say much more than any other candidate of either party with this media attention comes an abundance of newspaper articles  blog posts and ledes to stories  all with their own way to describe something trump has said or done or is being scrutinized for  many of which are pretty straight forward and bland  not really depicting trump in a way that really embodies his true essence well  fixing this dilemma is none other than the extraordinary rosie o donnell who took to twitter to retitle the news to more accurately depict donald trump for example  huffington post titled an article   judge criticized by trump unseals documents in trump university case   but rosie kept it real and wrote  orange people steal money from unsuspecting innocents orange people steal money from unsuspecting innocents https   t co  via  huffpostpol  deportorangeman  rosie   rosie  may    is exactly what he did  let s not try to sugarcoat what a scam artist donald trump actually is  he opened a make believe  university   took people s money  and laughed all the way to the bank  he scammed people then like he is scamming people now when he says he ll make a good president  when in reality he d be the worst president we ve ever seen  yes  even worse than george w  bush  trump has absolutely no policy experience whatsoever  foreign or domestic  and he would be an embarrassment to the entire nation if he were to represent us in the world forum it s getting to the point where you re waiting for the big reveal  as though someone is about to come out and say   hey america  you re on candid camera   and we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief  however  until then  kudos to rosie o donnell for keeping in real featured photo by andrew toth getty images for fund for women s equality  era coalition
