right wing ideologues are at it again with voter suppression  when not passing discriminatory voter id laws and striking down the voting rights act  they are passing off half assed  offensive journalistic  philosophy  as legitimate commentary enter right wing libertarian columnist david harsanyi and his op ed in the washington post titled  we must weed out ignorant americans from the electorate   the article at first glance seems innocent   yes  we all wish people we deemed  stupid  didn t vote  liberals wish conservatives didn t vote  and conservatives wish liberals didn t vote however  when reading deeper  one quickly finds out that harsanyi has an extremely nefarious way to achieve this   forcing voters to pass a civics test if they wish to vote saying to voters   unfortunately  we can t trust you   harsanyi says  let s give voters a test  the citizenship civics test will do just fine  the reason  the writer thinks the american public is too ignorant to vote at the same time  let s also remember that checking a box for the candidate whose campaign ads you like best is one of the most overrated obligations of the self governed  if you have no clue what the hell is going on  you also have a civic duty to avoid subjecting the rest of us to your ignorance the questions  simple  if you have the privilege to from an educated background admitting that he believes the school system and society fails to teach the public proper civics  harsanyi says he doesn t care  he s made up his mind  he doesn t seem to know  or maybe he just doesn t care  that his civics test  banking on the fact that people will fail it  would disproportionately affect black and hispanic voters  americans who don t speak english  and voters with intellectual or learning disabilities  all these people  regardless of what harsanyi thinks  are americans who are all entitled to vote without any discriminatory barriers but harsanyi addresses that of course  we also must remember the ugly history of poll taxes and other prejudicial methods that americans used to deny black citizens their equal right to vote  any effort to improve the quality of the voting public should ensure that all races  creeds  genders and sexual orientations and people of every socioeconomic background are similarly inhibited from voting when ignorant cause that just makes everything better  doesn t it   that was the same thing the racist bigots in the south said when passing their discriminatory jim crow laws this attack on the basic dignities of voters and their absolute right to vote without barriers is disgusting  but we shouldn t put it past a libertarian  or rather faux libertarian considering actual libertarians are for freedom with no barriers featured image via scott olson getty images
