north carolina republicans just would not listen when everyone kept telling them not to re legalize discrimination by passing its hateful  religious freedom  law  now they are going to be paying a huge price   literally   as you will see below the obama administration is stepping in this time and has given the state s republican legislature an ultimatum  repeal the law or we pull billions of dollars in federal aid from your state in a way  this should be a wonderful thing for republicans  they hate the federal government and hate handouts  so  logically thinking  if obama pulls out billions of dollars that normally funds their roads  schools  and housing assistance programs it will be a great thing for the state  right my  how quickly republicans forget literally all of their ideology when it s something that benefits them  they re actually calling it illegal for the federal government to  single out  north carolina for what they call  unfavorable treatment  republicans don t seem to care about the unfavorable treatment they just legalized against their own lgbt citizens  i mean they can only get fired  evicted from their homes  or denied basic things like being able to shop in stores if the owners  sincerely believe  they are bad people for being lgbt  but that s totally different  right there are already costly lawsuits coming in from the passage of the law  and businesses are already threatening to leave the state   if they have not done so already  add all that expense and loss of business and jobs on top of a few billion dollars less from the government  soon their schools will be closing and roads crumbling with disrepair  the same people who voted these idiots in and supported the law will be crying about how bad it is in their state  but  jesus will be happy with them  maybe they can pray for the roads to get fixed featured image via camel city dispatch
