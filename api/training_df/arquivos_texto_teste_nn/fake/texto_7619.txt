one of the most disturbing things about extremist christian holy rollers is how they prize the virginity of women  it s misogynist  it s gross  and it needs to stop  that likely won t be happening any time soon  though   and boy have we got proof of that sad fact for you christianity today is in full blown damage control mode after they let an absolutely disgusting advertisement run that a man submitted regarding his single  year old daughter  you see  the man was looking for a husband for his daughter  the advertisement he sent to the magazine said  her  godly  gorgeous  athletic  educated  careered  humorous  travelled  bilingual   year old virgin  you  unworthy  though becoming less so daily  christianity today is sorry they let the ad run  and one of their editors  mark galli said to the daily beast  we want everything in our magazine to reflect beautiful orthodoxy  and this ad did not  we have taken a hard look at our ad review process  made some changes  and we can assure our readers that no ad like this will appear again  the poor woman whose father saw fit to advertise for a husband for her in a creepy religious publication and wave the fact that she is in her mid twenties and a virgin around like that was something to be extremely proud of also happens to be a blogger  while the ad included her blog s url  we will not be doing that here  lest other creepy misogynists try to hit her up  further  she was smart enough not to make the blog public  also  the woman  called  rachel   is not too torn up over it  and seems to be okay  she wrote of her fathers gross antics  i m just nervous if this doesn t work out  next i ll find my face plastered on a billboard  oh gosh  now i m giving him ideas  the prizing of virginity is one of the most gross  inappropriate  and misogynist parts of abrahamic religions  just another reason to question these people and their idea of what morality is get out of that cult of a religion  rachel  while you still can  good luck to you   you ll definitely need it featured image via flickr
