donald trump has figured out that the more offensive  controversial and vulgar he is  the more conservative voters are going to love him  he s carried that tone throughout his entire campaign  and has only seemed to rise in the polls  now  he s focusing on offending individual republican voters to win their approval during a today show town hall event on thursday morning  undecided republican voter jamie eckman asked the donald a question that would impact many americans  would he deport the undocumented parents of a relative that was a natural born citizen relative  eckman asked  my relative is a natural born american in the military  deployed in oman  his father and stepmother are undocumented citizens here in the   undocumented people here in the united states for the last  years without any way of adjusting their status  if you re president  what will you do for those members that are the fabric of our country  that have been here for  years undocumented  won t they be deported  once again  trump nailed his formula of being an absolute a  hole and despicable human being  after taking a few moments to insult his rival  canadian born ted cruz  trump returned to the matter at hand and answered eckman s question with something she probably didn t want to hear  yes  your loved ones are still getting deported  trump said  when you say natural born citizens  that s interesting  i assume you were born here  why do you mention that  because you know who always says that  ted cruz  he was born in canada and lived there for four years  he says   i m a natural born citizen  when  actually he was born in canada  but  you know what  he has no path right now   eckman quickly clarified that she wasn t on team cruz before trump continued to tell eckman she could kiss her family goodbye if he became the next president  they ve been here how many years  we re going to do something  for people that have been   look  we re either going to have a country or we re not going to have a country  but many people are very fine people  and i m sure these are very  very fine people  they re going to go  and we re going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally  okay  but it has to be done legally  taken aback that she didn t get the answer she was looking for  eckman asked the republican front runner   you will deport them first  right   trump responded  they re going to go  and then come back and come back legally  we have wonderful people  it s too tough to say you ll never come back again  they re coming back  but they re coming back into our country legally  so important  and to prove just how disgusting and heartless he is  trump added   now that might not be the perfect answer for you  but am i going to get your vote   eckman didn t answer you can watch trump break this republican voter s heart below despite all of the backlash he s faced  trump continues to cling to his racist  intolerant immigration stance  it seems that unless eckman wants to be packing her relatives  bags in november  she d better vote for hillary clinton  but unfortunately  because republicans just aren t very bright  trump might still get her vote  featured image via screenshots
