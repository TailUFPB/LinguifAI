whenever big news happens in washington  the nation  at least those in desperate need of entertainment  awaits the response of just one man  rep  louie gohmert  r texas   gohmert almost never disappoints with the depth of his stupidity and he certainly didn t on thursday  when he yelled at the democratic congresspeople who were conducting a sit in in support of gun control the sit in lasted a bit over  hours  and it was in protest to the four failed attempts at gun control in the senate and of speaker paul ryan s  r wisconsin  refusal to even let a gun control measure get a debate or vote gohmert  who received more than    in contributions from the national rifle association  thought the congresspeople were protesting the wrong thing  according to him  islam is responsible for our country s mass shootings  we are talking about radical islam   gohmert yelled  waving his finger at posters featuring photos of the victims of the recent mass shooting at an orlando  florida gay club   radical islam killed these people  gohmert was shouted down by democrats chanting   no fly  no gun   and  don t let terrorists have a gun  source  talking points memosure  we can call our gun problem a terrorism problem  g d knows it s terrifying americans  but it s not a muslim problem  the vast majority of mass shooters are white men without a political agenda   as we learn more and more about the orlando shooter  we are coming to realize that his association to terrorism is sketchy at best  instead  it seems  he was a spurned self hating gay man if that s the case  that he is a self loathing gay man and that s all the shooting was about  that indicates a societal problem   one which gohmert  a man who seems to obsess over whether being gay is god s will   is at least partially responsible for  the bigger picture  though  is that all of our mass shootings  as a matter of fact  all of our nation s shootings period  have one thing in common and that s guns  in our current political climate  there isn t a chance in hell that people will give up all guns  but there s a chance  albeit a slim one  that maybe we could stop the sale of assault weapons to violent people  that s all congress wants featured image via chip somodevilla at getty images
