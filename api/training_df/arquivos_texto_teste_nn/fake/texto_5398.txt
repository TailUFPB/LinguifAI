it s no secret hispanics hate donald trump  he has record low favorability with them  and there are no signs that support with them will rise in the coming months  gop hispanic leaders and pundits alike  from republican governor susana martinez to cnn s ana navarro  have been chastising and distancing themselves from the republican nominee for president and another influential hispanic group is distancing themselves from the nominee in the most public way possible the hispanic chamber of commerce  which endorsed ohio governor john kasich  will be publicly backing democratic candidate hillary clinton  and will announce their endorsement live from cleveland at the rnc talk about the ultimate trolling president of the chamber  javier palomeraz  denounced trump to the huffington post  saying his divisive and racist rhetoric is the reason the group will be backing clinton we believe it is appropriate for us to weigh in and say enough is enough   what we re hearing from donald trump in his campaign  divisive  mean spirited language  has marginalized hispanics  immigrants  american pows  muslims  women  the disabled   and the list goes on after public spats with palomeraz  in which trump cancelled events planned  the clinton campaign was right there to attend  listen  and learn about the needs of hispanic business owners  the clinton campaign also was repeatedly in touch with the chamber in an effort to reach out to communities using a slew of business leaders familiar with their needs no wonder they re endorsing clinton  it s no secret that the u s  chamber of commerce is pro republican  pro conservative  but their opinion isn t the only representation of business in america while trump flunks the presidential test  yet again   clinton picks up the pieces and offers her hand in support  it s no wonder more unions and business leaders have endorsed her than trump  the republican nominee looks out for one person and one person only   himself featured image via ethan miller getty images
