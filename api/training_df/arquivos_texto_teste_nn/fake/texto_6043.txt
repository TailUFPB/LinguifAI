political cartoons are usually awesomely hilarious  and they also generally have more than a little truth to them  case in point   a cartoon posted on the washington post s opinion blog today that needed no words when showing just what happened as house speaker paul ryan finally lost what little spine he had and endorsed donald trump you see  speaker ryan  for a very short time  actually strongly resisted trump  he rightly called trump s plans to ban all muslims from traveling to the united states  un american   and he also called trump out for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of former ku klux klan grand dragon david duke and other white supremacist organizations  however  all of paul ryan s concerns about trump have suddenly gone out the window  and the spineless speaker of the house is now happily endorsing the brainless  bombastic  racist narcissist who is now the official  gop presidential nominee the thing is  ryan s infamous spinelessness is what is behind this endorsement  from his previous statements  he clearly knows how absolutely dangerous trump is  but he doesn t care  he  like other gopers who initially resisted trump are content to put party before country   and hell  even before the safety of the world and the human race as we know it   and happily take it up the ass from trump if it means keeping democrats out of power so  without further ado  here is just what happened as paul ryan jumped on the trump train and there you have it  keep kissing the dirtiest asshole in america  speaker ryan  goodness knows it s what you deserve featured image via win mcnamee getty images
