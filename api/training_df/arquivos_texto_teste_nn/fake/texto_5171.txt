last week  raba research had hillary clinton beating donald trump in a general election match up by  points  gaining  points on the gop presidential candidate after a strong showing at the democratic national convention raba s poll was considered a complete outlier  given most other polls  whether they be from reuters  cnn  fox  ipsos  had clinton beating trump by  to  points but now a second poll has come out that may put raba back into the mainstream a mcclatchy marist poll has given hillary clinton a  point lead over donald trump      and a  point lead when factoring in third party candidates      so even with spoilers  clinton blows trump out of the water what s even more fascinating is the mcclatchy marist poll shows clinton with an  point lead among men  and a  point lead among those who identify as moderates  clinton is also viewed as more presidential than trump by  points     when it comes to who can best handle the war on terror  immigration  gun violence  trade and jobs  clinton bests trump in every category  by a margin of   points while clinton gained in democratic support  going from  percent to  percent  trump lost among republicans  going from  percent to  percent so jill stein isn t siphoning off clinton supporters  but it would appear gary johnson may be gaining with trump supporters  i guess those in the  never trump  camp are aplenty while those in the  never hillary  are almost non existent wasn t trump supposed to be the great unifier  he s losing members of his own party  and quickly  remember  the rnc was only two weeks ago  in fact   percent of people voting for clinton are voting for her  more or less  because of her  whereas  percent are doing it to spite trump  on the other side  only  percent of trump supporters are voting for the billionaire because they like him  while  are voting for him to spite clinton so trump s voters don t really like him all that much  clinton s voters  they sure do this poll is not an outlier  it s the second one showing secretary clinton with a monumental lead  as trump continues into the abyss  clinton is truly making the sky her limit this will only pay off if democrats and progressives alike get out and vote featured image via justin sullivan getty images
