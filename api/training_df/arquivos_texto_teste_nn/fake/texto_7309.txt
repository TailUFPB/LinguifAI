appearing on the the view thursday morning was none other than former republican presidential candidate dr  ben carson  he  of course  spoke of his time running for office and even joked that his first choice for president went out the window the day he dropped out  carson was then asked by the women of the show about his endorsement of donald trump  which  in all honesty  doesn t make any sense  and it was discovered last week that trump may have illegally offered him an advisory role in exchange for an endorsement whoopi goldberg didn t hold back at all and laid it all out on the table for carson  this guy he s a racist and he s not good for the country you re ben carson  you re so much better than this  carson then explained that because he  is better than this  he s capable of looking past the racism to the broader picture  which is the biggest load of bs i ve ever heard carson also said that we have to get away from the ruling class  and unfortunately it had to be explained to the sleepy doctor that trump is very much a part of the ruling class all in all  the ladies of the view  in particular  whoopi goldberg  tore trump a new one  and laid into carson for backing him watch here  and as per usual  trump proves that he cannot handle criticism  especially if it comes from women  he quickly took to his twitter account while the show was still airing to show everyone  once again  that he has the maturity level of a seven year old   theview t v  show  which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air  is constantly asking me to go on  i tell them  no   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    how the women on the view  which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left  ever got their jobs   abc is wasting time  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     the women of the view  while still on air  called him out on these tweets  and told him that they d love to have him on  but he s terrified they ll be mean to him and ask him tough questions  you see  trump only wants to be part of interviews where he can control the conversation and be adored by the media  being surrounded by strong  successful women interrogating him is pretty much his worst nightmare oh  and the view has been on for  years now and is doing just fine with or without trump as a guest  he s the last person to talk about a failing television show good on whoopi for calling both carson and trump out  carson on his hypocrisy and aversion to reality  and trump on his utter horseshit  well done featured image via video screen capture twitter
