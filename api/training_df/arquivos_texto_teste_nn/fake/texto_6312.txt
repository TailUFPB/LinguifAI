cnn is slowly slipping off the deep end into the pool of corporate approved fake news with their latest attack on larry wilmore  the comedian gave a bit of a roasting to cnn during the recent white house correspondents  dinner  which seemed to raise the ire of company executives  as retaliation towards wilmore they cancelled an upcoming may  appearance on don lemon s evening show that lemon himself set up with wilmore let s look at this in a very pragmatic context for a moment  larry wilmore made an absolutely huge buzz in the media when he stood on stage next to our first black president and said  yo  barry  you did it my nig a   there was nobody who wasn t talking about this  and having wilmore on his show to talk about all this would have been a huge win for lemon  with all this in mind  you can see how don lemon wouldn t have been the one who suddenly cancelled the appearance no  this was from the faceless executives at cnn who wanted to punish a comedian for taking some arguably light  if well deserved  pokes at their growing joke of a  news  network  there isn t anything wilmore said which was that serious and hasn t been said before about the network for years now cnn is here tonight  i ve been watching cnn a long time  yep  used to watch it back when it was a news network  i did  what  is it all cnn here tonight i don t know about you guys  but i can t get enough of that cnn countdown clock  now we can see exactly when they hit zero in the ratings source  washington posthe even had a little fun with don lemon personally  yet lemon still invited wilmore on his own show because he simply got the joke cnn s excuse for cancelling wilmore s appearance is that they had to handle the coverage of the indiana primaries  this was a poor excuse  because the indiana primaries already ended  hours before then  he was never given the offer for a rescheduling either it s a disturbing precedent to set  especially by one of the big three cable news outlets  corporate media is becoming more and more consolidated under fewer and fewer owners  if cnn s new policy is to punish individuals who are critical of their increasing bend towards fluff news and false equivalencies  then the last few crumbs of journalistic integrity the network has  as a whole  are about to go completely out the window featured image via wikicommons
