bernie sanders and his supporters just received some excellent news concerning the mix up that might have prevented his name from being on the ballot in washington  d c anita bonds  chairwoman of the washington  d c  democratic party told cnn that  bernie will be on the ballot  sanders  supporters were dismayed to hear that the democratic presidential candidate might not be on the ballot  on wednesday   washington reported that d c  democrats had failed to send sanders  campaign information to the d c  board of elections until one day after the registration was due headlines proclaiming that sanders may not be on the ballot in the upcoming d c  primary election may have given some of sanders  supporters heart attacks  however  sanders campaign did not seem to be concerned about the possibility of his name not being on the ballot come june   the day of d c s primary election  we did what the d c  law requires in order to get bernie on the ballot and we are confident he will be on the ballot   a spokesman with the sanders campaign said sanders campaign had already paid   in registration fees and gave his registration filings to the d c  democratic party earlier this month it turns out that the board of elections closes before the deadline  so it is common to turn in the registration filings the day after the deadline  this has been kind of a tradition in the district of columbia  that the party would notify the board the following day   bonds told cnn what s unusual about the potentially campaign dooming mix up  is that sanders was actually challenged on the matter  the challenge to sanders  campaign came from a voter who lives in d c  neither hillary clinton nor rocky de la fuente  who had also paid their registration fees on time  were challenged bonds is working to rectify the current situation  in addition to her position as the chairperson of the d c democratic party  she also serves on the city council  she plans to change the city s rules to include a  hour grace period after the registration deadline  that means sanders is safe while i am glad that everything has turned out okay  this time  i have to say that it might be time for d c  democratic party to find a new  tradition  concerning turning in campaign registration filings featured image   photo by andrew burton getty images
