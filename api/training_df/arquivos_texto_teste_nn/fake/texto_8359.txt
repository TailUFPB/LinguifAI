another republican has dropped out of the race  this time  it s  kentucky senator rand paul  in a released statement  paul said  it s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the white house  today  i will end where i began  ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty  the self  described libertarian ish  paul touted himself as an alternative to establishment republicans  marketing himself as a grassroots guy however  paul finished  place in the iowa caucuses and and although he was one of the first to announce his candidacy  his campaign never gained any traction  since the beginning of his candidacy  polls consistently showed paul in the back of the pack  paul always failed to break away from ben carson  donald trump  marco rubio  and even the lowly jeb bush paul struggled to raise money from both large and small donors  resulting in a cash strapped campaign that was never able to spend and then replenish through donors  whether big or small  his ideas of a non interventionist and non violent approach in u s  foreign policy apparently didn t sit well with republicans  ted cruz  the guy who plans on killing lots of folks  especially in the middle east  is the current front runner for the republican nomination featured image via wikimedia commons
