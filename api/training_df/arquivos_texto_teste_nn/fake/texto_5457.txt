the republican national convention starts this coming monday  and things are not looking good for the gop s biggest event for the next four years  the problem  of course  is their standard bearer  donald trump  many prominent republicans are staying as far away from the convention as possible  they are still about   million short of actually paying for the whole thing  and to top it all off  it seems that rnc chair reince priebus still can t get the  nevertrump delegates to fall in line behind trump  now  former presidential candidate jeb bush has become the latest to go on record saying that he is most definitely  nevertrump on friday  bush took his anti trump sentiments to the washington post  where he said that trump had tapped into anger and frustration in americans  they have given rise to the success of a candidate who continues to grotesquely manipulate the deeply felt anger of many americans  trump s abrasive  know nothing like nativist rhetoric has blocked out sober discourse about how to tackle america s big challenges  bush then continued to slam trump throughout the article  and cautioned fellow republican politicians about the tone of trump s campaign and the stain he was putting upon the party  he then went on to beg them to reintroduce civility  ideas and optimism back into politics  let s find ways to campaign and govern inclusively  let s find ways to ease the angst and fear of people  without cynically feeding it  he then went on to say that he would not be voting for either trump or clinton  but might go for libertarian candidate gary johnson  i haven t decided how i ll vote in november   whether i ll support the libertarian ticket or write in a candidate   but i do know there are a lot of things republicans can do in the coming months to lay the groundwork for rebuilding our party and the foundation for a true conservative renewal in our country  the only sort of compliment bush had for trump was his choice to choose indiana gov  mike pence for the   spot on the gop ticket  and it came via twitter mike pence is a good man  he will add value to the ticket   jeb bush   jebbush  july     that s something i guess  at the end of the day  good on jeb bush and the other  nevertrump republicans  we don t agree on much  but we do agree that donald trump is dangerously unfit to be president of the united states featured image via michael vadon wikimedia
