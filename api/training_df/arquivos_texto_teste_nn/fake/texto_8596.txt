there is arguably no other person in america who dislikes obamacare more than ted cruz  he is the guy who quite literally shut down the government in order to make an inane point about it  but even for cruz  his latest attempt to show america how much he doesn t like the affordable care act is pretty pathetic at a campaign rally  cruz told the crowd that he and his family currently don t have any health insurance because  blah blah obamacare  i ll tell you  you know who one of those millions of americans is who s lost their health care because of obamacare  that would be me   cruz told the audience at a campaign stop new hampshire on thursday evening   i don t have health care right now  talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face   i wouldn t advise taking that literally  ted  the hospital bills will be through the roof   cruz seems to have intentionally torpedoed his family s chance to get insurance so that he could tell conservative voters that obama cost him his healthcare you may recall that fox news spent months trying to dig up people who lost their health insurance because of the aca  cruz cited  millions   in all their searching they found only a few  those  it turned out  were mostly wrong about losing their health insurance  one by one they discovered that they either hadn t actually lost their insurance or their new plan was more affordable because of obamacare  they were simply ignorant of what they were meant to do to get a new policy  thanks  no doubt  to fox news and its relentless misinformation as think progress explains  cruz is in a similar situation  he didn t  lose  his health coverage  he just didn t sign up for a new policy in time cruz s family used to be covered through a ppo plan with bluecross blueshield of texas  but for   the insurer decided to eliminate ppo plans and move to offering only hmo plans on the individual marketplace  which is becoming a bigger trend in the insurance industry   the insurance company announced this decision last july the july announcement gave people enrolled in bluecross blueshield s plans a full five months to select a new hmo plan if they wanted to maintain coverage into the new year  ted cruz s family apparently just didn t sign up in time like the rest of america  cruz was expected to pick his new plan before the new year  the marketplace actually extended their deadlines in order to make it easier for busy families to find time to sign up  millions of americans managed to do so  in fact  more americans have health insurance today than at any other time in the country s history  just not ted cruz and his family after blaming obama  cruz hinted that his family aren t happy with him  he told the crowd  by the way  when you let your health insurance policy lapse  your wife gets really ticked at you   cruz said   it s not a good   i ve had  shall we say  some intense conversations with heidi on that  note that even cruz seems aware that he simply dropped the ball  he also admitted that he s currently signing up for insurance  which will begin in march  at most  this is a mere inconvenience  for many american families  a lapse in insurance can be a scary time  one slip on the ice or nasty illness and one s savings can evaporate  that s unlikely to happen with cruz  his wife  a former goldman sachs executive  and cruz  a senator  probably have enough money in the bank that any hospital bill can be taken care of even without insurance while cruz has consistently run on the idea that he will repeal obamacare  americans are growing to like it  healthcare in the united states is still an absolute mess  and more reforms need to be done to fully address the problems  but more people on insurance means less bankruptcies  healthier workers  and longer lives  you can t put a number on more time with a loved one who may have been saved with access to healthcare  but you can put a number on what these life changing opportunities are doing to the economy  obamacare was framed by republicans as a  job killer  and a deficit bomb   it s proven to be neither so stop complaining and sign up for health insurance  ted  then go apologize to your family for gambling with their health to take a dig at the president  that s just bad form feature image via gage skidmore flickr
