donald trump seems to love it when his rabid  racist followers attack black people at his rallies  for instance  last year when trump s supporters attacked a black man  calling him a  n gger  as they punched and kicked him  the  hopeful spoke out in support of the assault  declaring that  maybe he should have been roughed up  the donald  who has been known to tweet white supremacist propaganda and order police to remove african americans from his rallies even if they did nothing more than stand still  strives to maintain an authoritarian atmosphere at his rallies  even promising to pay for the legal defense of anyone who attacks protesters   black or otherwise   at his events at a rally in north carolina on wednesday  one trump fan took his fuhrer s words to heart  attacking an african american man who was in the process of leaving the event  the unnamed black man was just one of several protesters who nonviolently protested the racist gop frontrunner s speech  as the men leave  trump supporters can be seen doing their thing   namely  acting like f cking  ssholes  one of the african american men can be seen flipping  the bird  to the white faced trump supporters  one trumpfan walks to the end of a row  waits for an opening  and sucker punches one of the protesters the attack happens in full view of members of the security staff  who are escorting the men out  the logical thing would be to detain the attacker until police arrive  after all  this is clearly an unprovoked assault  but  as this is a trump rally  security instead throws the victim of the attack to the ground  completely ignoring the white man who assaulted him unfortunately  this is where we re at  we have a mainstream gop candidate who encourages acts of violence   specifically against african americans   and security officers who are willing to completely ignore any acts of violence committed by the faithful  no matter how clear cut they are watch this preview of a donald trump america below  and remember to vote blue in november featured image via screengrab
