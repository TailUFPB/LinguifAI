democratic national committee  dnc  chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has taken a lot of criticism over the way she has handled our party s primary  some democrats believe that she has grossly mishandled the current primary  so  of course  that s exactly what trevor noah wanted to talk about when she stopped by the daily show on monday noah started off by asking her if she was happy by how the race is being run between bernie and hillary  because  it seems like it s becoming nastier and nastier  as the it progresses  wasserman schultz responded that it is drama being caused by the media and i d have to agree  the democratic candidates have conducted themselves as presidential candidates should  which is vastly different than the insane republican race that has been filled with horrible attacks and hateful rhetoric  the chairwoman went on to say  from our standpoint  i want them debating every day and i bet my counterpart reince priebus wants  to debate never because to debate never  because every time they open their mouth  they do something to alienate somebody else  that is absolutely true after she finished discussing the gop field  noah hit her with the question many people want to know the answer to  a lot of people feel that bernie sanders   is being c ckblocked by the dnc  is there any merit to this  wasserman schultz answered  after the crowd s cheers died down  that she is not favoring either candidate  as powerful as that makes me feel  i m not doing a very good job of rigging the outcome or blocking anyone from being able to get their message out  the reality is that i have a job as national party chair that is one that requires a thick skin  it requires me to be able to absorb the body blows so our candidates can stay above the fray  not everyone would agree with this  a very large portion of the democratic party  both hillary and bernie supporters  are really pissed off at the way she has handled a number of things  especially our debate schedule  although she said earlier in the interview that she would like our candidates to debate every day  that isn t exactly true  the candidates had to lobby for more debates because she originally only scheduled six debates and most of them were held on the weekend when they would get very little coverage she is probably the least popular person within the democratic party right now and with good reason watch the entire interview below  including her discussion with noah about superdelegates featured image via screencapture
