because of donald trump  republicans are finally being forced to admit that their party is a racist haven that caters to whites only during an appearance on fox news sunday  longtime conservative columnist george will told host chris wallace that the republican party is now the party of white people and he specifically blamed gop frontrunner donald trump for it  trump is in the george wallace tradition   will said in reference to the staunch alabama segregationist who ran for president back in  and   will continued by saying that wallace said that  there s too much dignity in american politics  we have to have more meanness  will noted that unlike wallace  trump has support all of over the country  but pointed out problems trump and the republican party face  the problem is this  not only are his negatives at  percent   almost double his positives  they are at  percent   but he s appealing entirely to white people  will explained that appealing for white votes is not enough for any national candidate to win elections anymore unless they receive a ridiculous percentage of the vote and that candidates must receive a sizable percentage of votes from other ethnic groups as well if they want to achieve victory in  century america  mitt romney got  percent   that s all   of the non white vote  trump  by every measure  would do worse than that  which means he would not have to get just the  percent of the white vote to win that ronald reagan got  sweeping  states  he would have to get  percent of the white vote  a  it won t happen and b  it would destroy the republican party by making it the party of white people  here s the video via youtube indeed  trump s incendiary remarks about hispanics and muslims and the way his supporters have treated black protesters during rallies makes it highly unlikely he will capture many votes if any at all from those voting groups when president obama won a second term in   he did so with  percent of the hispanic vote and only less than half of eligible hispanic voters actually showed up to vote  trump s hateful comments toward the hispanic community make it more likely that that both percentages will rise in  to the benefit of the democratic candidate and not only did african americans have a higher turnout rate than white voters in    percent of them voted for president obama the outright racism of the gop in this election cycle could very well be enough to drive pissed off hispanics and african americans to the voting booth in droves  and that could spell doom for the gop  featured image via free wood post
