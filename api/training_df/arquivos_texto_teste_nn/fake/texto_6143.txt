we know that the bp deepwater horizon oil spill was one of the worst manmade disasters in history  scientists are still desperately studying the behavior of marine life in the region hoping to find clues as to better understand just how much harm bp caused the ecosystem in  that s why when a video showing a pod of orcas swimming very close to the mouth of the mississippi river off the coast of louisiana  scientists started paying attention  whales have never before been seen swimming in the area  while orcas do enjoy coastal waters  they prefer to stay in colder waters the video was captured by a fishing group  who sent the footage to local news station wwltv  dr  moby solangi  who is the president and executive director of the institute for marine mammal studies  told wwltv  this is really an amazing story that you have told  we have not heard about this before   dr  solangi then on went to say that   that is concerning  you know  it s when these animals start showing signs of change  we need to pay attention  in the video  which is embedded below  it is mentioned that there was another recent example of large marine life exhibiting bizarre behavior  just two months ago  a group of young pygmy whales was found beached in mississippi  hundreds of miles away from their normal habitat when asked about what role the bp spill may have had in these incidents  dr  solangi responded  saying  that certainly disrupted their habitat  there s no question  these are top predators and if they re moving somewhere  something may be going on  what s even more disturbing about this is the revelation that bp is facing very few consequences for the marine armageddon they unleashed  in april  it was reported that bp will have to pay   billion dollars in a settlement for the disaster   though  since we currently live in an age where corporations can get away with just about anything  bp is able to deduct more than   billion dollars of the settlement expenses in tax breaks scientists are hard at work trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the gulf region  this bizarre whale migration may just be the thing that points scientists in the right direction you can watch the video below featured image from video screenshot featured image from video screenshot
