fox news continues to outdo itself for its incompetent so called journalism  a fox news host said that bernie sanders is basically a communist for wanting free college tuition for young americans  while the host has no clue to what a communist is  what the host said about millions of americans was the true insult in a startling display of disdain for middle and lower income americans  fox host gretchen carlson said that if rich kids get to go to school on their parents  dime  then it s because  their parents worked incredibly hard   where he said  you know  poor people should be able to go to college free  like rich kids  free   if that s actually true  quite possibly their parents worked incredibly hard to be able to pay for them  the full ride to go to college  what her silly statement implies is that parents of kids who can t afford to send them to college without assistance means that they are not hard workers  the shear arrogance is striking  how much money a person makes is not indicative of whether he she works hard  the shear stupidity coupled with arrogance is very disturbing  it s puzzling how such people can have a platform on television the host also went on to demean younger generations for supporting bernie sanders  alarmed by the overwhelming support sanders has received from young voters  carlson dismisses them as lacking an understanding in what she believed were sanders  communist policies  she said   we have fought wars  men and women have died in this country to fight against communism and many of these same principles  quite honestly   katherine  i mean  it s astounding  the more these people continue to spew such nonsense  the more obvious it is why sanders has enormous popular appeal to americans  it s time to give the american dream back to everyone and not a select few watch here  featured image via screen capture
