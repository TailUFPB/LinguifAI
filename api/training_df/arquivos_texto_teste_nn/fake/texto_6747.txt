conservative website the federalist often bills itself as the respectable  serious alternative to many of the toxic right wing watering holes that proliferate online  but every so often their true colors shine through  guess what  they can be just as awful federalist writer henry scanlon was ogling some young women at this year s cpac and came to the conclusion that the women who share his views on limited government and ayn rand are  incredibly attractive   whereas the women on the left are manly  what follows   in a   word screed   goes from delusional to offensive to just plain pathetic almost at every paragraph  it s a stunningly offensive piece of fantasy that manages to demean liberal women and condescend to conservative ones in the very same breath here s what scanlon  a middle aged married man  says he noticed at cpac the young women who attend cpac are spectacular  no kidding  what s up with this concentration of incredibly attractive young  conservative women  it s noticeable and remarkable  they are beautiful and stylish in the way french women often are  which is to say in their own way  not in a conforming or predictable way  they all look like the girl the high school quarterback wants to date  and they are confident  relaxed  and smart  joking amongst themselves could it be that they were joking amongst themselves about the creepy old guy staring at them from across the convention hall  just a thought scanlon has two theories as to why conservative women are attractive  his own is based in science  the other  what he calls  a woman s explanation  is about french fashion  his  scientific    and let s use that word loosely here   explanation is that young women who dare read ayn rand despite the evil mainstream media demonizing the libertarian movement makes them  the prettiest  smartest girls  because they have an inner confidence his wife  providing the  women s perspective   said it was because conservative women don t act like boys  which is ugly  instead  she says  they are willing to take fashion risks  just like trendsetters in paris scanlon also surmises that women on the right are more beautiful because being  politically correct  gives women wrinkles women of the right are allowed to accept obvious things rather than engage in exhausting psychic gymnastics to get to a place that is politically correct  while preposterous  if a thug murders a pregnant woman  he should be charged with two murders  not just one  and women of the right feel no compulsion to weary themselves by filing amicus briefs on behalf of the murderer to nullify the second killing because the unborn baby does not qualify as human life he concludes that conservative women are just  freer   in ideology  if not in  say  the right to decide what happens to their bodies  and that inner beauty makes them outwardly beautiful as well  and this being the federalist  scanlon attributes that to god favoring registered republicans put another way  maybe what i m noticing is simply women who have been liberated by their worldview to be who they are  uniquely and confidently  unabashedly and apologetically  unencumbered by the politically correct constraints imposed on women of the left  and the result is a kind of essential womanhood that  far from being oppressive  as the left would have it  is instead  miraculous and quintessential  and  you could say  god given bravo  henry scanlon  you ve managed to reduce women to either being ugly  oppressed liberals or angelic eye candy right wing men can salivate over at conservative conventions  it s no small wonder why the republican party has had an incredibly difficult time appealing to women in this election featured image via fox
