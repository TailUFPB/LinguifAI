like rolling stone before them  gq magazine is hailing president obama as one of the greatest presidents of our time  calling him   dollar bill  great and  mount rushmore  great  gq s jim nelson puts it plainly something is dawning on us it s almost too soon for us to admit  but it s there  a half considered thought only now blooming in our brains  maybe we dismiss it with one of those quick cognitive fly swats  nah  too early to say or i hate that guy  but the truth is coming  and it sounds like this  barack obama will be inducted into the league of great presidents in fact  nelson is so confident that president obama will be remembered as one of greatest presidents  that he predicts  in due time  obama will overtake clinton as the best one since fdr now that s a lot of confidence  but how can nelson be certain of such a grand prediction  it s really  really simple  he got stuff done  he helped save the world and united states  economy  he signed into law obamacare  his character was paramount in the face of unprecedented obstruction  and yes  he is the first black president  but there was one special  electrifying quality that president obama gave us that the best of best have given us  his speeches  his ability to communicate and relate to the average american was unlike any other with obama  each thoughtful step of the way  from his soaring acceptance speech   the road ahead will be long  our climb will be steep   to his epic speeches on race and religion  his responses to the shootings in tucson and newtown  the killing of osama bin laden  the opening of cuba   todos somos americanos    and countless other momentous occasions  he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate any angels with his mesmerizing clout  president obama was able to do what other before him   like lbj  clinton and fdr   did  and that was get things done  in an era when  getting things done  is a thing too often out of reach  president obama overcame the odds i agree completely with gq   president obama is one of the nation s finest presidents  and history will be very kind to him  as it should be photo by joshua lott getty images
