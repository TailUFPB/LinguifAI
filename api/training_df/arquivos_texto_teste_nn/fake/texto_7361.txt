republican presidential frontrunner donald trump is never at a loss for words  as the world is still in shock and reeling from news of the terrorist bombings in brussels tuesday morning  the business mogul didn t hesitate to make truly despicable remarks about the attacks on twitter  as well as insult president barack obama s historic trip to havana  cuba in an interview with fox business host maria bartiromo  trump used the terrorist attacks to imply that obama s cuba visit may correspond with setting up a little area in cuba for the muslim population   trump also said the bombings were a sure sign that if the united states doesn t secure its border  it is going to lead to just catastrophic problems   the disgraced candidate actually had the nerve to say that a big part of the reason he has been  leading on the republican side by a lot  was because of his racist  offensively strong position on building walls and controlling the border fox news was more than happy to follow trump on his criticisms of obama  with bartiromo noting that it was  interesting  that the president would be speaking at a press conference during his last day in cuba  she said  isn t it interesting that now we understand that president obama will give a live press conference later on today  he s probably going to discuss the terrorist attack from the brutal communist dictatorship of cuba  so  what irony that is  trump jumped in and asked  i wonder how many muslims cuba is taking in every year  i wonder if they re setting up a little area in cuba for the muslim population  bartiromo moved right on through the interview  without even clarifying with trump just why he would connect muslim camps in cuba to the president s visit  you can watch the video of trump s disrespectful comments below now  the fact that trump is making inflammatory remarks about muslims is no surprise as he has been expressing anti islamic sentiments throughout his entire campaign  however  his remarks about obama have different implications considering that trump has become infamous for his claims that obama was not born in america  and therefore should not be president  trump started his own birther movement surrounding those claims  insisting that the president show his long form birth certificate despite the overwhelming evidence that obama was indeed an american citizen  trump has also criticized obama for making a speech at an american mosque  saying  maybe he feels comfortable there  just yesterday  trump celebrated the fact that it was obama s final year with a big  yay   while he spoke at the aipac conference  on the same day  trump said obama was the  worst thing to ever happen to israel  during a town hall  it s becoming clear that trump is now hell bent on destroying obama s image  despite the fact that the president has undoubtedly improved america and our relations with other countries featured image via gage skidmore
