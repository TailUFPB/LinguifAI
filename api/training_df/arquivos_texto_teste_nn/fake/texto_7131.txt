less than two weeks before his father used a shotgun to end his life  amir issa posted a heartbreaking cry for help to his facebook wall on march     the  year old resident of los angeles wrote that he felt as if his mother  father and other family members were controlling his every waking moment he also wrote i was earning over   by age  and this has negatively impacted my life  made me live in pain and become unemployed  if there is a devil or evil spirit  i truly believe it manifests itself in my family later in the same post  he wrote they have literally robbed my bank account  lied to courts and doctor  to try and label me as mentally ill  and failed in their attempts to have me falsely imprisoned and evicted  if there are any good people on this earth  please help free me from this inhumane slavery just ten days later  on march   his father murdered him and his mother  issa s body was found outside the family home  according to police  he was gunned down with a shotgun his mother s body was found in the bathroom  she died of multiple stab wounds the l a  county district attorney s office called the shooting a hate crime  according to new york daily news issa s father had previously threatened to kill him for being gay a video posted to his facebook wall shows his father calling him a pervert and saying that he should be castrated shehada khalil issa is being held in the los angeles county jail on a     bond this tragedy should have never happened the death of amir issa is a heartbreaking reminder of the silent suffering of lgbt men  women and youth posts on his facebook page indicate the family were members of the seventh day adventist church on its website  the church states its official position regarding lgbt citizens  saying  the bible makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships   sexual acts outside the circle of a heterosexual marriage are forbidden for these reasons seventh day adventists are opposed to homosexual practices and relationships  amir issa wrote on facebook   i want to open my eyes lord  i want to see jesus   he went on to say he  would like to have a family that attends church regularly   but one that  doesn t punish my thoughts or actions if i am a good person which i know i am  from his posts  it appears that amir issa was murdered by his own father at least in part because of  these fanatical religious beliefs although he sent out a cry for help just ten days before he died  like those of so many other members of the lgbt community  his call for help went unanswered too often members of the lgbt community are isolated and alone  the isolation makes them more vulnerable to violence and exploitation  often perpetrated by physically  emotionally and mentally abusive family members things might have turned out much differently for amir issa if only someone had reached out to him ten days before  when he wrote the words  if there are any good people on this earth  please help free me from this inhumane slavery  it s too late now  for good people to reach out to amir issa but it s not too late to reach out to someone else in the lgbt community it s definitely not too late for our society to demand inclusion  knowing that exclusion leaves people isolated and vulnerable  making them easy targets for violence and abuse as republicans across the country attempt to pass laws excluding lgbt people from society  it is up to the  good people on this earth  to stand up and say no here s more on this story from the new york daily news  featured image via video screen capture via new york daily news
