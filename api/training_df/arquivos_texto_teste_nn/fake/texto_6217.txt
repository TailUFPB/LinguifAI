if you haven t heard about the ongoing battle between donald trump and elizabeth warren then you re clearly living under a rock  or possibly a newborn baby  they ve been going back and forth on twitter  in speeches  and every time he tries to call her  goofy  or  pocahontas   because he s apparently five years old  she smacks him down harder and harder during her commencement address at suffolk university this past weekend  warren went after him yet again taking a brilliant dig  because let s face it  she s brilliant  warren said  how s this speech polling so far  higher or lower than donald trump s unfavorable numbers with women  if you weren t aware  trump isn t doing so well with women  polling at   unfavorable  but can we be all that surprised  he s very misogynistic  constantly calling women names  and him going after warren and then hillary clinton for actually being a woman  is just another example of that something tells me warren isn t about to let up any time soon  trump can try his name calling games  but when it comes to strong women who have had to fight twice as hard to get half as much recognition their whole lives  he s in for a big surprise  those games may work on weak republican men  but just you wait  just  you  wait watch her whole speech here featured image via video screen capture
