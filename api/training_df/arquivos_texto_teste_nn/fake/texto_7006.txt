it is a violation of federal election laws to use campaign funds to pay for personal expenses  but that s exactly what california rep  duncan hunter has been busted for doing according to the san diego union tribune campaign finance reports show    in such charges during  alone     in travel     to hunter s children s school in el cajon     for video games and    paid to an oral and facial surgeon the forms list only one personal expense that was actually paid back by hunter     on oct    with no indication of which personal expense was being reimbursed  none of the other outstanding charges were listed as repaid  or as an ongoing debt to the campaign for the year end accounting so it s hard to believe that hunter will actually pay back the funds he and his family have stolen to enrich themselves like he said he would do in a statement  there was no taxpayer money involved  and i take full responsibility  hunter said before claiming that he s  going to pay everything back by tomorrow morning  with interest  hunter has been a member of the house of representatives since   and it didn t take long before he and his family started personally gaining financially off campaign funds even his own wife gets paid    a month as his supposed campaign manager and hunter clearly knows that he has been breaking the law all this time even though he lamely blamed the video game charges on his own son despite admitting that he and his wife are the only ones who had a campaign credit card the tribune reports that  a    payment on sept   to christian unified schools   where hunter s three children attend   was listed as a  personal expense   to be paid back  on hunter s form for the period ending dec    hunter literally listed a payment as a  personal expense   which provides all the evidence the federal election commission needs to throw the book at him this is yet another example of the hypocrisy republicans have demonstrated  for years  the gop has attacked food stamp recipients of living on the dole  meanwhile  a republican like hunter uses campaign funds to pay for lavish personal expenses instead of using his own bank account  the difference is that food stamp recipients actually need food stamps to put food on the table  that s not laziness  it s survival  what hunter is doing on the other hand  is laziness and theft and not only should he be forced to pay back every cent  he should be forced to resign featured image  youtube
