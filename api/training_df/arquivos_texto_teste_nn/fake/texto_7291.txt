despite how much the national rifle association  nra  would like everyone to believe that they are doing their best to educate and protect children against gun violence  the pro gun organization s latest stunt is pretty puzzling nra family has recently released a pair of children s stories   but added its very own special twist  recreating children s fairy tales like little red riding hood and hansel and gretel  the nra has taken it upon itself to rewrite the stories and give their heroes guns to defeat their enemies  after all  hasn t everyone wondered at some point or another what would have happened to little red riding hood if only her grandmother had been armed with a shotgun  finally  this burning question has been answered little red riding hood   nra familyin the recreated version of little red riding hood  has a gun   the big bad wolf finds himself out of luck because little red has a rifle  he gives up and tries to eat grandma instead  but finds himself in the same predicament because she s also packing heat  here s a snippet of what the fairy tale looks like with the nra s special trigger happy touch  what big teeth you have   grandma said  as his fierce jaws came near  the better to eat you with   the wolf threatened the wolf leaned in  jaws open wide  then stopped suddenly  those big ears heard the unmistakable sound of a shotgun s safety being clicked off  those big eyes looked down and saw that grandma had a scattergun aimed right at him  he realized that grandmother hadn t been backing away from him  she had been moving towards her shotgun to protect herself and her home hansel and gretal   nra familythe story of hansel and gretel  have guns  isn t much better  in this adapted classic  hansel and gretal avoid danger because their parents taught them how to use guns  gretel is not only able to hunt down a  point buck  but the pair is able to rescue the children being held captive in the witch s cottage   all because they re armed these revamped children s tales certainly send the wrong message to kids  and hopefully parents will be smart enough to know that  time and time again  we see that when guns get into the hands of children   even when they have been taught how to use firearms  things usually go terribly wrong but the nra has consistently proven that it doesn t know what s right for children   and the organization just doesn t care  the gun friendly organization continues to promote its eddie eagle gunsafe  program  an initiative to help educate kids and prevent accidental gun deaths  it has been proven extremely ineffective several times  but the nra refuses to actually do something that will really protect children   like support gun control  the association has consistently opposed and resisted any attempt the obama administration has tried to make toward gun reform  even as mass shootings have become more common than ever this is an organization that does not care about america s youth  and these rewritten stories prove it  these revised tales will only make kids want to use guns more  and offer zero education about the dangers and seriousness of handling firearms featured image via nrafamily org
