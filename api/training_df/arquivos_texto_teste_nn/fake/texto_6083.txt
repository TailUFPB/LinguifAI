it s no secret that sean hannity is one of donald trump s biggest bootlickers  following trump s most recent press conference  in which he slammed the media and even called abc reporter tom llamas  a sleaze  to his face  hannity spoke with trump about the so called  liberal media   and what they ve been doing to the poor guy during the back and forth  hannity is so far up trump s rear that this can hardly be called an interview   hannity demonstrated his complete ignorance of the media s coverage of the donald s veterans fundraiser by asking  do they think you need the money  do they think you re gonna steal it  yes  and yes  that s the whole issue right there  apparently  hannity hasn t been paying attention or he d have known not to ask that question first of all  trump s campaign is hardly self funded and is low on money  he had to have known his  self funding  scheme couldn t last forever  we re also talking about the liar of liars here   who in their right mind wouldn t be suspicious when money goes missing in addition to the campaign s financial woes  the washington post contacted every one of the  charities that trump listed as beneficiaries of his largesse  back in march  to find out what had happened to that   million that he said he raised  they could only account for   million of it there was also sandra miniutti  the vice president of charity navigator  who said that it s not uncommon for some fundraisers to vet beneficiaries after the fact  such as when they re raising funds in times of emergency  that makes sense  because they need to work quickly under those circumstances  raising the money and then vetting potential beneficiaries is the fastest way to do it miniutti also said  though  that it was fair to question why it was taking so long to distribute the money  trump already had a list of potential beneficiaries ready  and his fundraiser was ridiculously public  his groups should have been vetted beforehand furthermore  trump received heavy criticism from some veterans groups who were angry at him for using them as a political stunt  and who were angry because they hadn t yet received the money they were promised  it wasn t just the press that was trying to figure this out  hannity  however  has his blinders firmly in place and is likely blissfully unaware that he just made the  liberal media s  case for them watch the whole debacle of an interview below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
