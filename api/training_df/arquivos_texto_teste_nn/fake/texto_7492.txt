donald trump is a liar  not the kind of lies that qualify as little white lies or harmless little fibs  he doesn t just exaggerate a little or embellish his stories  no  donald trump qualifies for full pants on fire status  a recent study of nearly  hours of campaign footage by politico found that the donald lies on average every five minutes  go ahead and read that again and take it in for all it s worth  donald trump tells a bald faced lie every five minutes he s at a podium his followers eat it up  whether he s inventing numbers about trade deficits  creating success stories that definitely never actually happened to him or defending his bankruptcies  out of court settlements and failed business ventures  donald trump truly personifies the old adage that you can tell if he s lying if his lips are moving  politico stated we chronicled   hours of stump speeches and press conferences  from a rally in concord  n c   on monday to a rally on friday in st  louis the result  more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations  exaggerations  or simply false   the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories  or made the whole thing worthy of the spike  it equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average they also produced a video of some of those lies   captioned with the truth   for your viewing pleasure how anyone can take this buffoon seriously is a mystery  while most republicans are well known for blaming the problems they and their party created for our country on democrats  specifically president obama  trump is content to lie when the truth goes better  for example  we have a   billion trade deficit with china  which trump has repeatedly exaggerated to   billion  is that extra   billion really that important  most middle and working class americans struggle to keep   in the bank  donald    billion more than makes the point another fan favorite is the ever benevolent trump and his  self funded  campaign  trump has passed the   million mark on donations from people who hit the big blue  donate  button on his website  and the bulk of his  self funding  comes in the form of a    million loan from donald j trump  that loan can be repaid anytime up until shortly after his campaign ends  trump s actual personal contributions total a little over   that s how good  christians  like donald trump operate  they hide behind lies  the truth that they are corporate lackeys looking to better their personal portfolios and secure a future for old  white  male america isn t so easy to campaign on  so they conjure a truth that fits their dialogue  in trump s case  the truth is far more frightening than most  if not all  republicans who have come before him  he wants the presidency so he can enjoy the pinnacle of power and blow things up not exactly a good enough reason to hand a lunatic the nuclear football but hey  you can t blame a megalomaniac for trying featured image from gage skidmore
