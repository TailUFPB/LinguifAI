special counsel robert mueller s anti trump witch hunt is dead  even if he doesn t realize it  while his investigation stumbles onward  with life support provided by the biased media  from a legal perspective the viability of any criminal case that mueller could possibly bring has been effectively gutted thanks to the news  suppressed for months by mueller s team  that the fbi s  key agent  in both the russia investigation and the clinton email probe was an ardent hillary supporter with an anti trump bias under federal law  a prosecutor is required  to disclose exculpatory and impeachment information to criminal defendants and to seek a just result in every case   specifically  pursuant to giglio v  united states as a result  in any prosecution brought by mueller against a republican target  defense counsel would be entitled under the constitution to all evidence in the government s possession relevant to exploring the apparent biases of fbi agent peter strzok and his animosity toward trump and the republican party  this  in and of itself  could be a case killer because it is very unlikely that mueller or the doj would want defense counsel poring through all the records and documents  emails  and texts in the doj s and strzok s possession revealing the agent s biases since this could fatally undermine any other cases or investigations the agent has worked on such as the fbi s decision to recommend charging general flynn with lying to federal agents even though hillary clinton s besties  cheryl mills and huma abedin  were given a free pass despite apparently doing the same thing significantly  the fatal damage done to mueller s anti trump investigation does not only rest in the fact that defense counsel will be able to conduct an unlubricated prostate examination on the fbi s key agent at trial  instead  the real reason why mueller will not risk a criminal trial is the lasting damage that would be done to the fbi s reputation by having strzok s baggage brought into the daylight for example  jim jordan skewered chris wray today on the peter strzok angle of investigation this is just the tip of the iceberg on what could be brought forward on this weasel remember that strzok played a key roll in  analyzing  the trump dossier  let s remember a couple of things about the dossier   he said   the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign  which we now know were one and the same  paid the law firm who paid fusion gps who paid christopher steele who then paid russians to put together a report that we call a dossier full of all kinds of fake news  national enquirer garbage and it s been reported that this dossier was all dressed up by the fbi  taken to the fisa court and presented as a legitimate intelligence document   that it became the basis for a warrant to spy on americans    the easiest way to clear it up is tell us what s in that application and who took it there   jordan said  jordan finished with this   here s what i think   i think peter strozk   mr  super agent at the fbi  i think he s the guy who took the application to the fisa court and if that happened  if this happened  if you have the fbi working with a campaign  the democrats  campaign  taking opposition research  dressing it all up and turning it into an intelligence document so they can take it to the fisa court so they can spy on the other campaign  if that happened  that is as wrong as it gets  james rosen has this kabooooom    mueller investigation crumbles   first strzok and paige then weissmann  then rhee and now bruce ohr busted w  both hands in the fake trump dossier cookie jar    firemueller  shutitdown investigating the investigators pic twitter com    stock monster    stockmonstervip  december    more  daily caller
