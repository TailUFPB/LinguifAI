sean spicer was asked during a washington post interview   which white house reporters  did good work   he was able to rattle off eight names and then said   i m missing a bunch  for sure  spicer was then asked if he forgot to include anyone from cnn who did good work during his time in the white house you knew this was coming spicer gave the best answer ever oh  no   we have to agree that the cnn correspondents have had it out for president trump from day one  this is also  a dig at  combative wh correspondent jim acosta  how could we forget the exchanges with acosta  a bulldog cnn s jim acosta keeps trolling president trump and keeps making a total fool of himself  the latest moment was after signing a trade bill when acosta asked why the president didn t hold a press conference trump s response is priceless president trump to  acosta   i like real news  not fake news  you re fake news   https   t co tssgvnyuct pic twitter com   cspan   cspan  august    this jim acosta moment we wish president trump could clone senior advisor stephen miller  he s so brilliant and knows immigration like no other  we can t say the same for the white house press corp  the trump administration made some positive announcements on immigration and the left went nuts  miller got the best of them another great takedown fox news reported trump and acosta have famously traded jabs since the president called acosta  fake news  during a press conference earlier this year  if spicer was going to compliment anyone from cnn  it would presumably have been the reporter he dealt with on a regular basis   but the former press secretary failed to mention acosta when he had the chance acosta comes off as combative toward the white house on a regular basis and some insiders feel his grandstanding was one reason press briefings weren t televised over an extended period this summer  in addition to trump and spicer  acosta sparred with white house adviser stephen miller last month over the administration s immigration policy  miller famously accused the cnn reporter of having a  cosmopolitan bias
