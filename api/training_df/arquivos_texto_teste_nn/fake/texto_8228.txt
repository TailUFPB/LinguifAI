bernie sanders just won the new hampshire primary race  the candidate that was once written off as a protest candidate  that would only be successful in pushing hillary clinton to the left  has won one of the first primary elections in the nation  at the time this was written  bernie sanders has   percent of the vote with clinton at  percent  that isn t particularly surprising  seeing as sanders has long held a massive lead in the polls over clinton in that state this comes after a close caucus election in iowa  bernie sanders ultimately lost that election  though it was virtually a tie https   www facebook com berniesanders photos a      type  theatersanders supporters should be feeling the bern harder than they ever have at this moment  though that feeling must ultimately transform into action  if they wish to bypass clinton s firewall that is the nevada caucus and south carolina primary  the only thing for sure at this point is that the democratic primary battle is going to be a long  tight race on the republican side  donald trump has won the new hampshire primary  i guess racism and sexism still sells in parts of new england  what is somewhat interesting  is that john kasich  a man whose candidacy has been anything but interesting  appears to have taken second place  with the anemic jeb bush taking third  cruz  the winner of the iowa caucus took fourth place  the rubiobot seems to be malfunctioning  as he took fifth place trump may be riding high now though it remains to be seen if he can maintain his momentum  one thing is for sure  should he be the eventual republican nominee  it will be fun to watch sanders or clinton mop the floor with him in the general election  then again  that is true for any of the other gop candidates featured image from phil roeder via flickr
