bernie sanders just received a major endorsement in nevada  the clark county black caucus announced on thursday that they have decided to endorse sanders in the democratic primary race  this comes just before the nevada caucuses are held on saturday so cool rt  dammitpete   yvettebwilliams  djshakespeare  ccdbc  berniesanders  feelthebern pic twitter com wgwbtkewxo  yvette b  williams   yvettebwilliams  february    gives  ccdbc a shout out for ccbc endorsement  we believe in you   new deal for america   feelthebern pic twitter com   ccbc nv black caucus   ccdbc  february    county is the largest county in nevada  with both sanders and hillary clinton working overtime to win over minority voters  this is a huge win for sanders  sanders has not polled as favorably among black voters as clinton has in the past the endorsement that came from the ccdc shows just how far sanders has come in the past few months  yvette williams  chairwoman of the caucus said that the endorsement   wasn t a very difficult decision  the ccbc released a statement which in which williams wrote that while clinton is qualified  their choice to for who they want to be the next president of the united states is sanders  williams writes  with continuing unemployment disproportionately impacting black nevadans  over representation in prisons and the justice system  low performing schools  and lack of economic opportunity  we are looking for a president that will dismantle broken systems  and provide access to a new deal  a leader that will fight for wealth and racial equality  quality universal healthcare and lower prescription costs  debt free college education  jobs for american workers  restore and protect voting rights  and work to end racial injustice  your commitment to getting big money out of politics and restoring our government back to its people is an important concern of ccbc members  clinton once held a substantial lead over sanders in nevada  that lead is gone as polls show the two candidates tied in a dead heat  endorsements from black intellectuals such as michelle alexander and ta nehisi coates  albeit tacit ones  have helped to shine a light on sanders  record for standing up for civil rights  they along with a strong backlash against several failed attempts by people to try and smear sanders  record  have helped the candidate a win in nevada would be a major boost to the sanders campaign  sanders lost to clinton in iowa by a hair  in what was a virtual tie  that coupled with a landslide win in new hampshire and a win in nevada would make sanders the clear front runner of in the democratic primary  that might change once again when it comes time for the south carolina primary  featured image from gage skidmore   via wikimedia commons
