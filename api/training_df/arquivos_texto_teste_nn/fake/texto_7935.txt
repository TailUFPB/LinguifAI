donald trump s candidacy would not have happened if fox   friends hadn t encouraged it all these years  and newt gingrich reminded the hosts of the show of that fact on monday during the appearance  fox hosts steve doocey and brian kilmeade mentioned to the former house speaker that donald trump is the gop establishment s worst nightmare because he s a billionaire who  is spending the least amount of money and running away with this thing  in response  gingrich pointed out that it was fox news that created the trump candidacy in the first place  that s because of you guys  donald trump gets up in the morning  tweets to the entire planet at no cost  picks up the phone  calls you  has a great conversation for about eight minutes   which would have cost him a ton in commercial money  and meanwhile  his opponents are all out there trying to raise the money to run an ad  indeed  former republican candidate jeb bush raised and spent millions of dollars but never could take down trump  eventually dropping out after the south carolina primary because of that failure trump  on the other hand  has been all over the media getting free coverage  look  you can say that trump is the candidate fox   friends invented   gingrich continued   he was on your show more than any other show  here s the video via youtube but the monster fox news created has also come back to haunt them  ever since that first gop debate  trump has taken repeated shots at the conservative network for being unfair  he has even said that fox  is so biased it is disgusting  in short  while some at fox are bragging that they helped shake up the gop by helping trump rise as a gop contender  some are probably regretting that because trump is destroying fox news is the process featured image  flickr
