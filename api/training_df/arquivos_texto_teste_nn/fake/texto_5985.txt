how damaging is donald trump  just ask the republican national committee  they ve lost out on a lucrative advertising deal with buzzfeed because trump is offensive  media outlets need advertising dollars to function  so the fact that buzzfeed would give up any ad money at all  just to stand on principle  says a lot about how awful trump really is  the rnc has to be smarting from that their response to this is as weak and watery as their reluctant decision to accept trump as their nominee and standard bearer  according to cnn  the rnc s chief strategist and spokesman  sean spicer  said  space was reserved on many platforms  but we never intended to use buzzfeed  it is ironic that they have not ruled out taking money from a candidate currently under investigation by the fbi  excuses  excuses  it s like they re back in kindergarten and saying   i didn t want to be your friend anyway   in order to save face  and by all means  invoke the investigation into hillary s email server to smear buzzfeed and deflect attention from the real problem  which is trump  that just compounds the flimsiness of their response earlier on monday  buzzfeed ceo jonah peretti explained in a letter that they won t accept trump ads because trump is dangerous  he compared trump ads to cigarette ads  saying that they don t run cigarette ads for that same reason  they don t want to be seen as endorsing something that s fundamentally bad for them and for us peretti is especially concerned about trump wanting to limit freedom of the press  ban muslims and get rid of immigrants  the trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the united states and around the world and in some cases  such as his proposed ban on international travel for muslims  would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs  they do intend to continue covering trump  though  and their coverage is brutal enough for him to specifically target them at rallies and elsewhere  the rnc  though  doesn t want to look like they re sucking on sour grapes over this  but they can t avoid it now  such a shame   our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them featured image by alex wong getty images
