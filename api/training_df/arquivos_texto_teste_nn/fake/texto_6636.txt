one of the most tragic aspects of donald trump s candidacy  and there have been lots of  tragic aspects  is that he s managed to do something no one thought to be possible for a candidate running for president in  century america  he s managed to not only normalize racism  but violence as well  there have been so many instances of violence that they ve become normalized  in other words  we ve come to expect violence  and even more alarmingly  we ve also come to accept the violence  however  it s important to fight this normalization and continue to report on the absurdity that is donald trump that absurdity was on display outside a trump rally in california on thursday as supporters clashed with protestors  many of the anti trump protestors held mexican and american flags and were outraged at trump s rhetoric  about  protesters out of hundreds were arrested outside of the rally  a trump supporter was beaten  and property was damaged including a police vehicle watch video here since he declared his candidacy for the republican nomination  trump has made a series of inflammatory remarks about mexicans  calling some of the immigrants rapists and murderers  he continuously talks about building a wall to prevent mexican immigrants from coming into the country  his rhetoric has created a divisive atmosphere that has bred racism and violence the bottom line is that trump has created an environment that is tearing the country apart rather than working for unity  if his candidacy is any indication of what his presidency will be like  we are all in deep trouble as a society  he is normalizing the toxicity of violence and racism and should he be elected  america will become a very dangerous place for a lot of people featured image via video screenshot
