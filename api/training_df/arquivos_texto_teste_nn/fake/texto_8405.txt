glenn beck is a paranoid lunatic  and he has just done one more thing to further cement that idea  beck announced on the friday edition of his show that his staff is  on his orders  preparing to move his entire broadcasting network out of the country  why  because this idiot thinks that the america that we all know and love is on the brink of collapse  and when that collapse comes  the new government will silence him  beck told his equally idiotic followers  we have to pick up our pace on finding another place to broadcast  i need to know if i can get to jerusalem  where they won t shut this down and we can be able to broadcast into the united states  this could end quickly  the worst part of all of this is that this announcement came after an audience member asked what she could do to prepare her family for the coming apocalypse  she has already relocated from california to texas   on beck s lunatic suggestion  she has also followed more of beck s terrible advice  and is reading the left behind series to her children  which warns of coming worldwide disaster as if all of that is not bad enough  beck s child was present during these doomsday prepper declarations  and of course was alarmed  instead of comforting her and anyone else who might be rightfully disturbed by these ideas  beck says that today s children should be warned as well because they re the giants that are going to fix this  they have to know   he went on to warn that reading left behind is important because  they have to know that this might be the time   you have an army on earth now that says they are the army of the antichrist  they are the army of armageddon  this is about as irresponsible as it gets  and beck doesn t seem to be slowing down this crazy train anytime soon watch the insanity below  via right wing watch featured image from screen capture via right wing watch
