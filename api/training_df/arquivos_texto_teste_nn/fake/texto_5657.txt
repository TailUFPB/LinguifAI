donald trump s anti muslim rhetoric has been the focal point of his campaign  and he is showing no signs of stopping that trend at all  further   he has stirred it up in his ignorant supporters  and they are lapping it up  one woman at trump s new hampshire rally on thursday  though  took it to a new level when she told trump that he should fire tsa workers on the basis of their muslim faith  the way she made this statement  though  was stunningly ignorant   though nobody should really be surprised at the ignorance of any trump supporter at this point the woman stood up and first thanked trump for his helping veterans  this lady really needs to get her information elsewhere  seriously   and then said to trump  get rid of all these hibi jabis they wear at tsa  i ve seen them myself  instead of correcting this lady s ignorant  offensive statement  trump told her   we re looking at that   so  the latest in the amazingly long line of offensive statements donald trump has made  he is now saying that he will fire tsa workers for being muslim  nevermind the fact that it is illegal to fire people on the basis of religion  of course  trump has already said that he plans on engaging in religious and racial profiling  so  sadly  this is no surprise the level of ignorance of one s supporters definitely reflects that of the candidate watch this stunning display below  via right wing watch featured image via jeff j mitchell getty images
