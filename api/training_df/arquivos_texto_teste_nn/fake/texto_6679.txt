a battle creek  michigan substitute teacher has been fired because she had the audacity to say  vagina  allison wint said that she has been teaching at harper creek middle school since january  but was recently let go after she used the word during a discussion about art history with a class she was teaching  she said that she just wanted to have an open discussion with the eighth graders about art and the controversies surrounding some artists  work  during the lecture she held up a reproduction of some of georgia o keefe s work and said  imagine walking into a gallery when  was first showing her pieces  and thinking   am i actually seeing vaginas here  am i a pervert  i m either a pervert or this woman was a pervert  the teacher said she used the word vagina  maybe  times  but it was never in a vulgar capacity   she went on to say  i thought if i used a euphemism  that would make it into a joke   she said   and i don t think that s a word you should be afraid of  unfortunately  school officials did not agree and fired her  the day after her lesson  the school s principal  kim thayer  fired her for using the word  vagina   without previous approval   who knew that using the proper medical terminology for a part of a female s anatomy was no longer allowed in schools  maybe the principal would have preferred she say  whoo ha  or some nonsense like that let s be real  it is a sad day in the american educational system when proper terms for body parts are off limits because they offend an adult s delicate sensibilities  how the hell are our children supposed to learn if they aren t even taught basic things like  vagina  is not a bad word  being afraid of the word   creates an aura of shame around the body part   wint said indeed not only is it important for students to know that it is not a dirty word  knowing the proper names for anatomically correct terms helps to combat sexual abuse  according to think progress perhaps most importantly  teaching kids to use the accurate words for their body parts teaches them that they have ownership over their body  provides a positive boost to their self image  and increases their confidence  that could have radical implications for our current society s pervasive rape culture  which advances the false perception that sexual assault is merely a consequence of promiscuity rather than a serious crime  if youth grow up with a deeper understanding of bodily autonomy and consent  they will be more likely to speak up when they feel that consent has been violated   and perhaps less likely to violate someone else s consent there is absolutely no reason at all that this teacher should have been fired for using a word that these kids should have already been comfortable hearing  the fact that it was considered  inappropriate  demonstrates how much battle creek has already failed their kids wint said that the only other time she has had a problem with the principal was when she hung a sign that the students made her behind her desk  the sign read marriage is about love  not gender   thayer told her to remove it it sounds like thayer is one of those right wing  religious nuts who have no business overseeing a school  if she can t shelve her personal feelings about things before she goes into work  then she really has no business holding the position she does featured image via detroit free press
