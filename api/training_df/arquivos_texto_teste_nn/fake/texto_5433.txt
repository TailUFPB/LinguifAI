months before the potential inauguration of hillary clinton  we are beginning to see some of the same types of attacks against her that president obama has been dealing with for eight years michael folk is a west virginia republican in the house of delegates and he s a pilot for united airlines  he s also under fire for tweeting that hillary clinton should be  hung   but of course  it was a joke  or something like that the exact tweet was from friday and it s since been deleted  likely by twitter   but thank goodness for screen shots  it said   hillary clinton  you should be tried for treason  murder  and crimes against the us constitution  then hung  sic  on the mall in washington  dc  folk claims to have tweeted it in a moment of petulance  my word  not his  after clinton was acquitted of any legal wrongdoing in handling classified emails through a phone call with folk saturday  he says that he wrote the tweet after watching a video of utah republican jason chaffetz  who is head of the house oversight and government reform committee  chaffetz asked a question to the inspector general of the intelligence community charles mccullough  to see classified emails clinton is alleged to have had on a private email server on  mccullough said that he couldn t show the emails to congress without getting permission from the agency that owns that information  which frustrated folk folk said if a private person had done what clinton did  then they would be put in prison  which contradicts the fbi decision to not charge clinton for the email scandal  and related the case to the scandal involving former central intelligence agency director david petraeus back in  source  wowk comhis employer isn t happy  united airlines released a statement saying   we are appalled by comments advocating harm to any person  they do not represent united airlines and we are looking further into the matter  that s not good enough for many and  united has pulled   from future flights as of now  great first step to ensure safety of all of us  https   t co   karl s  johnson   karljohn  july    unless united fires this unbalanced individual  their words are empty rhetoric     united https   t co   mike williams     july    hope  united deals w    so i can fly them again  i won t fly any airline that employs pilots who promote political violence   politixdude   politixdude  july    if  united thinks someone like   is mentally fit to be a pilot i know i cannot trust them with my safety   kevin griffin     july     united fire that pilot   or i will never feel safe flying united again  only sociopaths fantasize about lynching in the mall   sigmundine   hoffmannrandi  july    the election of obama  the right has become completely unhinged  he has been the target of over  death threats per day  judging by the rhetoric in this presidential election  where even delegates receive death threats for not toeing the line  things could be even worse for clinton  who has wrongly been accused of being a criminal for more than  years  of course  to the right  complaints about death threats are just  political correctness  featured image via facebook
