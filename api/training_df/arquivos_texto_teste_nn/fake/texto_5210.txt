donald trump has already been giving hints that he might back out of debating democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton over claims that the political system is  rigged  against him   even though we all know it s really because he s terrified of her  while most of us think trump s attempts to blame outside forces for his incompetence are pathetic  some of his most prominent minions are coming to his rescue to further spread his conspiracy theories roger stone  one of trump s closest confidantes  spoke to breitbart bigot milo yiannopoulos recently and warned that there would be a  bloodbath  if trump didn t win the election  after several recent polls have suggested that clinton is pulling ahead of trump  stone was more than happy to declare voter fraud  stone said  i think we have widespread voter fraud  but the first thing that trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly  if there s voter fraud  this election will be illegitimate  the election of the winner will be illegitimate  we will have a constitutional crisis  widespread civil disobedience  and the government will no longer be the government  of course  yiannopoulos was right on board with this theory and the men had some horrific advice for trump   continue to be as offensive as possible and push those buttons so that he can gain enough rabid support from racists and bigots to make up for any supposed rigging that might happen  stone also suggested that trump should vow to shut the government down if clinton was elected in november  as if this interview couldn t get any crazier  delusional stone issued this warning  if you can t have an honest election  nothing else counts  i think he s gotta put them on notice that their inauguration will be a rhetorical  and when i mean civil disobedience  not violence  but it will be a bloodbath  we will not stand for it  trump s allies are just like him   they love to encourage violence and are incapable of acting like adults when things don t go their way  the amount of stupidity going on in this interview is unfathomable  you can listen to it below previously  roger stone had encouraged trump supporters to go stalk and visit anti trump delegates in their hotel rooms if they tried to take the gop nomination away from trump featured image via alex wong   getty images
