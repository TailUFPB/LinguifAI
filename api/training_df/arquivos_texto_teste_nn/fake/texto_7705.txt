the donald trump bandwagon is beginning to show signs of wear and tear  in what can only be described as an unusual move  fox news decided to air a segment of a post debate interview with a focus group who couldn t have been more disappointed with what they just witnessed  think of the ramifications  donald trump is so dangerous at this point that fox news is willing to abandon everything it holds dear and tell the truth about how things actually work the group is mostly trump supporters  but only one walks away thinking the donald won  the others withheld any semblance of a smile or any emotion rather than pure disgust  when the interviewer polls an entire row of people on one word to describe the event  the results are eerily similar to watching the people who still go watch their baseball team in late august after  losses  words like  disgusting  and  childish  come up and you can tell that these people mean business there has to come a point  even for the trump supporter  when enough is enough  the time is about to come when trump is thrust out of the local sports facility and into the world where he needs to earn votes from people looking to understand the issues  walls and removing all muslims and open hatred for anyone and everyone works well among the imbeciles who pay seven bucks for a beer at a trump event  but not so well for people who live in the real world wait until you see the expressions on their faces  the interviewer as well  they all look so mortified by the general state of affairs at the gop debate  as they should be  they should be worried about the general state of affairs of the gop  they re running around in circles right now trying to figure out what to do next  the establishment that was so concerned of a trump third party run may have to consider one themselves  if for nothing other than ensure trump loses  a trump presidency would spell the end of the republican party  they would be the laughing stock of politics across the globe all of that would have to start right here at home  where at least according to fox news  things aren t so hunky dory in the trump camp https   www facebook com mediamatters videos   permpage  image from screen capture
