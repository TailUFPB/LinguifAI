when donald trump isn t getting blasted for his disrespectful comments about muslim soldiers who died sacrificing their lives for america  the disgraced republican nominee is being reminded of what awful things he s said about other groups thanks to actor will smith  this time it s women  in a recent interview  smith reminded everyone that trump s infamous misogyny and sexism are not to be forgotten amongst all of the other groups of people the donald offends in any given week  smith ripped trump and his followers a new one when he said  for a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig  that makes me teary  and for people to applaud  that is absolutely f cking insanity to me  smith specifically is making reference to trump s comments about rosie o donnell  but we all know trump s anti women remarks go far beyond her  in the past  trump has also attacked arianna huffington  calling her a  dog  and tweeting that she s  unattractive both inside and out   and let s not forget trump s well known feud with fox news  megyn kelly twittertwitterbut smith didn t stop there  he continued to get more outraged  saying  my grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if i had referred to a woman as a fat pig  and i cannot understand how people can clap for that  it s absolutely collective insanity if one of my sons  i am getting furious just thinking about it  if one of my sons said that in a public place  they couldn t even live in my house anymore  smith also went beyond trump s misogyny and called the business mogul out for his bigoted rhetoric toward basically all minorities  i think as much as we want to believe that love is the greatest human motivator  it s not  fear is  fear is the most dangerous and powerful motivator because when a human being gets scared  fight or flight kicks in  and there is this really separatist non inclusive xenophobic  racist wave that is sweeping the globe that is making us pull apart farther than putting us together the importance of leaders is that they have to be level headed  they have to be calm  because when people get scared  they lose their morality and that reptile mind takes over  it s the type of thing that you see in all forms of nature  but our leaders can t be that  for smith  the only comfort he has in the midst of trump s hateful campaign is his belief in america to know better than to elect the former reality tv star  once again shaming trump for his remarks about women  smith said  for me  deep down in my heart  i believe that america won t and we can t  elect mr  trump   of all the things he has said  and we could go through the laundry list  that was the one that was such an absolute illustration of a darkness of his soul  i just cannot figure out how people can clap for that  he added  i have faith in america  america has had really critical times but the good  people  tend to make their way to the top  featured image via jason merritt and alex wong   getty images
