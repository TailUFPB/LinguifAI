by absolutely every metric imaginable  cruz s performance in saturday s south carolina primary was a disaster  in a state which has a massive e vangelical christian population and a thriving anti gay community  cruz  the man whose entire campaign is built on those two things  got walloped by donald trump  and edged out by marco rubio  jeb bush may have dropped out  but for cruz  south carolina might as well have ended his campaign so it was baffling to see that the texas senator was on the sunday morning political talk shows putting on a brave face and claiming that an embarrassing third place finish was actually a big win for him  things went from surreal to down right delusional on meet the press  where cruz gave an unsolicited victory speech like he was already elected president  it was painful to watch and host chuck todd quickly moved to put cruz out of his misery  there is now only one strong conservative in this race who can win   cruz opined   we see conservatives continuing to unite behind our campaign  our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten donald trump  and that can beat donald trump   he continued   so  what we re seeing is republicans coming to us in incredible numbers  todd wasn t having it   wait a minute   he interrupted   you finished third in a state with the highest evangelical turnout that we ve seen yet  and you finished third  cruz continued on with all the confidence of an asylum patient   we effectively tied for second    bullshit detector  blaring  cruz is hoping to persuade americans that his win in iowa  not his devastating losses in new hampshire and south carolina  is a sign that he can sweep other primary states  however  he never mentions that iowa has long been considered a toss up  literally anybody can win iowa  rick santorum won iowa  rick santorum what south carolina proves is that even the people who cruz panders to don t like him very much  if evangelicals are flocking to trump  a man who has had several divorces  was until recently pro choice  and has no idea what s in the bible  then cruz is screwed  the writing is on the wall no wonder trump has been quietly shifting his attacks towards marco rubio rather than focusing on cruz  he s focusing on the bigger threat  everyone but cruz seems to know it featured image via nbc screengrab
