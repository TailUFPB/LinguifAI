the mere thought that donald trump could succeed president obama is mindboggling  if you need any visual representation to figure this out  look no closer than the two s personal twitter statements honoring memorial day first we have the commander in chief s this memorial day  i hope you ll join me in acts of remembrance  the debt we owe our fallen heroes is one we can never truly repay   president obama   potus  may    now donald trump s wonderful tribute  have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    one honors america s fallen and the other decides to use it as a campaign pitch that eerily resembles hitler s slogan  how fitting for a memorial day tribute  while president obama lays the wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier  trump decides to spend his day railing against hispanic immigrants  complaining about bernie sanders  rally sizes  and of course pledged to build the wall so instead of actually honoring those who have fallen  trump continued to bloat his ego and echo his stupid campaign slogans to a group of angry bikers but the best tweet donald trump ever sent out on memorial day is from last year when he decided to use the day to attack those who don t support him i would like to wish everyone  including all haters and losers  of which  sadly  there are many  a truly happy and enjoyable memorial day   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    there s that  president obama  the democrat  honors those who gave their lives for us while trump  the republican  insults his  haters  and those he perceives to be losers the difference is night and day  the fact republicans really think their people care about veterans is laughable especially now that trump is their nominee should trump win the presidential election  veterans and service members alike will be missing president obama something fierce featured image via pool getty images
