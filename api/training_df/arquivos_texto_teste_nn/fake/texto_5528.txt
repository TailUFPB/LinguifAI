donald trump likes to brag that he attended the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  but while he is proud of that  the students and faculty are embarrassed that he is an alumni in an open letter  students and faculty both past and present condemned trump for his hateful and bigoted rhetoric and expressed outrage that he is humiliating the school by associating it with his ignorance and intolerance and rejected his use of the school name in his campaign here s the full letter via medium at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity  we are taught to embrace humility and diversity  we can understand why  in seeking america s highest office  you have used your degree from wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy as a candidate for president  and now as the presumptive gop nominee  you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the wharton community even prouder of our school and values however  we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy we  proud students  alumni  and faculty of wharton  are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance  although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter  we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia  sexism  racism  and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign  the wharton community is a diverse community  we are immigrants and children of immigrants  people of color  muslims  jews  women  people living with or caring for those with disabilities  and members of the lgbtq community  in other words  we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated  as well as their steadfast friends  family  and allies we recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at wharton  and we are committed to using our opportunity to make america and the world a better place for everyone  we are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance  but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values  your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the american economy  an intolerant america is a less productive  less innovative  and less competitive america we  the undersigned wharton students  alumni  and faculty  unequivocally reject the use of your education at wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance  your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at wharton  and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive american society in addition  the authors of the letter spoke to nbc about their decision to write it  it was important for us to speak out against trump because  as we have seen in many moments throughout history  silence is an act of complicity  this open letter speaks on behalf of wharton students  alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at wharton and across america  in short  donald trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms  because every time trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place featured image  mark lyons getty images
