it s been several months  and hundreds of hours of rallies  since the last time scientists took a hard look at donald trump s intelligence  and the new data did not help the republican front runner look any smarter in a new analysis of the language trump uses  scientists discovered that he is talking to his supporters at a  grade level   the lowest of any candidate in the race the study  done by the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university  seems to confirm what an earlier  albeit less scientific  analysis by the boston globe found  donald trump has either the language development of an  year old child  or he thinks his supporters do the results can often times be laughably bad  here  for example  is an answer trump gave to jimmy kimmel when asked to defend his call to ban muslims from the united states  he falls into a rubio esque repeat of the same two or three meaningless sentences  look  we have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm  you look at the two   look at paris  look what happened in paris  i mean  these people  they did not come from sweden  okay  look at what happened in paris  look at what happened last week in california  with  you know   people dead  other people going to die  they re so badly injured  and when he gets flustered  not only does his grammar go out the window  but so does his ability to spell  he winds up shooting off angry tweets like this one which contain astoundingly misspelled words  one of the dummer people on television  pic twitter com   james cook   jamesliamcook  june    bigdavebets  realdonaldtrump you know there a thousand screenshots just like this one lol  pic twitter com   ricky spanisssssssh   micahsgrrl  february    study also looked at past presidents to compare how the new crop stacks up  the researchers found that while most candidates were around the average  there were two notable exceptions   donald trump and george w  bush   circling the very bottom george w  bush  of course  is well known for having been one of america s least intellectual presidents  he was voted into office largely because he was a guy republicans wanted to  have a beer with  and not because he had the brain power to effectively do the job  in fact  his legendary stupidity was used as a selling point  he wasn t an  elitist  because he didn t  or couldn t  use big words and never excelled in school  his opponent  al gore  his supporters claimed was too smart  a major turn off for them trump seems to be banking on the same anti intellectual thinking  the simpler the words  the more they adore him  what his fans don t remember is that bush s ability to be fun in a bar didn t translate into a good presidency  he left america in an historic recession and multiple wars  a bit more thinking would have been nice featured image via flickr
