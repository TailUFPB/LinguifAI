students at a north carolina high school have let donald trump s influence get to them way too much  last week  they built a wall of boxes that blocked off mcdowell high school s common area  and then put the photo on instagram  saying   we built the wall first   in apparent homage to donald trump and his border wall idea worse  they built this wall under the supervision of a teacher  of all people  a teacher should have known what this symbolized and discouraged the students from doing this  instead  these students got supervision for a racist prank that understandably upset their latino classmates they wanted to put a trump sticker on it  too  but at least someone had the guts to tell them they couldn t do that  a picture of the wall was shared on  s instagram account  and is below mcdowell high school students get the award for best  studentsfortrump senior prank  they built a wall   we are      trump  maga  studentsfortrump  makeamericagreatagain  trump  trumptraina photo posted by students for trump     on jun    at   pdttrump has been chanting about a wall along the mexican border nonstop since he announced his candidacy a year ago  and he s been extremely racist against latinos in the u s  in fact  he tweeted that the anti trump protesters that got violent at his san jose rally were  mostly illegals   many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful trump supporters in san jose were illegals  they burned the american flag and laughed at police  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    has to wonder how he knows that  chances are  he doesn t  and just assumes that any latinos who don t support him are here illegally these kids took a page straight out of his book to do this  and they know it  otherwise they wouldn t have wanted to put a trump sticker on it  the students aren t going to face any disciplinary action over it  either  likely because it was just a  prank   that tells them that racist behavior will be tolerated in our society and teaches them nothing of value trump would be so proud of these kids  that s sickening featured image by elijah nouvelage getty images
