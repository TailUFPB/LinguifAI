one would think that to hold a position like chief justice of the alabama supreme court you would have to know a thing or two about the law  justice roy moore  the same guy who lost a battle and his job over the statue of the ten commandments in the alabama state house  is looking to once again defy the supreme court of the united states and the constitution he is sworn to uphold and protect moore sent word on wednesday that the scotus ruling that legalized same sex marriage nationwide doesn t apply to alabama  citing the fact that the case was ruled on for other states   not alabama   and how right kim davis was to refuse to do her job  moore laid down the gantlet to his next impeachment apparently moore doesn t quite understand how the judicial branch of the federal government works  nor does he understand the  amendment  the gay marriage ruling was specifically intended to extend the rights of couples in one state to all states in the union pesky little things like facts  procedure and protocol don t matter to moore  whose administrative order reads  until further decision by the alabama supreme court  the existing orders of the alabama supreme court that alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the alabama sanctity of marriage amendment or the alabama marriage protection act remain in full force and effect  moore and other opponents of equality have said there is confusion about the actual meaning of the supreme court s historic obergefell v hodges ruling that legalized same sex marriage in every state in the union  confusion and uncertainty exist among the probate judges of this state as to the effect of obergefell on the  existing orders    he wrote those  existing orders   essentially an archaic ban on a now legal practice  were more than clarified when a federal judge ordered in july that the scotus ruling was binding on all probate judges in alabama  judges from two counties have discontinued licensing for the time being  but could ultimately face the same fate as kim davis if they continue to violate a federal order roy moore told cnn that the vendetta he has against same sex marriage isn t a religious issue  it s about the law  roy moore is full of crap  he is and always has been nothing but a southern crusader for christianity featured image via screen capture
