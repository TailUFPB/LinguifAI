ted cruz is trying to differentiate himself from republican front runner donald trump by any means possible  recently  trump shocked everyone by calling controversial anti trans bathroom bills  discriminatory  and stating that transgender individuals should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel corresponds to their identity  meanwhile  cruz has decided to go the complete opposite way as his rival  ramping up the bigotry  his latest comments are transphobia at its worst while in indiana last weekend  cruz was filmed talking about his bathroom policies  making it perfectly clear that he is on board with divisive anti trans bathroom legislation  despite that fact that no trans person has ever attacked anyone in a bathroom  cruz insisted that the only bathrooms trans people should be able to use are the ones in their own homes  the texas senator told reporters  every one of us has the right to live our lives as we wish  then  cruz s lack of intelligence resulted in an epic contradiction  if any one of us wants to dress up as a woman or man and wants to live as woman or man and believes that we might be something other than what we were born  god has made each of us with free will and the ability to choose to do that if man to wants to dress as a woman  and live as a woman  and have a bathroom at home  a reporter clarified with the presidential hopeful  so  then they shouldn t use the bathroom out in public  yes  exactly  cruz drove his bigoted point home  you don t have a right to intrude upon the rights of others because whether or not a man believes he s a woman  there are a lot of women who would like to be able to use a public restroom in peace without having a man there   and when there are children involved  you don t have a right to impose your lifestyle on others  here s the video  courtesy of the american bridge cruz has definitely amped up his anti trans rhetoric over the last few days  the goper recently released an ad about transgender people using public restrooms with the message  it s not appropriate  it s not safe  and has also made anti trans jokes insulting donald trump  in the same weekend that this awful video was taken  cruz called transgender protections  political correctness on steroids  cruz has also voiced his support for north carolina s bathroom laws  which prevent transgender people from using the restroom they re most comfortable with if you care anything for the lgbt community and their right to freedom  ted cruz is definitely making himself out to be one of the community s biggest threats featured image via joe raedle   getty images
