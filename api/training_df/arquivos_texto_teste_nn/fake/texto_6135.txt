donald trump told an audience in fresno  california on friday  that there is no drought in california  this has to be the most absurd claim that trump has made during his campaign  during the event  trump implied that the water shortage in california was created by the government and environmentalists  we re going to solve your water problem  you have a water problem that is so insane  it is so ridiculous where they re taking the water and shoving it out to sea   trump told the crowd made up of mostly california farmers  they don t understand it  there is no drought  they turn the water out into the ocean  california has been in a state of drought for half a decade  in   the drought was less severe than it has been in previous years  though to claim that there is no drought and to imply that california s water shortage problem has been solely caused by poor water management systems is ridiculous trump pointed towards efforts to keep the delta smelt  or  a three inch fish  as trump referred to it in his speech  from going extinct as an example of environmentalists and the big bad government stealing water away from farmers  while water has been redirected in a last ditch attempt to save the species from complete extinction  the idea that it has had any major impact on farmers is nothing more than a flimsy talking point trump is pandering to california farmers who are trying to get legislation passed to build new water infrastructure that would help farmers out  it s probably just due to the fact that he is trump  that he has chosen to do so in such a ludicrous fashion  i m personally surprised that trump is spending so much time trying to win over voters in california  a state that is certain to vote blue in november you can watch the event below in full featured image via video screenshot
