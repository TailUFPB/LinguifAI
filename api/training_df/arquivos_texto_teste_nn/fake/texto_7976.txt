this the worst fear of republicans  conservatives and billionaires  the supreme court has turned its back on the gop s over the top racism and voter suppression  two of north carolina s congressional districts were so gerrymandered that they might as well spell out  whites only  on the map  but not for much longer via raw story the u s  supreme court on friday rejected a request to stay a ruling that two congressional districts in north carolina were racially gerrymandered in a  redistricting and needed to be redrawn within two weeks a panel of federal judges this month barred elections in the majority black districts  the  and the   until new maps are approved  calling the current maps unconstitutional  congressional primaries in the state are set for march  this is only going to get worse for the gop from here  when republicans swept to power on a tidal wave of blinding rage and racism in   they immediately started passing voter id laws  cut polling stations  reduced the voting hours and  of course  took gerrymandering to a whole new level  they knew that their base of angry old racists was dying  and the only way to stay in power was to rig the elections but all of this relied on a supreme court that would turn a mostly blind eye to all but the most obviously racist voter suppression  with the death the antonin scalia  the court will move to the left and then move left again under the next  democratic  president  more lawsuits will be brought against republican gerrymandering and with the precedent set  republicans will be forced to draw more competitive districts and that will lead to the loss of the house now you know why conservatives are freaking out over filling scalia s seat  as the court slowly undoes the damage  expect to see the right become ever more hysterical featured image via benn stancil
