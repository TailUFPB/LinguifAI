during her time in the white house  first lady michelle obama has championed so many important causes   many of them geared toward helping children and women around the world one of these crucial initiatives  launched last year  was let girls learn   an effort to educate teenage girls  this effort was backed by studies that showed that when women and girls are educated  a nation s economy rises  in an interview with a u s  agency for international development publication  michelle said  studies from the world bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl s future income by  to  percent  and we know that when girls are educated  they are less likely to contract hiv  more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children  and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates  research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country s gdp  the link between the education of girls and a nation s gdp has been made before   and thanks to an analysis by politifact  we now know that there s a lot of truth to that statement according to research  when there are more girls in school  there is a higher gross domestic product   although there is some uncertainty if it s a stronger economy that results in more girls being educated  or if having more girls in school leads to the rise of a nation s economy  one policy report from the world bank said  by effectively educating more women   that is  providing more women with a high quality education   more will enter the labor market  and the economy will show the favorable results  although educating girls has been shown to improve the economy  this doesn t account for any obstacles women might encounter even if they are educated  sexism and gender inequality can still have an impact on the economy even as efforts are made to put more girls in school and give them more resources and opportunities  according to a  article in the journal feminist economics  the economic benefit will be lost if companies refuse to hire educated girls however  the gains of educating girls are far more than any roadblocks they may encounter  education allows girls to make informed decisions about their lives and allows them to contribute to and help improve society  michelle was dead on when she said  we need to get these girls into school  because we know that education is the single most important stepping stone to power  to freedom  and to equality  featured image via jeff j mitchell   getty images
