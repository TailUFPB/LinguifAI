big news out of the treasury department  after much debate  alexander hamilton will remain on the   bill   and instead  it s andrew jackson who is being given the boot according to politico  treasury secretary jack lew is set to announce two major changes to the twenty  neither of which will make america s white supremacists very happy  first  former president andrew jackson will be replaced by a black woman  harriet tubman  tubman was a legendary fighter against slavery and is recognized as having personally shepherded hundreds of escaped slaves to freedom in the north during her lifetime  the second change is the treasury will be changing the   bill to  depict civil rights era leaders  both changes reflect the recent cultural movement to acknowledge and honor the legacy of racial justice in america  it can also be seen as a bit of condemnation for the actions of president jackson  a man whom historians are quick to point out gave america some of its most shameful actions against native american peoples   including the forced migration and resettlement of many tribes that would eventually become known as the trail of tears until recently  it was alexander hamilton who was on the chopping block  however  thanks to a resurgence of interest in the founding father s life and legacy and the outrage over jackson  treasury secretary jack lew was adamant that hamilton would stay  even if someone else went  so long  president jackson harriet tubman being printed on the   bill will be a turning point in america s cultural identity  she represents the country at its best   humane  strong and fighting for what s right  she will also be the first woman and first person of color to be represented on paper currency  native american  sacajawea is already on a less commonly used dollar coin  this all has to be quite a shock to the toxic white supremacists in the country who believe that white people are being erased and replaced by  minorities   the fact that they will have to stare at symbols of racial equality each time they use a   or   bill is deeply satisfying  or as my colleague oliver willis recently put it dear wingnuts who are going to freak out about harriet tubman on the    give your bills to me   oliver willis   owillis  april    image via
