greg pruitt s wife was awoken at approximately  a m  when she noticed her husband was having a seizure  quickly  she called   as help was on its way  greg s seizure started to subside a bit  and he was coming out of it when help arrived twenty nine year old jason adams  a volunteer fireman  was the first responder on the scene  when adams was standing in the doorway of the room where pruitt was  attempting to evaluate the situation  pruitt promptly shot and killed adams  thinking he was an intruder adams was a nearby neighbor who lived approximately a half mile from the residence  a witness who entered the home after the shooting gave the same account of what happened  adams was rushed to a local medical center in north little rock but was pronounced dead not very surprisingly  authorities do not know if there will be any charges filed in this  accidental  shooting please  can we admit yet that we have a problem with guns in america  this is a perfect example of why we do  i know when people are in an emergency situation  possibly panicking  they don t think about the gun that is in arm s reach of a seizure victim  or about what will happen because of it when a stranger suddenly enters their home  but  is that really an acceptable way to write off this sort of thing the idea of  responsible gun ownership  is exactly what s in question here  why are we living in such paranoia  in the  home of the brave   to where we are shooting at every shadow we see  it s incredibly wrong for a first responder to have to second guess rendering aid because they re afraid they will get shot just by showing up  the concept of  always shoot first because it s just an accident if you do   that has been cultivated by the nra and republicans in america needs to come to an end watch news coverage of the incident below featured image via twitter
