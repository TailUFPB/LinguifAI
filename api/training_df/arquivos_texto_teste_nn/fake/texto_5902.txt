pastor stephen l  anderson of faithful word baptist church in tempe  arizona  is a terrible human being  in   he made the case that aids can be eliminated if we just wiped all the  f ggots  off the face of the planet  naturally  given his many unhinged ravings about the lgbt community  a group he calls  without cause   pedophiles   and a wide array of other offensive language  anderson was quite pleased after learning that   sodomites  died  and another  were injured  in a targeted terrorist attack against the gay community in orlando anderson says that this is  good news  because  there s  less pedophiles in the world   the  christian  pastor praised the shooter for eliminating his victims because they we  just disgusting homosexuals at a gay bar   while he says he would never advocate violence  except for the time he prayed that president obama would  die and go to hell and his statement that all gay people should be murdered  of course   anderson is clear that the muslim man who killed all those people was simply following the bible  what   now let me just be real clear  i ve never advocated for violence  i don t believe in  you know  taking the law into our own hands  i would never go in and shoot up a gay bar   so called  i don t believe it s right for us to just be a vigilante  but i will say this  the bible says that homosexuals should be put to death  in leviticus    obviously  it s not right for somebody to just  you know  shoot up the place  because that s not going through the proper channels  but these people all should have been killed  anyway  but they should have been killed through the proper channels  as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them  convicted them  and saw them executed  because  in leviticus    god s perfect law  he put the death penalty on murder  and he also put the death penalty on homosexuality  that s what the bible says  plain and simple while he is happy that fifty people were murdered in the name of his god  though many christians would dispute that they share a god with muslims  after an extremist saw two men kissing and flew off the rails  anderson says that there are some drawbacks   like those awful liberals who think that this attack is one of the many examples that we need reasonable firearm regulations  and those who will denounce hate speech but the bad news is that this is now gonna be used  i m sure  to push for gun control  where  you know  law abiding normal americans are not gonna be allowed to have guns for self defense  and then i m sure it s also gonna be used to push an agenda against so called  hate speech   so bible believing christian preachers who preach what the bible actually says about homosexuality   that it s vile  that it s disgusting  that they re reprobates   you know  we re gonna be blamed like   it s all extremism  it s not just the muslims  it s the christians   i m sure that that s coming  i m sure that people are gonna start attacking  you know  bible believing christians now  because of what this guy did  i m not sad about it  i m not gonna cry about it  because these  people in a gay bar that got shot up  they were gonna die of aids  and syphilis  and whatever else  they were all gonna die early  anyway  because homosexuals have a  year shorter life span than normal people  anyway   anderson says   at least these dangerous predators  these dangerous filthy pedophiles at this gay bar  at least they re off the streets  i m just trying to look at the bright side   he concluded before wishing god s blessings on viewers if there was any justice in this world  god would have spared the victims and taken anderson instead  f ck him watch anderson s disgusting rant below featured image via screengrab
