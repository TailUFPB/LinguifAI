it s clear as day in the first amendment  but justice antonin scalia apparently has never read it or he is blatantly ignoring it  either way  such idiocy does not belong on the supreme court the establishment clause of the constitution states  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof this means that the government cannot support one religion over another   and nor can government promote religion over non religion but conservative justice scalia declared otherwise during a speech at a catholic high school in louisiana according to the associated press   scalia said saturday the idea of religious neutrality is not grounded in the country s constitutional traditions and that god has been good to the u s  exactly because americans honor him  to tell you the truth there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition   scalia claimed   where did that come from   he asked   to be sure  you can t favor one denomination over another but can t favor religion over non religion  scalia went on to claim that america has been successful because of god and argued that the government should honor the christian deity  telling the students to not let anyone tell them otherwise  god has been very good to us  that we won the revolution was extraordinary  the battle of midway was extraordinary  i think one of the reasons god has been good to us is that we have done him honor  unlike the other countries of the world that do not even invoke his name we do him honor  in presidential addresses  in thanksgiving proclamations and in many other ways  there is nothing wrong with that and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that  the hill reports that scalia also had words for americans who support secularism  don t cram it down the throats of an american people that has always honored god on the pretext that the constitution requires it  this is a man who sits on the supreme court of the united states  yet he has a profound ignorance of one of the most important parts of the constitution  the founding fathers added the establishment clause precisely because they did not want the government supporting religion in any way apparently  scalia thinks he knows more about the constitution than thomas jefferson and james madison  both of whom wrote that the establishment clause erected a wall of separation between church and state  i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibit the free exercise thereof  thus building a wall of separation between church and state    founding father thomas jefferson  letter to the baptists of danbury  connecticut   because religious belief  or non belief  is such an important part of every person s life  freedom of religion affects every individual  state churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights  moreover  state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion  erecting the  wall of separation between church and state   therefore  is absolutely essential in a free society  we have solved   the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws  and we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries    founding father thomas jefferson  in a speech to the virginia baptists   the civil government functions with complete success by the total separation of the church from the state    founding father james madison    writings     quoted from gene garman   essays in addition to america s real religion every new and successful example of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance    founding father james madison  letter   is an embarrassment who should resign from the bench in disgrace  for someone who calls himself an originalist on the court when it comes to interpreting the constitution  it sure sounds like he has no idea what the establishment clause means even though it s pretty clearly worded and has been clearly explained by two founding fathers  if scalia had his way  the united states would be declared a christian state and christianity would be forced down our throats every day despite the fact that such a thing is forbidden by the constitution featured image  flickr
