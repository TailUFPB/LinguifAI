those of us on the left have long said that the republican base took a jump off the cliff into crazy land never to return a long time ago  well  now  one of their own is saying the same  geraldo rivera  famed host of trash tv turned gop mouthpiece  has come out and echoed what we have all been saying for ages  his party is bashit insane  rivera went on fox news this weekend and spoke with howard kurtz  who pointed out that the fox correspondent was likely  a little uncomfortable  with republican frontrunner donald trump s comments regarding immigrants from mexico  considering the fact that it is well documented that rivera and trump have been bosom buddies for many years rivera said  he is a friend of mine  i do love the guy  and then he said mexican immigrants are dope dealers and rapists  indeed  we all remember the donald s infamously racist tone upon the opening of his travesty of a presidential campaign  it s nice to know that it did not go unnoticed by rivera rivera continued  though i have a deep respect for him and his family  i could never vote for him unless he moderates that position  it is easy for me to draw that line  i can go that far but no further  you have to be compassionate to this  population  well  that s good to know  one less vote for that lunatic trump  even from a self professed right winger in the public eye  rivera went on to say that he thinks that   donald doesn t really mean it   and then let loose on what those on the left already have known about the gop s base for a very long time now  i think you have to be a crazy person to get the republican nomination these days  i think that they have to tow a line that is in many ways intolerable for a reasonably intelligent compassionate person  you have to clear the  hurdle in iowa to get anywhere  steven king is the congressman that said of mexican immigrants that they have the calves the size of cantaloupes because they are all carrying dope across the border  i mean  if you have to please that person to get past the nation s first primary election then you are doomed to a radical position that will never fly with the american electorate  and you can never be elected  well  yeah  i mean  even though most republicans are that nutty and ignorant  there are plenty of moderates who cannot look the other way on such positions  and certainly independents and left wingers can t  despite the circus that is the current state of american politics  most of us really just aren t that nuts  thankfully i might not agree with geraldo rivera on much  but this time he is right on the money   the current incarnation of the republican party is beyond crazy watch rivera s comments below featured image via video screen capture
