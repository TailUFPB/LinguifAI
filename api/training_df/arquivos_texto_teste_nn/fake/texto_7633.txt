in a move that shows just how little republicans care about the opinion and safety of police  west virginia now allows anyone to carry concealed weapons without a permit the state had previously required people who want the ability to carry a concealed weapon to get a permit and undergo training so that they know how to use their gun and keep themselves and others safe around it republicans  however  chose to pass house bill  to do away with that program and the permit system for anyone over  years of age governor earl ray tomblin had vetoed the republican gun bill on thursday for the second time in two years citing police concerns that the law could turn west virginia into a land of gunslingers who have no clue about gun safety or how to use it  i just don t think it s in the best interest of the state of west virginia to sign this bill   tomblin said   when you re a police officer and you walk into a dangerous situation  you almost have to expect that everyone s carrying a gun  but in their gun crazy fervor  republicans decided to override that veto on friday  thus dismantling a critical program that had kept the mentally ill and convicted felons from getting concealed carry permits  now they ll be able to carry their gun in public among innocent people who could end up being killed by someone who shouldn t be able to have a gun in the first place as previously mentioned  west virginia law enforcement officials strongly opposed eliminating the system that has served the state well over the years according to west virginia metro news kent carper  president of the kanawha county commission  was one of several officials who expressed concern about the bill that  he said  fails to protect police officers  do we seriously want to send our law enforcement officials out and take away any chance they have to come home safely   he said   these men and women protect us  over the last few years  carper said more than  county residents were denied gun permits   it was  for people that had mental problems  people that were convicted felons  drug dealers  do we really want to take away a sensible protection for our law enforcement   he said county sheriff steve tanner blasted republicans for being irresponsible  i don t know how we as a society can say it s ok for someone to carry a concealed weapon with absolutely no training and expect if something bad happens  they re going to be the hero to rush in to protect their family or strangers  it has got to be the law that people are required to have training before they carry  here s the report by  news via youtube republicans literally just made it legal for mentally unstable people and convicted felons to carry concealed weapons and there is nothing police officers can do about it except wear bullet proof vests on a daily basis and hope they don t end up becoming a target or the victim of gunfire by an idiot attempting to be rambo conservatives constantly claim that they support police officers  but now republicans in west virginia have made it clear that they don t care if police officers have a higher chance of being gunned down by a right wing gun nut  they certainly don t care about the millions of innocent people who now have to worry about whether the rambling crazy person standing around is going to open fire any minute  or worse  parents will now have to worry about their children in school because the new law allows concealed carry everywhere  meaning anyone could walk into a school with a gun and the police can t do anything about it until the shooting starts  and even if there is a so called  good guy with a gun  around  it s very likely they won t be trained  which means innocent people could be killed by the wannabe hero if you live in west virginia  think about that next time you send your child off to school or watch your police officer spouse head off to work  because the chances that you ll never see them alive again just skyrocketed  all because republicans are gun crazy featured image  pixabay
