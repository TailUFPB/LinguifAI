there s a peculiar hysteria around marijuana in this country and for the life of me  i can t understand it  there s so much misinformation out there that it makes my head hurt  as soon as i saw the headline for this article   medical marijuana  how to prevent an addiction to weed   i knew i was in for a frustrating experience the author of the piece  dr  david casarett  spends half of the article on a mea culpa over his part in creating the current epidemic of opioid addiction  fifteen years ago  he and his fellow doctors shoved pain killers down our throats that were derived from the same stuff we make heroin from and couldn t see why that would be a problem fifteen years ago  a crowd of experts including many physicians proclaimed that opioids such as morphine were safe for use in chronic pain  we also downplayed the risk of opioid addiction for example  one expert statement on chronic pain management in older adults  on which i was an author  said that  concerns over drug dependency and addiction do not justify the failure to relieve pain  so far  so good  doctors have been over prescribing pain killers for years and then abandoning their patients when they re addicted  casarett is very sorry about his role in this and just doesn t want us to make the same mistake with marijuana proponents of medical marijuana advertise its safety  it s natural  they say  in fact  one dispensary owner told me guilelessly   it s perfectly safe it s from a flower  not like heroin   that dispensary owner ignored the fact that heroin is derived from poppies  and that poppies are also flowers besides  he told me  theoretical risks of addiction don t justify withholding a potentially beneficial treatment  but that s exactly what many experts were saying about opioids  years ago  and we should worry about marijuana addiction and that s when he goes off the rails  there s one critical difference between marijuana and opioids  you can easily become physically addicted to one and it s almost impossible to become physically addicted to the other you can become physically addicted to opioids  sugars  alcohol  tobacco and a slew of other chemicals and substances  it is nigh impossible to become physically addicted the same way to pot  it just doesn t happen and casarett  as a doctor  knows this  this is why he does a bait and switch from  addiction  to  dependence  the good news is that the risk of marijuana dependence is lower than it is for heroin  approximately  percent vs   percent    the term  dependence  is used to describe someone who uses marijuana regularly  even though it impairs their ability to function normally  and despite drug related physical and psychological problems   nevertheless  even if marijuana addiction doesn t turn out to be as devastating as opioid addiction is  it can still result in lost jobs  damaged relationships and lost opportunities dependence is very different from addiction  even the government website on marijuana points out  correctly  that you can be dependent on marijuana but not be addicted i know you might be thinking that i m just another stoner defending his precious weed but  honestly  i don t smoke marijuana and i never have  i have zero interest in it  personally  that being said  i grew up around a great many people who  smoke pot and not one of them ever became addicted to it  and they smoked a lot of the stuff  none of them even became dependent so addiction was right out the window  this is why i know  from first hand experience  that marijuana simply is not addictive  you have a better chance of becoming addicted to the sugar  salt and fat in mcdonald s food than you are to pot it s easy to read casarett s article and become concerned that we re facing the next drug epidemic but it s just not true featured image via getty
