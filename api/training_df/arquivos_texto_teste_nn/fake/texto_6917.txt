if you were one of the many political junkies crossing your fingers and hoping donald trump would attend the white house correspondents  dinner this year  you are about to be disappointed  the republican frontrunner recently announced that he has turned down all of the invitations he has received because of the media  i was asked by every single group of media available to mankind   but i ve decided not to go  do you know why  i would have a good time and the press would say i look like i wasn t having a good time  donald trump attended the  correspondents  dinner and president obama hammered him over and over and over  he even had a photo of what the white house would look like if the billionaire was ever elected president  complete with  trump  scrawled across the top of it image via screenshotbut trump is claiming that his decision not to attend has nothing to do with president obama repeatedly making him the butt of his jokes  it was instead the mean press  fault  i had a great time  i was very honored by all of the attention  the president told joke after joke and it was good  they were all very nice and delivered nicely and i had a great time and told the press  for four years  i ve read what a miserable time i had the press is dishonest  if the press would be honest  i d go because i d have a good time    but no matter how good a time i had  the press would say   donald trump was miserable  what would i need that for  honestly  it really doesn t matter if it was the president trolling him or the media talking about his angry face throughout the dinner that is keeping him from attending   it speaks to a much larger problem he has  trump is completely incapable of taking criticism   even in jest  he claims that he wants to run this country  but he can t handle anyone who isn t kissing his ass talking about him  and when people do say something about him  he lashes out like a toddler who was just told he cannot swing on the curtains  how is he ever going to deal with the scrutiny that comes with the highest office in the united states if he can t brush the big bad press off watch president obama roast trump at the  dinner featured image via kristoffer tripplaar pool  scott olson getty images
