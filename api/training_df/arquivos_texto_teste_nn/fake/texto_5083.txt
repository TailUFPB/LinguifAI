two women in new jersey are suing the state for one horrific obstacle that is in their path to having children   the women are lesbians  and they say the state is forcing them to have sex with men before they are allowed fertility treatments according to the suit  the women were denied insurance coverage for their fertility treatments because of the wording of an n j  law that requires women to prove their infertility not only through medical diagnosis  but through unprotected heterosexual sex  the law  the four women argue in the suit  discriminates against infertile gay couples trying to conceive state law requires large insurance providers to cover costly fertility treatments for patients medically unable to have children  the couples take issue with how the law defines infertility  which includes the inability to become pregnant after one or two years of unprotected sex  depending on a woman s age  insurance companies have been able to deny coverage to gay patients who  although they have been medically diagnosed infertile  do not fit the definition  the suit says source  new jersey comerin krupas is infertile  her doctor confirmed it  but that s not enough for new jersey law  she needs to prove it by having sex with a man you wouldn t think of a law like this existing in mostly blue new jersey  but remember they did elect chris christie twice  he s still vehemently opposed to marriage equality  despite the fact that it s the law of the land  christie didn t sign this archaic law  but you can bet he has no intention of making lives better for lgbt couples i hate defending insurance companies  but they are caught in the middle here  horizon blue cross blue shield vehemently maintains that they do not discriminate against lgbt couples  but they have to follow state law  they are not being named in the lawsuit here s the video let s all hope this law is overturned  this is state mandated rape  there s no other way to describe it
