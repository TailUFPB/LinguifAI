paul joseph watson nails it again  in the video below  watson does a brilliant job of exposing the hypocrisy of the media and why they are not to be believed or trusted when it comes to offering actual news without a nauseating leftist bias from ned ryan of fox news  you may have heard of the scandal brewing in washington  presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power  signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power  bribes being proffered  and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial u s  natural resources  and what if i told you that foreign power was russia collusion you say  perhaps  collusion with trump  nope i m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before halloween to scare a lot of democrats  bill and hillary clinton and obama administration officials  if you want to take a deeper dive on this issue  read the book  clinton cash   by peter schweizer  president of the government accountability institute  but here are the basics a decade ago  a long time clinton foundation donor  frank giustra  sold his uranium company to another firm  uranium one  with that deal  uranium one now owned uranium mines in the western u s   including wyoming  with about  percent of u s  uranium production capacity  and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the u s in   rosatom  russia s nuclear agency  took a  percent position in uranium one  a year later  in the summer of   rosatom bought majority control of the uranium one  effectively giving the russian government controlled entity proprietary access to one fifth of the u s  uranium supply and then there s that whole phony trump russian dossier story watch  as paul joseph watson destroys the liberal media for force feeding their viewers with    phony trump russian coverage  without having so much as one actual identifiable or legitimate source to back up their assertions  but when actual evidence is put forth about real collusion with the russians by hillary clinton and the dnc for the purposes of affecting the outcome of the election   the media goes silent enjoy
