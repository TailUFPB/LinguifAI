republicans are in full blown panic mode as over  gopers signed a letter to the rnc begging them to abandon trump to focus on funding down ticket races in order to prevent the party s extinction as donald trump continues to sink in the polls while refusing to curb his extreme rhetoric  many republicans have jumped ship from the party  choosing to vote for hillary clinton instead or not vote at all the republican nominee is even dragging other republicans down with him as democrats have a real good chance of taking back the senate and the house because trump s stink is causing trouble for gop candidates in races across the nation and that s why a multitude of high profile republicans from both past and present have written a letter to rnc chair reince priebus asking him to shift money and resources from the presidential election to down ticket races in an effort to keep republicans in control of congress  we believe that donald trump s divisiveness  recklessness  incompetence  and record breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a democratic landslide  and only the immediate shift of all available rnc resources to vulnerable senate and house races will prevent the gop from drowning with a trump emblazoned anchor around its neck   the letter states   this should not be a difficult decision  as donald trump s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day  politico reports that it lists several of trumps major stumbles since he threw his hat in the ring in june of last year including his offensive racist remarks about mexicans and muslims  his ties to russia  and his attacks against a gold star family  and that doesn t include his most recent outrageous statements  which include calling president obama the  founder of isis  and calling for gun nuts to assassinate hillary clinton  those recent outrages have built on his campaign of anger and exclusion  during which he has mocked and offended millions of voters  including the disabled  women  muslims  immigrants  and minorities   the letter continues   he also has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies  including threats to ban an entire religion from entering the country  order the military to break the law by torturing prisoners  kill the families of suspected terrorists  track law abiding muslim citizens in databases  and use executive orders to implement other illegal and unconstitutional measures  and they go on to argue in favor of halting funds earmarked for trump s campaign and re routing the money to other campaigns  trump s divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates  but to our party and the nation every dollar spent by the rnc on donald trump s campaign is a dollar of donor money wasted on the losing effort of a candidate who has actively undermined the gop at every turn  rather than throwing good money after bad  the rnc should shift its strategy and its resources to convince voters not to give hillary clinton the  blank check  of a democrat controlled congress to advance her big government agenda  again  over  republicans  including many heavy hitters  signed this letter to the rnc just like  republican national security experts signed a letter denouncing the billionaire mogul earlier this week and on the same day as details of this current letter are released  republican strategist matt mackowiak summed up the gop disgust with trump and their worry over how he is affecting the party  ok  this shit s not funny anymore   he wrote on twitter   trump is threatening elected gopers at all levels in places that haven t been competitive in decades  we are looking at an extinction level event  this is the ultimate proof that republicans know that hillary is going to destroy them in november even though they really only have themselves to blame for creating the political climate that gave rise to an extremist opportunist like trump in the first place  so it s just a matter of waiting and seeing if we should get the tombstone ready for the republican party as a whole featured image  baystateconservativenews com
