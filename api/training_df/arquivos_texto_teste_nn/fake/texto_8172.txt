oklahoma state university student  sherene zarrabi loves fashion  she is so fond of it  in fact  that she found a job working at a clothing store called danity hooligan while she went to school  but now her beloved job is a thing of the past and it is all because of one extremely nasty boss  a body shaming email and the young woman s respect for herself while she worked at danity hooligan she also ran the store s instagram page  during her down time at work  she would try on some of the store s clothes  snap a picture and post it on the social media website as a form of advertising high buns and combat boots are my new thing  and apparently mirror selfies are my new thing also   fallfashion  combatboots  highbun  selfiea photo posted by sherene zarrabi   sherenemarie  on nov    at   pstwhen i m bored at work  i take shameless mirror pics to show off my extra comfy outfit  fall clothes make me so happy       fallfashion  ootda photo posted by sherene zarrabi   sherenemarie  on nov    at   pstyou d think her boss would be thrilled  right apparently  not so much  instead of rewarding her for the time and effort she put into the business  her boss sent an email to the store manager complaining that sherene didn t have a  model  figure the email reads  something i want to make sure you keep in mind  i want size small  the stereotypical  model  type to model our clothes  please use our pictures of our models if stillwater can t find someone who would be considered  model material   this is not to put anyone down but to communicate the expectations of presenting our brand don t take it personal  all i ask is for really good representation  in exchange for the freedom  i ask you to take down all pictures of anyone that doesn t fit the criteria  don t take it personal   really first of all  this young lady is a beautiful woman and she looked amazing in those clothes  this vile human being was lucky to have such a lovely girl in their clothing secondly  no woman should ever be made to feel as if they are not good enough no matter what size they are  body shaming is disgusting and has no place in our society fortunately  sharene gave zero f cks what her boss thought of her and she responded by promptly quitting and writing the following statement on facebook this is an email i was forwarded earlier  i just want to start by saying this  i am fully comfortable with who i am and the way i look  i have recently been attacked and discriminated against by the owner of dainty hooligan  she went on our stores instagram and deleted all of the pictures where i was modeling the clothing and then sent this email to my manager  i do not want to respresent or support a business that has such archaic values and beliefs  this is the reason young girls have body image issues  this is disgusting  i quit immediately and i suggest that my friends and family do not support dainty hooligan  love yourself  no matter what you look like bravo she is exactly right and the best response to that horrible email was removing herself from such a toxic environment  frankly  if the store owner does not respect all women  they have no business selling clothes to us  women have enough issues with body image as it is  we really don t need someone else shaming us  featured image from facebook  h t winning democrats
