not too many people had heard of bernie sanders until recently  although a senator  sanders doesn t come from a famous political family  nor is he a party favorite  however  sanders has taken the country by storm and ignited an energy and excitement for the political process not seen in decades  that s because sanders  ideas have hit home for many people  his new campaign ad for the presidency sums up his policies in such an impassioned way that it will leave you in tears  the ad begins with the statement  what does it mean to lead a moral life  when we talk about morality  and when we talk about hope  we have to understand that there is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little  there is no justice when the top    owns almost as much wealth as the bottom    sanders also touches on the fact that  millions of people are working long hours  but unable to feed their children  and the fact that the united states today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any country in the developed world  instead  sanders says we use our money for the wrong reasons  how can we talk about morality and justice when we turn our backs on the children of our country  we have in this country sufficient amounts of money to put more people in jail than any other country on earth but apparently we do not have enough money to provide jobs and education to our young people  the touching four minute ad continues to hit on topics vital to the interests of millions of americans including healthcare  to all people as a right  all of the people  the poor and the wretched have a right to go to the doctor when they are sick  bernie sanders  ideas resonate with many americans because he s been able to eloquently bring to light issues that the majority of politicians lack the courage in tackling   he s the most genuine presidential candidate in generations watch video here featured image via video screenshot
