bristol palin is no smarter than her mother  half term governor of alaska  sarah  however  she sure does think she knows a lot about a lot of things  as if being an abstinence activist who has had two out of wedlock children weren t enough  bristol has also decided that she is some kind of racism expert ever since black actors and their allies have decided to boycott the oscars because  for the second year in a row  they have no black stars nominated for their prestigious awards  white folks all over the place have been telling black america at large that there s no problem here  when we all know damn well there is  now  bristol palin has added her voice to the mix she said that she agrees with fox contributor stacey dash  who wants to ride the world of pesky  racist institutions such as bet and black history month  this is bad enough coming from the clueless star  who is black herself  to refresh  dash said the following  either we want to have segregation or integration  if we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like bet and the bet awards and the  image awards  now  lily white bristol palin goes and blogs about something that in no way concerns her  taking to her own blog  bristol wrote  i have to admit  i don t know who  waka flocka  is  or what he sings  but i agree with him on this  though  didn t mention stacey by name  isn t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly  we shouldn t segregate ourselves or limit black history month to one month a year  i wish things were really colorblind  i don t know how other people think about it  but i hope my son sees early on   that not everyone gets a trophy  and this is the problem with people like stacey dash and bristol palin  ignoring problems like racism doesn t make them go away  in fact  it always them to fester and grow under cover of dark  exposing these things is how we rid the world of them  these actors and their supporters are taking on a systemic problem no  you privileged  clueless little girl  this isn t about trophies and segregation  this is about uncovering the truth and telling it like it is  in an effort to right wrongs that are centuries old and counting then again  i don t expect you to know anything about that featured image via video screen capture
