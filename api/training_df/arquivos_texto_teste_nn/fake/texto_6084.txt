conservative commentator and trump hater bill kristol has been hinting at a third party alternative to the gop frontrunner for months  on friday  kristol tweeted that he had indeed found his candidate  and that he was the true principled conservative who would offer voters something real and unique well  it s been announced who this republican savior is and it s national review writer and constitutional lawyer david french the man with absolutely no name recognition is the alternative to trump   a guy who literally has his name plastered on skyscrapers congratulations  republicans  you ve managed to make yourselves look more stupid than you already have  they could have put romney on the ticket  who may have been the best choice to take on clinton and trump  in a moment of irony  just a week ago  french was calling on romney to run third party  saying he was the  only hope  for the gop s survival  how about that  not even the current third party candidate thinks he s good enough and french doesn t even fit the description of what kristol and his allies were searching for  according to bloomberg politics according to one person deeply involved in the efforts to recruit an independent challenger  the search has focused on individuals who have one or more of the following three traits seen as vital for credibly launching such a bid  fame  vast wealth  and elective experience oh  and there s one more harbinger  french hasn t actually officially announced his candidacy  so kristol s only pick might no actually file to run in the first place whereas french may be conservative  he is more principled than trump  while the gop blowhard has multiple draft deferments and rips off veteran s organizations  french is an iraq war veteran and a recipient of the bronze star and french  like kristol  has had a few words to say about donald trump  in march  french wrote a blistering critique of the real estate mogul titled  what now  conservatives   likening him to segregationist george wallace the party of lincoln is in ruins  a minority of its primary voters have torched its founders  legacy by voting for a man who combines old school democratic ideology  a bizarre form of hyper violent isolationism  fringe conspiracy theories and serial lies with an enthusiastic flock of online racists to create perhaps the most toxic electoral coalition since george wallace how do you know french is a true republican  he thinks trump ruined the gop when it clearly was george w  bush  oh  and he once referred to planned parenthood as  disgusting   so that gives you an insight as to how he feels about women s reproductive health so maybe french isn t all that better than donald trump  republicans just aren t ready for an orange man with a bad comb over and tiny hands to ruin their party featured image via   fm wibc
