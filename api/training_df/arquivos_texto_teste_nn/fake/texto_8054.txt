desperate times call for desperate measures  or something like that  and that s exactly what floundering republican presidential candidate jeb bush has resorted to in what could be considered the lamest attempt ever to pander to the right wing  who loves their guns more than  well  pretty much anything  jeb bush decided he would tweet out a pic of his brand new fancy gun with his name engraved on it with the caption   america   honestly  if you haven t vomited by now  prepare yourself  because in a moment  you just may america  pic twitter com   jeb bush   jebbush  february    wasn t long after jeb tweeted this image that he likely got exactly what he was aiming for  pun intended   he received a follow from the national rifle association on twitter  apparently  they weren t following him already  and jeb knew that if he had any hope of doing well in the south  he d have to up his gun toting game  and it worked check out the interaction that was captured via tweetdeck tweetdeck via thetrace orgsweet that we can watch that romance bloom in real time  huh as it turns out  it was revealed last fall that bush  while having an a  rating with the nra  didn t actually own a firearm  however  all that has changed now with the tweet of the candidate s manhood new gun  and of course  he had it engraved  although  i wouldn t put it past his mom to have put his name on it for him  as she likely did on his underwear when he went away to camp as a teenager apparently  this sort of pandering knows no boundaries  and it has paid off for the former governor of florida with his new deplorable follower who prefers endless amounts of gun sales with no restrictions over common sense reform and saving lives  you know  we all have our priorities  the nra s just happens to be profit motivated  and now jeb has fallen in lockstep behind them  pretty pathetic  yet not at all surprising featured image  twitter flickr
