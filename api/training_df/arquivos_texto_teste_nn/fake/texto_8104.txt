donald trump isn t exactly a stranger to making large groups of people angry   women  african americans  hispanics  muslims  and mainstream republicans all despise the donald  one group  however  has always strongly supported him   the stupid part of america   and he s about to lose them  too  trump s popularity with conservatives has soared since he began screaming about a god he will never actually understand  baby parts  and other favorite talking points of theirs   but his recent remarks about planned parenthood may lose him a lot of support among the segment of the population who are dumb enough to fall for heavily edited propaganda videos at the insanely heated gop debate  ted cruz managed to trick the donald into defending planned parenthood  during one of the screaming matches between trump and cruz that have become rather commonplace  the texas senator accused the billionaire of supporting federal funding of planned parenthood  eventually  he managed to goad trump into supporting planned parenthood  though the donald still spoke out against abortion  but let me say more blunt donald you notice didn t agree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for planned parenthood and donald has this weird pattern  when you point to his own record he screams  liar  liar  liar     cruz said  pointing out that trump has  in the past  said planned parenthood does  wonderful things   trump replied  it does do wonderful things  but not as it relates to abortion  there are wonderful things having to do with women s health  but not when it comes to abortion  planned parenthood absolutely does do wonderful things  but unlike trump s assertion  those wonderful things include giving women access to a safe  sanitary abortion if they choose to have one  planned parenthood also provides numerous irreplaceable services to women that have nothing at all to do with abortion  as well as informs women of alternatives to terminating a pregnancy   like adoption  in fact  only three percent of the organization s services are abortion related unfortunately for trump  this moment of honesty about planned parenthood will haunt him right up until election day   because conservatives simply don t care about women watch the exchange below featured image via screengrab
