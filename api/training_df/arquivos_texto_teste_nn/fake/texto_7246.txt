hillary clinton is about to step up the fight against senate republicans and their refusal to give constitutional hearings to supreme court nominee merrick garland despite his impressive resume  including a stint prosecuting the worst domestic terrorist in america  most republicans have refused to even give garland a standard meeting  let alone give him an up or down vote in the senate in a speech about the supreme court that clinton is scheduled to deliver at the university of wisconsin at madison  the democratic front runner is expected to single out iowa sen  chuck grassley and challenge him to hold hearings on the nomination of merrick garland to fill the supreme court seat vacated last month by the death of antonin scalia  according to a campaign official clinton has spoken out forcefully against the republicans  intransigence to hold nominating hearings  accusing the gop of implicit racism in ignoring president barack obama s nominee  and noting that it has never taken the senate more than  days to vote on a supreme court nomination even controversial supreme court nominees offered up by republican presidents  like justices alito and roberts and nominee robert bork  were given hearings and subjected to a vote by the u s  senate republicans have offered several phony excuses for the opposition to garland  including the strange claim that the senate shouldn t act on nominees in the last year of a presidency  historical precedent has already shown that that isn t true republican leaders with no actual role in garland s nomination  like speaker paul ryan  have also chimed in against an up or down vote but polling shows that an overwhelming majority of americans  including many republicans  believe that garland deserves a fair hearing  in response  some republicans have already given in on sitting down and having a discussion with the nominee  particularly those in blue or purple states who face re election this year against strong democratic candidates the rest of the republicans opposed to a garland hearing are already facing the prospect of having their obstruction linked to highly unpopular presidential candidate donald trump  trump has made the same arguments against a garland hearing as his republican allies  and some  like senator john mccain  r az  are facing advertising tying them in with trump s position here  among others despite arizona s history as a republican state  the most recent polling has shown mccain tied with his democratic challenger  maybe he and his colleagues will stop the garland blockade featured image via flickr
