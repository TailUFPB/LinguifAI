holy moly  we ve been covering the fbi agent who was fired for his  anti trump tweets but now this bombshell the agent is the one who quickly looked over thousands of emails from the weiner computer and said there was nothing there  you can bet this is now a big problem for the fbi  president trump is correct when he says the  fbi is in tatters reddit reported our previous report on the fired anti trump fbi agent  this is an interesting development in the mueller investigation because we don t trust the fbi  is this new news from the new york times an effort to make mueller and mccabe appear unbiased  we re not buying it because this guy was the lead investigator in the hillary email case really    talk about compromised  please see our previous report below on the fbi giving  special status  to hillary s email investigation robert mueller kicked a  top fbi agent  off the special counsel investigation this summer over potential anti trump texts he sent  per a new report today according to the new york times  peter strzok not only  helped lead  the investigation into hillary clinton s emails  but he  played a major role  in the trump russia investigation but he is no longer on the investigation mr  strzok was reassigned this summer from mr  mueller s investigation to the f b i  s human resources department  where he has been stationed since  the people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which mr  strzok and a colleague reacted to news events  like presidential debates  in ways that could appear anti trump abc news reported back in august that strzok had left the investigation  but said at the time  it s unclear why strzok stepped away from mueller s team of nearly two dozen lawyers  investigators and administrative staffers  and the washington post s report today on strzok contains some rather  well  personal details during the clinton investigation  strzok was involved in a romantic relationship with fbi lawyer lisa page  who worked for deputy director andrew mccabe  according to the people familiar with the matter  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue the extramarital affair was problematic  these people said  but of greater concern among senior law enforcement officials were text messages the two exchanged during the clinton investigation and campaign season  in which they expressed anti trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor clinton officials are now reviewing the communications to see if they show evidence of political bias in their work on the cases  a review which could result in a public report  according to people familiar with the matter  via  mediaitefbi investigators gave  special status  to hillary friday on fox news channel s  fox   friends   rep  matt gaetz  r fl  said evidence had been uncovered showing that the fbi gave the investigation of  democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s improper use of an unauthorized email server while secretary of state a  special status  according to the florida republican  who is also a member of the house judiciary committee  the process afforded to clinton was different than it would have been for  any other american  we now have evidence that the fbi s investigation of hillary clinton did not follow normal and standard procedures   he said   the current deputy director of the fbi andrew mccabe sent emails just weeks before the presidential election saying that the hillary clinton investigation would be special   that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters  that it would be given special status  goetz called for an immediate investigation  i am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the fbi gave hillary clinton  rep  gaetz   i am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the fbi gave hillary clinton    ingrahamangle pic twitter com ehkqfyewdk  fox news   foxnews  november    member of the house judiciary committee goetz is calling for an investigation into why hillary clinton s fbi case was labelled  special  by the fbi s andrew mccabe the hill reports shortly before last year s election  fbi deputy director andrew mccabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the hillary clinton email probe had been given  special  status  according to documents released wednesday mccabe s oct      email to press officials in the fbi said the probe was under the control of a small group of high ranking people at the fbi s headquarters in washington  as i now know the decision was made to investigate it at hq with a small team   mccabe wrote in the email  he said he had no input when the clinton email investigation started in summer   while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the fbi s washington office   provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a  special  and i was not given any details about it   he wrote fbi officials on wednesday night refused to answer what mccabe meant by calling the clinton email probe a  special  or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began  we don t have anything to add to the documents that were released   bureau spokeswoman carol cratty wrote the hill the note was contained in more than  pages of emails the fbi released on its public records site known as the vault the emails chronicled mccabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s  campaign for political office mccabe s references to a  special  status for the clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by republican lawmakers critical of former fbi director james comey s handling of the clinton investigation remember that the doj s loretta lynch also wanted clinton s case to be called an  incident  and not an investigation  it looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect clinton  was it to save themselves from exposure in the uranium one case or something else
