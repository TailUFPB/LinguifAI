when it comes to donald trump  there s really not much you can believe that comes out of his mouth except for what can only be assumed is a putrid odor  and this is explained by the fact that he talks out of his ass beautifully proving this point was none other than last week tonight s john oliver in a segment utterly dismantling trump s plan for a border wall with mexico point by point  down to the size  capability  location  and price tag  oliver successfully turns trump s plan into a decaying pile of pig shit  it s absolute nonsense  and better plans have been constructed on the back of a napkin at chuck e cheese by a desperate father brainstorming his escape from the chaos however  knowing that this  great wall  is pretty much one of the few things trump talks about  oliver said  the border wall is one of the few policy proposals trump has talked about in detail  so instead of mocking or dismissing it out of hand  tonight let s take a serious proposal by a serious presidential candidate seriously  it was then that the dismantling began  and there was absolutely no refuting it  and no matter how much the wall costs  oliver points out that according to the sierra club   the congressional budget office estimates that wall maintenance costs will exceed the initial construction costs within seven years  he then used this brilliant comparison  it s a big  dumb thing that only gets more expensive over time  it s like getting a pet walrus  you think it s stupid now  wait until you learn what a bucket of sea cucumbers costs  you ve not prepared for that  which pretty much sums up the realism of the wall and how it s going to be built and maintained  because mexico has made it damn clear they re not going to be the ones paying for it  and if you need proof that this wall is just simply never going to happen  the washington post fact checked everything right here trump has no plans to actually build this wall  he has no plans for anything  he s talking out of his ass  and because so many americans are racist shiteaters  they gleefully consume every last ounce of his poppycock kudos to oliver for this brilliant takedown  well f cking done featured image via video screen capture
