the republican race towards the white house is getting more terrifying by the day  we have the front runner  donald trump  saying at his rallies that not only does he want his crowd of supporters to be violent towards protesters  but he s also saying that he ll pay their legal fees  now  we have ted cruz  who s currently in second place  saying that he ll back trump unless he were to shoot someone cruz  while being interviewed monday and asked if he s still sticking to his loyalty pledge to back the republican nominee  said  well  i can give you one example where i would no longer support donald trump  if  for example  he were to go out on fifth avenue and shoot somebody  i would not be willing to support donald trump  cruz is referring to when trump said that his supporters love him so much  he could even shoot someone in the middle of fifth avenue and they would still love him when pressed on the subject of violence at trump rallies by a reporter and if he has reconsidered his pledge due to recent developments  cruz insisted that he ll still back trump  cruz said  i know it is a shocking concept to member of the media  a shocking concept that an elected official actually does what he said  at the outset of this campaign i committed  i will support the republican nominee  and i honor my word  this clearly shows cruz s inflexibility on evolving situations  and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he does not belong in the white house  being president includes being able to gather and process to information and intelligence and make the best decision for the nation depending on that information honestly  if people are still voting republican at this point we should question their sanity  we literally have the top republican presidential candidate encouraging violence against others  and the next in line saying he ll back that sort of behavior  unless  of course  he were to actually  shoot somebody   we  as americans  should not only be ashamed  we should be terrified that one of these men has a very real shot at being leader of the free world here s the video via raw story featured image via video screen capture
