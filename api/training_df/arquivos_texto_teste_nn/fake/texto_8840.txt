arthur laffer  known for inspiring republican economic ideology since the reagan era  and largely considered to be the father of supply side economics  has just come out with another prediction  no  not another false trickle down theory of  if you cut taxes on the rich  governmental revenues will somehow maximize  and we ll all be better off   this time he is weighing in on the outcome of the  election not only does he think republicans will win in a  landslide   he thinks they re going to win practically every state  here s what he told host john catsimatidis on new york s am  on sunday  i would be surprised if the republicans don t take      states out of the   i mean  i think we re going to landslide this election  that s some estimation on his part  the last time that happened was when walter mondale was running for president against ronald reagan  that was three decades ago   this guy must still be living in the   since then most economists have come out on the record stating his economic theories have been wrong  and that  trickle down  economics is straight up bogus  his  laffer curve  even has it s own laughable tag line  laughing at the laffer  curve  governmental revenues have declined since it was first implemented  giving tax cuts to the rich that ultimately hurt the economy and the federal government s source of income  still  that hasn t kept him from being a big wig within top republican circles  hey   rich guys like their tax cuts  we get it  now they ll do anything and everything to keep on justifying those lower tax rates they have become accustomed to here s what else he had to say in the interview  when i look at these candidates  i don t see one of them who wouldn t do a great job as president  i think donald trump is phenomenal  i think rand paul has done a great job  i even like jeb bush   i think jeb bush is great  he did a wonderful job in florida  chris christie   phenomenal  he also took a few jabs at hillary clinton  but pretended to be nice about it  saying that her  day is over  we get that he s a fan of republicans  but there is no hard data to suggest even what he is predicting  it would be interesting if he could cite some source or reference for why he thinks republicans are going to win practically every state  or why he would be  surprised  if they didn t  yet   he doesn t provide any of that if his  election prediction is anything like his economic policies  you can rest assured it s flat out wrong featured image via laffer center
