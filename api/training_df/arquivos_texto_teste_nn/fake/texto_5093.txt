gop congressman steve king  r ia  had endorsed republican nominee donald trump after ted cruz ended his presidential campaign  but a recent statement of his is raising some eyebrows   he actually praised trump s rival in a speech on thursday  king told a crowd at the iowa state fair that he and democratic nominee hillary clinton can barely see eye to eye on anything and if he were to be re elected  he ll break out of my shell if i have to do battle with an agenda that iowans reject   however  king said the former secretary of state is  somebody i can work with  if she were to win this election  king s full statement to the audience  as quoted by the des moines register s jason noble  was  if it s hillary clinton  we don t agree on very much  so you ll probably see me become a vocal member of congress if you should elect me to go back to washington after november but i also know that i ve sat across the table with hillary clinton eye to eye  and when you re working outside of staff and outside of press  she is somebody i can work with  you can listen to king s remarks below that almost sounds like resignation to the fact that trump is destroying his campaign and dragging the gop down with him  coming from an elected republican like king  this is a pretty powerful statement   especially considering all that the republican party has done to smear clinton s name  of course  king is still going to vote for trump in november  but it sounds like he s coming around to accepting clinton as the probable next president of the united states clinton has been smart in recognizing that so many anti trump moderate gopers are looking for their place in this election  and she is positioning herself as someone who can unite people  clearly  it is working  as trump continues to grow more insane and violent in his rhetoric  we can only expect to see more statements like this coming from prominent gopers featured image via darren mccollester   getty images
