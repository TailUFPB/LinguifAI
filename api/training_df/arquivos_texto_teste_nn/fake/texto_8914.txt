a new analysis by the tax foundation  a nonpartisan research group devoted to educating taxpayers  shows that some of the most conservative states in the nation are the most dependent on the federal government  really  how can this be  you say  republicans hate the federal government  right  while some conservative states certainly do  the reddest states  most particularly the bible belt in the south  actually rely on uncle sam far more than the most liberal states in the nation  it s pretty hilarious  actually looking at the data  you ll see that five of the ten most conservative states in the country are considered to be in the top   out of   that are most reliant on the federal government  the numbers are calculated as a share of government revenue coming from the fed  as opposed to self reliant sources within their own state  each state is given a percentage  located on the map below   this can include medicaid payments  education funding  infrastructure financing  grants  etc pic via gallopgo ahead and take a look  you will see that mississippi is   in both categories  it s the most conservative and the neediest  that s just one example  we have a feeling that each state would turn blue real quick if republicans got their way on most of their economic policies directed towards the poor  this proves that some of the most conservative states in the country would barely be able to get by without the federal government pic via washington postsee where california ranks  not only is it the most populous  by far   but it s considered to be one of the top six most liberal states  you know  the sort that passes all kinds of progressive reforms conservatives claim to hate  well  guess what  it s one of the least dependent on uncle sam  that s right   the state s liberal politicians do a better job generating revenue by itself   i e  creating jobs  making sure education is a priority  all those liberal ideas that actually make a difference in people s lives   without needing as much help it s information like this that is sure to blow the mind of any republican reading it   that is if they re open minded enough to digest objective facts  but  we know better than this  conservatives don t care about facts  they just know they hate welfare   anyone else receiving welfare  just not the monies they personally get featured image via wikipedia
