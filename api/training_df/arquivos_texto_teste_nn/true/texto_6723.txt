washington  reuters    from syria s bloody civil war and the slow burning crisis in eastern ukraine to perennial diplomatic headaches such as the north korean and iranian nuclear programs  rex tillerson would face a messy  complex world as the chief u s  diplomat  below are brief descriptions of some of the problems that will land on his plate if he is confirmed by the u s  senate as the  u s  secretary of state after a career spent at exxon mobil corp  where he rose to be chief executive  tillerson will inherit an increasingly complex conflict in syria  where the rebel held eastern portion of aleppo is on the verge of falling to syrian government forces backed by russia  iran and shi ite militias from lebanon and iraq  the civil war  now well into its sixth year  pits president bashar al assad against a range of rebel groups  many supported by outside powers including the united states  turkey and gulf states such as saudi arabia and qatar  during the u s  presidential campaign  president elect donald trump suggested his top priority was defeating the islamic state militant group that has launched attacks in europe and inspired mass casualty attacks in the united states  if trump cooperates with russia against islamic state  which holds a swath of northeastern syria  there is a risk that moderate rebels  angered by what they viewed as abandonment by the united states  could gravitate toward militant islamist factions that pose a potential threat to western interests  moreover  the persistent bloodshed could unleash new and destabilizing waves of refugees into neighboring nations from which they could then attempt to reach europe  earlier refugee flows triggered a backlash that has bolstered far right nationalist parties in europe  cooperating with russia would cause other complications for the new u s  administration  for one thing  it could  by extension  align the united states with iran and its lebanese proxy militia  hezbollah  iran has used its ties to syria to project force in the region  a troubling fact for israeli officials not eager to see tehran extend its influence  next door in iraq  tillerson will confront a country struggling to overcome deep ethnic and sectarian divisions as it fights to stamp out the islamic state insurgency with the help of some   u s  support troops and military advisers  even if iraqi security forces prevail in retaking the islamic state stronghold of mosul  the country s second largest city  the extremist group is expected to revert to waging a guerrilla war against the shi ite dominated central government  if so  that could force trump and tillerson to decide whether the united states should remain engaged   and attempt to counterbalance the powerful influence of neighboring shi ite led iran   or play a diminished role  tillerson also may face a renewed drive by iraq s minority kurds  trained and armed by the united states to fight islamic state  for independence for their oil rich autonomous northern region  such a move  which the united states has opposed  would raise the threat of a conflict between the kurds and baghdad that could affect the international petroleum market  it could also fuel demands by kurds in syria and in turkey for greater autonomy  a prospect that turkish officials bitterly oppose  north korea s secretive  authoritarian government has conducted five nuclear tests over the past decade  four of them during the obama administration and two this year alone  along with an unprecedented flurry of ballistic missile tests  the north s tests have brought tighter u n  security council sanctions  including some passed last month that aim to cut its export earnings by a quarter  but no sign that pyongyang s young leader  kim jong un  is willing to restrain its nuclear and missile programs  reclusive  impoverished north korea poses a direct threat to rich  democratic south korea  a u s  treaty ally that technically remains in a state of war with pyongyang because the   korean war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty  the north regularly threatens to destroy the south and the united states  which maintains about   troops in south korea as a tripwire to deter north korean from attacking  north korea said after its september nuclear test that it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile  if it developed an effective intercontinental ballistic missile  or icbm  it could strike the continental united states  trump has harshly criticized the agreement struck on july     between iran and six major powers under which tehran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions  many republicans  particularly in the u s  congress  have argued that the deal  negotiated by the united states  britain  china  france  germany and russia  should be torn up  while trump has been critical of the agreement  it is not certain he would actually abrogate it  for one thing  israeli officials quietly say that they prefer to have iran live under the deal s restraints and subject to its transparency measures  than totally freed from both  which could allow them to race to acquire nuclear weapons  further  if the united states were to be blamed for the agreement s collapse  it would be unlikely to find much sympathy among its european allies to reimpose sanctions on tehran  even if the deal holds  tillerson may have his hands full trying to find ways to counter iranian support for syria s assad  hezbollah in lebanon and the houthis  the militia fighting the saudi backed government in yemen  tillerson may quickly find himself dealing with a crisis of trump s own making with china given beijing s angry response to the republican president elect s view that washington did not necessarily have to stick to its long standing position that taiwan is part of  one china   if he were to upend some four decades of settled u s  policy  trump risks antagonizing beijing  which could decide to restrict cooperation with the united states or  if truly pushed  seek to subvert u s  policy aims around the world  the united states has a vast array of interests with china  which is the third largest destination for exports of u s  goods and the largest source of goods imported into the u s  market  china is also the largest holder of u s  government debt  among the areas where the two sides have worked together under the obama administration are maintaining growth in the world economy  reining in the iranian nuclear program and seeking to combat climate change  they have also had disagreements over north korea and china s maritime claims      russia seized the majority russian speaking crimea from ukraine on march     after an uprising toppled ukraine s pro russian president  ukraine  the united states and many governments in western europe also say that moscow has armed and encouraged pro russian separatists in eastern ukraine  and covertly infiltrated russian military personnel  the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian backed separatists has cost nearly   lives since   germany and france have tried with little success to convince both sides to implement a peace deal agreed to in minsk last year  the kremlin denies western charges that it is stoking the separatist movement and aiding the rebels and accuses ukraine of perpetuating the violence and violating the minsk deal  the united states and the european union have imposed a range of economic sanctions on russia as a result of its annexation of crimea and its actions in eastern ukraine  trump has said that better relations with russia could be a great benefit to the united states and there are suspicions that he and his nominee for secretary of state might be inclined to ease the western sanctions on russia  one u s  official said there might be a deal to be done if russian president vladimir putin were willing to abide by the minsk peace deal  or to agree to something similar under a different name  in return for sanctions relief  trump has given few specifics on his plans for afghanistan  where nearly   u s  troops remain more than  years after the islamist taliban were toppled by u s  backed afghan forces  trump has said  however  that the united states should stop carrying out  nation building   something it has been seeking to do for a decade and a half in the southwestern asian nation  one of the most important questions facing trump on afghanistan  former officials and experts say  is how many u s  troops will stay on there  acknowledging that afghan security remained precarious and taliban forces had gained ground in some places  president barack obama shelved plans to cut the u s  presence almost in half by year s end  opting instead to keep   troops there through to the end of his presidency in january  a number of provincial capitals have been under pressure from the taliban  while afghan forces have been suffering high casualty rates  with more than   killed in the first eight months of
