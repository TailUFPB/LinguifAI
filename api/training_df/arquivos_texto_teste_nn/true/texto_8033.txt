new york  reuters    john kerry had heard enough  after last week s bombing of a u n  aid convoy in syria dealt a death blow to a ceasefire deal in which he had invested all his diplomatic capital with russia  the u s  secretary of state tossed aside a page of notes and looked at russian foreign minister sergei lavrov across the horseshoe shaped table in the u n  security council   i listened to my colleague from russia  and i sort of felt a little bit like they re sort of in a parallel universe here   said a visibly angry kerry  effectively calling lavrov a liar for blaming the united states for spoiling the ceasefire  the moment in some ways captured the former politician s time as the top u s  diplomat  which will end with a new administration in january  not for the first time  kerry had invested months of intensive diplomacy and tireless traveling on an issue only to end up feeling let down or deceived by negotiating partners  on syria  kerry has wanted greater u s  involvement than president barack obama was willing to support  in an interview on friday with reuters  kerry said lavrov s  blatant obfuscation of reality     took my breath away   the attempted syria ceasefire was his most ambitious effort to fix what some argue was the biggest foreign policy misstep of obama s administration  which began with the failure in  to follow through on a  red line  threat against syrian president bashar al assad over the use of chemical weapons  kerry hammered out the truce two weeks ago  but was left pleading in vain with russia last week to halt renewed air strikes on the besieged city of aleppo   james dobbins  a former u s  special envoy to afghanistan  noted kerry s  tireless  ceaseless engagement  even when pursuing administration policies he didn t always agree with   kerry to his credit has stayed in the game even when he had a weak hand   said dobbins  a career diplomat who worked alongside kerry in  to hammer out a deal with president hamid karzai to keep u s  forces in afghanistan    the situation in syria is too serious and too consequential to simply back off and leave it to others    from kerry s perspective  it is better to fail than not to have tried   the weakest hand of all would be to have another round of migrants going into europe   russian president vladimir  putin do whatever he wants by dropping bombs and the united states doing nothing but pretending we re sending some support to people   kerry told reuters   that is the weakest hand  and it is far stronger to stand up and find a way to leverage getting to the table and getting some kind of an understanding   he added  in his nearly four years as america s top diplomat  kerry has racked up more miles than any other secretary of state  sometimes appearing to rush in without a clear strategy   it is clear that kerry is prepared to take greater risks with his own personal reputation than others might have     because they did not want to be identified with failure   said dobbins      but some critics say kerry stayed in the game too long in negotiating with russia  which they argue manipulated his quest for a deal over syria to strengthen its position  the syrian conflict  with its shifting geopolitical forces  complex new alliances and new threats such as the rise of islamic state  has tested kerry like no other issue  after obama declined to carry out threatened attacks on assad s forces over chemical weapons  kerry perceived an opening to work with lavrov on an agreement to get syria to turn over its chemical arsenal  he told reuters  that deal struck in  was considered a success  but the war has since deteriorated and grown more complex following russia s military intervention backing assad last year  now the continuing ceasefire push by kerry strikes some as hopeless gesturing   kerry s plan is to do more of the same despite the repeated failure of u s  attempts to strike a deal with russia   said mutasem alsyofi of the syrian civil society declaration initiative  who met kerry in new york last week  it s not the first time kerry s been accused of overreaching  at the start of his term in   kerry vigorously pursued a peace deal between the israelis and palestinians   even as others warned of failure  an undaunted kerry spent months shuttling between jerusalem and ramallah  however  u s  ally israel s announcement of  new housing units for jewish settlements in territory the palestinians claim for a future state finally caused the talks to collapse  although israel blamed the palestinians move to apply to join  international conventions and treaties  kerry s biggest accomplishments came in  with the iran nuclear deal and the u n  climate change agreement  in both instances  he had obama s leadership and full support for the very visible u s  role  though both deals have been vilified domestically in the polarized american political environment  last week s failure of a second syrian ceasefire agreement brokered by kerry unleashed a fresh round of stinging criticism of the administration s syria policy  republican senator john mccain called kerry  intrepid but delusional  for placing too much faith in the prospect of cooperation with russia  kerry  a vietnam veteran who lost to george w  bush in the  presidential election  is not running for office again and has often remarked that he has nothing to lose   in this business of diplomacy  you have to test things sometimes   he told reuters   it is a mistake to delude yourself  it is also a mistake to avoid putting something to test where there is a reasonable chance something may be able to happen   hours after the tense exchange at the u n  security council  lavrov and kerry met again  the russian diplomat had brought a new proposal for putting the ceasefire back on track  kerry looked at the sheet of paper  folded it tightly and stuffed it into his top pocket
