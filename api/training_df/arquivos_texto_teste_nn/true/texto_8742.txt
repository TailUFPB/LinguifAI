cleveland washington  reuters    donald trump s choice of mike pence as his vice presidential running mate has irked some republican activists who see the indiana governor s years of opposition to gay rights initiatives as a setback to efforts to broaden the party s appeal  the pick could bolster trump s support among religious conservatives  but it also opens up a new line of attack for democrats and liberals seeking to paint the new york businessman as a divisive candidate  putting at risk his efforts to woo moderate voters ahead of the nov   election against democrat hillary clinton  rachel hoff  the first openly gay member of the republican party s platform committee  has spent time in cleveland ahead of next week s party convention trying repeatedly to get the party to change its official position on gay marriage and adoption by gay couples  she was dismayed by the choice of pence   after the pence announcement  i think the question is   is trump really moderate on gay rights issues  it seems more likely his rhetoric has been a smoke screen   hoff said   there s no substance behind it  by picking pence  trump is signaling his administration may not be any friendlier to the lgbt  lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  community   megan robertson  a republican strategist in indiana who has pushed for the party to be more open to gay members  was similarly disappointed   picking pence shows that he maybe doesn t care about that community as much as he tried to profess that he did   she said of trump  clinton s campaign seized on the announcement to attack pence s record on gay rights issues  saying it  embarrassed  the people of indiana  clinton has previously called trump the most divisive candidate  in our lifetimes   referring to his calls to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants  in   pence found himself at the center of a national uproar when he signed a bill that he said was meant to protect religious liberty  but which critics countered would allow business owners to deny services to gay people   after intense pressure from liberal groups and large corporations  he asked lawmakers to clarify that businesses could not deny services on the basis of sexual orientation  calling it a  subject of great misunderstanding   he has also fought against same sex marriage and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military  a u s  supreme court ruing last year legalized gay marriage nationwide and the pentagon in  ended the ban on openly gay and lesbian people serving in the military  in   while a member of the u s  congress  pence argued against expanding the definition of a hate crime to include sexual orientation  calling it an attempt to  advance a radical social agenda   the federal hate crimes law was expanded to make this inclusion  gay supporters of trump are hopeful pence will have little influence on a potential trump administration   trump has declared himself the most gay friendly candidate in the election  he expressed support for the gay community after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando in june that killed  people  and broke from his party during an argument  about transgender bathroom usage  saying people could use the bathroom of their choosing at his office building trump tower in new york  that has cheered moderate republicans who have been seeking to appeal to younger  more liberal voters   donald trump is the nominee of the party and donald trump is going to set policy   said chris barron  who has launched lgbtrump  a group seeking to encourage gays to vote for trump  pence    comes from a different wing of the divided republican party than trump  one that is dominated by evangelicals in southern and midwestern states  conservatives were elated with his selection   it s the best conservatives could possibly want   said brent bozell  a conservative leader   the pro gay rights group log cabin republicans said it would seek to pressure the republican party at the cleveland national convention to adopt a more gay friendly policy platform  including by running a full page ad in a local paper  the party s platform committee met early in the week to draft official policy positions on myriad issues  the document  which carries little significance beyond the symbolic  calls for a constitutional amendment to reverse the supreme court s decision legalizing gay marriage and included a veiled acceptance of gay conversion therapy  a practice that has widely been criticized as harmful to children  despite the disappointment that gay rights activists are feeling  log cabin republican president gregory angelo said he thinks voters are going to look at trump s past statement on gay rights and not where pence stands  trump has spent little time talking about social issues and has instead focused on immigration and economic issues    donald trump rose to stardom as our presumptive nominee because he showcased an opposition to illegal immigration and unfair trade deals  that s what s resonating with the republican electorate this year   he said
