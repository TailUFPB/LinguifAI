washington  reuters    republican donald trump thrust the u s  supreme court into the presidential campaign debate on wednesday  rallying conservatives with a call for justice ruth bader ginsburg to resign after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews  the presumptive republican presidential nominee led a chorus of outrage over the comments by ginsburg  who described trump as a  faker  and speculated about the possibility of moving to new zealand if he won the white house  in a post midnight counterattack on twitter  trump said the  year old leader of the court s liberal wing had  embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me  her mind is shot   resign   the furor gave trump a cause to help galvanize conservatives divided over his unorthodox candidacy but concerned that the high court is too liberal  a mistrust fueled by recent rulings upholding racial preferences in university admissions and striking down tough abortion restrictions in texas  in three recent interviews  ginsburg questioned how trump had gotten away with not turning over his tax returns and said she could not bear to think about the wealthy real estate developer winning the white house  in response  trump said ginsburg had politicized the supreme court with her comments and suggested she owed her fellow justices an apology   i m questioning her mental capacity   he told fox news channel on wednesday   for her to have done that is an absolute disgrace to the supreme court      other republicans jumped to join the attack  saying ginsburg had proven she could not be an impartial voice on the country s highest court   for someone on the supreme court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president or congress does  that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm   republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on cnn on tuesday  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called her comments  totally inappropriate   while senator john cornyn of texas  the no   senate republican  said ginsburg s statements reflected poorly on her objectivity  the new york times and washington post joined in the rebukes  with the times asking her to uphold the court s tradition of silence in political campaigns and drop the  punditry and name calling   ginsburg s comments could push some on the right who have reservations about trump into his camp  said jonathan adler  a conservative professor at case western reserve university school of law who is not a trump supporter   there are some  not me  who learn to like trump based on the enemies he makes   he said in an email  the controversy erupted as trump prepared for the opening of the july   republican convention  which will formally make him the party s presidential nominee in the nov   election  ginsburg is the senior liberal on the court  which has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative justice antonin scalia died in february   this gives trump the ability to attack not only justice ginsburg but ultimately the authority of the supreme court  that is a very bad situation   said richard painter  a law professor at the university of minnesota law school who served as a lawyer in the white house under republican president george w  bush  u s  supreme court justices are not required to follow the code of judicial conduct that applies to judges on lower federal courts  the code  set by the u s  judicial conference  says judges should not  make speeches for a political organization or candidate  or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office   still  the justices typically try to stay out of the political fray  the court has a sometimes pivotal role as a judicial counterweight to the executive and legislative branches of government  deciding some of the most divisive social issues in american life  in recent years  major rulings legalized gay marriage nationwide and upheld democratic president barack obama s healthcare overhaul   in public remarks earlier this year  chief justice john roberts stressed it was important for the justices not to be seen as political players  saying criticisms of partisanship  which he described as inaccurate  were damaging to the court s reputation   we don t work as democrats or republicans   he said  ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on trump s remarks and the other rebukes  the high court  whose nine justices are nominated by the u s  president to lifetime appointments  had already been caught up in political controversy as the republican controlled u s  senate refused to take up obama s nominee to replace scalia  merrick garland  republicans have said the next president should be allowed to nominate a replacement for scalia  trump has emphasized the importance of naming conservative justices to the court  the next president  potentially serving two four year terms  could have the opportunity to appoint up to three new justices  not including scalia s replacement  ginsburg is the oldest of the justices  justice anthony kennedy turns  on july   while justice stephen breyer turns  in august  some democrats defended ginsburg  with u s  senator jon tester of montana saying  she called him  trump  for what she saw  and senator heidi heitkamp of north dakota saying   i think she s the ultimate determiner of what s appropriate and what isn t   but democratic senator chris murphy of connecticut said   i don t think we re well served by supreme court justices openly expressing their political opinions   asked about ginsburg s remarks  white house spokesman josh earnest responded with a joke referencing a nickname used widely on social media by ginsburg s admirers   she didn t earn the nickname  the notorious r b g   for nothing   he said  the name was inspired by rapper notorious b i g
