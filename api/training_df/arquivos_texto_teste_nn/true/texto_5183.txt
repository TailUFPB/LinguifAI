washington  reuters    president donald trump s signal of a new openness to immigration reform in a speech to the u s  congress did little to win over democrats who would be essential to revamping the nation s immigration laws  any goodwill trump may have sparked with his mention of a chance for  real and positive immigration reform  in tuesday s speech  his first to a joint session of congress  was soon dashed by rhetoric that democrats said tarred and misrepresented most immigrants   the speech he gave was one of the most anti immigrant speeches that we heard any president ever give   senate democratic leader charles schumer said on wednesday  what offended democrats  a minority in both chambers  was trump s reference to past incidents in which one illegal immigrant  viciously gunned down  two california law enforcement officers and another  viciously murdered  a  year old boy  trump built a base of support for his  presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration  including a pledge to build a wall on the u s  mexico border  on becoming president in january  he immediately issued a temporary visa ban against seven muslim majority countries  later blocked by federal courts  he also suspended a refugee program and initiated tougher deportation procedures  major immigration reform efforts failed in congress under trump s predecessors  democratic president barack obama and republican george w  bush  because of deep divisions among lawmakers and americans over the issue  the challenges include how to protect illegal immigrants who came to the united states as children  and how to deal long term with the estimated  million people living in the country without proper documentation  legislation putting illegal immigrants in line for citizenship threatens to alienate trump s core conservative voters  trump said in his speech that reform was possible if both democrats and republicans were willing to compromise      even before tuesday s address  immigration reform minded republicans and democrats in congress were holding informal lunches and dinners  as well as conversations on the floors of the house of representatives and senate about the possibility of trump eventually moderating his stance  the congressional hispanic caucus will meet on thursday and discuss how  or whether  to react to trump s signal of openness to reform at a time when a feeling of  fear and hopelessness  pervades latino communities  one house democratic aide said   republican representative mario diaz balart of florida  a leading voice for overhauling immigration laws  hoped that once the white house dealt with healthcare and tax reforms this year  trump might tackle vexing immigration problems   remember that old adage that only nixon could go to china   said diaz balart  a self described optimist and son of cuban immigrants who has labored for years over immigration laws  he was referring to richard nixon  who in  became the first u s  president to visit the people s republic of china despite having built his political career as the arch enemy of communist governments  after tuesday s speech  a major change in tone will likely be needed for democrats to engage with republicans  democratic representative luis gutierrez of illinois challenged attorney general jeff sessions and trump adviser steve bannon  who have both taken a hard line on illegal immigration  to pledge support for immigration reform   absent that  i don t believe a thing  they  have to say  on the administration s interest in reforming immigration law  gutierrez told reporters  gutierrez is of puerto rican descent and has worked in the past with republicans on immigration legislation  some prominent republicans said progress on the first major immigration reform since  was still possible  senator john mccain of arizona  who helped win senate passage in  of a sweeping bipartisan immigration law rewrite that subsequently died in the house  said of trump s upbeat remarks   i would hope that would open the door for negotiations and support  for legislation  senator jeff flake  an arizona republican who joined with mccain and others in   said if there was an opportunity to go forward  trump would likely want to pair bills that would be supported by opposing sides in the immigration debate  for example  flake speculated  the president might support putting into law temporary protections shielding  dreamers  from deportation   people who entered the united states as children  in return  conservatives could win new legislation on border security or  expedited deportations   he said  a trade off democrats might not want to make
