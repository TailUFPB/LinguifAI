washington  reuters    u s  senate democrats plan to fight some of president elect donald trump s choices for top administration jobs  but history and the party s minority status in the chamber are not on their side  a simple majority of  votes is needed in the  member senate to confirm nominations  louisiana will select its newest senator on saturday  if the republicans  as expected  hold on to the seat  they will control at least  seats in the chamber next year  senate republicans said on thursday they were confident of winning cabinet confirmations early next year  nonetheless  some democrats said they hoped to persuade a few republicans to help them block a trump nominee or two  following the republican trump s inauguration on jan    when a newly installed senate starts reviewing his nominations  that could be just brave talk from democrats  the senate has rejected only nine of  cabinet nominations in u s  history  not counting nominees who have withdrawn when facing certain defeat  according to congressional records  the last rejection was in   when the senate blocked republican president george h w  bush s nomination of senator john tower to be defense secretary  in   democratic president barack obama had trouble getting chuck hagel confirmed as defense secretary  but he ultimately prevailed  this time around  democrats said their top targets included  u s  representative tom price as head of the department of health and human services  and oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt as environmental protection agency administrator  former new york investment banker and hedge fund investor steven mnuchin  tapped by trump to become treasury secretary  is also drawing the ire of democrats  who will be in the minority in both the new senate and house of representatives in   trump s path toward senate confirmations of nominees will be easier than the one faced by most of his predecessors  in   senate democrats  frustrated by republicans blocking obama s choices for federal judges  used their majority status at the time to eliminate  filibusters  against executive and judicial branch nominations  except the supreme court  that meant only  votes were needed for confirmations  rather than   pruitt is a climate change skeptic who has participated in lawsuits trying to stop the epa from carrying out clean air regulations  as a nominee  he will embody  the fossil fuel and anti clean air and clean water movement      i like those odds   democratic senator edward markey said of the fight ahead  in   when in the house  markey was a leader in the fight for legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions  republican senator lindsey graham  who was an ally at the time in that failed battle  said in a brief interview that while he did not know pruitt   i appreciate his passion for fighting back against things he thought were an overreach  by federal agencies  price is high on the democrats  target list  according to a senior senate democratic aide  who asked not to be identified   defending medicare  the federal healthcare program for the elderly  is a top priority of congressional democrats  price supports limiting some medicare benefits  he also opposes government funding for women s healthcare provider planned parenthood  that could help democrats win support for blocking price from moderate republicans such as susan collins or lisa murkowski  the senior aide said  a spokeswoman for murkowski said she had not expressed an opinion on the price nomination  collins and her aides were not immediately available for comment  a second senior senate democratic aide said some republicans up for re election in  could be uncomfortable voting for price because of his medicare stance  but graham said price  has been the heart and soul of the republican alternative to obamacare  i can t imagine any republican voting against him   republican senator jeff sessions has been chosen by trump to be attorney general  democrats plan to highlight his hardline stances on illegal immigration  as well as remind colleagues that a republican controlled senate judiciary committee rejected sessions  nomination for a federal judgeship in  amid allegations that he had made racist remarks  which he denied  if the debate stokes strong opposition to sessions    republicans might have to scramble to win his confirmation  that could especially be true if the alabama lawmaker follows a long held practice of senators of merely voting  present  on their own confirmations  meaning democrats would be one vote closer to defeating him
