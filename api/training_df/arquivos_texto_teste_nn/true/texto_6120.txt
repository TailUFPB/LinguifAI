  this january  story deletes reference to interfax being state run in paragraph   by jonathan landay and arshad mohammed washington  reuters    michael flynn  president elect donald trump s choice for national security adviser  held five phone calls with russia s ambassador to washington on the day the united states retaliated for moscow s interference in the u s  presidential election  three sources familiar with the matter said  the calls occurred between the time the russian embassy was told about u s  sanctions and the announcement by russian president vladimir putin that he had decided against reprisals  said the sources  they spoke on condition of anonymity  citing internal u s  government deliberations about the issue  the calls raised fresh questions among some u s  officials about contacts between trump s advisers and russian officials at a time when u s  intelligence agencies contend that moscow waged a multifaceted campaign of hacking and other actions to boost republican trump s election chances against democrat hillary clinton  on dec    u s  president barack obama announced he had ordered the expulsion of  russian diplomats suspected of being spies and imposed sanctions on two russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking u s  political groups  the administration told russian ambassador to the united states  sergei kislyak  an hour before the decision was made public  one of the sources said  the phone calls between flynn and kislyak were first reported by washington post columnist david ignatius  a trump official confirmed one phone conversation between the two men on dec    and said their understanding was they did not discuss the sanctions  the three sources stressed to reuters that they did not know who initiated the five calls between flynn  a former three star army general who headed the u s  defense intelligence agency under obama  and kislyak  nor did they know the contents of the conversations  and declined to say how they learned of them  one source said there was nothing intrinsically odd or wrong about a russian diplomat speaking to a member of trump s team following the u s  announcement  moscow  the source added  probably would want to have some sense of what trump s team thought about the measures  that sentiment was echoed friday by state department spokesman mark toner   this building doesn t see anything necessarily inappropriate about contact between members of the incoming administration and foreign officials   toner said  the other two sources  however  said the timing of the calls raised a question about whether flynn had given kislyak any assurances to soothe russian anger over the u s  moves  if that were the case  it would have raised a possible entanglement with the logan act  the  law bars unauthorized u s  citizens from negotiating with foreign governments with which the united states has disputes  it is aimed at preventing the undermining of official u s  government positions  alexey mosin  a spokesman for the russian embassy in washington  said   the embassy does not comment on multiple contacts  which are carried out on a daily basis with local interlocutors   flynn raised eyebrows among some u s  foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with putin at a banquet in moscow in late  celebrating russia today  an international broadcasting network funded by the russian government  however  flynn has also expressed skepticism about moscow s intentions   a view that does not seem to fit trump s vision of closer ties with moscow  classified documents that the heads of four u s  intelligence agencies presented last week to trump included  unsubstantiated information compiled by a private security firm suggesting moscow had compromising personal and financial details about trump  trump called a dossier that contains salacious claims about him in russia  fake news  and  phony stuff   one of the sources said the u s  actions  took the russians by surprise   russian officials threatened to shutter the anglo american school of moscow  the source said  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov proposed tit for tat expulsions  but on dec    putin announced that he would not retaliate   trump praised putin for the decision  writing in a twitter post   great move on delay  by v putin   i always knew he was very smart   trump spokesman sean spicer earlier friday said flynn and kislyak had spoken on dec    the day before washington announced the expulsions and sanctions   but a trump official acknowledged later in the day that they held one conversation on dec   about setting up a telephone call between trump and putin after trump s jan   inauguration  the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  was aware of only one phone call between the two that day and did not know if they spoke again since  after the nov   election  russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told the interfax news agency that the russian government was in touch with members of trump s political team during the u s  election campaign and knew most of his entourage  at a news conference on wednesday  trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with moscow during the campaign and said he had no loans or business deals with or in russia  white house spokesman josh earnest on friday said it remained unclear whether such a call between flynn and the russian ambassador would be objectionable     it depends on what they discussed   earnest told reporters  he said he could not weigh in without knowing the content
