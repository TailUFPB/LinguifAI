washington  reuters    the republican controlled u s  house of representatives  under mounting pressure to advance gun control legislation  will vote next week on a measure to keep guns out of the hands of people on government terrorism watch lists  republican and gun lobby sources said the legislation  due to be introduced as part of a terrorism package  was likely to be a national rifle association backed bill brought by representative lee zeldin of new york as the companion to a senate republican measure from senator john cornyn of texas  house democrats  who last week staged a  hour sit in on the house floor to push for gun control after the june  mass shooting in orlando  condemned the cornyn zeldin measure as the handiwork of the nra  senate democrats blocked the same legislation last week     house democrats will keep up our efforts to push for the majority to allow a vote on gun violence legislation  but bringing up a bill authored by the nra just isn t going to cut it   said drew hammill  an aide to house democratic leader nancy pelosi  the nra denied writing the legislation   house speaker paul ryan announced the plan in a conference call with lawmakers  republican leadership aides declined to provide details  one said the package was still being negotiated  after the orlando  florida  shooting that killed  people and wounded  more at a gay nightclub   gun control proponents ratcheted up pressure for meaningful legislation    we are going to get something done this year  i predict   senate democratic leader harry reid told reporters   i think we re going to take a bite out of the nra   reid said he was hopeful for a bill introduced by republican senator susan collins of maine  and a bipartisan house companion bill backed by republicans including representative carlos curbelo of florida  to prevent gun sales to anyone on the government s  no fly list  for terrorism suspects or the  selectee list  for extra airport screening    before thursday s announcement  representative bob dold of illinois  a republican backer of the collins curbelo bill  urged ryan and house majority leader kevin mccarthy to opt for the bipartisan measure  according to a dold aide  but hopes for a vote on that measure could be dashed if house republicans move first on the cornyn zeldin bill  which would allow party leaders to say they had acted on gun control     it would really be a sharp blow   said representative scott rigell  a virginia republican and nra member who supports the collins curbelo measure  the nra backed measure would give officials three days to decide whether a gun sale should be blocked  democrats argue the timetable is insufficient and say the government would have to persuade a court that a would be buyer  has committed or will commit an act of terrorism  before it could block a gun sale  under the collins curbelo bills  a court would have  days to decide on appeals
