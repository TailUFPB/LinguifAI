washington  reuters    there is disagreement within president elect donald trump s camp about the structure of the top u s  intelligence agency when he takes office and it is unclear whether his national security adviser will prevail in advocating a reorganization  sources familiar with the matter said on thursday  at issue is the office of the director of national intelligence  odni   which congress created after the sept   attacks to better coordinate the efforts of u s  intelligence agencies to protect the united states  trump security adviser michael flynn  who as head of the pentagon s defense intelligence agency under president barack obama sometimes clashed with other intelligence agencies  favors restructuring and paring back the odni  the sources said  but one source close to the trump transition cautioned that the outcome is not certain   there is a general consensus that the odni is too big and grown too fast  some around him  trump  believe this  but whether they plan to address it or how  i just don t know   said the source  who like others requested anonymity to discuss the trump team s internal deliberations  flynn has had a fraught relationship with the odni  after complaints over his management style at the defense intelligence agency  he was fired by director of national intelligence james clapper  a senior transition official told reuters on thursday that trump has picked former u s  senator dan coats as his director of national intelligence   a sign trump does not plan to try to eliminate odni  a u s  official familiar with coats  views suggested he would not move precipitously to overhaul u s  intelligence agencies   any possible reforms to the structure of the intelligence community  he would approach with great caution and responsibility   the official said  relations between trump and u s  intelligence agencies are extraordinarily rocky even before he is sworn in on jan    trump disparaged the spy agencies  conclusions that russia was behind hacks of the democratic national committee and the campaign staff of his  election opponent hillary clinton  clapper told congress thursday he was  even more resolute  that russia staged cyber attacks  rebuking trump s skepticism  trump was scheduled to be briefed on friday on an intelligence report that reaches that conclusion  russia has denied the hacking allegations   i think the president elect is more skeptical of the conclusions that are drawn from the raw data rather than the intelligence in the raw data that s provided   trump spokesman sean spicer told reporters on wednesday  coats  according to another u s  official familiar with his views  said he knew a lot about europe and russia and may well  butt heads with trump over russia   the wall street journal reported on wednesday that trump is working with top advisers to restructure and reduce the size of the odni  that report largely reflects the views of flynn  said a  source familiar with the retired lieutenant general s thinking who declined to be identified  trump spokesman sean spicer on thursday rejected the report   there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure   spicer said   all transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative   a broad intelligence reorganization would require congressional action  congress created odni in a  law that makes it the parent of  other u s  intelligence agencies  ranging from the cia and the dia to the eavesdropping national security agency and the state department s intelligence bureau  flynn  who served as a top military intelligence officer in afghanistan and iraq  is said by those familiar with his views to favor major changes at the cia as well  both on the battlefield and at the dia  flynn pushed for intelligence personnel to be moved out of compounds and offices and closer to front lines  where flynn believed they would be more effective intelligence collectors  said the source familiar with his views  flynn would like the cia to reorganize itself along these lines  the source said  the cia was just reorganized last year  however  to bring frontline spies and backroom analysts together in new units focused tightly on specific issues or regions  republican congressman mike pompeo  trump s choice for cia director  is known to share flynn s views about the need for restructuring at cia  the source said  but two other people familiar with trump transition discussions said pompeo has not been involved in talks about possible cia reorganization
