washington new york   democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton has spent about   per vote so far in the race for the party s nomination  less than her rival bernie sanders  who spent    according to campaign finance reports filed on wednesday  clinton s efficiency with money could offset concern among some of her backers that sanders  the u s  senator from vermont  has outraised her in each of the last two months as he wages a fierce fight to get onto the presidential ballot  the former first lady s campaign has spent a total of    million since launching last april and has yielded a total of   million votes in state nominating contests  that includes    million for   million votes in march  the filings show  sanders  in turn  has spent    million since launching his bid for the white house  while netting   million votes  sanders  campaign has often touted its ability to tap a large number of small donors to outraise clinton  in march  sanders pulled in nearly   million from   people  with an average donation of just over    it said  that compared to    million for clinton in march  from   people   some  percent of sanders  donors have given less in total than the    maximum  according to his campaign  meaning he can go back to them for more funds   some of clinton s backers say they are nervous about her campaign s fundraising strategy of relying heavily on donors who are able to write big checks  and who max out more quickly   i think we re going to see her doing more small dollar fund raisers   said lorraine hariton  who has raised more than    for the campaign   but the clinton campaign s spending efficiency has helped it preserve a warchest  at the end of march  clinton had   million left in the bank   more than anyone else running for president  sanders had just   million  preserving the war chest is crucial for clinton s chance of winning the white house in the general election against a republican  letting her campaign effectively in swing states  attack her opponent s vulnerabilities and defend her own  should she face off against republican front runner donald trump  she will need a bank account sufficient to compete with a candidate who has mastered the knack of earning free coverage  approaching the end of the primary campaign with a surplus is a far different scenario from the one in which clinton found herself at the end of her failed  bid for the nomination against barack obama  when she ended up    million in debt  an example of the campaign s frugality  it cut advertising spending by   million to   million in march  a month heavy with primaries and caucuses  by using more digital advertising instead of television ads   clinton spent only    million on digital ads  the campaign also reduced real estate costs and limited increases in payroll as it staffed up    we set ambitious goals to ensure we d have the resources we need to win a competitive primary and we ve blown past every goal  recently surpassing the million donor mark   spokesman josh schwerin said
