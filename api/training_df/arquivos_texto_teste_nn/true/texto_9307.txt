it s the near future  and north korea s regime is on the brink of collapse  as rumors swirl of palace coups  forces on both sides of the world s most militarized border are on heightened alert  the u s  military faces a much bigger problem  somewhere in the pacific  a north korean submarine is believed to be carrying nuclear warheads and the missiles to deliver them  and nobody knows where it is   it sounds like the plot of a  hunt for red october  style technothriller  but if pyongyang s technicians continue at their current pace  experts say it is becoming ever more likely   one thing is certain  north korea is plowing considerable resources into building its nuclear capability  and it is clearly making progress   even if tuesday s failed missile test shows it still has a long way to go   japanese officials said what appeared to be a conventional musudan rocket  which theoretically has the ability to reach japan and the u s  territory and military base of guam  exploded either as or shortly after it left its launcher  north korea is estimated to have some  to  of the missiles   first deployed in   but yet to be launched successfully   what north korean leader kim jong un wants  most analysts believe  is simple   a rocket that can fire a nuclear warhead at least to regional targets  his ultimate ambition  however  is to be able to hit u s  cities on the west coast  most likely from a submarine that could hide itself at sea   north korea has been steadily improving its rockets   which can also carry conventional explosives   for decades  it detonated its first nuclear device in  but most experts believe it has yet to build one small enough to be placed on a missile  having the credible ability to do all of that and get the missiles to sea could take well over a decade  perhaps considerably more   once it happens  however  it will be a strategic game changer  at worst  u s  cities on the west coast would have to deal with the prospect  however remote  that they might be struck by a north korean atomic weapon  at the very least  a north korea armed with nuclear submarines would hugely complicate the calculus for any u s  president handling a crisis on the korean peninsula itself   that  of course  is exactly the plan   the fact that pyongyang has conducted so many tests this year  some experts believe  suggests kim is pushing his scientists harder than ever to deliver working rockets and warheads  north korea is believed to have tagged the expertise of russian cold war era scientists  and while its capabilities on both fronts lag well behind established nuclear states such as russia and china  it is already believed to be well ahead of iran   in april  south korean and u s  officials said a north korean submarine successfully launched a ballistic missile that traveled some  miles   a major step forward   technical experts say tv footage appeared to show a solid fuel rocket successfully launching from underwater  essentially the same system used by western forces to achieve the same goal   when she testified before the senate armed services committee in april  the incoming head of the u s  northern command   responsible for defending the mainland united states   delivered a stark warning    the north korean threat is real   u s  air force general lori robinson   previously head of u s  air forces in the pacific   told lawmakers   for now  it s a medium range but they are trying very hard to be able to hit the homeland    it s impossible to know exactly how much money and expertise the north koreans are expending  the scale of the effort  however  is seen as large   in many ways  the same level of commitment the united states gave to the manhattan project to build the world s first atomic bomb during world war two  pyongyang s reason is clear  building that kind of credible ability to strike is seen as central to the long term survival of the kim dynasty and its ruling party   earlier this month  at the first meeting of its ruling party in  years  kim said north korea was a responsible nuclear weapons state and would never use its weapons   unless it were threatened  that seemed a clear warning to outside powers  particularly washington  to steer clear of any attempts to destabilize or attack the regime   getting a submarine based deterrent would be a very big deal   and not just because it might allow the north koreans to move the launch point much closer to the target  submarines are central to what nuclear weapons states call a  second strike  capability  the ability to launch missiles even in the aftermath of an overwhelming and perhaps surprise preemptive attack   the united states  russia  britain and france all retain what they call a  continuous at sea deterrent   at least one submarine offshore at all times ready to fight back even if the homeland and all other military forces are completely taken out  israel is also believed to have the ability to mount nuclear cruise missiles on its dolphin class conventional submarines  while china is now moving quickly towards new ballistic missile submarines for its own at sea deterrent   this technology isn t new   the united states and russia developed it in the late  based in part on plans originally developed to hit nazi german u boats in the dying days of world war two  there is no good reason it should not eventually work for north korea  too   if and when it does  pyongyang is likely to try to keep its submarines very close to its coasts and its home defenses at first  still  once the first nuclear armed submarine exists  japan and the united states might feel political pressure to destroy it   that would come with considerable risks  the north is known to have huge volumes of conventional artillery based along the south korean border  much of it in range of seoul and its  million residents  the risk of those weapons inflicting massive casualties is one of the key factors that has deterred multiple u s  administrations from considering the kind of preemptive strike on pyongyang s weapons programs that the united states has threatened against iran   the korean war   frozen by its  cease fire but never otherwise resolved   may not be over yet
