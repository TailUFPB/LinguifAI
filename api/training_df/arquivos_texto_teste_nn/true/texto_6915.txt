washington  reuters    president elect donald trump has outlined a ten point plan on his transition website for dealing with illegal immigration  here is a look at what it would take to accomplish each of the ten goals  build a wall on the southern border  trump has the legal authorization to build fences under the  secure fence act  passed in   but congress would have to approve considerably more funding to wall off the entire southern border  which spans nearly   miles  there are also logistical challenges  some areas of the border are privately owned  and the geography of some stretches would make construction extremely difficult  trump previously said he would make mexico pay for the wall  but that policy is not included on his post election web site    end catch and release  to end the practice known as  catch and release   under which immigrants are released pending court hearings  trump could unilaterally shift policies  but full implementation would require significantly more detention space to hold migrants before they can see a judge  there is currently a   case backlog in u s  immigration courts and recent court decisions prohibit him from detaining children with their parents for longer than  days   zero tolerance for criminal aliens  the obama administration currently prioritizes immigrants convicted of serious crimes for deportation  but trump could try to expand the definition of who is classified as a criminal alien or attempt to speed up removals of people who have been ordered deported  in any case  more funding for courts and personnel involved in apprehensions would likely be necessary   blocking funding for sanctuary cities  trump has threatened to cut off funding for so called sanctuary cities such as chicago and los angeles  where local law enforcement refuse to report undocumented immigrants they encounter to federal authorities  while trump has the authority to cut some kinds of funding to the cities  mayors of those cities have said they will not be pressured to report migrants to federal agents   cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws  trump has the authority to undo executive orders like daca  which has provided temporary relief from deportation to more than   immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children  enforcing all immigration laws would require trump to deport an estimated  million immigrants living illegally in the united states  that would require large increases in funding from congress to grow the current workforce of immigration agents and judges to be able to lawfully handle  million deportations  locating so many immigrants  many in the country for years with deep family ties  would be logistically challenging and could spark public backlash   suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur  similar to the  muslim ban  trump proposed during his campaign  this policy would be aimed at visa seekers from war torn countries such as syria and iraq where many refugees and asylum seekers have sought to escape  under current law  trump could unilaterally suspend visas for any individuals or groups or people deemed  detrimental to the interests of the united states    the policy could face challenges in court  however  if it appears to discriminate against any one religion  ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported  the obama administration has wrestled with the issue of forcing recalcitrant countries to take back people the united states is seeking to deport  trump could ramp up diplomatic pressure on countries such as china  the country that has refused to repatriate the largest number of people ordered deported from the united states  but that could have wider diplomatic ramifications  finally complete the biometric entry exit visa tracking system  although mandated by law since bill clinton was president  the united states has yet to develop a system to track foreign visitors and determine if they leave the country when their visas expire  getting a program up and running would require significant funding to collect and store biometric data such as fingerprints for every visa holder who enters and leaves the united states  and some experts have said the system is not practical   turn off the jobs and benefits magnet  trump would need congressional approval to mandate a national database known as e verify that allows employers to check the immigration status of potential hires  until such a system is in place  it is difficult to penalize employers who unknowingly hire undocumented immigrants using fake social security numbers    reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of america and its workers  the department of labor  the department of homeland security and the justice department could  increase investigations of employers suspected of abusing visa programs such as h  that allow companies to hire foreign workers  often for a lower cost than what they would pay americans  but trump could face backlash from industries that rely on the program  including the technology sector  if he goes too far in revoking visas
