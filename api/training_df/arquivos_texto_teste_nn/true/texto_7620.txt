new york  reuters    whether fbi director james comey broke the law may hinge on whether he had political motivations or was merely doing his job by reviving democrat hillary clinton s email controversy just days before the nov   presidential election  richard painter  a chief white house ethics lawyer to former republican president george w  bush  on saturday accused comey of violating the  hatch act when the fbi chief wrote congress on friday that more of the candidate s emails would be scrutinized   on sunday  u s  senate democratic leader harry reid wrote to comey to accuse him of partisan actions that may have broken the law  the hatch act bars government employees from taking part in political activities that include soliciting or accepting donations from a political party and using official authority to interfere with the outcome of an election   stephen vladeck  a professor at the university of texas school of law  said   i would be surprised if this complaint leads to anything significant  but i would also be surprised if comey s tenure as the fbi director will not be shortened    even if he didn t violate the letter of the hatch act  he certainly violated the spirit of the hatch act  which should have prompted him to think twice before issuing that letter  especially because the letter didn t say anything   he said  little is publicly known about the new email trove  comey wrote congress the fbi had yet to determine the significance  painter filed his complaint with the independent office of special counsel  osc  and the office of government ethics  a spokesman for the osc  which has a specialized hatch act investigative unit  declined to comment  a hatch act investigation is an administrative  not a criminal  matter  penalties may include removal from office  a demotion or temporary suspension  or a civil penalty no higher than     in cases of high level officials  the disciplinary decisions on osc actions are made by the president  on monday  the white house said president barack obama believes comey is a man of integrity and is not trying to influence the election by announcing the scrutiny of additional emails  jan witold baran  a lawyer at wiley rein in washington  suggested it would be hard to construe what appeared to be comey s engagement in normal government business as a violation of the hatch act   but kenneth gross  former associate general counsel of the federal election commission  said comey s letter fell outside the fbi director s normal duties as there is no legal obligation to disclose details of an ongoing probe to congress  painter s complaint said that barring extraordinary circumstances  a public communication about a pending fbi investigation involving a candidate for public office so close to an election likely violated the act  comey said in an internal memo obtained by news media that even though it is not common to update congress on the progress of investigations  he felt obligated because he had repeatedly said the probe was completed  the osc hatch act unit  which usually experiences a surge in complaints during election years  has disciplined  employees the last five years  almost a three fold increase over the previous five years  an osc  report to congress said   hatch act violations usually relate to inappropriate electioneering  for example  the  report cited a complaint against a u s  agriculture department official who allegedly asked two subordinate employees to donate to a political action committee supporting obama s  re election   in a  letter  the osc found that secretary of housing and urban development julian castro violated the act by advocating for and against presidential candidates during a media interview  castro called it an  inadvertent error
