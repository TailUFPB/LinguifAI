court  which has three jewish justices and five catholics   exclusive poll  a third of americans think travel ban will make them safer gorsuch is seen by analysts as a jurist similar to scalia  who died on feb      scalia  praised by gorsuch as  a lion of the law   was known not only for his hard line conservatism but for interpreting the u s  constitution based on what he considered its original meaning  and laws as written by legislators  like scalia  gorsuch is known for sharp writing skills    it is the role of judges to apply  not alter  the work of the people s representatives   gorsuch said on tuesday at the white house event announcing the nomination in remarks that echoed scalia s views   trump  a republican  had the chance to nominate gorsuch because the republican led u s  senate last year refused to consider obama s nominee  appeals court judge merrick garland   democrats  angered by the treatment of garland  and opposing gorsuch s conservative views  may seek to block his nomination   trump may have favored gorsuch for the job in hopes of a smoother confirmation process than for other potential candidates such as appeals court judge william pryor  who has

efforts against polluters and slowing payments for cleaning up toxic waste   the high court is also familiar ground for gorsuch  who served as a clerk for two justices including a current member of

practice and worked in george w  bush s justice department   in a  article in the conservative national review magazine  gorsuch criticized american liberals   overweening addiction to the courtroom  to implement a social agenda  on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide   in his senate confirmation hearing for his appellate court judgeship  he said the point of the article could be applied to groups across the political spectrum   in   gorsuch played a role in a high profile ruling involving arts and crafts retailer hobby lobby  allowing owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to an obamacare provision requiring employers to provide health insurance covering birth control for women   the decision  later upheld by the u s  supreme court  said the provision violated a federal law called the religious freedom restoration act  in a concurrence  gorsuch expressed sympathy for the choice faced by the evangelical christian owners of the company  between exercising their faith or saving their business    gorsuch also criticized an important legal doctrine that directs courts to defer to federal agencies  interpretation of statutes  last august  in a case over immigration rules  gorsuch called the doctrine the  elephant in the room  that concentrates federal power  in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution    he has written extensively on the topic of assisted suicide and euthanasia  arguing against legalization  in written questions related to his senate confirmation hearings  he was asked whether his writings would make him biased in any case on the matter before him  he said his personal views would play no role in his decisions as a judge   gorsuch is married with two teenage daughters  and
