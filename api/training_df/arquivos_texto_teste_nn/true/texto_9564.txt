washington  reuters    a u s  judge on thursday handed a victory to congressional republicans who challenged president barack obama s signature healthcare law  ruling that his administration overstepped its constitutional powers relating to government spending  u s  district judge rosemary collyer  based in washington  ruled that the administration cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds to provide subsidies under the law known as obamacare to private insurers without the approval of congress  at issue in the case  brought by the republican led house of representatives  are reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law requires them to make to customers  out of pocket medical payments  the ruling will not have an immediate effect on the law because the judge put the decision on hold pending an expected appeal by the administration  but it adds to uncertainty over the future of obama s signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the nov   presidential and congressional elections  including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program  insurers have sustained losses from their obamacare business  saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members  two of the largest players  unitedhealth group and humana inc  had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year   if you re going to lose more money  why participate   asked steve halper  an analyst with fbr capital markets  shares in hospital operators such as community health systems inc fell sharply  while insurer stocks including aetna inc  which plans to remain in at least  obamacare markets next year  also declined  in court papers  the administration had warned that a court victory for the house republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy holders  as part of an appeal  the administration is likely to press its argument that the house lacks legal standing to sue    this suit represents the first time in our nation s history that congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute   white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters   it s unfortunate that republicans have resorted to a taxpayer funded lawsuit to re fight a political fight that they keep losing   earnest added   they ve been losing this fight for six years  and they ll lose it again   conservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the affordable care act since it was passed by congress in  over unified republican opposition  collyer was appointed to the bench by republican former president george w  bush  the law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of americans who previously had none  subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits  in addition  the federal government helped defray consumers  out of pocket costs  the house republicans argued that the administration s action violated the u s  constitution because it is the legislative branch  not the executive branch  that authorizes government spending   big win for the constitution   house speaker paul ryan wrote on twitter  jonathan turley  the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit  in a blog post called the ruling  a resounding victory not just for congress but for our constitutional system as a whole   the appeals court in washington may be more receptive to the administration s arguments  in part because seven of its  active judges are democratic appointees  including four picked by obama  the case focuses on a cost sharing provision of obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co pays  insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government  cost sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower income households   the obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by congress  the house republicans who filed the challenge disagreed  collyer ruled that the cost sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law  the judge rejected the administration s contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to  absurd economic  fiscal and healthcare policy results   the u s  supreme court in june   in a ruling authored by bush appointed chief justice john roberts  rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted obamacare  upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law  roberts also wrote a major  ruling preserving obamacare
