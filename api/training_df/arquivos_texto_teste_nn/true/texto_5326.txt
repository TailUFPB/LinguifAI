 reuters    conservative u s  supreme court justices on tuesday expressed skepticism about reviving a lawsuit filed by the family of a mexican teenager against a u s  border patrol agent who fatally shot the  year old from across the border in texas in   among the concerns raised by justices was whether non u s  citizens injured by drone attacks overseas that are directed from the united states could file similar claims if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward  in a closely watched case that could affect u s  immigration actions under president donald trump s administration  the court s liberal justices expressed sympathy toward allowing the case to move forward  indicating the justices could be headed toward a   split  such a ruling would leave in place a lower court s decision to throw out the civil rights claims against the agent  jesus mesa  filed by the family of sergio hernandez  the supreme court potentially could delay action on the case to see if trump s nominee to fill a vacancy on the court  conservative appeals court judge neil gorsuch  is confirmed by the u s  senate  gorsuch could then potentially cast the deciding vote  a ruling would normally be due by the end of june   justice anthony kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the liberal justices in close cases and whose vote could be pivotal in this one  voiced doubt about the family s arguments during the court s hour long argument  kennedy indicated the question of how to compensate victims of cross border shootings is one that the u s  and mexican governments should resolve   you ve indicated that there s a problem all along the border  why doesn t that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with mexico what the solution ought to be    kennedy asked the hernandez family s lawyer  robert hilliard  chief justice john roberts  another conservative  brought up the sensitive question of whether u s  officials could be sued for drone attacks overseas   how do you analyze the case of a drone strike in iraq where the plane is piloted from nevada  why wouldn t the same analysis apply in that case   he asked hilliard  the justices heard the case at a time that the security of the lengthy u s  mexico border is a hot topic  with president donald trump moving forward with plans for a border wall he said is needed to combat illegal immigration  the case is one of three the justices currently are considering that concern the extent to which the u s  constitution provides rights to non u s  citizens  that issue has become more pressing in light of trump s january order  put on hold by the courts  to block entry into the united states by people from seven muslim majority countries and refugees  trump is preparing a rewritten version of the ban  the case raises several legal questions  including whether or not the u s  constitution s ban on unjustified deadly force applied to hernandez because he was a mexican citizen on mexican soil when the shooting occurred in june   the court could resolve the case by simply deciding not to apply a  supreme court ruling in a case involving federal drug enforcement agents that allowed such lawsuits in limited circumstances  the court has been reluctant in subsequent cases to extend that ruling to other types of conduct  kennedy seemed unwilling to take that step  saying the hernandez shooting would be an  extraordinary case  in which to allow a lawsuit against a federal official  liberal justices appeared more willing to examine whether some u s  rights extend to border areas where the u s  government exercises a certain amount of authority even beyond the border line  as it does in the culvert where hernandez was killed  justice elena kagan said it could be described as a no man s land that is  neither one thing or another thing   likewise  justice stephen breyer said the border area could be viewed as a  special kind of physical place  where u s  law could extend in certain instances  hernandez s lawyers cited a report by the washington monthly magazine that said over a five year period  border agents were involved in  cross border shootings  killing six mexican nationals  justice sonia sotomayor  another liberal  said that in order to deter such shootings   why should there not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the constitution   the incident took place at a border crossing between el paso  texas and ciudad juarez  mexico  the u s  border patrol said at the time that hernandez was pelting u s  agents with rocks from the mexican side of the rio grande before the shooting  u s  authorities have asserted that mesa shot hernandez in self defense  lawyers for hernandez s family disputed that account  saying he was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the mexican side and touch the u s  border fence before dashing back  the fbi also said hernandez was a known immigrant smuggler who had been pressed into service by smuggling gangs that took advantage of his youth   the family appealed a  ruling by the new orleans based  u s  circuit court of appeals throwing out the lawsuit
