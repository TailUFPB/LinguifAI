washington  reuters    president barack obama s proposed rules to stop u s  companies from reincorporating abroad  if only on paper  to avoid u s  income taxes appear to overstep legal authority  a top republican lawmaker said on friday  representative kevin brady said his staff is scrutinizing the rules  which were unveiled last week by the u s  treasury department  legal experts have offered mixed views on the viability of any court challenge   the new rules  intended to discourage tax  inversions   led to the collapse of u s  drugmaker pfizer inc s   billion acquisition of ireland s allergan plc   we recognize there is broad discretion in some areas of that tax code   brady  a texas republican and chairman of the tax writing house of representatives ways and means committee  said in a speech to the u s  chamber of commerce   but it certainly appears that treasury overstepped its authority  especially in effect  taking legislative proposals that haven t passed this congress or any other congress and essentially making it law through regulation   brady gave no indication of what his committee might do  it was unclear what action  if any  the republican controlled congress would take against the inversion rules in an election year marked by voter anger over taxes and international trade   i share the concern about inversions  everyone does  but there s a right way and a wrong way to tackle them   brady said   an inversion is a tax driven deal in which a u s  company acquires a smaller  foreign business and adopts its tax domicile to reduce the combined company s overall tax burden  the deals most often involve reincorporating in ireland or britain  though inversions have been going since the   a new wave has been under way for about five years  the pfizer allergan deal would have been the biggest inversion of all time  there is bipartisan agreement on the need for comprehensive tax reform to address inversions  but the deeply divided congress is unlikely to tackle this until   especially with elections coming in november  analysts said  in the interim  the obama administration has tightened  inversion rules in limited areas  drawing republican criticism    the administration s strategy won t solve the fundamental problem and likely will make it worse   brady said
