chicago  reuters    illinois republican governor bruce rauner urged lawmakers on friday to allow voters in  to decide whether to change how political boundaries are drawn after the state s supreme court a day earlier declared a petition driven redistricting initiative for this fall s statewide ballot unconstitutional  rauner called illinois  existing political maps  which are drawn by democrats who control the general assembly   rigged and gerrymandered  because they have left a majority of legislative races this fall without challengers to incumbent legislators   our system of government is broken   rauner told reporters during a stop in marion  in far southern illinois   two thirds of our general elections don t have opponents  and we ve got to change the system   the next opportunity for state legislators to put a constitutional amendment before voters comes in two years  when the first term governor is expected to be in the midst of a re election campaign   our system has been run by a broken  powerful political machine in chicago that looks out for itself  not for the people of illinois  and certainly not for the people of southern illinois   rauner said   we ve got to get the power away from that machine  and we can do it with political reform   rauner s comments came less than  hours after the illinois supreme court ruled   to uphold a lower court ruling that would keep in place the once a decade  partisan controlled political mapmaking process that has allowed for democratic majorities in the state legislature and on the elected supreme court  the amendment  if it was placed on november s ballot and passed by a majority of illinois voters  would have transferred the power of re drawing legislative districts to a bipartisan commission  more than   illinois voters signed petitions backing the amendment   there were  redistricting amendments filed in both chambers during the current legislative session though none won approval in both chambers  the illinois supreme court ruled the ballot initiative fell outside the scope of permissible ballot initiatives  which may only be used for amendments directed at  structural and procedural subjects  in the constitution pertaining to illinois s legislative branch  in a dissenting opinion  justice robert thomas wrote   today a muzzle has been placed on the people of this state  and their voices supplanted by judicial fiat
