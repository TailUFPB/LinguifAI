los angeles  reuters    democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders  positions on fracking  free tuition and breaking up big banks wouldn t sound out of place in an oscar winning actor s acceptance speech   but in famously liberal hollywood  long used as an atm by democratic campaigns  sanders  message is not resonating as loudly as in other progressive bastions  the more moderate hillary clinton has far outpaced the vermont senator in fundraising and has a deep line up of a list stars and top executives among her backers    celebrities don t sway votes  but they can persuade people to listen to a candidate s message  said historian steven ross  author of  hollywood left and right  how movie stars shaped american politics     it puts a candidate on their radar   he said  hollywood actors  studio executives and other employees of the film  tv and music industries have donated at least    million to clinton s campaign and the independent super pac that supports her bid  priorities usa action  according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance data through march    a pair of clinton fundraisers held by actor george clooney this month  at which tickets went for as much as    per couple  is not included in that total  but were reported by deadline hollywood to have raised an additional   million  by contrast  sanders  campaign had raised about   million from entertainment industry donors through march   according to the campaign finance data  the vermont senator  who called the price of the clooney event  obscene   is not associated with a super pac and says he does not court wealthy donors   graphic on hollywood flows to sanders and clinton  tmsnrt rs   all republican presidential candidates combined collected     roughly  percent of entertainment industry donations  the data showed  clinton s support in hollywood can be traced back to strong ties her husband built during his first presidential campaign in   said donna bojarsky  a democratic public policy consultant who worked as national entertainment coordinator for bill clinton s campaign  bill clinton connected deeply with hollywood  she said  in part because  he showed a real respect for and appreciation of pop culture  he followed it  and he enjoyed it   another reason for hillary clinton s success in hollywood is the backing of executives  while business people in hollywood may be liberals  they are less likely to embrace a candidate who attacks corporations  said ross  the historian  sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist who wants higher taxes on wealthy people and corporations to help pay for college  healthcare  and other programs   corporate hollywood is about business and the bottom line   ross said  the biggest hollywood contributors to date are behind the scenes figures rather than stars  with about two thirds of clinton s industry support through march coming from just three donors   haim saban  ceo of saban capital group  contributed    million  while dreamworks animation dwa o ceo jeffrey katzenberg and director steven spielberg donated   million each to clinton and funds supporting her  but it is the celebrity backers who make headlines for a candidate  even if they re not making hefty contributions  pop singer demi lovato performed at a clinton campaign rally  and  scandal  star kerry washington recorded radio and tv ads for the former secretary of state    i really believe in her capacity to deliver on her messages   washington said in an interview  sanders welcomed the band vampire weekend onto a stage in iowa  where they joined the candidate to sing  this land is your land   the red hot chili peppers performed at a sanders fundraiser in los angeles   clinton s celebrity support skews toward older men and women  and she attracts more minorities  while younger personalities gravitate to sanders  said dan schnur  director of university of southern california s jesse m  unruh institute of politics and a former republican political strategist   these leanings reflect those of voters in general  schnur said  though there are plenty of exceptions   ninety year old actor dick van dyke  a sanders supporter  is happy to buck the trend     people in my generation are set in their ways   van dyke said in an interview   some people are afraid he might get a little too drastic  that he might do something to upset the apple cart     sanders  not known for his sense of humor  has also attracted a number of comedians as supporters  including danny devito  bill maher and sarah silverman    bernie is not for sale   says silverman  a one time clinton backer  in a pro sanders video viewed more than  million times on facebook   this is a once in a lifetime candidate who genuinely represents the people   schnur finds sanders  support among some comedians understandable   if you decide to perform comedy for a living  you ve probably got a little bit of an anarchist streak   he said  and sanders  challenges the establishment     the bernie hillary split at times the sanders clinton divide in hollywood has grown heated  when actor susan sarandon  a sanders supporter  said in an msnbc interview last month that she wasn t sure she could vote for clinton if she was the democratic nominee  the reaction in hollywood was intense  her comments were seen as lending support to trump    actor jamie lee curtis  a clinton supporter  tweeted that she respected but disagreed with sarandon  calling her position  dangerous  women  minorities   migrants   debra messing  one of the stars of nbc sitcom  will and grace   also joined the twitter fray  criticizing sarandon for representing  the bernie or bust position which is so dangerous for our country   sarandon  who has donated    to sanders  said her comments were reported incorrectly   of course i wouldn t vote for trump   she said in an interview with reuters  she is unrepentant in her support for sanders   we have to do something more than incremental change   sarandon said  sanders is  about real change  progressive change   she said  she said she worries about an industry backlash against sanders supporters  given the reaction to her statements  as well as negative comments from feminist gloria steinem and former secretary of state madeleine albright about women supporting sanders    it s a much easier thing to be supporting hillary than to be supporting bernie if you are a woman in the industry    in the end  hollywood s democrats will unite behind clinton if she wins the nomination  predicted usc s schnur   a sanders nista is not going to flip over and vote republican   he said
