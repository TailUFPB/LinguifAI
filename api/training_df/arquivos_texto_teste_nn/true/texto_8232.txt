new york  reuters    donald trump declared on wednesday that russia s vladimir putin had been a better leader than u s  president barack obama  as the republican presidential nominee used a televised forum to argue he was best equipped to reassert america s global leadership   trump suggested at the event in which he and democratic rival hillary clinton made back to back appearances that u s  generals had been stymied by the policies of obama and clinton  who served as the democratic president s first secretary of state   i think under the leadership of barack obama and hillary clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble  they have been reduced to a point that s embarrassing for our country   trump said at nbc s  commander in chief  forum in new york attended by military veterans   it was the first time trump and clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties  presidential nominations in july for the nov   election  clinton was grilled over her handling of classified information while using a private email server during her tenure at the state department  fbi director james comey had declared her  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive material but did not recommend charges against her   i did exactly what i should have done and i take it very seriously  always have  always will   she said trump s praise of putin and his suggestion that the united states and russia form an alliance to defeat islamic state militants could raise eyebrows among foreign policy experts who feel moscow is interfering with efforts to stem the syrian civil war   if he says great things about me  i m going to say great things about him   trump said of the russian president   certainly in that system  he s been a leader  far more than our president has been   trump had called obama  the founder of isis   an acronym for islamic state  in stump speeches several weeks ago  the statement drew broad criticism  prompting him to take a more disciplined approach to campaigning  he has since picked up ground on clinton in national opinion polls  trump also flirted with revealing what he had been learning in classified intelligence briefings given to him by u s  officials because he is the republican nominee   there was one thing that shocked me   trump said   what i did learn is that our leadership  barack obama  did not follow what our experts     said to do  and i was very  very surprised     our leaders were not following what they recommended   earlier on wednesday  trump pledged to launch a new u s  military buildup  saying america was under threat like never before from foes like islamist extremists  north korea and china  the event offered a prelude to how clinton and trump will deal with questions on national security issues in their three upcoming presidential debates later in september and in october  clinton began the forum saying her long experience in government as a u s  senator and secretary of state made her uniquely qualified to serve as president  she said she had  an absolute rock steadiness  to be able to make tough decisions  a not so subtle dig at trump  who democrats say is temperamentally unfit for the white house  moderator matt lauer doggedly pressed her about her handling of emails from a private server while secretary of state from  to   the issue has raised questions about whether she can be trusted to serve as president  clinton said none of the emails she sent or received were marked top secret  secret or classified  the usual way such material is identified   appearing in the second half of the hour long show  trump faced questions about his fitness for office  asked if he would be prepared on day one to be commander in chief  trump said   one hundred percent   trump quickly abandoned lauer s entreaties to avoid attacking his opponent and focus on what he would do if elected president in november   she s been there for  years   trump said   we need change  and we need it fast    the event brought together the meticulously prepared clinton    the wife of former president bill clinton  and trump    a new york businessman whose brash  freewheeling style has allowed him to dominate the headlines during his campaign  clinton said she regretted her decision as a u s  senator from new york to vote in favor of the much criticized  iraq war and that trump had been in favor of it as well  trump has condemned the war during his campaign and said he would avoid lengthy conflicts in the middle east  on the u s  intervention in libya in   clinton rejected trump s criticism of her support for the effort as secretary of state   permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in libya would be as threatening and as dangerous as what we are seeing in syria   she said  trump said clinton s handling of libya proved disastrous  republicans have made much of the fact that the u s  ambassador to libya  chris stevens  was killed in an islamist attack in benghazi  libya  in    she made a terrible mistake in libya   said trump  clinton said u s  policies under her leadership at the state department had helped promote security   we made the world safer   she said
