london  reuters    donald trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with david cameron because the british prime minister cast the u s  presidential candidate as  divisive  stupid and wrong  for proposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  cameron criticised trump in the british parliament over his call for the ban on muslims and suggested that the new york billionaire  who is now the presumptive republican presidential nominee  would unite britain against him if he visited   it looks like we re not going to have a very good relationship  who knows   trump told britain s itv television station in an interview aired on monday when asked how ties would fare if he won the u s  presidential election on nov     well number one  i m not stupid  okay  i can tell you that right now  just the opposite  number two  in terms of divisive  i don t think i m a divisive person  i m a unifier  unlike our president right now   trump said  referring to barack obama  cameron s spokesman said the prime minister stood by his original comments  the united states is britain s closest ally  u s  companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in britain and the so  called  special relationship  with washington has been the cornerstone of british diplomacy since world war two  trump s often controversial comments on everything from muslims and women to the future of nato and relations with russia have drawn criticism from berlin  paris and other european capitals  but neither germany s angela merkel nor france s francois hollande have gone as far as cameron in chiding trump who  if he wins in november  would be in charge of the world s most powerful nation and largest economy from january  next year  cameron will work with whoever is elected u s  president and is committed to maintaining the special relationship  the prime minister s spokesman said   the pm has made his views on donald trump s comments very clear  he disagrees with them   the spokesman said   he continues to believe that preventing muslims from entering the u s  is divisive  stupid and wrong  he stands by his comments   the spokesman refused to answer questions on who cameron would like to see win in november but said there was no telephone call or meeting planned with trump  adding   if one is proposed we will consider it   on a more conciliatory note  cameron has said trump deserves respect for making it through the gruelling republican primary process  the times newspaper also reported last month cameron had ordered diplomats to attempt to repair relations with trump   i hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he s not willing to address the problem either   trump told itv  trump also criticised london s newly elected muslim mayor sadiq khan for making  very rude statements   trump had initially welcomed khan s election and said he would make an exception in the event of a ban on muslims for him entering the united states  drawing a sharp reply from khan   donald trump s ignorant view of islam could make both our countries less safe   it risks alienating mainstream muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists   khan said  responding to this criticism in the itv interview  trump said   he doesn t know me  never met me  doesn t know what i am all about  i think they are very rude statements  frankly  tell him i will remember those statements  they are very nasty statements  it is ignorant for him to say that
