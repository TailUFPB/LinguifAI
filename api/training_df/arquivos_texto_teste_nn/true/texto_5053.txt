washington  reuters    two senior senators asked the fbi and justice department on wednesday for any information they have on president donald trump s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor barack obama wiretapped him during the  u s  presidential campaign  in a letter to james comey  director of the federal bureau of investigation  and acting deputy attorney general dana boente  republican lindsey graham and democrat sheldon whitehouse wrote   we request that the department of justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders     related to wiretaps of president trump  the trump campaign  or trump tower    under u s  law  presidents cannot direct wiretapping  instead  the federal government can ask a court to authorize the action  but it must provide justification  asked at a briefing on wednesday if trump was the subject of a probe  white house spokesman sean spicer replied   there is no reason that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever   critics of trump in congress have accused him of issuing the wiretap allegation to try to deflect attention from investigations into his administration s possible ties to russia  some have likened it to trump s long held contention that obama was not born in the united states and thus did not legitimately hold the office of president   an accusation he did not withdraw until   dianne feinstein  a democratic member of both the senate intelligence and judiciary committees  told cnn she had not seen any evidence that obama had tapped trump s phone   it s all rather shocking to me that a sitting president would make this kind of an allegation about a former president without any proof whatsover   she said   i believe it s patently false   graham later told cnn that if the justice department does not cooperate with the senators  request  subpoenas would be issued   i expect them to come forward as to whether or not a warrant was obtained or sought   graham said  he chairs a senate judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism  and whitehouse is the senior democrat on the panel  on saturday  trump accused obama of phone surveillance  amid a swirl of questions about possible ties between the trump presidential campaign and russian president vladimir putin  u s  intelligence agencies have found that russia tried to influence  the election  an obama spokesman said on saturday that neither obama nor any white house official had ordered surveillance on any u s  citizen  the spokesman s statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the trump campaign could have been sought by the justice department  in their letter  graham and whitehouse wrote   we would take any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political purposes very seriously   the senators added   we would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of president trump  the trump campaign  or trump tower   on tuesday  house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes told reporters his panel would consider issuing subpoenas if information being sought on russia s possible role influencing the election was not forthcoming  the committee has scheduled a march  hearing and trump s wiretap allegation is part of that probe  democrats  questioning the commitment of the republican controlled congress  have been calling for an outside investigation  which so far has been rejected
