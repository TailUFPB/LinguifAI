washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court is heading into its home stretch  with major rulings due by the end of the month on president barack obama s unilateral immigration plan  racial preferences in university admissions and a restrictive texas abortion law  producing decisive rulings has been complicated by the fact that the court has been down one justice since conservative antonin scalia died in february  leaving it evenly split with four conservatives and four liberals  the justices also are set to rule on whether to overturn republican former virginia governor robert mcdonnell s  corruption conviction  one of the  cases yet to be decided  the court appeared divided along ideological lines when it heard arguments on april  over whether democrat obama exceeded his constitutional powers in bypassing the republican led congress with a  plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits  twenty six states led by republican governed texas brought the lawsuit  a   ruling  which appeared to be one possibility after the arguments  would deal obama a huge defeat because it would affirm a lower court ruling invalidating the plan  split rulings do not set nationwide legal precedents  but a   decision would effectively kill obama s immigration plan  the court also seemed split along ideological lines during march  arguments in a challenge to a texas abortion law brought by abortion providers backed by the obama administration  a   ruling would deliver a victory to texas because it would affirm a lower court ruling upholding the law  because such a ruling would set no nationwide precedent  it might not serve as a legal blueprint for other conservative  republican dominated states to enact similar laws  the question before the justices is whether the law  which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities  violates a woman s constitutional right to abortion as established in the  roe v  wade ruling  there cannot be a   ruling in a challenge by a white woman  enlisted by a conservative legal activist  to a university of texas student admissions policy giving preferences to racial minorities in a program aimed at fostering campus racial diversity  only seven justices heard that case  liberal elena kagan  the obama administration s solicitor general when it supported the university in earlier litigation  recused herself  that means four conservatives and three liberals will decide the case  conservative justices expressed reservations about the affirmative action admissions policy during dec   arguments
