washington  reuters    president donald trump dismissed a growing controversy about ties between his aides and russia on thursday as a  ruse  and  scam  perpetrated by a hostile news media  and denied any of his associates had contacts with moscow before last year s election   the leaks are absolutely real  the news is fake   trump told a news conference  referring to media reports that his presidential campaign team had contacts with russian intelligence officials   trump  who frequently assailed the news media  also said he had not directed his former national security adviser  michael flynn  to talk to russia s ambassador about u s  sanctions before taking office  trump said he had asked the justice department to look into the leaks of  classified information that was given illegally  to journalists regarding the relationship between his aides and russia   he also said he did not think that russian president vladimir putin was taking actions that would test him early in his term in office  trump  who took office on jan   and has voiced support for improved ties with russia  added he personally had no business deals in that country  the new york times reported on tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of trump s presidential campaign and other trump associates had repeated contacts with senior russian intelligence officials in the year before the nov   election in which trump defeated democrat hillary clinton      pressed by reporters about whether he was aware if any member of his presidential campaign team had contacts with russia before the election  the republican president said   nobody that i know of   wary democratic lawmakers challenged republicans  who control congress  on thursday to conduct a credible investigation into contacts between trump s associates and russia  the process could take months and might never be made public  u s  intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump s favor  trump has spoken admiringly of putin  who had a tense relationship with former president barack obama over moscow s  annexation of crimea from ukraine  russian military actions in syria and other matters  even fellow republicans have expressed unease about trump s comments about putin  flynn  a close adviser to trump during his campaign  was seen by moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with russia  trump fired flynn on monday after the retired lieutenant general misled vice president mike pence about conversations he had with the russian ambassador to the united states  before trump took office  regarding u s  sanctions on moscow  flynn told fbi agents last month he had not discussed sanctions against russia with the ambassador before trump took office  the washington post reported on thursday  flynn s jan   interview with the fbi could expose him to charges  since lying to the agency is a felony  but any decision to prosecute would lie with the justice department  u s  intelligence agencies intercepted flynn s call with russian ambassador sergei kislyak after trump s election  in which the two discussed sanctions  the post reported previously  obama imposed the new sanctions on russia on dec   after the u s  intelligence community s conclusion about moscow s interference in the election campaign  a u s  official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said flynn indicated that if russia did not retaliate  that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving u s  russian relations once trump took power  that was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the united states has with other countries  trump forcefully defended flynn s discussion with the russian ambassador   what he did wasn t wrong   trump told the news conference    mike was doing his job  he was calling countries and his counterparts  so  it certainly would have been ok with me if he did it      i didn t direct him  but i would have directed him because that s his job   trump said   no  i didn t direct him  but i would have directed him if he didn t do it  ok   said trump  who added the problem was flynn s having misled pence  a wealthy new york real estate developer with global business interests  trump also portrayed himself as having no ties to russia   i can tell you  speaking for myself  i own nothing in russia  i have no loans in russia  i don t have any deals in russia   trump said  critics of the president have called on him since the election campaign to release his tax returns  saying that would shed more light on his business dealings  trump has said he will not do so while his tax affairs are under audit by the internal revenue service   i have nothing to do with russia  haven t made a phone call to russia in years  don t speak to people from russia  not that i wouldn t  i just have nobody to speak to   trump said
