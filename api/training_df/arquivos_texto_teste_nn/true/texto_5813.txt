washington  reuters    for seven years  the united states has fought to keep the euro zone intact  urging european officials toward action and supporting international bailout programs to keep the  nation currency union from cracking apart   that appears to have changed less than two weeks into donald trump s new administration   a sharp shift in tone toward germany  casting the euro as fuel for that country s massive trade surplus  has raised concerns that the u s  president s trade centric world view may see the euro not as a geopolitical plus  but as another needless bit of multilateralism  while trump has refrained from commenting directly on the euro  he praised britain s decision to exit the european union as a  great thing  and predicted that others would leave the bloc as the result of an influx of refugees  in comments published in the european press on tuesday  trump trade adviser peter navarro said the  grossly undervalued  euro served as a currency for germany alone  allowing the country to  exploit  the united states and others  on capitol hill  treasury secretary designate steven mnuchin softened the traditional u s   strong dollar  mantra  suggesting that the dollar s current strength may be working against what has become perhaps the administration s central economic priority  reviving u s  manufacturing and exports  framed narrowly  that could put the united states on a clear a collision course with germany  the world s fourth largest economy and home to companies that rival top u s  industrial giants  as it is with mexico or china    there seems to be this desire to go back to a divide and conquer style strategy where the u s  negotiates against individual countries   said douglas rediker  executive chair of international capital strategies and a former u s  executive board member at the international monetary fund    to single  germany  out when they don t have authority to manipulate their currency  requires you to make a leap   which is to say that  we don t care that there actually is a common currency  we are going to take you to account    monetary policy in the euro zone is set by the european central bank  and it is the ecb s money creation policies that have contributed to the euro s recent decline in value   like the u s  federal reserve s quantitative easing  those efforts have been regarded internationally as a reasonable response to the region s dangerous economic weakness   not as an effort to cheapen the currency to gain a trade advantage    the question is how far will the new administration go with this   said jeromin zettelmeyer  a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former german economic official  trump could  for example  try to tax german goods to offset any perceived advantage gained from a cheap euro  zettelmeyer said  an import duty has already been suggested as a way to redress alleged currency manipulation by china   trump seems to think that having a trade deficit with another country means that the other country is somehow stealing or at least getting the better deal   said zettelmeyer  the first days of trump s administration have touched off a wave of anxiety in europe  european council president donald tusk went so far as to list the new government in washington among the chief  external  threats faced by europe  criticism of germany s trade surplus  however  is not unique to trump   the treasury department under president obama added germany to a  watch list  because of its large trade imbalances  the u s  trade deficit with germany stood at   billion as of   three times that of other european union countries combined  and   billion more than the deficit with mexico  one of trump s other economic nemeses    but for obama officials  the aim was to get germany to spend more and boost its imports of goods from the rest of europe and the rest of the world  it was not to target the euro s value and  by extension  the steps taken by the ecb to revive european growth more broadly  partly under american influence  the group of  nations  including china  has in recent years agreed to consensus language that countries would  refrain from competitive devaluations    they have also generally avoided criticizing each other s central banks  that diplomacy is credited at least in part for china s recent shift toward a more flexible currency regime that organizations like the international monetary fund feel have brought the renminbi currency close to fair market value  in their last report on the euro zone  imf staff said they did think the euro was undervalued  but they said the range could be anywhere from  to  percent  though likely larger for germany   the consequences  of a protectionist united states  affect us germans as a leading export and import nation particularly hard   federation of german industries chief dieter kempf said in a speech in berlin after the navarro comments
