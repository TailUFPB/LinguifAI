washington st  louis  reuters    the u s  republican party on sunday confronted its biggest crisis in more than  years when its presidential nominee  donald trump  faced a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women in a newly uncovered  video  only a month before the nov   election and on a day when trump was due to debate democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  trump took to social media to squelch any speculation that he would leave the race   tremendous support  except for some republican leadership    thank you   trump wrote on twitter  then in a last minute surprise in st  louis  host city for the town hall debate  trump called journalists into a hotel room to witness a meeting he held with four women who revived accusations of past sexual misdeeds by clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  the party turmoil recalled past party crises  including the watergate scandal that led to republican president richard nixon s resignation in   a businessman turned politician previously best known to americans as a reality tv show host  trump    faced his latest crisis when on friday the  video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman  the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife  melania  the controversy pitched trump    into the biggest crisis of his  month old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment republicans  on sunday  he struck a defiant tone in the face of calls for him to abandon the race  a source close to the campaign of trump s vice presidential running mate  mike pence  dismissed talk among some political analysts the indiana governor might bolt the ticket in the uproar over trump s comments   absolutely not   the source told reuters  at a democratic campaign event in chicago  president barack obama weighed in on the controversy  saying trump had been degrading not only to women  but to minorities  immigrants  people of other faiths  and the disabled  obama said that  tells you he is insecure    he pumps himself up by putting other people down   obama said  with republican party leaders in crisis mode and doubts emerging over trump s ability to draw support from crucial undecided voters  there were nonetheless some early signs many of his core supporters would remain loyal  a public opinion poll by politico morning consult  taken just after news broke of the video  found  percent of voters thought trump should withdraw  and  percent said he should stay  of those who said trump should leave  only  percent identified themselves as republicans  as of sunday afternoon  at least  of the united states   sitting republican governors  senators and house of representatives members had condemned trump s remarks  according to a reuters review of official statements and local news coverage  at least  had called for him to withdraw from the race and three other officeholders said he should consider doing so  eight of those said they were withdrawing their endorsement as well  those facing a difficult re election were more likely to speak out  all but six of the  republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive had condemned trump s comments on the video  although only three members of that group called for him to drop out  any attempt to replace trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles   the trump campaign was battling back  circulating  talking points  to a core of high profile republicans who promote trump in the news media  the points sought to undermine establishment republicans who have abandoned trump   they are more concerned with their political future than they are about the future of the country   said a copy of the talking points  described to reuters by two sources close to the campaign  a real estate developer making his first run at public office  trump has made his battle against the establishment a central campaign theme   phones have been blowing up for the past  hours   said a prominent republican political operative in washington  referring to a heavy volume of calls among party officials and republican members of congress     down ballot races the operative  who did not want to be identified  said trump s troubles could steer campaign donations away from him and to republican candidates for congress and other down ballot offices  the source said trump could help himself most during the presidential debate   the second of three before the election   if he addressed the video and an oct   new york times report that he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared   million loss in  that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to  years  despite having recovered from a string of setbacks  trump had an uphill battle to win the white house  before the video surfaced  a reuters ipsos poll had clinton leading by  points on friday  the question now is whether trump s quest for the presidency has been dealt a lethal blow
