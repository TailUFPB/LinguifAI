new york  reuters    donald trump  who often says he only likes winners  tells one grand tale of loss  in   he nearly went bankrupt and was forced to ask dozens of banks to whom he owed money to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts  it was  the real estate developer admits in his  book  the art of the comeback   the darkest period of his professional life  in his telling  it s a story of redemption  of resilience  and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking  six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection  raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of trump s supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the united states on nov    on the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator  trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans   that decision was perhaps the smartest thing i did   he wrote  the six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasn t based on any overture trump initiated with the banks   and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks  not trump   three of the participants say trump didn t acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books  realized he was on the brink of collapse  and summoned him for debt restructuring talks   while much has been written about trump s financial troubles at the time  there has been little examination of his description of the bank negotiations in  the art of the comeback   including his assertion that he chose to initiate those talks  trump s spokeswoman  hope hicks  declined to comment for this story  following the u s  stock market crash of   a global recession hit new york real estate  new construction stalled  and several big developers declared bankruptcy   as the real estate market slumped  trump ran out of cash  at the beginning of  he owed a combined   billion to more than  banks  with   million personally guaranteed by his own assets  according to alan pomerantz  a lawyer whose team led negotiations between trump and  banks to restructure trump s loans  pomerantz was hired by citibank but became lead counsel for the negotiations  at the time  trump was not considered a major developer  but he was a new york celebrity  his affair with the actress marla maples and his divorce from his first wife ivana trump made national news headlines  and his first book   the art of the deal   was a bestseller  he didn t have a large portfolio of real estate in new york  with the notable exceptions of his  avenue building  trump tower  completed in   and the plaza hotel  which he bought in  after borrowing heavily from citibank  he also owned three casinos in atlantic city  having made a financial bet that he could revive the east coast gambling destination  and in  he added part of an airline to his portfolio  again turning to citibank for a loan to help finance the acquisition of bankrupt eastern airlines shuttle  he turned it into trump shuttle  in   in response to growing concerns about the economic downturn  the federal reserve began asking big banks to review their exposure to the sinking real estate market  at the beginning of   a credit specialist at one of trump s biggest lenders decided to take a look at the bank s book of loans to him  the decision was prompted in part by the fed s questions  as well as concerns within the bank about its exposure to the real estate market  the credit specialist  who did not want to be identified  concluded at the time that trump was  about to go into bankruptcy     the banks were onto the problem before he was onto the problem   the specialist told reuters  pomerantz said some of the banks became aware of the magnitude of trump s financial problems when  on a single day  he drew down every cent of a   million line of credit one of the banks  banker s trust  which was purchased by deutsche bank in   had given him to meet his obligations  reuters was unable to independently confirm this   he did not come to the banks and say  i have a problem   that did not happen   said pomerantz  pomerantz  who says he is not a member of any political party  argued in an opinion piece in the wall street journal that trump s record in real estate was not a good way to measure whether or not he would be a good president   in  the art of the comeback   trump says he began loan workout talks in march  when he informed his bankers he might miss a payment on his casino debts    if i had waited just six months longer to renegotiate terms with the banks  i might have lost everything   he wrote   i would have had to stand in line with a whole bunch of other moguls who were trying to do the same thing   soon  in boardrooms of banks and law firms around manhattan  trump s deputies and lawyers began a series of meetings with representatives of the  banks  which had billions in outstanding loans  according to pomerantz  during the same period  trump was separately renegotiating a series of loans on his atlantic city casinos  one of the bankers involved in those negotiations  ben berzin  said trump seemed unaware of the depths of his financial troubles even after the banks had stepped in    there was a period during these negotiations when he was still spending money like a drunken sailor   berzin said  recalling the uproar among the bankers when  in a tv interview in the summer of   trump displayed a large diamond engagement ring he had given maples  media reports said the ring cost     and pomerantz said the bankers complained about it to trump in their next meeting  at one point  trump invited all of the bankers to a broadway show that maples had a role in  according to berzin and a banker who took part in the larger talks with the  banks  both said they believed trump was trying to curry favor to win better terms in the workouts  berzin attended the show but the other banker did not  trump described berzin in  the art of the comeback  as a  jerk  who would  scream at people at the top of his lungs about nonsense   berzin said he was irritated by trump s characterization and denied ever raising his voice in a meeting  in his book  trump says he told representatives of the  banks he would declare bankruptcy and  tie you guys up for years  in the proceedings unless they staked him   million to keep his businesses running until the real estate market recovered  he also wanted them to agree to defer all loan payments until that time     the banks more than capitulated   they enthusiastically agreed to my proposal   trump wrote  the bankers and lawyers interviewed dispute this  though it was true that a personal bankruptcy would have made it harder for the banks to collect what trump owed them  he had little leverage in the talks  they said  he  too  would have been seriously hurt in a bankruptcy  especially since he had personally guaranteed so much of what he had borrowed  in pomerantz s analysis  he would have been able to hold on to little else beyond his home and his pension plan  during the  month process of negotiations and asset sales  trump also asked for more time to develop his business ideas  like his plan to turn hotel rooms at the plaza hotel into condominiums  according to one of the bankers  who declined to be identified  that proposal was vetoed  while he did receive a    a month allowance from the banks to keep his business operations going  it was structured and executed on the banks  terms  several of the negotiators said  the banks decided they could recover more of the   billion they were collectively owed if they sold trump s holdings one by one  waiting until the market recovered  rather than taking possession of the assets  four participants in the talks said   these individuals said the banks agreed to forgive trump s personal liabilities in exchange for his help in selling the properties  the proceeds of the sales would then be split among the banks  trump agreed that the banks could take away all his personal property  including his beloved florida estate  mar a lago  if he failed to execute the agreement   we had to be sure he would pay attention   pomerantz said of the liens on trump s personal holdings   we would meet with him every friday morning  he was under very strict restrictions by the banks    trump worked with the bankers to sell his assets  even when he disagreed about the timing of the sales  most notably when citibank eventually sold the plaza  the banks did not recover  percent of what they were owed and several lenders vowed never to work with trump again
