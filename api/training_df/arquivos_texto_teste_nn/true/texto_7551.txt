washington  reuters    when president barack obama leaves office on jan   after eight years  several of his major initiatives will still hang in the legal balance  meaning the u s  courts and his successor will play a major role in shaping his legacy  ongoing legal challenges by republican governed states and business groups are targeting obama s signature healthcare law  his plan to combat climate change  a key immigration initiative  his transgender rights policy  his  net neutrality  internet rules  overtime pay for workers and other matters  most of the cases are awaiting rulings by trial judges or regional federal appeals courts and could be bound for the u s  supreme court  but are unlikely to get there until after the winner of tuesday s election  pitting democrat hillary clinton against republican donald trump  is sworn in   unless the u s  senate changes course and confirms obama s nominee  appellate court judge merrick garland  to fill the vacant ninth seat on the ideologically split supreme court  the next president would be responsible for selecting a new justice who could cast the deciding vote in these cases   the supreme court has already agreed to decide a major transgender rights case  obama s administration is backing a female born transgender high school student named gavin grimm  who identifies as male and sued in  to win the right to use the school s boys  bathroom  a ruling  which also could resolve similar litigation around the country  is not due until the end of june  in another transgender rights case  a number of states challenged the obama administration s may guidance to public schools nationwide to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice  a federal judge blocked the policy in august while the litigation continues  because obama during much of his presidency has faced a republican controlled congress hostile to his legislative initiatives  he has often bypassed lawmakers and used executive power to advance policy goals   despite having majorities in both houses of congress  republicans have refused to govern  instead  this litigious republican party has rushed to the courts with partisan lawsuits   white house spokesman eric schultz said  those challenging obama have vowed to fight on unless his successor changes course   should a new administration rescind those policies and respect the bounds placed before it  we will happily direct our energies elsewhere   added republican texas attorney general ken paxton  who has helped spearhead various legal challenges to obama  clinton  backed by obama in her white house bid  could be expected to leave in place or even expand on his initiatives and to defend them in court  trump  if elected  could quickly reverse obama executive orders as promised  but undoing large scale regulations like power plant emissions rules could be more complicated    it s not at the stroke of a pen   said sean donahue  a lawyer representing environmental groups that backed obama administration climate rules known as the clean power plan  trump would have to undergo a new  lengthy rule making process  according to legal experts  the case with the biggest potential long term impact is the challenge by states and industry groups to obama s clean power plan  which would curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal fired power plants  the rules are an important legacy issue for obama  they also are vital to u s  obligations under last year s international climate change treaty  a federal appeals court heard oral arguments in september  a ruling is not due for months  the case is likely to go to the supreme court on appeal  the supreme court put the regulations on hold in february while the litigation continues  republicans and conservative groups have launched numerous challenges to the  affordable care act  known as obamacare  the supreme court in  and  issued rulings preserving obama s top legislative achievement   now  another republican led legal challenge is making its way through the courts  the administration has appealed a district court judge s may decision that the federal government cannot spend billions of dollars to provide subsidies under obamacare to help individuals buy policies from private insurers without congressional approval  separately  the administration is seeking in federal court in texas to revive obama s  executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits  the plan  challenged by texas and other states  has been barred by the courts  the supreme court  split    in june left in place lower court orders blocking the plan  and in october declined to revisit that ruling   other obama regulations have been targeted by business groups  a federal appeals court in june upheld obama s landmark  net neutrality  rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content  the case remains under appeal  in september  states and business groups filed a legal challenge to an administration rule to extend mandatory overtime pay to millions of workers  a ruling is not due until after obama leaves office  graphic  courts weigh obama legacy   here
