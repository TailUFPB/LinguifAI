washington  reuters    democrat hillary clinton  suddenly vulnerable in the presidential race  is under pressure to deliver a strong performance against republican donald trump in their first debate on monday  a moment that could be the most consequential yet of the  election  political veterans involved in preparing for past presidential debates said clinton should drive home how she would run the country during uncertain times and draw a contrast as the steady  experienced alternative to the untested trump  for his part  trump needed to show enough gravitas to convince skeptics that he is ready to be commander in chief  they said  the  minute face off at hofstra university in hempstead  new york  the first of three debates  takes place at a time when clinton s once comfortable lead in opinion polls over the former reality tv star has evaporated  history shows that a single bad debate performance can alter the trajectory of a u s  presidential race   reuters ipsos polling shows about  percent of the electorate remains undecided  far higher at this stage in the campaign than the  percent undecided four years ago   the tv audience for the debate is expected to be a record  easily surpassing the record   million households who watched the first encounter between president barack obama and republican mitt romney in   according to the nielsen ratings company       i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent   clinton said on tuesday on the steve harvey radio show  anita dunn  who helped president barack obama prepare for debates against republican nominee john mccain in   said obama succeeded at their first debate by steering the conversation repeatedly back to the struggling u s  economy even though the event was supposed to be about foreign policy  she said she expected clinton to try to exploit trump s weaknesses and emphasize her strengths   the contrast between them is what you want to hone   she said  the debate will be the best opportunity for two candidates  both widely seen by voters as untrustworthy  to put to rest questions about their fitness for the white house with the nov   election fast approaching  even the candidates  body language will be closely scrutinized  just as it has been in past elections  brett o donnell  a debate coach who helped president george w  bush in his  debates and mccain in   said bush did not put in the necessary work for his first debate against democrat john kerry that year and it showed  quickly put on the defensive  bush blinked rapidly and slouched behind the lectern  kerry was judged the winner  bush got more serious about the debates after that  o donnell said  clinton had a shaky performance at a sept   nbc  commander in chief  forum where she became prickly in response to questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as u s  secretary of state   presentation is very important  and hillary has to work on that  her presentation at the  commander in chief  forum was not very good  she didn t come off as likeable  she came off as sour and defensive   o donnell said  clinton is spending most of this week in debate preparations with a small circle of top aides at her home in chappaqua  new york  clinton aides said she is preparing for two scenarios  one in which trump is measured and serious  and another in which he is freewheeling and makes inflammatory personal attacks  trump relied on his famed spontaneity to fire off one line zingers to dismantle  republican rivals during the primaries  dispatching  low energy  jeb bush or  lying ted  cruz and  little marco  rubio  he has repeatedly called clinton  crooked hillary  at rallies   you re just not sure who is going to show up   said jennifer palmieri  a senior adviser to clinton   he may be aggressive or he may lay back  that s hard to game out necessarily so i would say most of the focus is on what points does she want to make   a trump supporter  republican u s  representative chris collins of new york  said trump understands that he needs to put forth a presidential demeanor   i think the seriousness of that can t be understated and that we re going to see the debate prep making sure that she s not going to be able to pull him somehow off the message   he said  rick lazio  a republican former congressman from new york  found clinton a tough opponent when he faced her in a u s  senate debate in new york in   he was seen as bullying  lost the debate and the election  and now says trump will need to treat clinton carefully   what he has to avoid is a sense that he is name calling  highly disrespectful  badgering  anything like that   he said  role playing former republican senator judd gregg  who played democrats al gore and john kerry in george w  bush s mock debate sessions in  and   said bush began preparing in early june unbeknownst to the news media and for a while did two practice sessions a day  for that reason  he said  he suspects trump is doing more preparation work than he lets on   i have to believe he is doing something because it would be foolish to go in there and not practice at hearing lines   he said  a republican source close to the campaign said former fox news chief executive roger ailes has been coaching trump but that the former reality tv star does not want to be over prepared  trump spokesman jason miller said trump is preparing for the debates but  there s nobody who s playing the role of hillary clinton    mr  trump prepares for everything that he does   he said
