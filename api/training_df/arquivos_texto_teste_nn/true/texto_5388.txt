washington  reuters    a crisis over the relationship between president donald trump s aides and russia deepened on wednesday as a growing number of trump s fellow republicans demanded expanded congressional inquiries into the matter  trump sought to focus attention on what he called criminal intelligence leaks about his ousted national security adviser  michael flynn  trump forced flynn out on monday after disclosures he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office  and that he later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  the drama of flynn s departure was the latest in a series of white house missteps and controversies since the republican president was sworn in on jan    at a news conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday  trump said flynn  a retired u s  army lieutenant general  was a  wonderful man  who had been mistreated by the news media  but republican trump critics including senators john mccain and lindsey graham voiced fresh consternation  adding to the pressure were comments by senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  who has been a trump supporter  corker said the russia issue was threatening trump s agenda on foreign affairs and domestic matters like healthcare and tax policy  he questioned whether the white house was able to stabilize itself and said flynn should testify before congress   let s get everything out as quickly as possible on this russia issue   corker told msnbc s  morning joe  program   maybe there s a problem that obviously goes much deeper than what we now suspect   democrats  doubting trump s justice department or the republican led congress will pursue the matter vigorously  have demanded an independent investigation of possible illegal communications between flynn and the russian government and any efforts by flynn or other white house officials to conceal wrongdoing  the most powerful democrat in the senate  chuck schumer  said attorney general jeff sessions  a close ally of trump  must recuse himself from any investigation  the republican and democratic leaders of the u s  senate judiciary committee asked sessions and fbi director james comey on wednesday to send the committee documents and provide a briefing on flynn s resignation  citing reports that both the federal bureau of investigation and justice department were involved in events leading to flynn s departure  senators chuck grassley and dianne feinstein said they raised  substantial questions  about flynn s discussion with russian officials  graham called for a broader bipartisan congressional investigation to be conducted by a newly formed special committee rather than existing committees  if it turns out  trump s presidential campaign communicated with the russians  but the top republicans in the senate and house of representatives have insisted the matter be investigated by existing republican led committees  the senate and house intelligence committees and a subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee have announced they launched investigations into alleged russian efforts to influence the election through computer hacking  u s  intelligence agencies previously concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the nov   election in trump s favor  congressional inquiries into alleged russian interference in the u s  elections are gaining momentum as capitol hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents   the fbi and several u s  intelligence agencies are investigating russian espionage operations in the united states  they are also looking at contacts in russia between russian intelligence officers or others with ties to president vladimir putin s government and people connected to trump or his campaign  the fbi recently questioned flynn about his telephone contacts with the russian ambassador in washington  people familiar with the agency s multiple probes said there was no evidence so far of pre election collusion between russians and trump s campaign  or any evidence of criminal activity by flynn or anyone else connected to trump  some experts expressed concern the white house could curtail or divert probes into flynn and russian involvement in the election unless congress becomes more aggressive by holding hearings and appointing an independent commission or special prosecutor into whether trump s team violated federal laws in their contacts with russia  intelligence agencies now overseen by trump may not be ideally suited to the job  they added   it s not  at the end of the day  the job of the intelligence community to regulate the white house   and it shouldn t be   said stephen vladeck  a university of texas law professor who focuses on constitutional law and national security   very un american  in twitter posts on wednesday  trump called the reported russian connection with his campaign team nonsense and said the leaks were the  real scandal   from early on in his white house bid  trump said he would like improved relations with putin  a stance criticized by democrats and those republicans concerned about washington softening its stance after russia s annexation of crimea from ukraine and aggression in syria  only a few republican lawmakers have supported even the idea of extending any investigation to cover actions by trump s team in the weeks after the election  when flynn made his calls  some republicans  including house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes  are calling for investigations into leaks to the news media of conversations between flynn and russia s ambassador in washington  the trump administration has offered flynn s former job to u s  navy vice admiral robert harward  said two u s  officials familiar with the matter  it was not immediately clear if harward  a former deputy commander of u s  central command  had accepted the offer  according to sources
