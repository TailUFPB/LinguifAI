washington  reuters    a drop in the u s  unemployment rate last month to a  year low signals the risk of a collision between president elect donald trump s plans to goose the economy and the federal reserve s efforts to tap the brakes with higher interest rates  since trump s election  officials at the u s  central bank have cautiously introduced the possibility that his spending and tax cut plans could prompt a faster pace of rate increases than the two hikes currently foreseen in   an increase is already expected when the fed meets in two weeks  fresh economic projections  the first since the election  will also be issued and fed chair janet yellen will hold a news conference when the meeting concludes on dec    with november s decline  the jobless rate is now already below the most optimistic projections from fed policymakers for where it would stand at year end  if it keeps moving lower  trump s spending and tax cut plans may be adding fuel to a tank that s already brimming  possible new trade or immigration restrictions could make markets even tighter  and switch the fed from worrying about the risk of deflation to fighting price rises before they get out of hand   there is much more than the trump election driving the     rally that started the day after the election   bank of the west chief economist scott anderson wrote   we are seeing signs of a synchronized rebound in the global economy   when fed policymakers issued their last projections in september  the lowest level predicted for the unemployment rate at the end of the year was   percent  in november  it fell three tenths of a percentage point to   percent  the decline was partly due to a drop in the labor force participation rate  which officials have expected to begin falling again because of an aging population with more retirees  in general  the lower the unemployment rate  the slower the pace of job growth the economy can sustain without pushing up wages and prices too quickly  policymakers insist they still have time to move rates higher to keep price increases under control  several officials feel it may even help fix some of the damage from the   recession if inflation moved above the fed s  percent target for a while  that might  for example  allow steady wage increases to restore some of the ground lost by workers  however  in recent months even ostensibly dovish officials  like boston fed president eric rosengren  have cautioned that steady rate hikes might be needed to avoid the need for even faster increases that could trigger a recession    i view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate  not because i want to curtail the expansion  but because i believe it will help prolong the expansion   cleveland federal reserve bank president loretta mester said on wednesday   trump s victory gives that debate more urgency  his plans for a big infrastructure spending package  tax cuts and tighter controls on immigration could test the limits of what the economy can absorb before overheating    for a year now  fed officials have said they expect job growth to slow as the economy nears full employment  it hasn t happened  meaning trump will take office at what may be a tough point of inflection  either job creation slows or inflation jumps  jed kolko  chief economist at the indeed job site  said the current pace of job growth and low unemployment rate  sets a baseline for the trump administration    recent wage gains and unemployment declines make this a tough economy to improve on   he said
