washington  reuters    several intriguing scenarios could unfold after tuesday s u s  election to break the deadlock over filling a supreme court vacancy that has provoked a bitter nine month standoff between president barack obama and senate republicans  obama nominated u s  appeals court judge merrick garland on march  to replace long serving conservative justice antonin scalia  who died on feb    the republican led senate  in a move with little precedent  has refused to consider the nomination  saying the winner of the presidential election should make the pick  if republican donald trump wins  garland s nomination would be dead  trump has already put forth a list of conservative jurists as potential nominees  if obama s fellow democrat hillary clinton wins  there are ways garland could secure senate confirmation to the lifetime post before obama leaves office on jan    senate republican leader mitch mcconnell has been adamant that obama s successor should select scalia s replacement and that he will not consider garland s nomination during a post election  lame duck  session  but mcconnell could come under pressure by some senate republicans to allow confirmation hearings and a vote on garland  who has a reputation in washington as a moderate  out of fear clinton could instead choose a more liberal nominee  the senate s inaction on garland has made the supreme court a potent issue in the election  after many years of leaning conservative  a new democratic appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades  scalia s death left the court split with four liberals and four conservatives  conservative activists dismiss the notion garland is a moderate  saying he would vote with the four liberal justices on major  ideologically divisive issues   garland is a liberal  not a centrist   said carrie severino  a lawyer with the judicial crisis network  liberal activists like caroline fredrickson  president of the american constitution society  said republicans should move forward on garland   he s got every qualification you could ask for  he s exactly the type of judge they claimed they wanted   fredrickson said  if democrats win control of the senate in tuesday s election  the new congressional session would begin on jan    and they could decide to move forward immediately on garland s nomination before obama s term ends  clinton would play a major role by deciding whether or not she wanted to stick with garland  who was named to his current job by her husband bill clinton in   or choose her own nominee   chief judge garland is the most experienced nominee to the supreme court in our nation s history   white house spokeswoman brandi hoffine said  it is time for republicans to  stop putting politics over the best interest of the country and do their job by giving the president s nominee to the supreme court a hearing and a vote   she added  clinton has said garland should be confirmed this year but has not committed to re nominating him if she wins  some republicans have floated the idea of staunch opposition to any clinton nominee  raising the possibility of the seat remaining vacant long term  mcconnell has said no obama nominee will be confirmed this year  there are no signs so far of republican leaders backing off that position  garland    and other members of the washington legal community joined the eight current justices inside the supreme court s ornate courtroom on friday at an memorial event honoring scalia  four days before the election that will help decide his fate  there has been little controversy over garland s suitability to sit on the supreme court as there has been with some past nominees  he is widely respected in the legal community and has won praise from democrats and republicans
