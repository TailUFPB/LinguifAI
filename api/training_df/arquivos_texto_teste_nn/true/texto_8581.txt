washington san francisco  reuters    a computer network used by democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on democratic political organizations  people familiar with the matter told reuters  the latest attack  which was disclosed to reuters on friday  follows two other hacks on the democratic national committee  or dnc  and the party s fundraising committee for candidates for the u s  house of representatives  a clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on friday that an analytics data program maintained by the dnc and used by the campaign and a number of other entities  was accessed as part of the dnc hack    our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts  to date  they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised   said clinton campaign spokesman nick merrill  later  a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics program s server for approximately five days  the analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis  and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers  the official said  the u s  department of justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on democratic political organizations threatened u s  security  sources familiar with the matter said on friday  the involvement of the justice department s national security division is a sign that the obama administration has concluded that the hacking was sponsored by a state  people with knowledge of the investigation said  while it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to  the third such attack on sensitive democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond  just over three months before the nov   u s  presidential election  hackers  whom u s  intelligence officials have concluded were russian  gained access to the entire network of the fundraising democratic congressional campaign committee  or dccc  said people familiar with the matter  detailing the extent of the breach to reuters for the first time  cyber security experts and u s  officials said earlier this week they had concluded  based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the dnc hack  that russia engineered the release of hacked democratic party emails to influence the u s  presidential election  the u s  federal bureau of investigation said on friday it was  aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities  and is working to determine the accuracy  nature and scope of these matters    the fbi takes seriously any allegations of intrusions  and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace   the agency said in an emailed statement  the hack did not involve the private email system clinton used while she was secretary of state  yahoo news reported on thursday night that the fbi had warned the clinton campaign last march that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation  but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive  a source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to reuters   the new disclosure to reuters that hackers gained access to the full dccc network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support democratic candidates in campaigns for the house  the hack of the dccc  which is based in washington  was reported first by reuters on thursday  ahead of clinton s speech in philadelphia accepting the democratic party s nomination  russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment  several u s  officials said the obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to russia as that might undermine secretary of state john kerry s effort to win russian cooperation in the war on islamic state in syria  the officials said the administration fears russian president vladimir putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on u s  targets  increasing military harassment of u s  and allied aircraft and warships in the baltic and black seas  and making more aggressive moves in eastern europe  some officials question the approach  arguing that responding more forcefully to russia would be more effective than remaining silent  the obama administration announced in an april  executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks   the hack on the dnc  made public in june  led to wikileaks publishing more than   emails last weekend  some of them showing favoritism within the dnc for clinton over u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz resigned on sunday as a result  creating a rocky start for the party s convention in philadelphia this week  republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday invited russia to dig up thousands of  missing  emails from clinton s time at the state department  prompting democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on americans  on thursday  trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm  earlier in the week  clinton campaign senior policy adviser jake sullivan had criticized trump and called the hacking  a national security issue   trump campaign spokesman jason miller said on friday the reported breach showed cyber security is  a problem wherever hillary clinton goes  hopefully this time there wasn t classified or top secret information that puts american lives at risk   in washington  the dccc said early on friday it had hired cyber security firm crowdstrike to investigate   we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network   the dccc said   we are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation   the dccc had no additional comment late on friday  officials at the dnc did not respond to requests for comment   senator dianne feinstein  a california democrat and the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee  told cnn on friday she had not heard about the hack of the clinton campaign  but she said   it wouldn t surprise me  i think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that there s a problem out there  everybody should be cautious
