 new york  reuters    a u s  appeals court is weighing arguments for and against president donald trump s temporary travel ban  but its decision this week may not yet answer the underlying legal questions being raised in the fast moving case   the  u s  circuit court of appeals in san francisco is expected to rule only on the narrow question of whether a lower court s emergency halt to an executive order by trump was justified  trump signed the order on jan   barring citizens from seven muslim majority countries for  days and halted all refugee entries for four months   the appeals court has several options  it could kick the case back to lower court judge james robart in seattle  saying it is premature for them to make a ruling before he has had a chance to consider all the evidence  robart stopped trump s order just a week after he issued it and before all the arguments had been developed on both sides   or the panel of three appellate judges could side with the government and find halting the order was harmful to national security  reinstating it while the case continues   their decision is  one step in what will be a long  historic case   stephen yale loehr  a professor at cornell university law school who specializes in immigration  ultimately  the case is likely to end up in the u s  supreme court  legal experts said   the case is the first serious test of executive authority since trump became president on jan    and legal experts said there were three main issues at play for the judiciary   the broad questions in the case are whether the states have the right to challenge federal immigration laws  how much power the court has to question the president s national security decisions  and if the order discriminates against muslims   washington state filed the original lawsuit  claiming it was hurt by the ban when students and faculty from state run universities and corporate employees were stranded overseas   trump administration lawyer august flentje argued at an appeals court hearing on tuesday that the states lack  standing  to sue the federal government over immigration law  but his arguments were questioned by the judges   if the court decides the states are allowed to bring the case  the next major question is about the limits of the president s power    historically courts have been exceedingly deferential to governmental actions in the immigration area   said jonathan adler  a case western reserve university school of law professor  though  he added   the way they carried it out understandably makes some people  and perhaps some courts  uneasy with applying the traditional rules    trump issued the order late on a friday and caused chaos at airports as officials struggled to quickly change procedures   at tuesday s hearing  judge richard clifton  an appointee of republican president george w  bush and judge william canby  an appointee of democratic president jimmy carter  pushed the government to explain what would happen if trump simply decided to ban all muslims from entering the united states   would anybody be able to challenge that   canby asked   flentje emphasized that the order did not ban muslims  he said the president made a determination about immigration policy based on a legitimate assessment of risk   the government has said its order is grounded in a law passed by congress that allows the president to suspend the entry of  any class of aliens  that he deems  would be detrimental to the interests of the united states    when asked by the third judge   michelle friedland  appointed by democrat barack obama   if that meant the president s decisions are  unreviewable  flentje  after a pause  answered  yes   when pressed  flentje acknowledged  however  that constitutional concerns had been raised about the order   one of the main concerns is allegations by the states  civil rights groups  some lawmakers and citizens that the order discriminates in violation of the constitution s first amendment  which prohibits favoring one religion over another   the judges will have to decide whether to look exclusively at the actual text of the president s order  which does not mention any particular religion  or consider outside comments by trump and his team to discern their intent   washington state s attorney noah purcell told the hearing that even though the lawsuit is at an early stage  the amount of evidence that trump intended to discriminate against muslims is  remarkable   it cited trump s campaign promises of a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states    in a tweet on monday night  trump said  the threat from radical islamic terrorism is very real  urging the courts to act quickly   government lawyer flentje countered purcell by saying there was danger in second guessing trump s decision making about u s  security  based on some newspaper articles    clifton asked about statements on fox news by trump adviser rudolph giuliani  former new york mayor and former prosecutor  that trump had asked him to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal    do you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then candidate trump and to his political advisers and most recently mr  giuliani   clifton asked   either those types of statements were made or not   said clifton   if they were made it is potential evidence
