jacksonville  fla  reuters    when u s  manufacturing employment peaked  jimmy carter was president  inflation was  percent  and craftsmen at frontier contact lenses made the company s products one at a time on diamond tipped lathes  as presidential candidates promise to reclaim jobs lost in the intervening decades  they might want to visit the company now  bought by johnson   johnson  jnj n  in   the fully automated factory allows four workers to produce in a  hour shift what more labor intensive methods produced in a year  the jacksonville plant and one in ireland make  billion soft contacts a year  and between the robots and lasers and computer algorithms no worker touches the product from the start of the process through final packaging   i don t think you could even make  billion lenses  using the old method  said david turner  vice president of research and development for johnson   johnson vision care  inc   you d need a guy with a lathe in every town   since peaking at   million in   the number of u s  manufacturing jobs has fallen  percent to around   million as of march  or just over  percent of the private sector workforce   graphic  tmsnrt rs   that may be as good as it gets  despite the promises made on the campaign trail by republican frontrunner donald trump and other candidates  the next president will find it hard to raise manufacturing s share of a u s  labor force that keeps shifting toward services  while much of the jobs debate has centered on trade pacts  that democrats and republicans have backed over the last quarter century  both successful and struggling companies and sectors offer evidence of long term trends that neither sharp trade negotiators nor aggressive political leaders can easily reverse  even critics of trade deals acknowledge that labor intensive industries  such as textiles  which once employed hundreds of thousands of less skilled workers  are probably gone for good  technology continues to diminish the share of labor in production and its spread around the world has made other nations   notably china  but also korea  brazil  mexico and former soviet bloc countries   competitive both as exporters and in their own markets  investment worldwide is drifting steadily toward services  according to the united nations conference on trade and development  and americans are spending relatively less of their income on manufactured goods      a reuters analysis of federal data for   categories of goods shows that the united states has been running a trade deficit in more than  of them since at least    before the north american free trade agreement came into force or china joined the world trade organization  events often cited as turning points for u s  manufacturing  since the   recession manufacturing has added about   jobs  but that has lagged overall job growth  as a result manufacturing s share of private employment has continued to fall  from about  percent since the recession ended   the move toward a more global market hurts the marginal  low skilled worker  but it was inevitable and you cannot roll it back   said brookings institution senior fellow barry bosworth  at careersource northeast florida  a job development group  president bruce ferguson  jr  said by necessity he focused on finding a  path  for entry level service sector employees to move up a career ladder  because services are where the growth is     the raw  manufacturing  numbers don t look anything like the service sector and they never will   he said   a majority of   americans surveyed in march as part of reuters ipsos  campaign polling acknowledged that free trade brings lower prices  but also saw it as a drag on wages and jobs and an  important  issue for the next president to confront  tapping such concerns  trump has promised punitive tariffs to  bring back  jobs for those left behind in the current recovery  particularly the roughly two thirds of americans without a college degree     former secretary of state hillary clinton switched gears as a candidate to oppose a major pacific trade deal and promises billions in public support for manufacturing  her democratic rival bernie sanders calls for worker protection against what he considers unfair trade  while republican ted cruz has focused on trimming government red tape  however  playing tough on trade carries some risks and there are limits to what trade talks and tariffs can accomplish  the u s  steel industry is a case in point  the american iron and steel institute estimates around   jobs were lost to a recent jump in imports  mainly from china  it reckons those jobs could be recovered with steps  such as the anti dumping duties imposed by washington late last year  that pales  however  in comparison with more than   jobs that the sector has lost since the early   some because of imports  but some because the amount of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has fallen from  hours to less than two    there has been a short term loss that is definitely attributable to imports  while a longer term trend reflects technological innovation   said kevin dempsey  the institute s senior vice president   such dynamic is not limited to old industries like steel  florida is home to successful manufacturers big and small in a wide range of sectors  which export nearly half of their output   double the national average  yet  as is the case nationally  the share of jobs available to those with a high school degree has been shrinking since   according to federal data  and wages have been stagnant  johnson   johnson vision care s recent approval of a   million expansion  which added some  jobs  cements the company s u s  presence  but also shows how technology and innovation reshape the landscape  the company s local workforce has risen to around    but about  percent of that are white collar and non manufacturing jobs   from research positions for phd scientists to those in sales and a highly automated shipping operation  florida development officials say the trend is clear  manufacturers keep cutting the labor content of their products and each round of investment tends to drive up the skill levels that workers need  that may benefit the state s economy  but acts as a reality check for workers who hope that the november  presidential vote can reverse decades old trends   how do you evaluate a company that says we will spend a lot of money and make the workforce more qualified but not create many jobs   said aaron bowman  senior vice president for business development at jaxusa partnership  a regional economic development agency and division of the local chamber of commerce   over time you see more projects that bring in fewer jobs but a bigger bang
