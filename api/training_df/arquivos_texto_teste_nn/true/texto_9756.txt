new york  reuters    more than half of american voters believe that the system u s  political parties use to pick their candidates for the white house is  rigged  and more than two thirds want to see the process changed  according to a reuters ipsos poll  the results echo complaints from republican front runner donald trump and democratic challenger bernie sanders that the system is stacked against them in favor of candidates with close ties to their parties   a critique that has triggered a nationwide debate over whether the process is fair  the united states is one of just a handful of countries that gives regular voters any say in who should make it onto the presidential ballot  but the state by state system of primaries  caucuses and conventions is complex  the contests historically were always party events  and while the popular vote has grown in influence since the mid  century  the parties still have considerable sway   one quirk of the u s  system   and the area where the parties get to flex their muscle   is the use of delegates  party members who are assigned to support contenders at their respective conventions  usually based on voting results  the parties decide how delegates are awarded in each state  with the republicans and democrats having different rules  the delegates  personal opinions can come into play at the party conventions if the race is too close to call   an issue that has become a lightning rod in the current political season  another complication is that state governments have different rules about whether voters must be registered as party members to participate  in some states  parties further restrict delegate selection to small committees of party elites  as the republican party in colorado did this year   i d prefer to see a one man one vote system   said royce young    a resident of society hill  south carolina  who supports democratic front runner hillary clinton   the process is so flawed       trump has repeatedly railed against the rules  at times calling them undemocratic  after the colorado republican party awarded all its delegates to ted cruz  for example  trump lashed out in a wall street journal opinion piece  charging  the system is being rigged by party operatives with  double agent  delegates who reject the decision of voters   republican national committee chairman reince priebus has dismissed trump s complaints as  rhetoric  and said the rules would not be changed before the republican convention in july  trump swept the five northeastern nominating contests on tuesday in pennsylvania  maryland  delaware  connecticut and rhode island  the new york billionaire has  delegates to  for cruz  a u s  senator from texas  and  for kasich  the ohio governor  according to the associated press  a total of   delegates are needed to secure the republican nomination  on the democratic side  sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  has taken issue with the party s use of superdelegates  the hundreds of elite party members who can support whomever they like at the convention and who this year overwhelmingly back front runner hillary clinton  clinton has repeatedly emphasized that she is beating sanders in both total votes cast and in pledged delegates  those who are bound by the voting results   rendering his complaints about superdelegates moot  on tuesday  the former secretary of state won pennsylvania  maryland  delaware and connecticut  while sanders won in rhode island  clinton leads sanders by   delegates to    according to the ap  with   needed to win the nomination  sanders has also criticized party bosses for not holding enough prime time television debates and said before a string of primaries open only to registered democrats this month that  independents have lost their right to vote   referring to a voter block that has tended to favor him   a democratic national committee official was not immediately available to comment  larry sabato  director of the university of virginia center for politics  said the u s  presidential nominating system could probably be improved in a number of areas  but noted that the control wielded by party leadership usually became an issue only during tight races   the popular vote overwhelms the rules usually  but in these close elections  everyone pays attention to these arcane rules   he said  some  percent of likely voters who responded to the april   online survey said they believed the primary system was  rigged  against some candidates  some  percent of respondents said they would prefer to pick their party s nominee with a direct vote  cutting out the use of delegates as intermediaries      the results also showed  percent of likely voters did not understand how the primary process works and  percent did not understand why delegates were involved in the first place  the responses were about the same for republicans and democrats      overall  nearly half said they would also prefer a single primary day in which all states held their nominating contests together   as opposed to the current system of spreading them out for months      the poll included   americans and had a credibility interval of   percentage points
