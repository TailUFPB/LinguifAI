washington  reuters    a hard line republican effort to impeach the top u s  tax collector came under fire on tuesday from democrats who called it an unsubstantiated partisan attack that could undermine the credibility of congress  internal revenue service commissioner john koskinen faces  allegations before the house judiciary committee of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers  the accusations stem from a  scandal in which the irs was criticized for targeting conservative tea party groups  applications for tax exempt status for extra scrutiny  some republicans want the republican controlled u s  house of representatives to vote on impeaching koskinen before congress leaves for its midyear break in july  democrats oppose the effort    this resolution fails by every measure  it arises from the worst partisan instincts  it is not based in the facts   representative john conyers said at the outset of the first of two judiciary committee hearings to examine charges against koskinen   when a vote for impeachment is divided on party lines     we undermine our credibility   added conyers  the panel s top democrat  koskinen angered critics by declining to testify  but submitted a statement saying the charges are without merit and fail to meet the constitutional impeachment standard of  treason  bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors   in his absence  the committee heard from republicans on the house oversight and government reform committee  which investigated the tea party scandal and concluded that koskinen failed to preserve evidence that was later destroyed   this is really a simple case in my mind  when congress asks you a question  you re expected to give a truthful answer  when congress issues a subpoena  compliance is not optional   house oversight panel chairman jason chaffetz testified  chaffetz described impeachment as the remedy congress has for officials guilty of breaching the public trust  but democrats noted that irs and federal bureau of investigation probes produced no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or deliberate efforts to mislead congress  they said the case against koskinen showed little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements  judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte offered no direct criticism of the impeachment push  but avoided using the term other than to name impeachment as one of several options that include  the power to write the laws  the power of the purse     and the power to censure
