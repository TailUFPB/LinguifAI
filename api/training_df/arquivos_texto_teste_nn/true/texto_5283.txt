new york  reuters    a u s  department of homeland security plan to add more than   border enforcement agents will present logistical challenges and might be unnecessary  according to former government officials familiar with earlier pushes to accelerate border hiring  three former top officials at u s  customs and border patrol  cbp  told reuters in interviews that ramping up hiring at the agency  as outlined in a directive on tuesday  would be expensive  while rapid expansion poses the risk of corruption if screening protocols for recruits are relaxed   the officials said the agency should get what it needs to secure the border  but they questioned whether such a major staff expansion was necessary  noting that apprehensions at the border have dropped      congress is going to be looking at this very carefully and looking for justification for this kind of money to make sure they don t write a check that is not necessary   said w  ralph basham who headed u s  customs and border protection during the george w  bush administration   the question will be do we need more agents or do we need money for technology and infrastructure   he said   additional enforcement officers are central to president donald trump s sweeping plan to crack down on illegal immigration  outlined in jan   executive orders on border security and interior enforcement  tuesday s homeland security guidance for implementing those orders called for adding more than   border patrol agents and   immigration and customs enforcement  or ice  officers  who enforce immigration laws in the country s interior  among other duties  the white house and department of homeland security did not respond to a question about the rationale behind the number of personnel requested   at the end of the day  the goal is to get control of the border and enhance the security of the country   said white house assistant press secretary michael short in an email   the proposed hiring surge would be the largest since the bush administration  when congress funded an expansion of border enforcement following the sept     terror attacks  that effort doubled the number of border patrol agents from nearly   in  to nearly   by   according to cbp  the agency was required to meet tight time requirements for hiring  said basham who was appointed commissioner in  the laser focus on quick hiring  and its cost  ended up  sucking all the air  out of other parts of the department  basham recalled  leaving gaps for other spending needs  basham said he supports cbp getting adequate resources and was encouraged that the new department of homeland security guidelines did not mandate a deadline to complete the hiring  but he questioned the need for a renewed expansion of the force  more than   million migrants were apprehended trying to cross the u s  mexico border illegally in  compared to   last year  according to cbp statistics   currently the flow is not really anywhere near where it was   basham said   jim wong  who was deputy assistant commissioner of cbp s office of internal affairs from  to   said money might be better spent on other department needs     throwing more human resources at the issue is not necessarily the best way to approach it   he said       the union representing border patrol agents  which backed trump in the presidential election  has long supported adding personnel  saying more manpower is needed to secure the border  said union spokesman shawn moran  homeland security spokespeople declined to estimate how much the increased hiring would cost   the  fiscal year budget request for staffing at current levels of more than   border patrol agents was about    billion for salary  overtime and benefits  or about    per officer on average  although officers with different levels of seniority earn different wages  additional costs could include housing for agents working in remote areas  equipment and support staff  former officials said    in the last budget cycle  the agency requested funding for  fewer officers than the year before to instead invest in replacing aging radios and vehicles  cbp said the request reflected  realistic agent hiring expectations   gil kerlikowske  who headed cbp for three years under president barack obama  said one risk of rapid hiring is quality control    when you speed up the process and don t take the requisite time you pay a price later in things like corruption   kerlikowske said  during the bush era hiring surge  the border patrol had problems screening candidates  and internal corruption cases soon spiked  according to congressional testimony and government documents  congress then passed the anti border corruption act in   which made polygraph testing mandatory for all border patrol agents  since then  tests have revealed candidates who were compromised by drug cartels or were heavy drug users themselves  but the polygraph test and other controls have also slowed the hiring process  a  gao report found that between  and   only  percent of applicants passed their polygraph exams  in addition to polygraph tests  applicants now undergo a rigorous hiring process  including a cognitive exam  fingerprinting  financial disclosure  fitness tests  medical examinations and background checks  according to the government accountability office  gao   kerlikowske said when he left the agency at the time of trump s inauguration there were   authorized but unfilled openings for border patrol agents due to the difficulty of finding and vetting enough qualified candidates
