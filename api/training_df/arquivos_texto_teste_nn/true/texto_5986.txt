 reuters    rogue twitter feeds voicing employee concerns at more than a dozen u s  government agencies have been launched in defiance of what they say are president donald trump s attempts to muzzle federal climate change research and other science  representing scientists at the environmental protection agency  nasa and other bureaus  either directly or through friends and supporters  the accounts protest restrictions they view as censorship since trump took office on jan    seizing on trump s favorite mode of discourse  the feeds reflect concern that the new president  a climate change skeptic  is out to squelch federally backed research showing that emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other human activities are contributing to global warming   can t wait for president trump to call us fake news   read one posting on the newly opened twitter account  altnatparkservice   you can take our official twitter  but you ll never take our free time   reuters could not verify that all the accounts  which borrow the names and logos of their respective agencies  were being run by current federal employees of those agencies  the alternate national park service twitter feed said it had passed control of its account to individuals outside the government to protect colleagues at the agency   the introductory disclaimer borne by the  roguenasa account was typical of many of the feeds  describing it as  the unofficial  resistance  team of nasa  not an official nasa account   it beckoned readers to follow its feed  for science and climate news and facts  real news  real facts   an administrator of an associated rogue nasa facebook page told reuters the alternative site was being used as a platform by agency scientists and others who support them  in some instances  the alternate twitter accounts were registered on behalf of employees by supporters  presumably to better safeguard their anonymity  as was the case for the unofficial rocky mountain national park site  an individual contacted at the alternative twitter feed for mount rainier national park said   it s not about the people running the accounts  it s about the movement it s generated  we may never disclose our identity due to the current political ecosystem   the swift proliferation of such sites followed internal directives several agencies involved in environmental issues have received since trump s inauguration requiring them to curb their dissemination of information to the public      last week  interior department staff were told to stop posting on twitter after an employee re tweeted posts about relatively low attendance at trump s swearing in  and about how material on climate change and civil rights had disappeared from the official white house website  employees at the epa and the departments of interior  agriculture and health and human services have since confirmed seeing notices from the new administration either instructing them to remove web pages or limit how they communicate to the public  including through social media  the resistance movement gained steam on tuesday when a series of climate change related tweets were posted to the official twitter account of badlands national park in south dakota  administered under the interior department  but were soon deleted  a park service official later said those tweets came from a former employee no longer authorized to use the official account and that the agency was being encouraged to use twitter to post public safety and park information only  and to avoid national policy issues  within hours  unofficial resistance  or rogue  twitter accounts began sprouting up  emblazoned with the logos of government agencies  the list growing to at least  such sites by wednesday afternoon  an account dubbed  ungaggedepa invited followers to visit its feeds of  ungagged news  links  tips and conversation that the u s  environmental protection agency is unable to tell you   adding that it was  not directly affiliated with  epa    civil servants have a job to do and part of that job is to interpret the national parks and history behind it   said a former official at the interior department  the parent agency of the national park service  who spoke on condition of anonymity  the former official said that while people outside the federal government could be involved in the rogue accounts  employees with whom the official communicated were supporting the feeds   they bristle at any political involvement   the former official said   they re taking that as an attack on their work  you have   people feeling attacked  you re going to play whack a mole trying to stop them  i don t see this stopping   the phenomenon was not limited to u s  environmental and natural resource employees  they were soon joined by similar alternative twitter accounts for various science and health agencies  including the food and drug administration  the national institutes of health  the centers for disease control and prevention and the national weather service  many of their messages carried twitter hashtags  resist or  resistance
