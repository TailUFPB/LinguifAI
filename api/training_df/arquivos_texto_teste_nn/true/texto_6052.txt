washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump signed orders on tuesday smoothing the path for the controversial keystone xl and dakota access oil pipelines in a move to expand energy infrastructure and roll back key obama administration environmental actions   oil producers in canada and north dakota are expected to benefit from a quicker route for crude oil to u s  gulf coast refiners  but going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for native american tribes and climate activists  who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action  trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production  before taking office he said the dakota pipeline should be completed and that he would revive the c  billion     billion  keystone xl project  which was rejected in  by then president barack obama  u s  crude imports have fallen dramatically in recent years as domestic production has boomed  but the world s largest oil consumer still relies heavily on imports  even though canada is already the biggest source of u s  crude imports  boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in washington as a way to improve u s  energy security   it goes to show we as a nation build infrastructure that is part of a comprehensive energy plan to make our energy secure   republican senator john hoeven of north dakota told reuters   transcanada corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for keystone xl after trump signed an order saying the company could re apply  the application will be reviewed by the u s  state department  which has  days to reach a decision   the orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in north dakota against energy transfer partners  which has nearly completed construction of the dakota line  despite the advanced phase of the project  the obama administration in december denied the company a permit to tunnel under the missouri river  protesters rallied for months against plans to route the    billion pipeline beneath a lake near the standing rock sioux reservation  saying it threatened water resources and sacred native american sites  at one point  nearly   people had flocked to federal land in north dakota  including   veterans after protests turned violent at times  the main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the standing rock tribe asked activists to leave when the u s  army corps of engineers denied the easement  in a statement on tuesday  the standing rock sioux said they would fight the orders   americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent  the existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights  contaminating our water and the water of  million americans downstream   said dave archambault ii  chairman of the standing rock tribe  the north dakota petroleum council  the trade group for state oil producers relying on dakota access to expand their crude transport options  cheered trump s order  about  million barrels a day are currently produced in north dakota   we think this is a great step forward for energy security in america   said ron ness  the council s president          the more than   bpd keystone xl pipeline would bring heavy crude from canada to the u s  gulf coast  the project was conceived nearly a decade ago  but since then the u s  shale revolution has redefined oil flows  with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports   canadian natural resources minister jim carr said in calgary that keystone xl has all the regulatory approvals it needs in canada  and that the project would be  very positive for canada                      environmental activists campaigned against the keystone xl pipeline for more than seven years  eventually winning a victory when obama rejected the project in    trip van noppen  president of nonprofit environmental law organization earthjustice  said in a statement that trump  appears to be ignoring the law  public sentiment and ethical considerations  with the decision  transcanada shares closed up   percent on the toronto stock exchange   trump said on tuesday in washington that keystone xl would create   jobs  but that figure is at odds with a  u s  state department environmental study that said the project would create   construction jobs and  permanent jobs   shares of etp  the company building the   barrel a day dakota pipeline  ended the day up   percent in u s  trading   trump owned etp stock through at least mid   according to financial disclosure forms  and etp s chief executive  kelcy warren  donated    to his campaign   the protest against the   mile    km  dakota pipeline was concentrated around blocking a permit to tunnel under lake oahe  a reservoir that forms part of the missouri river  adjacent to the standing rock reservation  the army corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further  tuesday s white house memoranda said the army and the army corps of engineers should review and quickly approve permits for dakota access   in cannon ball  north dakota  protesters  many of whom have stayed at the camp for months  said they would continue fighting to protect the environment  at a protest in front of the white house  a few hundred demonstrators shouted slogans and carried signs  including one that read   now environmental rapist    what happened today is an attack on our homes   said jade begay  a spokeswoman for the indigenous environmental network  which fights against mining and dumping on native lands   we are going to continue to show up at your home  donald trump   in new york city  about  protesters gathered outside the trump international hotel and tower  chanting slogans such as  if all lives matter  then native lives matter  and  you can t drink oil  even in the soil    actress and activist jane fonda  speaking to protesters with a bullhorn  called trump  the predator in chief  and warned of the danger of oil spills  graphic of proposed dakota access pipeline here   tmsnrt rs
