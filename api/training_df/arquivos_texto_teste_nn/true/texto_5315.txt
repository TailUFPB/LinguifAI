washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump has shown little patience for dissent  but that trait is likely to be tested by his new national security adviser  army lieutenant general h r  mcmaster  mcmaster is joining the white house staff with views on russia  counterterrorism  strengthening the military and other major security issues that diverge not only from those of the trump loyalists  but also from those the president himself has expressed      a military intellectual whose ideas have been shaped more by experience than by emotion  more by practice than by politics  and more by intellect than by impulse may also find himself in political terrain that may be as alien  and perhaps as hostile  to him as the sands and cities of afghanistan and iraq were  mcmaster will not be alone  however  his prominent administration allies include defense secretary jim mattis  marine general joseph dunford  the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  and senator john mccain  chairman of the senate armed services committee  as well as many of the soldiers who have served with him  white house press secretary sean spicer said on tuesday that trump told mcmaster  he s got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants   trump  however  already has taken the unusual step of adding steve bannon  his chief strategic adviser known for right wing ideological views  to the white house national security council   the real potential for flashpoints is with some of the people that steve bannon has brought into the administration     people who see things very ideologically   said andrew exum  a former army officer and defense department mideast policy official and mcmaster friend for more than a decade  trump s early missteps on immigration and other issues  have strengthened the leverage available to not only h r  mcmaster  but also defense secretary mattis and secretary  of state rex  tillerson potentially   exum said  one of the first tests of mcmaster s influence will be the administration s review of u s  policy in syria  and more broadly against islamic militancy  the review s results are due early next week  pentagon officials said on tuesday  bannon said last june that the united states and its european allies are fighting a  global existential war  against islam  mcmaster s approach to defeating sunni muslim militants has been more nuanced  resting largely on separating extremists from the vast majority of the local population as commander of the army s  armored cavalry regiment  then colonel mcmaster prepared his troopers for retaking the city of tal afar on the iraqi syrian border in  by having some of them dress in traditional arab dishdashas  recruiting arab americans to play the part of locals  and teaching his troops how to determine if a household was sunni or shiite by looking at the pictures hung on the walls mcmaster ordered his soldiers never to call the iraqis they encountered  hajjis   which many americans used as a derogatory term for the muslim pilgrimage to mecca  writing in the journal military review  he warned that emphasizing force  as trump has done in his vows to bomb islamic state into oblivion  could backfire  in iraq  an inadequate understanding of tribal  ethnic  and religious drivers of conflict     sometimes led to military operations  such as raids against suspected enemy networks  that exacerbated fears or offended the sense of honor of populations in ways that strengthened the insurgency   he wrote  that is not to say mcmaster is a shaved headed intellectual hesitant to use force  twenty one of his troopers were killed in action in tal afar  and one unit suffered  percent casualties  a second early test for mcmaster will be russia policy  unlike his predecessor  michael flynn  and trump himself  mcmaster regards moscow as an adversary rather than a potential partner last may  at the center for strategic and international studies think tank  mcmaster cited russia s annexation of crimea and support for rebels in eastern ukraine as evidence of a broader effort  to collapse the post world war two  certainly the post cold war  security  economic  and political order in europe and replace that order with something that is more sympathetic to russian interests  a third area where mcmaster s thinking differs from the president s rhetoric is the size and shape of the u s  military  trump has promised to add tens of thousands more soldiers  expand the navy to  ships from   and  provide the air force with the   fighter aircraft they need   according to his campaign website in his scholarly  military review article  which has  footnotes  including one citing greek historian thucydides  account of the peloponnesian war  mcmaster argued that  promising victory delivered rapidly from stand off range  based on even better surveillance  intelligence  information  and precision strike capabilities  is a fallacy that  confuses targeting enemy organizations with strategy  the question now is whether mcmaster s views will have sufficient force to alter the course of u s  policy set by the president and his closest aides   the real challenges he s going to confront  i think  are not the challenges of strategy and the global responsibilities of the world s only superpower   said john nagl  a retired army colonel who helped rewrite u s  counterinsurgency doctrine for the iraq and afghanistan wars   he knows how to deal with those things   nagl continued   the challenges he s going to confront are moral  dealing with an administration that has not always been clear in its support for american values          whatever his odds  mcmaster took the job not simply because his commander in chief could order him to do it   those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it   he once said   those who ignore them are doomed to watch
