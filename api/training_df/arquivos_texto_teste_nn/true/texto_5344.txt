washington  reuters    one of rex tillerson s first directives as u s  secretary of state was an order to senior staff that his briefing materials not exceed two pages  it was a reflection of tillerson s management style honed at the helm of exxon mobil  an oil company known for its relentless focus on efficiency  and one reason his closest aides at the state department refer to him as  the ceo  rather than  the secretary    more than a dozen current and former u s  officials familiar with briefing procedures said tillerson s predecessors would typically request far more detailed information  his aide r c  hammond said the directive reflected tillerson s focus on key facts rather than lack of interest in finer points of foreign policy    he is asking people to be efficient with their information   hammond said  adding that if tillerson needed more information he would ask for it   he is a decision maker and he needs the facts in front of him   as a first time government official with no prior diplomatic experience  tillerson faces close scrutiny over how successful he will be in managing both the state department bureaucracy and its relations with donald trump and his administration  senior state department officials who have attended meetings with tillerson say they find him sociable and a man of substance  whose direct manner and probing questions reflect his training as an engineer seeking to solve problems rather than play politics  the veteran oil executive also made a good impression on his first foreign trip to a group of  summit in bonn  germany  last week  four senior diplomats who met him told reuters they were relieved to find that he was pragmatic and open to dialogue   yet a key concern for u s  diplomats is how effective his team can be in shaping foreign policy in the new administration  just two state department positions of  key posts requiring executive branch nomination have been filled  according to the nonpartisan partnership for public service   tillerson s and that of u s  ambassador to the united nations   for example  tillerson still has no deputy after trump rejected his top choice  elliott abrams   people want to back him   one veteran senior official said  about the former exxon mobil boss   but people are feeling that this building is being stripped   said the official  referring to a sense that with so many top positions vacant  the state department is not fully equipped to help make policy in the new administration  there is also unease over possible deep staff cuts and the future of some departments  two people said employees in the bureau of management and resources were told to apply for other positions within the state department  hammond  tillerson s aide said no decision had been taken to close that division        on one recent matter of longstanding u s  foreign policy  tillerson appeared to be sidelined  on feb    while tillerson was at a dinner with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in a state department dining room  news headlines emerged suggesting the united states was backing away from supporting a two state solution for israelis and palestinians  the two state solution is the bedrock of the international community s policy for a settlement between israel and the palestinians  but trump suggested last week he was open to abandoning it if both sides agree   no one had been informed of any changes in policy and the secretary was about to leave on his first major trip   said one senior state department official  referring to tillerson s visit to bonn  tillerson s acting deputy tom shannon also did not take part in trump s meeting with netanyahu at the white house the following day when his boss was on his way to europe  according to one u s  official  it was unclear whether tillerson had been left out of the loop deliberately or by accident  said two officials   a white house official told reuters he did not know whether tillerson was briefed in advance  in response to broader concerns about communication between the state department and the new administration  he said both coordinated  very well    there are open lines of communications in both directions   the official  who declined to be named  said   the white house and the state department coordinate closely across a full range of issues that concern both organizations  to be sure  on another important issue  tillerson had his say in persuading trump to back washington s stance on  one china  policy  which acknowledges beijing s position that taiwan is part of it  trump has in the past appeared to question whether the united states would continue to respect that  hammond said tillerson was on the phone with trump several times a day    this is the general style of the president to have quick check ins with people  get people s advice on things   he said   information for ceos flows up  and as a former ceo  tillerson  understands that   tillerson has said little publicly since he started and his aides are quick to draw a contrast between him and predecessor john kerry  a former senator and presidential candidate who reveled in extensive foreign travel and deal making   tillerson is not john kerry  it is unfair to compare the two   said hammond   he will quietly go about his job as a counselor and advisor to the president   for tillerson s state department the concern is how to maintain a similar degree of communication with an administration grappling with a succession of crises  nine officials involved in foreign policy and security issues  said  over the past month the white house has faced legal setbacks over its immigration orders  the resignation of trump s national security adviser and an investigation into possible links between his campaign and russian intelligence  monday s resignation of michael flynn  who served as trump s national security adviser for just  days  in particular created a vacuum at the national security council  which acts  as a key partner for the state department in formulating washington s foreign policy
