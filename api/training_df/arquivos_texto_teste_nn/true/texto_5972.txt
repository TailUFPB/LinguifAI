 reuters    president donald trump s executive order directing federal agencies to take away funding from self proclaimed sanctuary cities had one big exemption for one of his favorite constituencies  the police  who would be protected from cuts  but trump s opponents say that very exemption makes it much more likely that a judge could strike down that section of the order as unconstitutional  it is just one example of the legal arguments that cities  immigration groups and other opponents are readying as they prepare to fight an executive order signed by trump on wednesday that would cut federal aid to  sanctuary  jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities  lawyers for the potential challengers pointed to court rulings that said the federal government can only withhold funds to local jurisdictions if the money is directly tied to the behavior it objects to  the trump administration cannot cut funds for sanctuary cities  healthcare and education while preserving money for police  since those jobs relate more closely to immigration enforcement  said richard doyle  city attorney in san jose  california  he said it was not clear whether existing federal funding or only future grants would be targeted     supporters of the new republican president s actions say that sanctuary cities ignore federal law and think the white house will be able to answer with a strong case in court  federal law allows trump to restrict public assistance  of any kind where an illegal alien could possibly benefit   said dale wilcox  executive director of the washington based conservative immigration reform law institute   the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment  in new york city  mayor bill de blasio in a news conference said his chief legal officer would be in court the  hour  after any specific action to withhold money came through   there is less here than meets the eye  this executive order is written in a very vague fashion   said de blasio  a democrat  san francisco city attorney dennis herrera  also a democrat  said his office was still examining whether it could sue before trump made any specific move to cut funds   trump s order directed that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities   omar jadwat  director of the american civil liberties union s immigrants  rights project  said the cities can argue  they are fully in compliance with that statute   since they do share information with federal authorities  but offer limited cooperation when it comes to turning over immigrants who are not convicted criminals  there could also be procedural snarls to implementing the cuts  lawyers who specialize in federal grants said  if the u s  government seeks to cut off grants to a certain recipient  it must go through a complicated process known as  suspension and debarment   and cities would have the right to appeal   it s fair to say that they don t understand the scope and reach of federal grants law   said edward waters  who heads the federal grants practice at the law firm feldesman tucker leifer fidell in washington  referring to the trump administration  the white house would also have to negotiate with states that are home to sanctuary cities  nearly  percent of   billion the federal government handed out through more   separate grant programs in the most recent fiscal year went to states  not directly to cities  according to a reuters review of federal spending data  if the trump administration wanted to try to cut off medicaid money to chicago  for example  it would have to work through the state government of illinois  which could pose an additional barrier  waters said  advocacy groups for immigrants  rights said they are also preparing their own legal challenges to other aspects of two executive orders trump signed on wednesday  examining sections that deal with expanding detention of immigrants and changing how asylum requests are processed    all of our legal research is done  most of the complaints are all drafted   said marielena hincapie  executive director of the national immigration law center  based in los angeles  she said litigation could be filed in the next days
