washington  reuters    apple inc and other u s  multinationals will face new curbs on tax loopholes under a rule imposed by washington on thursday  part of a scramble among governments worldwide to bolster their corporate tax bases  acting shortly after a european union grab for billions of dollars in back taxes from apple  the u s  treasury said it was tightening restrictions on companies  use of foreign tax credits to reduce what they owe in u s  taxes   we are closing another tax loophole that contributes to the erosion of our tax base   treasury assistant secretary for tax policy mark mazur said in a statement   the fight for multinational tax revenues escalated on aug   when the eu ruled ireland was giving improper state aid to apple in the form of a deal for low taxes  the eu ordered apple to pay ireland  billion euros     billion  in back taxes  prompting u s  treasury secretary jack lew to express concern the eu ruling could undermine the u s  tax base  analysts have speculated whether apple would be able to cut its u s  tax bill by claiming foreign tax credits for its extra tax bill in ireland   under normal circumstances  u s  companies can reduce the taxes they owe the u s  government by the value of the tax credits they claim for taxes paid abroad on foreign profits  no u s  tax is due on those profits until they are brought into the united states  or repatriated  the new rule will prevent companies faced with back tax bills from  splitting   a strategy that allows companies to bring foreign tax credits into the united states without repatriating the income from which they were derived  apple had no comment on treasury s tax notice  the technology giant is not the only u s  company in the crosshairs of eu state aid investigations  starbucks corp has been ordered to pay up to  million euros    million  to the dutch state  while amazon com inc and mcdonald s corp are under investigation by the eu s executive arm  the new rule was likely to ratchet up transatlantic tensions over corporate taxes while eliminating one more strategy u s  companies can use to cushion the blow from increasingly aggressive eu tax collection efforts  the tax notice specifically cited european union state aid investigations as a risk to u s  revenues  the treasury had no comment on whether its notice would have an impact on apple directly  but a spokesperson said the notice applies to all companies required by a foreign government to pay additional taxes  including those hit by state aid cases
