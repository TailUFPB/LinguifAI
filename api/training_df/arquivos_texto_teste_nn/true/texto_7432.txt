jakarta islamabad cairo  reuters    many muslims around the world expressed dismay on wednesday at donald trump s election as u s  president  saying they feared it might raise tensions between the west and islam and contribute to radicalization  while egypt s president made an early congratulatory call to trump  ordinary muslims were worried that his victory would be a propaganda gift to jihadist groups  others were apprehensive that the president elect will implement campaign pledges to clamp down on muslims entering the united states   trump has espoused highly inflammatory rhetoric against muslims  voters there will expect him to fulfill his promises  that makes me worry about the impact on muslims in the u s  and in the rest of the world   said yenny wahid  a prominent mainstream muslim figure in indonesia       the world s   billion muslims follow a multitude of sects and schools of thought  constitute a majority of the population in countries as varied as indonesia  pakistan  saudi arabia  senegal and albania  and hold a vast array of political views  yet trump s previous comments about muslims  that those from abroad should be barred entry or intensely scrutinized beforehand  and the presence of vocal anti islam activists among his supporters  has alarmed many  during a bitter election campaign  trump also attacked his opponents for what he characterized as their denial about the threat posed by militant islam  which he said was  coming to our shores   adding that he would quickly form a commission on it  egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi was the first world leader to congratulate trump on the phone  sisi s office said  many other egyptians also welcomed his victory  saying his opponent hillary clinton s record in office had won her few friends in the most populous arab country  clinton  secretary of state during the  arab spring uprisings  is unpopular with many egyptians  many of those who backed the revolt saw her as a long standing supporter of hosni mubarak  the autocrat they toppled from power  but elsewhere  other muslims saw trump as a hostile figure   whatever happens to america affects everybody and with all these promises of doom by trump to the blacks  to the muslims  the minority  so it s not something we re happy about   said ganiu olukanga  a muslim resident of the nigerian capital lagos               some muslims  including wahid  said they feared his election as president might encourage a view that the united states held enmity for muslims and that this would hinder efforts in islam to counter radicalization    trump s victory will be an enormous gift to a failing jihadist movement  that will have now have a renewed rallying cry   said ammar rashid  an academic and member of pakistan s awami workers party on twitter    if jihadi ideology has a source of sustenance  it is the image of the us as the evil anti muslim crusader  they will milk trump s win dry   he added   in jihadist social media forums  militants said trump s election had merely revealed the true position of the united states toward muslims   the masks have slipped   one wrote   but some other muslims were more hopeful  including umer daudzai  former afghan minister of interior  citing the record of ronald reagan who was u s  president from     ronald reagan ended the cold war  i hope donald trump will end all wars and become hero of peace in the world   he told reuters   among some officials  there were also expressions of concern but the organisation of islamic cooperation  oic   the body that represents muslim states  issued no statement early on wednesday   in indonesia  the most populous muslim nation  an official from the faith s top clerical body there said trump s election could create new tension between the united states and the islamic world       trump had made  negative  cynical  comments about muslims in the past  din syamsuddin  a senior official at the indonesian ulema council  mui   told reporters in jakarta   he had forgotten that many americans are immigrants       saudi arabia  a u s  ally that is both birthplace of islam and home to its holiest places  issued a statement that it had congratulated trump on his election win without making further comment   however  awad al qirni  one of its most popular clerics with a twitter following of two million  said in a social media post after the election   but without referring to trump directly   that  america declines into collapse  and that  its internal crisis will grow severely    in pakistan  sherry rehman  a senator and former ambassador to washington  said trump s proposal last year to bar muslims from entering the u s  had disturbed many    pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever america elects but his anti muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty   he told reuters on wednesday   and in bangladesh  a government official who asked not to be named said   i can t think what awaits us  donald trump was talking about fighting against muslims  are we going to see more wars   among private citizens in dhaka  some said they hoped the pressure of office would temper trump s views    it is just unbelievable and i am a bit tense  i hope there will be a difference between donald trump and president donald trump  president trump will be more mature than individual trump   asif iqbal  a private sector employee  said
