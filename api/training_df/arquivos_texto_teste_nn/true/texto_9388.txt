new york  reuters    hillary clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as u s  secretary of state  an internal government watchdog said on wednesday  the long awaited report by the state department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public  it was highly critical of clinton s use of a server in her home  and immediately fueled republican attacks on clinton  the democratic front runner in an already acrimonious presidential race   the report  which also found problems in department record keeping practices before clinton s tenure  undermined clinton s earlier defenses of her emails  likely adding to democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate  a majority of voters say clinton is dishonest  according to multiple polls   the report concluded that clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security  the report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet  several suspected hacking attempts in  were never reported to department information security officials  in breach of department rules  it said   she s as crooked as they come   donald trump  the presumptive republican presidential candidate  said of clinton at a campaign rally in anaheim  california  adding that the report s findings were  not good  for her  clinton s campaign disagreed  saying the report rebutted republican s criticism  the inspector general s office examined email record keeping under five secretaries state  both democratic and republican  john kerry  the current officeholder  and predecessors madeline albright  colin powell and condoleezza rice all agreed to speak to the inspector general s investigators  clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed  as did her aides  the report contradicted clinton s repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed   several other inquiries continue  including a u s  justice department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws  the inspector general s report cited  longstanding  systemic weaknesses  with state department records that predated clinton s tenure  and found problems with the email record keeping of some of her predecessors  particularly powell  that failed to comply with the federal records act   but it singled out clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in chappaqua  new york  for government business   oig found no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server   the report said  using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general  the report said clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the department s security and technology officials  officials told investigators that they  did not   and would not   approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct department business   the reason  those officials said  is because it breached department rules and presented  security risks   state department spokesman mark toner said he would not  challenge  those findings  he told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on clinton s server  but had no evidence that any were successful   when two lower level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about clinton s email arrangement in late   their supervisor in clinton s office instructed them  never to speak of the secretary s personal email system again   the report said  their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system  but the inspector general s office said it found no evidence this was true  brian fallon  a clinton spokesman  said the report rebutted criticisms of clinton made by her political opponents   the report shows that problems with the state department s electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a state department email account until after the arrival of her successor   he said in a statement  he did not address the report s criticism of clinton s use of a private server  something no other secretary of state has done  democrats  including fundraisers for clinton s campaign  said the report revealed nothing new   it s digging and digging and digging   amy rao  the chief executive of data company integrated archive systems and a clinton fundraiser  said in an interview  comparing the investigation to probes the clintons faced in the    trust me  there s no there there  it s whitewater   current secretary of state kerry asked steve linick  the state department inspector general  to investigate after clinton s email arrangement came to light last year  president barack obama appointed linick to the role in    republicans have used clinton s email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public access laws  republican national committee chairman reince priebus said in a statement that the findings  are just the latest chapter in the long saga of hillary clinton s bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security
