pittsburgh  reuters    donald trump on thursday praised aggressive police tactics and condemned attacks on officers amid criticism of his plan to use  stop and frisk  tactics to reduce crime  in a speech following a second night of unrest that shook charlotte  north carolina  the republican presidential nominee said drugs were  a very  very big factor  in urban unrest and that those suffering the most from the violence were  law abiding african american residents who live in these communities    crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a trump administration   trump told an energy conference in pittsburgh  as a room full of natural gas and coal industry executives listened in silence   the violence against our citizens  and our law enforcement  must be brought to an end   he added  trump has portrayed himself as the  law and order  candidate  stop and frisk  in which police stop  question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband  has drawn protests and successful legal challenges because it is seen as unfairly targeting minorities  at the same time  trump has recently reached out to african american voters as the gap in many opinion polls has narrowed between him and his democratic rival  hillary clinton  ahead of the nov   presidential election  clinton  who did not immediately respond to trump s remarks on thursday  has pushed for stricter gun controls to help rein in gun violence and called for the development of national guidelines on the use of force by police officers  in pittsburgh  trump  a new york businessman  called for better training of police and more community engagement   if you re not aware  drugs are a very  very big factor in what you re watching on television at night   trump said   my administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority   trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said later in a statement that trump s comments were not referring  specifically  to the violence in charlotte  but  addressing a major concern that authorities and moms across the country are raising with him  which is indiscriminate drug use and opiate addiction   the fatal police shooting of a black man sparked the protests in charlotte  and a state of emergency was declared on wednesday   there have also been protests in tulsa  oklahoma  in recent days after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man who a video showed had his hands in clear view at the time  a white tulsa officer was charged with first degree manslaughter on thursday in the shooting  police tactics and deadly encounters with african americans  many of them unarmed  have sparked protests and unrest across the country in recent years   clinton said on wednesday that the deaths in charlotte and tulsa added two more names to the list of african american victims of police killings   it s unbearable  and it needs to become intolerable   she said  trump was at an african american church in cleveland on wednesday when he praised stop and frisk  which had triggered protests and court rulings that it was unconstitutional or required outside monitoring in cities like new york  chicago and newark  new jersey  before going to pittsburgh  trump was asked on fox news   fox and friends  program to define the tactic  he said   if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun  they will see the person and they ll look and they ll take the gun away    they ll stop  they ll frisk  and they ll take the gun away  and they won t have anything to shoot with   he said  in washington  white house spokesman john earnest pointed to what he said was a contradiction in trump s remarks   it does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting second amendment rights  to bear arms  yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against illegal search and seizure   he told a news briefing  while trump did not mention stop and frisk by name in pittsburgh  he used the speech to repeat his praise for the policing tactics fostered by former new york mayor rudolph giuliani  now a major trump supporter  who promoted the practice  trump again credited policing under the republican mayor with reducing crime in the candidate s hometown  new york city mayor bill de blasio rejected that argument on thursday  warning trump against embracing a tactic that would  worsen relations between police and the minority community  de blasio attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by bill bratton  the city s longtime police commissioner  who retired less than a week ago  bratton championed the  broken windows  policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor  in his resignation letter  he attributed the decline in crime in new york  the nation s most populous city with   million people  to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods   de blasio  who supports clinton  said in an interview with cnn that trump  should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop and frisk all over this country  you would see a lot more tension between police and community
