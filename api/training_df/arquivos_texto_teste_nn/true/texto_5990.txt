beirut  reuters    syrian rebels urged president donald trump to fulfill a pledge to create safe zones in their country  but analysts doubted he would proceed with a step that could drag washington deeper into war  hasten syria s fragmentation and risk conflict with russia   trump told abc news on wednesday he  will absolutely do safe zones in syria  for refugees fleeing violence and that europe had made a mistake by admitting millions of refugees from syria  president bashar al assad s opponents have long demanded safe zones to protect civilians who have fled government air strikes and bombardment of rebel held areas  but reflecting uncertainties about the announcement  representatives of the insurgents voiced only cautious optimism   we ve seen no result on the ground from  u s   statements that were made six years ago  so therefore we await action before anything else   said fares al bayoush  a rebel commander in northwestern syria  qatar  which backs the rebels  welcomed trump s comments and  emphasized the need to provide safe havens in syria and to impose no fly zones to ensure the safety of civilians   there was no immediate word from damascus  but it is sure to oppose such a move as assad has vowed to regain control of all syria  iran  which backs militias in syria including lebanon s hezbollah  would also oppose any u s  intervention  russia said it had not been consulted on trump s plan  warning that it should not  exacerbate the situation with refugees  and washington should weigh up  all the consequences    the creation of safe zones would mark a major shift in u s  policy  former u s  president barack obama resisted an idea that would require a commitment to defend such areas from the syrian government or its foreign allies  including russia  trump appears to see safe zones as a way to stem the tide of refugees which he sees as a possible threat to u s  security  but there are no obvious answers as to how the united states would avoid the problems that have prevented it establishing safe zones in syria before  including the complication of policing such an area in a war zone dotted with armed groups   at this stage this is very much in the realm of political maneuvering   said yezid sayigh  a senior fellow and syria expert at the carnegie middle east center in beirut   i don t think it is signaling imminent u s  action   trump could order the state department and pentagon to produce a plan that would also create  safe areas  in countries surrounding syria where millions of refugees already live  the syrian government hopes trump will end u s  support for the rebels fighting assad and refocus u s  policy solely on fighting islamic state  perhaps in cooperation with russia  trump has indicated he will do both    almost six years of war has turned syria into a patchwork of areas  some controlled by assad  some by rebel groups and others by kurdish militia or islamic state militants  previous discussion of safe zones in syria has focused on rebel held areas in the northwest stretching from idlib province to the euphrates river  areas in the southwest at the border with jordan have also been seen as a possibility  but the complications have grown since the syrian opposition first called for safe zones  including the deployment of russia s air force to syria   defending a safe zone from attack by the syrian government or its russian and iranian backed militia allies would inevitably lead to an escalation  which is one of the reasons obama had avoided this path in the first place  sayigh said   another big challenge would be how to police the area to maintain its neutral status as a safe zone  he added  while much of trump s syria policy remains unclear  syrian kurds  who have generally avoided conflict with assad  look set to remain central to u s  strategy  the syrian kurdish ypg militia controls swathes of northeast syria  where conflict with the government is rare and the u s  air force mounts regular air strikes against is targets  syrian kurdish autonomy in northern syria alarms turkey  which fears it could increase separatist sentiment among its kurdish minority  kurdish groups already govern northern iraq  where the establishment of a no fly zone in  helped them on their way to autonomy from baghdad  the ypg has links to the kurdistan workers party  pkk   a designated terrorist groups in turkey      growing kurdish influence in northern syria largely explains why turkey launched a major incursion into syria last year  helping insurgents from the free syrian army drive both islamic state and kurdish militia away from the border  the operation dubbed  euphrates shield  has created what turkish officials call a safe zone that is  km   miles  long  this week  a new turkish trained syrian police force deployed in the town of jarablus in that strip of territory  turkey  which hosts   million syrian refugees  has long advocated safe zones in syria   but underlining the caution with which foreign governments are viewing trump s comments  turkey said it was waiting to see the outcome of a  study  requested by trump  aid agencies in the region are concerned  karl schembri  regional media adviser in the middle east for the norwegian refugee council  said that from the group s  experience   we know that militarily enforced  safe zones  rarely work and can actually put civilians at more risk
