washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump backtracked on monday on his remarks about raising taxes on wealthy americans  saying the rich might simply get a smaller tax cut than he originally proposed  trump walked away from his sunday comment that taxes on the wealthy would  go up  once his broad tax policy proposals  which include tax cuts for rich americans  were negotiated with congress  that appeared to be a break with traditional republican support for lower taxes in all income brackets  on monday  trump said he did not mean to imply he was willing to raise taxes for people in higher income brackets from their current level  but was referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal   i may have to increase it on the wealthy   i m not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class   trump said on cnn   now  if i increase it on the wealthy  that means they re still going to be paying less than they are paying now  i m talking about increasing it from my  original  tax proposal   the proposal  released in september  included broad tax breaks for businesses and households  with the highest income tax rate cut to  percent from the current   percent  trump  a billionaire real estate developer  said on monday that lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses was his priority   i m not talking about a tax increase  i m talking about a tremendous tax decrease  ok   trump said on the fox business network  he said proposals always changed in negotiations with congress but that he was committed to cutting taxes  the contradictory statements came as trump began pivoting to a general election race against likely democratic nominee hillary clinton  trump effectively clinched the republican nomination for the nov   presidential election last week after his last two rivals dropped out of the race  douglas holtz eakin  a former bush administration official who also advised republican john mccain during his failed  presidential run  said trump was trying to make his economic plans add up   he s gone from wildly unrealistic to impenetrable  on the subject of taxes  holtz eakin said  adding that trump s comments about the outcome of possible negotiations with congress  makes me confused as to what he really wants   trump did win support from influential anti tax crusader grover norquist  who said on cnbc on monday that some people with a lot of tax credits might see some increase  but that rates would drop overall under trump s plan   he s made it very clear he wants lower taxes   norquist said   trump s tax cut would be a tax cut for every american   norquist s group  americans for tax reform  asks all republican candidates to sign a no new taxes pledge  but trump has not signed one yet  norquist said he was confident the candidate would sign  given his public comments  the clinton campaign was happy to take trump at his word that he planned to cut wealthy americans  taxes  it cited an analysis of trump s proposal by the nonpartisan tax policy center estimating it would give the wealthiest americans an average annual boost of more than    million a year   this is a tax plan by the billionaire for the billionaires   clinton adviser jake sullivan said   and after some confusing comments over the weekend  he actually doubled down today on the fact that his tax plan would have massive cuts for the wealthy  who knows what he ll say tomorrow   trump also sought on monday to clarify comments he made last week about the u s  debt  he said he never espoused restructuring or defaulting on government debt but would buy it back at a discount if interest rates go up   he should stop talking about the debt because he hasn t said anything that makes any sense yet   holtz eakin said  trump s candidacy has opened a rift in the republican party  with many leaders appalled by his rhetoric on immigrants  muslims and women and concerned that some policy positions such as his opposition to free trade run counter to republican orthodoxy  u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  who said last week he was not yet ready to endorse trump  said on monday he would step down as co chairman of the july   republican national convention if trump wants him to  trump on sunday did not rule out pushing ryan out from the speaker s traditional role as convention chairman  ryan and trump will meet on thursday to try to iron out their differences  later on thursday  the candidate will meet with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and other members of the senate republican leadership  a senate republican aide said on monday  trump said on monday that new jersey governor chris christie  a former presidential rival who endorsed his candidacy shortly after dropping out of the race  would lead his white house transition team  republican u s  senator marco rubio of florida  another vanquished presidential rival  sought on monday to quash speculation he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for trump  saying he still had deep reservations about the former reality television star
