minot air force base  n d   reuters    in this flat  windy expanse just south of the canadian border  u s  air force pilots fly the same bombers their grandfathers flew  using mid  century cables and pulleys  each spring  the airmen and airwomen must clear melting snow from the steel and concrete doors of the silos that house  nuclear tipped ballistic missiles scattered across thousands of square miles of the upper great plains  the u s  nuclear arsenal  patched  welded  and re skinned countless times  was built between  and  years ago when the united states found itself locked in an arms race with a rival superpower  the soviet union  now  its future is an issue in the campaign for the nov   presidential election  democratic candidate hillary clinton has said she would call for a nuclear posture review  last completed in   as one of her first acts upon taking office  republican candidate donald trump has said he would be open to reversing decades of u s  policy and allowing allies such as japan and south korea to acquire their own nuclear weapons to deter a strike from north korea  which carried out its fifth and largest nuclear test this month  on monday  in his first visit to minot air force base in north dakota as u s  secretary of defense  ash carter said america s nuclear deterrence was the  bedrock  of its security  and the pentagon s no   priority   if we don t replace these systems  quite simply they will age even more  and become unsafe  unreliable  and ineffective    carter said  speaking at a lectern in front of a b  bomber loaded with cruise missiles   the fact is  most of our nuclear weapon delivery systems have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives  so it s not a choice between replacing these platforms or keeping them   it s really a choice between replacing them or losing them   carter said  russia  he said  had built new nuclear weapons systems  raising questions as to whether its leaders were cautious enough when it came to atomic weapons  and north korea presents a sustained threat  carter said  carter s speech coincides with a growing realization among defense officials and experts that budget constraints almost certainly will force the next president to decide whether and how quickly to proceed with the obama administration s plans to maintain and modernize the u s  nuclear arsenal  the crunch comes in the next decade as american ballistic missile submarines  bombers  and land based missiles   the three legs of the nuclear triad   reach the end of their useful lives  the congressional budget office estimates the total cost of nuclear forces through  at   billion  but that does not include some of the costliest upgrades  scheduled for the latter half of the next decade  independent estimates have put the cost of maintaining and modernizing the arsenal at about   trillion dollars over  years   there s a bipartisan commitment to doing that upgrade  so we have to assume those funds will come through   energy secretary ernest moniz told reuters on sept     but it will be a significant budget increase  especially in the next decade   the energy department shares responsibility with the pentagon for the nuclear arsenal  and some of its research and production facilities are  years old  the next administration could abandon or delay some aspects of modernization to cut costs  or it could raise taxes  increase the budget deficit  or cut domestic programs  all unpopular steps with american voters  the most vulnerable elements of the modernization plans are a long range standoff weapon  or lrso   a nuclear capable cruise missile launched from an aircraft   and new land based intercontinental ballistic missiles  icbms   ten u s  senators  including elizabeth warren of massachusetts and bernie sanders of vermont  called on president barack obama in july to cancel the lrso  saying it  would provide an unnecessary capability that could increase the risk of nuclear war   some pentagon officials and defense experts have said the cruise missile would be a hedge against improved air defenses that are difficult for even a stealthy bomber to penetrate  a clinton or trump administration also could cut the number of land based ballistic missiles below the  currently planned or delay a new missile by extending the life of the current minuteman iiis  which each carry a warhead with an explosive yield of at least  kilotons   times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima  which killed an estimated   people   the united states is one of five nuclear weapons states allowed to keep a nuclear arsenal under the nuclear non proliferation treaty  the others are russia  britain  france and china  the u s  air force has estimated the cost of a new ground based system   including missiles  command and control systems and launch control centers   to be more than   billion      some former u s  officials  including former defense secretary william perry  have argued that land based missiles are not essential and should be phased out  proponents say they are more important in the face of potential nuclear threats by russia and north korea  much of the planned modernization is nearly locked in  because of the need for new weapons and because some of it is so far along  said evan montgomery  a senior fellow at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments  a washington based research group  the b  long range strike bomber and the replacement for the navy s  ohio class ballistic missile submarines are  the two most expensive items  and they re arguably the two safest in a lot of ways   montgomery said  the bomber can deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons  and the submarine is considered a priority because it would survive any first strike by an adversary  the navy plans to replace its ohio class submarines  first commissioned in  and armed with up to  trident missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads  with  boats costing about   billion  in his speech on monday  carter said that most people do not realize that spending on the nuclear program is a small percentage of total defense spending  at its peak  nuclear spending would make up about five percent of the pentagon s budget  which is now around   billion annually  defense experts said  still  the funding gap means that despite the pentagon s massive budget  the next president will face an unavoidable dilemma   there s no doubt in my mind that we re tens of billions of dollars short in that time frame from what it takes to execute a global strategy   said james miller  a former undersecretary of defense for policy in the obama administration   it s not a rounding error anymore
