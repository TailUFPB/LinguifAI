 reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration will begin rolling back obama era environmental regulations in an  aggressive way  as soon as next week  the head of the environmental protection agency said on saturday   adding he understood why some americans want to see his agency eliminated completely   i think there are some regulations that in the near term need to be rolled back in a very aggressive way  and i think maybe next week you may be hearing about some of those   epa administrator scott pruitt told the conservative political action summit in washington dc  pruitt added the epa s focus on combating climate change under former president barack obama had cost jobs and prevented economic growth  leading many americans to want to see the epa eliminated completely   i think its justified   he said   i think people across this country look at the epa much like they look at the irs  i hope to be able to change that       pruitt was confirmed as epa head last week  his appointment triggered an uproar among democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates worried that he will gut the agency and re open the doors to heavy industrial pollution  he sued the epa more than a dozen times as his states  top attorney and has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change   but his rise to the head of the epa has also cheered many republicans and business interests that expect him to cut back red tape they believe has hampered the economy  trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries  pruitt mentioned three rules ushered in by obama that could meet the chopping block early on  the waters of the u s  rule outlining waterways that have federal protections  the clean power plan requiring states to cut carbon emissions  and the u s  methane rule limiting emissions from oil and gas installations on federal land  a trump official told reuters late friday that the president was expected to sign a measure as early as tuesday aimed at rescinding the waters of the u s  rule  pruitt said in his comments to the cpac summit that rule had  made puddles and dry creek beds across this country subject to the jurisdiction of washington dc  that s going to change   he also suggested longer term structural changes were in store at the epa    long term  asking the question on how that agency partners with the states and how that affects the budget and how it effects the structure is something to work on very diligently   pruitt said  like trump  he said cutting regulation could be done in a way that does not harm water or air quality
