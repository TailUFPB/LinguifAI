washington  reuters    when president barack obama sets out this week to meet world leaders in china and laos during his final presidential trip to asia  he will make an unusual stop along the way  with time running out for more action on climate change during his time in office  obama will drop in to midway atoll  a far flung and largely uninhabited coral reef that is a refuge for sharks  albatrosses and endangered turtles and seals  the photo rich stop is aimed at both raising awareness about the threat posed by climate change  and showcasing obama s decision to protect a larger part of the ocean around hawaii  but the trip to the middle of the pacific ocean will also highlight the high stakes of climate change just before obama meets world leaders in china   i think it s going to be an amazing sequence  and one that really matters   said doug mccauley  a conservation biologist from university of california  santa barbara   suddenly  you re sitting in a room with the leaders who will decide what the fate of that place is going to be   mccauley said  the rare trip is both a signal of the importance obama gives to climate change   and a sign of his focus in bliateral meetings with chinese president xi jinping  the two leaders have clashed on economic and security issues  but forged common ground on climate  which helped secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions at a paris conference last year   we have to recognize that climate change and clean energy cooperation has really helped to create better overall stability in the u s  china relationship  writ large   said andrew light  a former senior climate official in obama s state department  light  now with the world resources institute think tank  said he expects xi and obama will try to push other  leaders to agree to timelines for implementing the paris agreement and work on cutting other greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons  any progress on climate issues could be a rare bright spot in a trip otherwise dominated by concerns about the international economy  anti globalization sentiments and global security problems  with less than five months left in the white house  obama is racing to cement his record through actions he can take without help from the gridlocked u s  congress  for example  at obama s final meeting with his canadian and mexican counterparts  the leaders set new goals for clean energy production  republicans in congress have thwarted obama s legislative efforts on climate  and mocked him for his focus on an issue they see as less pressing than the economy and defense  obama also has faced criticism from environmental groups for not doing more to limit u s  oil and gas production   if we re going address the climate crisis or meet our climate commitments  the vast  vast majority of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground   said brendan cummings  conservation director with the center for biological diversity  but former environmental protection agency director carol browner said obama has done what he could on climate both through leadership on the international stage  and by using existing laws to kick start the clean energy sector and cut emissions from vehicles and power plants   nobody should ever be disappointed with this president on climate change   said browner  who led the white house climate push in obama s first term
