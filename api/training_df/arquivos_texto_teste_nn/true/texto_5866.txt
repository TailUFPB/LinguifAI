  this version of the jan  story has been corrected to show former senate republican leader trent lott is from mississippi not missouri  by laila kearney  reuters    many of president donald trump s core political supporters had a simple message on sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban  calm down   the relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove trump s historic upset victory   working  and middle class residents of midwest and the south   provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities  where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained  in the st  louis suburb of manchester  missouri   year old jo ann tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate    somebody has to stand up  be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in   she said   i m all for everybody to stop and take a breath   just give it a chance    by executive order on friday  trump banned immigration from seven muslim majority countries   iran  iraq  syria  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen   and temporarily halted the entry of refugees  in the electoral strongholds for trump  residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens  they shrugged off concerns about botched execution  damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country   in new york  los angeles  san francisco and other cities  trump s action set off an outpouring of anger   house minority leader nancy pelosi  a democrat from california  evoked an image of the statue of liberty weeping  senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the  mean spirited and un american  immigration ban  veterans in government agencies  including the homeland security and state departments  blasted trump s team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication  criticism the white house rejected   at airports  security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules   but allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform  political analysts said   louise ingram  a  year old retiree from troy  alabama  said she forgave the new administration a few  glitches   such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders  as it moved to protect u s  citizens from attacks   i m not opposed to immigrants   she said   i just want to make sure they are safe to come in    a senior trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders  they rather represent a reaction to the  mass shooting in san bernardino  california  the boston marathon bombing  and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in europe    the reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of france  germany and parts of belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the united states   one official told reuters  candace wheater  a  year old retired school cafeteria worker from spring lake  michigan  also referenced the attacks in brussels and paris    look at what s happening in europe   she said   i don t dare travel there  out of fear   steve hirsch    from manassas  virginia  drove to washington s dulles airport on sunday to pick somebody up  rather than to protest as hundreds of others did  he said he supported trump s order   a country is not a country if it doesn t have borders   he added  he lauded trump s actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security   he probably went as far as he thought he could   hirsch said   you can t ban everybody in the world  but i think it s prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world   trent lott  a former senate republican leader from mississippi who is now a lawyer in washington  d c   said the orders made sense to  working class americans in the real world     out in the rest of the country  people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border   he said  university of virginia political science professor larry sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt trump politically   his base is as firm as ever   he said   what he s lost in the very early polls is the republicans who were never trumpers and ended up voting for trump   trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders  but sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites   trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him  such as delivering jobs to the so called rust belt  the midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns   whatever trump ultimately accomplishes  his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country    i just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about donald trump   sabato said  in baton rouge  louisiana   year old teacher trista carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about trump out of the classroom    we were told to be switzerland   she said   we re not allowed to take any sides or views    she has her own opinions  of course  and said she appreciated that trump  in his blunt way  gave voice to them  with no sugar coating     i think it s just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally   she said   i feel like he is going to   to the best of his abilities   make a lot of things he said happen
