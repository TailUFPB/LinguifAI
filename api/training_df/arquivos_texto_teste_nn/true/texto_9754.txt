indianapolis  reuters    u s  republican presidential candidate ted cruz  in a last ditch bid to slow front runner donald trump s momentum  named former business executive carly fiorina on wednesday as his vice presidential running mate should he win the nomination  after crushing losses to trump in five nominating contests in the northeast on tuesday  cruz praised fiorina  a former presidential rival  as a principled fighter for conservative values who would be a valuable ally on the campaign trail   carly is a vice presidential nominee who i think is superbly skilled  superbly gifted at helping unite this party   the u s  senator from texas told a rally in indianapolis  the capital of indiana  the midwestern state is the next battleground for selecting the republican and democratic presidential candidates for the nov   presidential election and is shaping up to be cruz s best   and perhaps last   chance to block trump s march to the nomination  cruz acknowledged it was unusual to choose a running mate so early in the race  traditionally  the winners of the republican and democratic nominating races announce their running mates in the period between clinching the nomination and summer s national conventions   i think all would acknowledge this race  if anything  it is unusual   said cruz    adding he wanted to give voters a clear choice and offer a rebuttal to media suggestions the republican race was over  at a nearby rally in indianapolis afterward  trump was scornful of cruz s move  calling his rival  desperate    in the democratic race  hillary clinton    won four of tuesday s five contests  building a virtually insurmountable lead over rival bernie sanders  a  year old u s  senator from vermont  who vowed to keep fighting until the july convention  in tapping fiorina as his no    cruz was apparently trying to recover from trump s landslide primary wins on tuesday in pennsylvania  maryland  delaware  connecticut and rhode island  the victories made the uphill climb toward the nomination even steeper for cruz   i ve had tough fights all my life   fiorina said after cruz introduced her   tough fights don t worry me a bit   fiorina    dropped her own white house bid in february after a seventh place finish in new hampshire  she endorsed cruz a month later and has been a sharp critic of clinton  fiorina and cruz both said they had grown close since her endorsement  and she sang a few verses of a song she said she sings to cruz s two daughters on their campaign bus   the choice of fiorina  a former hewlett packard co chief executive who  like trump  has never held elective office  could help cruz with women voters  a group that trump has had difficulty winning over to his outsider campaign  it also could offer cruz a boost in the june  primary in california  where fiorina won the republican primary in  for the u s  senate  she was defeated in the general election by incumbent democrat barbara boxer  fiorina now lives in virginia  trump has amassed  of the   republican national convention delegates he needs to secure the nomination  to  for cruz and  for ohio governor john kasich    the third remaining candidate  according to the associated press  if cruz can win a large share of indiana s  delegates  it will increase the chances that trump will not be able to win the nomination on the convention s first ballot  after that  many delegates will be free to turn to cruz  kasich or a dark horse establishment candidate on a second or subsequent ballot  a loss to trump in indiana would effectively cripple cruz s bid  and increase pressure on the party to rally around trump as the prospective nominee   trump called cruz s decision to pick a running mate  a pure waste of time  and  a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all talk  no action politician    he is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country who s mathematically eliminated from becoming president who chose a vice presidential candidate      it s a record   the new york billionaire and former reality tv star told supporters in indianapolis on wednesday  trump vowed to campaign extensively in the state between now and tuesday s nominating contest    i m not playing games with indiana   he said   you are going to get so tired of me    we re going to win it   he said  trump was introduced at the rally by famed college basketball coach bob knight  who led indiana university to three national championships   cruz said fiorina had already proven her mettle in standing up to trump last year after he insulted her looks in an interview   look at that face  would anyone vote for that   trump had asked  only to be sternly rebuked by fiorina in their next presidential debate   she s faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and yelling and insulting her face   cruz told the indianapolis crowd  a breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction  fiorina served as hewlett packard chief executive from  to   she was forced to resign amid weak earnings as the company struggled to digest a   billion merger with compaq computer corp  about   layoffs took place during her tenure  fiorina s campaign never took off in the original  member republican presidential field  and she was mostly relegated to the early second tier debates for low polling candidates  craig robinson  a former political director of the iowa republican party  said cruz would have been better off picking an experienced politician who could help him secure delegates in a fight at the convention    it s a real head scratcher   he said  but some conservatives applauded cruz s choice  marjorie dannenfelser  president of the susan b  anthony list  which works to elect political candidates who oppose abortion rights  said fiorina was the  ideal  choice   she will take hillary clinton head on   dannenfelser said in a statement
