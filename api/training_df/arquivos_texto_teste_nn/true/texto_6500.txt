washington  reuters    senate democrats on thursday demanded an ethics probe into tom price  president elect donald trump s pick for u s  health secretary  following a report that the fierce obamacare critic traded in healthcare company stocks while pushing legislation in congress that could affect those shares  senate democratic leader chuck schumer and others made their comments as congressional republicans moved ahead with their long desired effort to dismantle president barack obama s affordable care act  and signaled the vehemence with which democrats will fight to protect the  law  price is an orthopedic surgeon and a republican congressman from georgia who  if confirmed by the senate as department of health and human services  hhs  secretary  would be given the task of carrying out trump s promise to gut the law that has enabled up to  million previously uninsured americans to obtain medical coverage  the democrats called on the independent office of congressional ethics  oce   which examines misconduct allegations involving house of representatives members  to investigate price s stock trades  the wall street journal last month reported that price bought and sold more than    in stock in about  healthcare  pharmaceutical and biomedical companies over the past four years while sponsoring and advocating legislation that could influence those companies  shares   every american should be shocked by this   schumer told a news conference   we don t know if he broke the law   schumer said of price   but there are certainly enough serious questions to warrant a serious investigation before any hearing is held on congressman price to become secretary of hhs   democratic senator patty murray said lawmakers want to know what nonpublic information price may have had when the transactions at issue were made  phil blando  a trump transition spokesman  called schumer s demands a  stunt  to deflect attention from obamacare s  dismal record   price  asked by reuters in a capitol hallway for a reaction to schumer s comments  replied   we re looking forward to a positive and productive confirmation hearing   a  law prohibits members and employees of congress from using  any nonpublic information  stemming from the person s position or gained while performing their job for personal benefit  the nonpartisan watchdog group public citizen also asked the ethics office  as well as the u s  securities and exchange commission  to investigate price and another republican congressman  chris collins of new york  for possible violations of insider trading and conflict of interest laws and rules  public citizen said that  while serving in the house  collins also sat on the board of directors of australian biotech company innate immunotherapeutics ltd  iil ax  and was its largest shareholder  with a  percent stake  it said price also bought shares in the company  collins serves as the trump transition team s congressional liaison  collins spokesman michael mcadams said in a statement the congressman  has followed all ethical guidelines related to his personal finances during his time in the house and will continue to do so   house republicans had moved on monday to weaken the ethics office but backtracked a day later after criticism from democrats and trump  trump transition spokesman blando said the ethics questions schumer raised about price should be directed to three sitting democratic senators  delaware s tom carper  virginia s mark warner and rhode island s sheldon whitehouse   who own and have traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in pharmaceutical and health insurance company stocks    hypocrisy is apparently alive and well this morning in washington   blando said  a warner spokeswoman said his investments were managed by an independent trustee  a whitehouse spokesman said the senator does not direct his trading  a carper spokeswoman said he has submitted thorough financial disclosures and  always complied with every requirement and regulation   republicans will control the white house and congress once trump takes office on jan    in a series of twitter posts on thursday  trump blasted the democrats over obamacare  taunting schumer as  head clown    it is time for republicans   democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works   much less expensive   far better   trump wrote  republican house speaker paul ryan said he expects the legislative work on repealing and replacing obamacare to be completed this year   what date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know   ryan added  ryan indicated that a republican proposal to strip women s healthcare organization planned parenthood of federal funding will be included in the obamacare repeal legislation  planned parenthood draws the ire of many republicans because it provides abortions  as well as cancer screenings and other services  republicans criticize obamacare  one of obama s signature accomplishments in his eight years in office  as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by burdening businesses  democrats said obamacare has extended insurance to millions of americans and curbed abuses by private insurers such as refusing to provide policies to people with pre existing medical conditions
