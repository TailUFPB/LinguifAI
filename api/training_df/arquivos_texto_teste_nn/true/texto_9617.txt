new york  reuters    u s  democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders  tax and benefit plans would raise income for most americans but his proposal for single payer healthcare would help generate record federal deficits  two washington think tanks said on monday   an analysis by the tax policy center said that although most people would pay higher taxes under sanders  plan  the average household income would increase by nearly    in  after his proposed benefits were factored in   those benefits include an expansion of the social security government pension plan  paid family leave and free tuition at public colleges  ideas that have generated support for sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  as he seeks to become the democratic nominee for the nov   presidential election   only the wealthiest  percent of households would end up paying more in new taxes than they got back in benefits  according to the center  a joint effort run by two washington based think tanks  the urban institute and the brookings institution  but sanders  plans would also increase federal deficits to  unprecedented levels   the center said  relying largely on a new estimate of the cost of his healthcare proposals published on monday in a separate analysis by the urban institute   sanders has proposed a single payer healthcare system  a more significant overhaul than the tweaks that democratic front runner hillary clinton wants to make to the affordable care act  a signature policy achievement of democratic president barack obama  the urban institute estimated sanders  healthcare plan would require an increase in federal spending of   trillion over the next decade but that new revenue sources proposed by sanders only covered just under half of that amount   the overall result would be an increase in annual federal budget deficits by   trillion over the next decade  the tax policy center said   warren gunnels  sanders  policy director  called the new cost estimate  wildly  overestimated in a statement on monday  he said the analyses were wrong to assume that state and local governments would stop their own spending on healthcare  thereby shifting    trillion in costs to the federal government   gunnels said the reports also underestimated what the sanders campaign forecast would be trillions of dollars in savings in administration  paperwork and drug prices seen in other western countries with single payer systems  the sanders campaign has estimated that his proposed healthcare system would save more than   trillion over the next  years  compared with the current system
