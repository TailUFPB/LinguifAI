philadelphia  reuters    the head of the democratic party resigned on sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails  hoping to head off a growing rebellion by bernie sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate hillary clinton for the white house  lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between clinton and sanders erupted after more than   democratic national committee emails  leaked on friday  confirmed sanders  frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race  in a statement  dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting clinton in the white house was for her to step aside after the convention  sanders had demanded earlier in the day that wasserman schultz resign  the furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of republican candidate donald trump  who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in cleveland last week  it also overshadowed preparations in philadelphia for clinton s coronation as the nominee to face trump in the nov   presidential election  she will be the first woman nominated for president by a major u s  political party   the four day democratic convention will open on monday  in some good news for clinton  the new york times reported that businessman and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg will endorse her in a prime time speech on monday  saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in   the cache of emails leaked on friday by the wikileaks website disclosed that dnc officials explored ways to undermine sanders  insurgent presidential campaign  including raising questions about whether sanders  who is jewish  was really an atheist  sanders said wasserman schultz  a u s  representative from florida  had made the right decision for the future of the democratic party   the party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process  something which did not occur in the  race   he said  the clinton camp questioned whether russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party s emails and were interested in helping trump  who has exchanged words of praise with russian president vladimir putin   what s disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that russian state actors broke into the dnc  stole these emails and other experts are now saying that russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping donald trump   clinton campaign chairman robby mook said on cnn s  state of the union   trump campaign manager paul manafort said the clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention   what s in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system  that bernie sanders     never had a chance   manafort said on abc   clinton    a former secretary of state  and sanders    an independent u s  senator from vermont who ran for president as a democrat  waged a bruising months long battle for the nomination  branding himself a democratic socialist  sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in wall street and eradicate income inequality     but sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a dnc and party establishment he felt was stacked against him  and the resentment from sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention   i m not shocked but i m disappointed   sanders said of the emails earlier on sunday on abc s  this week   the emails showed dnc officials pondering various ways to undercut sanders  brad marshall  the dnc s chief financial officer  apologized on facebook on saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in kentucky and west virginia would reject an atheist   he had skated on saying he has a jewish heritage   marshall wrote in a may  email to three top dnc officials  no names were mentioned  but sanders was the only jewish candidate   i think i read he is an atheist  this could make several points difference with my peeps  my southern baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a jew and an atheist   clinton told cbs s   minutes  in an interview that aired on sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was  wrong and unacceptable  to bring religion into the political process  the emails angered many sanders supporters who were already dismayed by clinton s choice on friday of low key u s  senator tim kaine of virginia as her vice presidential running mate  kaine    who could appeal to independents and moderates  has never been aligned with party liberals  sanders  who has endorsed clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on monday  said he would have preferred she pick u s  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  a favorite of the party s liberal wing  as her no     i have known tim kaine for a number of years      tim is a very  very smart guy  he is a very nice guy   sanders said on nbc s  meet the press     he is more conservative than i am  would i have preferred to see somebody like an elizabeth warren selected by secretary clinton  yes  i would have   he said   carrying pitchforks meant to portray clinton as the devil  hundreds of sanders supporters took to the streets of philadelphia earlier on sunday to say they felt betrayed by the dnc   it just validated everything we thought  everything we believed to be true  that this was completely rigged right from the beginning  and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win   sanders supporter gwen sperling said  dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile will serve as interim chair through the election  the dnc said on twitter
