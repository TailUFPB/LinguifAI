cleveland  reuters    cleveland s police union called for the suspension of a state law allowing people to carry firearms during the republican national convention but ohio s governor said he was powerless to act despite heightened security concerns with the killing on sunday of three police officers in louisiana   republican donald trump seized on the shooting deaths in baton rouge  louisiana  to bolster his case the united states is leaderless and he is the better candidate in the nov   u s  presidential election to restore law and order than his rival  democrat hillary clinton  it was not immediately clear there was a link between sunday s shootings and recent unrest countrywide over police killings of black men  one of them a shooting in baton rouge about two weeks ago  despite a lack of clarity about the motive and specifics of sunday s incident  trump said president barack obama  doesn t have a clue  on how to handle the problem after obama voiced concern about inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail    our country is a divided crime scene  and it will only get worse   trump said  he issued statements on twitter on sunday  a day before the start of the four day republican convention in cleveland this week due to formally nominate him for the white house  after the shootings in baton rouge  in which three other police officers were wounded  the head of cleveland s police union  steve loomis  asked governor john kasich to suspend state laws allowing people to openly carry firearms  but kasich said he lacked the authority to do so  kasich  a republican who lost his bid for the white house to trump  issued a statement through his spokeswoman emmalee kalmbach  saying   ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested  the bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt   as we re doing in ohio   so our communities and officers can both be safe   clinton called the shootings  devastating  and urged the country to work together   we must not turn our backs on each other  we must not be indifferent to each other   clinton said in a statement   we must all stand together to reject violence and strengthen our communities   speaking at the white house  obama said that with this week s republican convention followed next week by the democratic convention in philadelphia  political rhetoric would likely be more overheated than usual   we don t need inflammatory rhetoric  we don t need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda  we need to temper our words and open our hearts  all of us   obama told reporters  there were no plans to delay monday s start of the cleveland convention  where thousands of republican delegates are gathering amid a threat of protests both for and against trump    a businessman turned candidate  security was extraordinarily tight with downtown streets lined by concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences  propelled by a new urgency after an attacker drove his truck into a holiday crowd in nice  france  last week  killing  people  jeff larson  chief executive officer of the convention  said he was not worried about the open carry law   there s going to be plenty of law enforcement in downtown cleveland   he told reporters   i feel good about the security and what we ve done   trump sought to link the violence to the u s  led fight against islamic state  writing   we are trying to fight isis  and now our own people are killing our police  our country is divided and out of control  the world is watching   trump enters the crucial week trailing clinton in most national opinion polls and needs a bounce from the convention to vault him into a more competitive position  republican strategist hogan gidley said the violence gave relevance to trump s message   it s something that donald trump and his crowd were already prepared to talk about   he said   this is an epidemic in this country now and we ve got to solve it   democratic strategist david axelrod tweeted that trump s effort to make himself a law and order candidate reminded him of a similar attempt by richard nixon in   when the republican won his first presidential election   someone s been studying     axelrod tweeted  trump s goal at the convention is to get more american voters to take a fresh look at him and  he hopes  to see him in a more favorable light  after his victory over  other republican candidates in a brutal battle marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric that left many in the party divided  to that end  many speakers will talk about their views on trump  from daughter ivanka to women s pro golfer natalie gulbis  it s going to be a very personal convention  i mean  you re going to have his family speaking  you re going to have friends who have known him speaking   trump campaign manager paul manafort told cbs s  face the nation   many longtime party fixtures are staying away  republican national committee chairman reince priebus  who has been a private counselor to trump  said the convention would help trump pivot to the general election   he s never run for anything before      i think it s just taken longer to pivot  and i think he s pivoting   priebus told nbc s  meet the press    the convention will also provide republican faithful with their first look at his vice presidential running mate  indiana governor mike pence  who was announced on saturday after a messy selection process  hoping to win over more traditional republicans  trump picked the social conservative pence over two other finalists  former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and new jersey governor chris christie  the disorganized nature of the running mate rollout   in which trump failed to fully project the power of the partnership    had some republicans worried that they could see more of the same at cleveland
