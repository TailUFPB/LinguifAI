elkhart  ind   reuters    president barack obama said on wednesday the decision to direct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice was based on the law and the best interests of the children  speaking at a town hall event broadcast by the pbs television network  obama  a democrat  said the federal government waded into the controversial issue after school districts asked the education department for guidance  republicans have blasted the directive as executive branch overreach  and more than a dozen states have sued the obama administration to block it       what happened and what continues to happen is you have transgender kids in schools  and they get bullied  and they get ostracized  and it s tough for them   obama said   my best interpretation of what our laws and our obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so that they are not in a vulnerable situation   he said  on may   the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity  the non binding guidance contained the implicit threat of cuts in federal funding if it was not followed  it relied on an interpretation of title ix  which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance  the directive came as the justice department and north carolina battled in federal court over a north carolina state law approved in march that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates  other states are weighing similar measures   we should deal with this issue the same way we would want it dealt with if it was our child and that is to try to create an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids   obama said  obama said there  are a lot of things more pressing  than the transgender bathroom controversy  including islamic state  the economy and jobs   somehow people think i made it an issue  i didn t make it an issue   he said
