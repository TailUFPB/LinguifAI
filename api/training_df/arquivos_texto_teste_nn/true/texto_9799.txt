west chester  pa   reuters    republican donald trump  on the eve of primary elections in five states that he is expected to sweep  launched blistering attacks on monday on rivals ted cruz and john kasich for their  hour joint effort aimed at denying him the party s presidential nomination  the cruz kasich agreement  which some stop trump republican strategists say should have been undertaken weeks ago  was forged to try and keep trump from securing the   delegates he needs to win the nomination outright and force republicans to consider the two rivals at the party s national convention in cleveland in july  kasich  the ohio governor  and cruz  a u s  senator from texas  agreed not to compete against each other in three upcoming nominating contests that could prove to be pivotal  indiana  oregon and new mexico  trump  speaking at pennsylvania s west chester university  near philadelphia  dismissed the deal as a sign of desperation and predicted he still would win the nomination on the convention s first ballot  with dramatic flair  he compared his plight to a champion boxer whom trump said he once warned not to go into unfriendly territory because the judges could rule against him  the boxer  trump said  replied   if i knock him out there s not a damn thing the judges can do   trump is expected to win all five of tuesday s nominating contests in the northeastern states of pennsylvania  connecticut  rhode island  delaware and maryland  which have a total of  delegates at stake  trump is already ahead in the delegate race with   followed by cruz with  and kasich with   according to the associated press  after tuesday  indiana  which votes on may   will be the next big battleground  with  delegates up for grabs  the kasich cruz deal already showed signs of bending on monday  with kasich telling voters in philadelphia that people who want to vote for him in indiana should still do so   i ve never told them not to vote for me  they ought to vote for me  but i m not over there campaigning and spending resources   he said  cruz took steps to maintain he is a serious contender for the nomination with his campaign team announcing he has developed a short list of vice presidential running mates  traditionally  candidates wait until they have secured the nomination to select a running mate  one person being vetted for the no   position is former republican presidential candidate carly fiorina  an aide to fiorina said  fiorina  a businesswoman  endorsed cruz when she dropped out of the race  showing no sign of trying to unify republicans around him with a more serious demeanor  trump ripped kasich for refusing to get out of the race and even criticized his eating habits   this is just a guy who s a stubborn guy  who eats like a slob and shouldn t have press conferences while he s stuffing stuff down his throat   trump said  on cruz  trump said he has done a  lousy job  in the senate and has shown that he  cannot build consensus   trump agreed to an may  interview with fox news anchor megyn kelly  whose questioning of him at a debate last august angered trump and led him to criticize her for months  cruz said the deal with kasich was aimed at preventing a trump nomination that he argues would assure victory for democrat hillary clinton in the nov   presidential election  the cruz kasich agreement is unique in modern presidential politics and signaled panic after trump s sweeping victory in last week s new york primary  said larry sabato  director of the university of virginia s center for politics   they know he s going to have a great night tomorrow   sabato said   if things are not shaken up  trump s going to be the nominee  they have to do something big to shake things up  they re hoping that this is it   but cruz said trump was the desperate one because he knows he has a difficult path to win the party s nomination   i don t doubt that donald trump is going to scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well   cruz said in indiana   that has been donald s pattern   trump has dominated the nominating contests so far but still faces a tough path to earn the delegates needed to lock up the nomination before the convention  if no candidate has enough delegate support on the first vote at the national convention  many delegates can switch to another candidate on subsequent ballots
