washington  reuters    the u s  government for the first time on friday formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the nov   presidential election   we believe  based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts  that only russia s senior most officials could have authorized these activities   a u s  government statement said on friday about hacking of political groups   these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the u s  election process   u s  intelligence officials concluded weeks ago that the russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the democratic national committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee  possibly to disrupt or discredit the election  in which democrat hillary clinton faces republican donald trump  a kremlin spokesman called the u s  allegations  nonsense   the interfax news agency reported   on saturday  the russian foreign ministry said the u s  accusations lacked any proof and were an attempt by washington to fan  unprecedented anti russian hysteria    this whipping up of emotions regarding  russian hackers  is used in the u s  election campaign  and the current u s  administration  taking part in this fight  is not averse to using dirty tricks   deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said on saturday in comments posted on the ministry s website  the obama administration s decision to blame russia for the attacks is the latest downward turn in u s  relations with moscow  which are under strain over russia s actions in syria and ukraine and in cyberspace  also on friday  u s  secretary of state john kerry said russian and syrian actions in the syrian civil war  including bombings of hospitals   beg for  a war crimes investigation  in addition  a u s  intelligence official said on friday that russia was moving short range nuclear capable missiles into kaliningrad  a tiny russian enclave between poland and lithuania  confirming estonian news reports  clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  said the public blaming for the hacks left one remaining question of  why donald trump continues to make apologies for the russians   trump had previously expressed doubt about russia s involvement  in july  he suggested russia should attempt to retrieve and publish emails from clinton s private server   trump s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment  hours after the u s  government s accusation was levied  wikileaks posted hundreds of emails on its website purportedly hacked from podesta s private account  until friday  the obama administration had avoided publicly singling out russia in connection with the mounting civilian deaths in syria or the cyber attacks  the statement by the department of homeland security and the office of the director of national intelligence did not blame the russian government for hacking attempts against state election systems  but said  scanning and probing  of those systems originated in most cases from servers operated by a russian company  however  a department of homeland security spokesman said u s  officials had concluded that the hacking attacks or probes of state voter registration systems were  consistent with russian motivations   concern has grown about the reliability of the u s  voting system as a result of the breach  and trump has called the system  rigged   but without providing specific evidence  u s  intelligence officials have said there is no evidence that voting recording systems have been manipulated   identifying russia as the actor behind the cyber attacks on political organizations falls short of more punitive measures the united states has taken against other countries for cyber intrusions      lawmakers of both political parties welcomed the formal accusation  republican senator cory gardner  chairman of the u s  senate foreign relations subcommittee on east asia  the pacific and international cybersecurity  said he planned to introduce sanctions legislation  earlier this year  a u s  grand jury indicted seven iranians employed by two iran based computer firms on charges of hacking into the u s  financial sector  in   obama announced sanctions against north korea for hacking into sony pictures  in   the united states charged five chinese military hackers for economic espionage aimed at u s  nuclear  metals and solar industries  a senior u s  official said the administration is considering other retaliatory steps against russia  but he declined to identify them  those steps may remain covert  the official said    the democratic national committee publicly disclosed intrusions into its systems in june and held russia responsible  leaks of committee emails from pro transparency group wikileaks soon followed  demonstrating what appeared to be favoritism for clinton over another democrat  bernie sanders  by committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  wasserman schultz  a florida congresswoman  stepped down  in friday s statement  the government said disclosures of emails by wikileaks and hacking entities known as dcleaks and guccifer    are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts    wikileaks has not identified the source of its leaks and criticized those who have claimed it was russia  guccifer   has identified itself as a romanian hacker  but u s  intelligence officials have concluded that guccifer   and dcleaks are both a front for russian spy units
