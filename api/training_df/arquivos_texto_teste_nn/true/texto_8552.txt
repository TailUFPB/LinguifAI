washington  reuters    president barack obama issued a scathing attack of donald trump on tuesday for criticizing a muslim family whose u s  army captain son was killed in iraq  and he challenged republican leaders to withdraw support for their  unfit  nominee  obama s comments added to a growing number of statements from republicans and democrats lambasting trump for his criticism of khizr and ghazala khan  who appeared at the democratic national convention last week  trump questioned whether mrs  khan did not speak at the convention because she was prevented from doing so by her religion and he characterized mr  khan s criticism of him as  vicious   families who lose sons or daughters who serve in the u s  military are called gold star families   the notion that he would attack a gold star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf or our country  the fact that he doesn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in europe  in the middle east  in asia means that he s woefully unprepared to do this job   obama said of trump during a white house news conference  the democratic president noted that leading republicans  including speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell  and one time republican presidential nominee john mccain  a u s  senator from arizona  had criticized trump for his remarks but have stood by their endorsements of him   the question i think that they have to ask themselves is  if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable  why are you still endorsing him   obama said    what does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer   obama said  obama spoke during a white house news conference with singapore s prime minister  lee hsien loong   obama has endorsed his former secretary of state  hillary clinton  the democratic nominee for president  obama said that even if he had lost his white house races in  to mccain and in  to former massachusetts governor mitt romney  he would not have doubted their abilities to lead the country  that was not the case for trump  a businessman from new york  obama said   there has to come a point at which you say  somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn t have the judgment  the temperament  the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world   obama said
