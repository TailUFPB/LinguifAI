moscow  reuters    the kremlin says u s  intelligence agency allegations it ran an influence campaign to help president elect donald trump win the white house are false  but if u s  spies are right  moscow may wish it hadn t bothered to meddle in the first place  the belief  widely held in the west  that the kremlin helped discredit democratic rival hillary clinton by orchestrating embarrassing media leaks  has relegated u s  russia relations to a post cold war low and stoked fears russia will try to subvert french and german elections this year   and true or not  the bipartisan view that russia tried to help trump  supported by a classified u s  intelligence report  may make it harder  not easier  for trump to make common cause with president vladimir putin  something both men say they want  in the latest wrinkle  u s  officials said on tuesday that trump has been presented with claims that russia had compromising information about him  the accusations are uncorroborated and denied by the kremlin   there was initial delight in russia when trump won and there was more delight after trump picked rex tillerson as secretary of state   said alexei makarkin  deputy director at the moscow based center for political technologies   there is significantly less delight now   former exxon mobil ceo tillerson  trump s pick for america s top diplomat  is seen as a friend of russia  his firm has been thwarted from carrying out a huge project in the russian arctic by economic sanctions imposed by the outgoing obama administration to punish moscow for its actions in ukraine  makarkin said trump and his circle would now be accused of being kremlin stooges every time they pushed for detente with russia  with senior republicans likely to warn that any rapprochement would hand political capital to the democrats  putin  who has repeatedly praised trump s political skills  is hoping his incoming u s  counterpart will ease or annul the sanctions  stay out of russia s domestic affairs  and maybe even team up with the kremlin in the middle east  but the furor over hacking and allegations of wider russian interference have triggered pressure from democrats and trump s fellow republicans in congress for tougher  not weaker  anti russian measures  that has amplified congressional calls for an independent bipartisan investigation into russian dirty tricks and prompted president barack obama to expel  suspected russian spies  denting early russian optimism about a trump presidency  when the announcement that trump had won the nov   presidential election was made in russia s parliament by vyacheslav nikonov  the grandson of stalin s foreign minister  lawmakers erupted in applause  in moscow  clinton was widely seen as being anti russian    two months later  the mood has soured   the new hacking allegations against russia are clearly timed to coincide with the handover of power in the united states   alexei pushkov  a senator who sits on the upper house of parliament s defense and security committee  said    the aim is to force trump into enmity with russia      victoria zhuravleva  an expert on u s  russia relations who writes analytical papers for the government  said the current mood in the united states meant trump would struggle to improve relations with moscow even if he wanted to   if we are realistic we have nothing to wait for   said zhuravleva  who said congress could stymie trump s russia policies and would probably present him with proposals to hit moscow with fresh sanctions rather than roll back existing ones  to be sure  some observers of u s  russian relations say the kremlin still emerges from the affair with a major win  the new u s  president favors closer ties with russia and has named people who share that view to key posts  and trump can plow ahead with rapprochement even if some in washington oppose it   the constitution privileges the executive in war and foreign policy   rhodri jeffreys jones  author of  we know all about you  the story of surveillance in britain and america   wrote in e mailed comments   once trump and putin begin to play together  if they do   the hacking issue will become a minor historical footnote   but with u s  russia tensions so strained  some in russia fret washington will strike back with its own cyber attack   german klimenko  putin s internet adviser  has suggested russia must be ready to disconnect itself or to be involuntarily cut off from the global internet   america could say it will throw up virtual borders to protect itself from  external  influence   klimenko told reuters   i can imagine     any actions    with so much focus on alleged russian meddling  attention is now turning to presidential elections in france and germany this year with some european politicians and intelligence services warning moscow will try to interfere there too  the kremlin s preferences appear clear from state media  where chancellor angela merkel has been denigrated as  an old witch   french national front leader marine le pen and center right francois fillon have both been portrayed more positively  former intelligence agents and cyber experts say neither country has the technical ability to protect itself or fully understand by whom and how it is being hacked  creating a rich opportunity for disinformation and unverifiable claims    several intelligence experts said elements of russia s intelligence community won t be able to resist trying to replicate their u s  election operations in european elections   even while other parts of the ruling elite see such operations as highly risky   this publicity  around the u s  election  made russia look so powerful that it almost provokes them to try their hand elsewhere   said andrei soldatov  co author of red web  which examines how the fsb security service uses the internet   yuri felshtinsky  a friend of murdered kremlin critic alexander litvinenko and an expert in the russian intelligence services  said europe should brace itself     during the u s  campaign russia created a very powerful tool to influence elections  this tool  including hacking and the creation of web sites involved in publishing fake news  will now be used everywhere
