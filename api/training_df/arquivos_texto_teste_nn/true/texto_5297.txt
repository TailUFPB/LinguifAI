branchburg  n j  virginia beach  va   reuters    u s  representative leonard lance  who has held more than  town hall style meetings with constituents in his central new jersey district  has never faced a crowd like he did on wednesday  the republican endured catcalls  chants and caustic questions from more than   residents at a local college  while hundreds of others outside brandished signs with messages like  resist trump   parallel scenes have played out across the country this week during the first congressional recess since donald trump became president  republican lawmakers returning home confronted a wave of anger over a spectrum of issues  including immigration  healthcare and trump s possible ties to russia  the raucous meetings are the latest in a relentless series of rallies  marches and protests that shows no signs of abating more than  days into the new administration  the anti trump energy has prompted talk of a liberal style tea party movement  in reference to the protests in  that helped reshape the republican party and arguably laid the groundwork for trump s surprise electoral victory last year   some of the lessons to draw from that are persistence  repetition  not taking  no  for an answer   said victoria kaplan  the organizing director for the grassroots progressive group moveon  since the day after trump s inauguration  when millions of protesters joined women s marches worldwide  left wing organizers have sought to harness that anger to fuel a lasting political campaign  hundreds of progressive groups have sprung up across the country   some affiliated with national organizations like indivisible or moveon   to help coordinate  at town halls in new jersey and virginia this week  constituents came armed with red  disagree  signs they held aloft to register their disapproval of what they heard from their representatives   some u s  senators  such as pat toomey  republican of pennsylvania  have faced weekly protests outside their offices  and a pennsylvania healthcare network set up a  town hall  this week with an empty suit in place of toomey  who declined to attend  more marches are scheduled across the country in the coming months  including several major events in washington  tied to gay rights  science and a push for trump to release his tax returns  the sheer volume of protests   last week  there were three nationwide calls for action within a five day span   has some political observers wondering how long it can last  but several experts who study protests said the level of outrage may be increasing  rather than subsiding  after a tumultuous first month in which trump s words and actions created fresh outrage among liberals almost daily   we re not anywhere near reaching a saturation point for protest   said michael heaney  the author of  party in the street  the antiwar movement and the democratic party after    and a university of michigan professor   if anything  it s just getting started   the key for organizers is to convert large scale protests into sustained action by building databases of names and encouraging locally based events  experts said   you can t just have the diehards   said dana r  fisher  a university of maryland professor who studies collective action   and then you need to channel them into new types of activism   when fisher surveyed participants at the women s march in washington  she found one third were attending their first protest   the highest percentage she has ever observed   this is unprecedented   she said   but there s nothing that s not unprecedented about the trump presidency   some republicans have dismissed the protests as manufactured  trump on tuesday tweeted that  so called angry crowds  in republicans  districts were  planned out by liberal activists   but kaplan of moveon said the vast majority of actions were  organic   a weekly conference call the group hosts to discuss the movement has attracted a bigger number of participants each week  with   people joining the latest discussion   we are firing on all cylinders to catch up  with grassroots protests  she said   that is a demonstration of energy and sustainability   experts also said social media has made it far easier to organize mass protests quickly and efficiently  in what kaplan said was a sign the protests are having an impact  many republicans have eschewed town halls this week to avoid confrontations  there were fewer than  in person republican town halls scheduled for the first two months of the year  compared with more than  in the same period in   according to a vice report  in louisiana on wednesday  residents shouted down republican senator bill cassidy as he tried to explain his healthcare proposal  scott taylor  a freshman republican representative in virginia  sparred with hundreds of impassioned constituents on monday at his own event  like lance  whose district voted for hillary clinton over trump  taylor is already a midterm target for democrats  taylor said in an interview after the town hall that he recognized many of the attendees from the local democratic party   it s not like they re just some new organic people who just came about and are concerned   taylor said   but not everyone was a democrat  austin phillips  a  year old trump voter  told taylor at the town hall he was worried about losing healthcare coverage if obamacare is repealed   trump has talked about wanting to repeal it   phillips  who is self employed and purchased insurance through an exchange created by the law  said in a later interview   if they quickly repeal it with no replacement lined up  then theoretically everybody would lose their insurance
