washington  reuters    divisions have emerged among advisers to president donald trump over whether to rescind a signature policy of his predecessor  president barack obama  that shields young immigrants from deportation  according to congressional sources and republicans close to the white house  even though trump campaigned on a promise to roll back obama s executive orders on immigration  the republican has so far left intact an order safeguarding   people who were brought to the united states illegally as children  known as the  dreamers   the issue has become a flashpoint for white house advisers divided between a more moderate faction such as chief of staff reince priebus and immigration hardliners stephen miller and steve bannon  said a former congressional aide who has been  involved with immigration issues in washington       priebus has said publicly that trump will work with congress to get a  long term solution  on the issue   meanwhile  miller  said to have mastered the thinking of his former boss and anti immigration advocate jeff sessions  trump s nominee for u s  attorney general  as well as bannon  former head of right wing breitbart news  have pushed trump to take a harder approach and rescind the protections   two officials at the department of homeland security expect trump to simply stop renewing the authorizations that  dreamers  currently have to work  drive and obtain higher education  under that plan  the most recently renewed authorizations would expire in two years    but a senior house republican aide said it was uncertain whether the administration had scrapped the idea of overturning obama s deferred action for childhood arrivals  known as daca  as the internal debate plays out    preserving daca has also become somewhat of a bartering chip as trump seeks congressional support for a wall on the u s  mexico border and other early administration priorities  the white house is  acutely aware  of the firestorm in the country and within congress that could swamp the fledgling administration just as it plunges into negotiations over the wall  healthcare  tax reform and infrastructure investments  said the senior house republican aide  another congressional aide described a senate bill sponsored by democrat dick durbin and republican lindsey graham to protect the  dreamers  as the  sugar that would help the medicine of the wall go down    the bill would likely face challenges winning enough votes to pass  efforts to attach some tough conservative amendments could lose democratic party support and sink the whole effort   trump has kept his public comments on daca vague  in an interview with abc news on wednesday  trump said his administration would be coming out with a policy to deal with  dreamers  over the next four weeks    they shouldn t be very worried  they are here illegally  they shouldn t be very worried  i do have a big heart  we re going to take care of everybody  we re going to have a very strong border   trump said in the interview with abc   trump reportedly told durbin during the inaugural luncheon at the capitol on jan   that he did not have to worry about an executive action overturning obama s order  but there is scant trust among democrats that trump will keep his word  and immigration advocates said daca recipients live in fear and uncertainty as the message from the white house and republicans seems to shift by the day      house speaker paul ryan told a woman protected by daca  at a townhall hosted by cnn jan    that there should be a solution for people like her to get  right with the law  and not be separated from their families   just two days prior  sessions  a senator  told a senate panel considering his confirmation that it would  certainly be constitutional  to repeal daca  sessions also attempted to force a vote to block daca in the senate in    miller  sessions  former staffer  is now trump s senior adviser for policy at the white house   miller is known to be a staunch advocate for restricting immigration  even by workers who enter legally on visas   both miller and bannon  trump s senior counselor and chief strategist  are seen as outsiders to the republican establishment and unafraid to upset people like ryan to stay true to trump campaign promises  priebus  however  came to the white house after chairing the republican national committee and has spent years seeking to unify the party and cultivating relationships with career politicians
