washington beijing  reuters    china s plan to punish a u s  automaker accused of price fixing is a sign of how beijing could retaliate if president elect donald trump upends decades of relations between the two nations  trump s assertion that the united states need not be bound by the policy that taiwan is part of  one china  would erode a bedrock of u s  china ties that has underpinned the vast increase in trade and cooperation between what are now the world s two largest economies  few expect the disagreement will lead to outright military confrontation  nor even the kind of economic war that many feared could be launched by trump s threat during the u s  presidential campaign to slap tariffs of up to  percent on chinese imports  however  a rising china has plenty of other ways to push back hard if trump presses on the taiwan question  which most analysts see as the most sensitive part of the u s  china relationship  in what might be a shot across the bow of the trump administration  due to take office on jan    the official china daily newspaper quoted a state planning official saying china will soon penalize an unnamed u s  automaker for monopolistic behavior  while the official said no one should read  anything improper  into this  shares of general motors co and ford motor co skidded  auto industry sources have told reuters this specific investigation was already underway before trump s recent comments  however  the manner in which it was announced  by saying only that it was a u s  automaker before a formal announcement of fines  has raised questions around whether officials might be seizing on the case to send a shot across the bow of the incoming trump administration  jason miller  a spokesman for trump  said on wednesday trump s team was aware of the report but it would be premature to comment  in washington  a democratic congressional aide said china s threat to fine the automaker was a  good sharp reminder  to trump that  they have cards to play too and that if he is thinking that he can enter into negotiations   be it on taiwan  trade  north korea  whatever   as if the united states is the sole global superpower     then he is going to need to think again   china s state planner  the national development and reform commission  did not responded to reuters requests for comment on the china daily story  china s foreign ministry said it did not know any details about the case   china welcomes foreign companies  including american ones  to invest in and operate in china  at the same time they must respect china s laws and rules  this point is very clear   ministry spokesman geng shuang said when asked if this was china sending a message to trump   pressure on other u s  companies  such as boeing co  ba n  and general electric co  ge n   with large interests in china could be one of the most tangible tools of retaliation  together with new limits on access to the country s huge markets  u s  business interests in china are estimated at more than   billion  wider economic steps   such as china  america s biggest creditor  selling a significant part of its    trillion of u s  treasuries  or weakening its currency   seem unlikely  the first because it would slash the value of china s u s  bond portfolio and the second because it could accelerate capital flight  experts said  beijing could speed up a military build up that had begun to slow along with chinese economic growth  carry out naval exercises close to taiwan   which it regards as a renegade province   and withhold diplomatic cooperation on issues such as iran and north korea s nuclear programs   taiwan policy is what china considers a core interest     and it s prepared to go to great lengths to defend it   said eric altbach  senior vice president at the albright stonebridge group consultancy in washington and a former deputy assistant u s  trade representative for china affairs  the consensus within the obama administration is that trump  who irked china by taking a phone call from taiwan s president  was not fully aware of the potential backlash from beijing over his questioning of the  one china  policy  a u s  official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  the hope is that by the time trump takes over from president barack obama  he will recognize that china has advanced so far economically  diplomatically and militarily that it is unwise to pick fights with beijing over such a bedrock principle  he added  a former senior u s  official took a more pessimistic view   trump has basically guaranteed that the first year in the china relationship will be a combative  competitive one  and the question is how bad it will get   he said   the chinese now are basically putting together their list on how to retaliate   there are at least three ways in which the matter could play out  u s  china experts said  trump could backtrack over time  much as former u s  president george w  bush did  a second track would be if trump goes on questioning the  one china  policy without taking concrete action  the third   considered unlikely by u s  officials past and present  would be a drift toward military confrontation  asked if trump s  one china  stance could lead to this  a source with ties to the chinese leadership told reuters   we will see what trump says and does after he becomes president   a second source with leadership ties said they expected tensions with the united states over taiwan  but the source said chinese president xi jinping  who has sounded a more nationalistic line than his recent predecessors  could also use the issue to further cement his grip on power   if  taiwan  is emboldened by the u s  support and does something drastic  it could be an opportunity for us  there will be just cause to dispatch troops   the second source said  while the possibility of taiwan declaring independence and hence triggering a chinese invasion seems low  the mere softening in the u s  commitment to the policy would likely play out in china s defense posture   it will alter chinese defense priorities  i think that s inevitable now   said dennis wilder  a former cia china analyst  he said xi may increase chinese military spending for  and place new emphasis  over time  on gaining the amphibious capabilities necessary to actually invade taiwan   xi jinping has to respond to this internally  domestically  and while he doesn t want an open fight with trump  he will have to show     resolve   he said  citing higher military spending  more defense exercises and tougher rhetoric on taiwan   we can anticipate that unless this issue is taken off the table
