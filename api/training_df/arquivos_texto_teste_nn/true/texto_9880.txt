washington  reuters    he s a successful businessman making his first foray into politics  he wants to secure the southern border with mexico and dump global trade deals  and like donald trump  he wants to be the republican establishment s worst nightmare   he s paul nehlen  who has emerged as a republican rival to paul ryan  the speaker of the u s  house of representatives  in his home district in wisconsin  ryan  the most powerful elected republican in the country  is the epitome of that establishment  while many republican operatives fear trump s tumultuous presidential bid will hurt house and senate races this year  a handful of candidates like nehlen are embracing trump s message  although not always the man himself  a loss by ryan or another high profile incumbent would send shockwaves through the party and could prompt fellow establishment republicans to rethink positions on advocacy of free trade and support for immigration reform  in new hampshire  where trump won the nominating contest  or primary  by  points  jim rubens  a former republican state senator who has endorsed the billionaire businessman  is attempting to unseat incumbent senator kelly ayotte    in arizona  another state trump won  state senator kelli ward is challenging veteran senator john mccain by talking up securing the border and courting voters at trump rallies  although she has not endorsed the presidential candidate       the dynamic of outsiders challenging establishment candidates is one that has been taking place within the republican party for several election cycles  but in trump  the insurgency has a new  more popular face  beyond the races in wisconsin  arizona and new hampshire  it has played out in states like alabama  where jonathan mcconnell greeted voters outside a trump rally in huntsville in a bid to unseat veteran senator richard shelby  and north carolina  where rep  renee elmers  facing a challenge to her seat  said she had voted for trump in that state s presidential primary  but  unlike the anti establishment wave that swept tea party aligned lawmakers into congress in   these candidates do not appear to represent a new anti washington groundswell  suggesting there are limits to trump s brand of politics  which at times runs deep against republican orthodoxy on issues such as trade and taxes   i been surprised that there haven t been any senate or house incumbents that have lost primaries as a result of a groundswell of support for donald trump or ted cruz   said nathan gonzales  an independent analyst on congressional races in washington   shelby  for example  soundly defeated challenger mcconnell in alabama s republican primary race in march   other candidates could try to replicate his message  but no one can replicate donald trump   gonzales said  still  many analysts and political operatives believe republicans unhappy with trump as the nominee won t vote in the general election  potentially causing republicans to lose their congressional seats to democratic contenders  it would be easy  to dismiss nehlen s challenge to ryan  who is popular among republicans inside and outside of wisconsin and has a large campaign warchest  a poll last month by marquette university law school showed him with more than an  percent approval rating among wisconsin republicans  but less than two years ago  eric cantor  then the no   republican in the house of representatives  was also considered a rising republican star  he suffered a shock defeat in the  congressional elections in virginia to an obscure conservative college professor  david brat  cantor  too  had looked unbeatable   that race is what reinforced in my mind this is possible   nehlen said in an interview  trump has frequently criticized ryan for the    billion budget deal struck with democratic president barack obama last december  and ryan s support of trade deals such as the trans pacific partnership and comprehensive immigration reform is squarely at odds with trump s positions      nehlen said those two issues motivated him to mount his challenge to ryan  although he stopped short of saying he embraced trump s candidacy  rubens  who is challenging ayotte in new hampshire  isn t as restrained   i admire his independence   rubens told reuters   rubens  like trump  calls for a fence along the southern border and for doing away with so called  birthright citizenship   a policy that grants anyone born on u s  soil a citizen   ayotte  a first term senator  was praised by conservatives when she ran in  and was endorsed by former alaska governor sarah palin at the height of palin s popularity  but she earned their wrath when she backed immigration reform  she also frustrated moderates by voting against a bill that would block suspected terrorists from buying guns  ayotte  gonzales said   is an example of someone who can t come out guns blazing against donald trump  she needs every republican possible in the state   in arizona  ward is challenging mccain  the moderate who was the republican presidential nominee in   in a state where rancor over immigration issues runs high  ward has said she supports trump s claim that mexico was sending criminals to the united states  mexico has ridiculed the allegation      ward has an opportunity  a poll released last month by the firm public policy polling showed mccain with a  percent approval rating among republicans in arizona
