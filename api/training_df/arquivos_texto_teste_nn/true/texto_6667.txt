new york  reuters    yahoo inc yhoo o came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history  prompting verizon communications inc  vz n  to demand better terms for its planned purchase of yahoo s internet business  shares of the sunnyvale  california based internet pioneer fell more than  percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than  billion users late on wednesday  following another large hack reported in september  verizon  which agreed to buy yahoo s core internet business in july for    billion  is now trying to persuade yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks  according to people familiar with the matter  the u s  no   wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal  but is looking for  major concessions  in light of the most recent breach  according to another person familiar with the situation  asked about the status of the deal  a yahoo spokesperson said   we are confident in yahoo s value and we continue to work towards integration with verizon   verizon had already said in october it was reviewing the deal after september s breach disclosure  late on wednesday  it said it would  review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions  about whether to proceed   the company declined to comment beyond that statement on thursday   verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced  citing a material adverse effect  said the people familiar with the matter  who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential  no court in delaware  where yahoo is incorporated  has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement   nevertheless  the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals  and experts said that some concessions from yahoo are likely  given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches  renegotiating the deal s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time  according to erik gordon  a professor at the university of michigan s ross school of business   a more likely concession would be for yahoo to agree to compensate verizon after the close of the deal  based on the liabilities that occur  the two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches  gordon suggested  verizon shares rose   percent to close at     in line with the s p  index  spx  yahoo closed down   percent at      yahoo said late on wednesday that it had uncovered a  cyber attack that compromised data of more than  billion user accounts  the largest known breach on record   it said the data stolen may have included names  email addresses  telephone numbers  dates of birth  hashed passwords and  in some cases  encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers  the company added that some of its partners were affected  one such partner  europe s sky plc  skyb l   said yahoo provides email services to its   million sky com email account holders  but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected   the announcement followed yahoo s disclosure in september of a separate breach that affected over  million accounts  which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers   the white house said on thursday the u s  federal bureau of investigation was probing the breach  several lawsuits seeking class action status on behalf of yahoo shareholders have been filed  or are in the works  meanwhile  democratic senator mark warner of virginia said he was looking into yahoo s cyber security practices   this most recent revelation warrants a separate follow up and i plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users   he said in a statement  warner  who will become the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee next year  described the hacks as  deeply troubling    new york attorney general eric schneiderman urged anyone with a yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach s circumstances and the company s disclosures to law enforcement   germany s cyber security authority  the federal office for information security  bsi   advised german consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email  and criticized yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users  personal data   considering the repeated cases of data theft  users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision   bsi president arne schoenbohm said in a statement  the latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts  several advising consumers to close their yahoo accounts   yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways i have to recommend that if you have an active yahoo email account  either direct with yahoo of via a partner like at t  get rid of it   stu sjouwerman  chief executive of cyber security firm  inc  said in a broadly distributed email   a yahoo spokesperson  in response to criticism of the company s security measures  said on thursday   we re committed to keeping our users secure  both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure
