sacramento  calif   reuters    the california senate on thursday passed a sweeping package of gun control bills that would require background checks for ammunition purchasers  ban possession of high capacity magazines and establish a firearms violence research center  the bills  whose passage through the assembly are far from assured  are at the heart of a political duel between senate leader kevin de leon and lieutenant governor gavin newsom  both democrats  who are proposing competing plans in advance of key election campaigns   gun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation   de leon  who represents los angeles  said as he introduced the bills on the senate floor on thursday   we cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence   the package of eight bills would ban the possession of ammunition magazines holding more than  rounds  make stealing a gun a felony  limit the lending of guns among family members  and close a loophole in the state s assault weapons ban  it is uncertain whether the bills will pass the assembly  where republicans and conservative democrats have blocked some of the same measures in the past  or be signed by democratic governor jerry brown  who has vetoed some gun control measures  the senate bills were fast tracked through the legislature this week  even as state officials are counting signatures and preparing to place on the november ballot a referendum by newsom that would accomplish many of the same goals  the competing measures are a sore point between the two powerful politicians that could spill into the november election campaign as well as the race to replace brown in   de leon  who said thursday that newsom based his ballot initiative on de leon s own proposals  has asked the lieutenant governor to agree to withdraw his ballot measure should the senate bills pass  but newsom  who is running for governor  has refused  his campaign strategist  dan newman  said thursday that the initiative was more comprehensive than the legislative package and should go before voters in the fall  newsom is expected to make the gun control initiative a centerpiece of his campaign to replace brown in   along with a proposed referendum to legalize recreational use of marijuana  de leon has not endorsed newsom  he is close to possible newsom rivals in the governor s race  including former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa
