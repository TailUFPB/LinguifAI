new york washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump plunged into a deep crisis on friday after a bombshell  recording came to light in which he boasted in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman and groping women  saying  when you re a star  they let you do it   a stream of republican leaders denounced the remarks  first published by the washington post  which threaten trump s already shaky standing with women voters just a month ahead of the nov   presidential election  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the top republican elected official  said he was  sickened  by the comments and said trump would no longer attend a campaign event in wisconsin with him on saturday   i hope mr  trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests   ryan said in a statement  reince preibus  chairman of the republican national committee  said   no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner  ever   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the comments were  repugnant  and that trump  needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere   u s  representative jason chaffetz of utah  who has been one of clinton s fiercest critics  said he had retracted his endorsement of trump  telling cnn he would not be able to look his  year old daughter in the eye if he voted for trump  utah s republican governor gary herbert said on twitter he would also no longer vote for trump   tonight  millions of republicans are facing a moment of truth   herbert said  republican lawmaker mike coffman from colorado told cbs that trump should  step aside  and said  his defeat at this point seems almost certain   trump was expected to release a video statement late on friday  earlier  in a brief written statement  trump shrugged off the leaked tape as  locker room banter  a private conversation that took place many years ago   in the recorded conversation  trump was wearing a microphone and chatting on a bus with billy bush  then host of nbc s  access hollywood  ahead of a segment they were about to tape   i did try and fuck her  she was married   trump said   i moved on her like a bitch  but i couldn t get there   trump talked about his attraction to beautiful women   i just start kissing them   he said   and when you re a star they let you do it   he said   grab them by the pussy  you can do anything   trump  who has brought up former president bill clinton s infidelities as a criticism of hillary clinton  calling her a  total enabler   responded to the audio   bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close  i apologize if anyone was offended   trump said   access hollywood  confirmed the video in its own report  saying it discovered the comments in its library  billy bush said in a statement to variety he was  embarrassed and ashamed  of his comments  other prominent republicans also condemned the comments but stopped short of withdrawing their support for their candidate  including arizona senator john mccain and texas senator ted cruz  trump  known for his unconventional and controversial speaking style  has made a series of gaffes in his campaign  but the  graphic nature  of the clip will hurt his standing among women  independents  and wavering republicans  said david yepsen  director of the paul simon public policy institute at southern illinois university   we ve never seen something like this trump clip in a modern presidential campaign   yepsen said  calling the incident  sad for the american political system  and for trump s supporters  republican strategist ron bonjean said  this feels like it is quickly becoming a political  game over   for trump   unless voters don t care about these issues or believe that this is simply political dirty tricks by releasing the videos now  trump is going to have to pull a rabbit out of his hat in order to turn things around   bonjean said  still  trump s past controversial comments have failed to shake his core supporters  said david axelrod  a former political adviser to democratic president barack obama   appalling as the  trump  tape is  i m reminded of all the times we have said  this time he s really done   axelrod said on twitter  the revelation comes right before sunday s town hall style debate  seen as critical as trump tries to rebound from a dip in some opinion polls after a rocky performance in the first debate  clinton  who slammed trump s comments as  horrific   was also hit by a leak on friday  wikileaks published what appeared to be excerpts of her paid speeches to corporations  the transcripts of which the campaign has refused to release  the excerpts were likely to provide trump some fodder for attacking clinton in the debate  in them  she voices support for open trade and borders and discusses taking different positions in public and in private  however  yepsen said the excerpts would likely be eclipsed by trump s clip   the two things aren t comparable   he said  the u s  government formally accused russia on friday of hacking democratic party organizations ahead of the presidential election  wikileaks has declined to name its sources  a spokesman for the clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the wikileaks emails were authentic and noted that other hacked documents have been faked
