washington  reuters    as a teenager in the early  retired u s  navy vice admiral robert s  harward played football and basketball  was popular with classmates and  like many american high school students  was known for partying  but harward  to whom president donald trump has offered the post of u s  national security adviser  to succeed michael flynn  spent his teenage years not in his native rhode island  but in pre revolutionary iran  where his father  a navy captain  advised the iranian military  during his teenage years  harward lived in an iranian neighborhood  attended school with iranian american students and played sports against iranian teams  those experiences gave him an unusual familiarity with iran s culture and people in the years before the  islamic revolution that ousted the pro american shah   during very formative years of his life  he was exposed to everything that was iran   said joseph condrill  who knew harward  known by his classmates as bobby  when they were students at the tehran american school   iran was one of our homes  and we got to know the iranian people very well  in a very intimate way   the trump administration has offered harward the job of national security adviser  two u s  officials familiar with the matter said on wednesday  it was not immediately clear if harward had accepted  the sources said  a white house spokesperson had no immediate comment  harward would carry his experience into the trump white house  charged with coordinating national security policy and responding to threats including iran s ballistic missile program and support for militant groups in the middle east  while flynn put iran  on notice   and trump has tweeted that iran is  playing with fire   harward s experience with iran is more personal  the revolution that brought iran s theocratic government to power forced the closure of the tehran american school and cut short the tours of american families living in iran  rather than being isolated on a military base  harward and other americans at that time lived among iranians  rode local buses  and were exposed to iran s attractions through field trips  his classmates said   it was not a completely isolated culture for us   said john martin    of reston  virginia  who was in harward s high school class and attended the u s  naval academy with him  harward even picked up fluent persian while he was in iran  martin said   for those of us that had once lived in iran  there s an after effect  the effect of the islamic revolution   condrill said   there is definitely a sense of suspicion  if you will     based upon that experience of the iran that we once knew   it is not clear  however  how harward s memories might influence u s  policy  because the national security adviser s job is to coordinate  not make  policy  in addition  administration officials said  trump advisers steve bannon and stephen miller have closer ties to the president than harward would have and would present a rival power center  in   as deputy head of the u s  central command  he told a conference that  iran s well established past pattern of deceit and reckless behavior have progressively increased the potential for miscalculation that could spark a regional  if not a global conflict   at the same event  he recalled with some wistfulness his own experience living in the region   i think back to the days when i graduated from the tehran american school in   where as a westerner i could freely travel through afghanistan  pakistan  india and other countries in the region and be greeted  and welcomed  because of the policies and strategy the west employed in the region   he said   yet i look today  we are in a much different world   harward did not respond to a request for comment and officials at lockheed martin  where he is a top executive  declined to comment         after graduating from high school in   harward returned to the united states  joined the navy  became an elite seal and rose through the ranks  eventually serving as deputy commander of u s  central command  which oversees american forces in the middle east  he served there under general jim mattis  now the u s  defense secretary  earlier in his career  harward worked on counterterrorism as a military officer on the national security council  an assignment seen as a marker of a rising star  several former u s  officials who worked with harward described him as experienced and smart  but not known for his personal experience with iran  he is well liked and respected and seen as unpretentious despite his distinguished military service  according to people who have worked with him    he was a very good and effective bureaucratic player   said derek chollet  an assistant secretary of defense under the obama administration   he understands the role the military plays within the broader tool set of american policy   when harward was a commanding officer in afghanistan  he was known for making his rounds without full body armor to send a message that afghanistan was safe  said a u s  official who worked under harward there   he had no ego   the official said  on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak
