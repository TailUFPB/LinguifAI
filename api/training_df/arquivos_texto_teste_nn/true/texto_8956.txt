washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday struck down a texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in america in more than two decades  the   ruling held that the republican backed  texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their right under the u s  constitution to end a pregnancy  established in the court s landmark  roe v  wade decision  the abortion providers who challenged the law said it was medically unnecessary and specifically intended to shut clinics   texas officials said it was intended to protect women s health  the ruling means similar laws in other states are probably unconstitutional and could put in jeopardy other types of abortion restrictions enacted in various conservative states   the decision should send a loud signal to politicians that they can no longer hide behind sham rationales to shut down clinics and prevent a woman who has decided to end a pregnancy from getting the care she needs   said jennifer dalven  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  president barack obama  whose administration backed the abortion providers in the court challenge  said in a statement he was  pleased to see the supreme court protect women s rights and health  and that restrictions like those in texas  harm women s health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a woman s reproductive freedom   conservative justice anthony kennedy joined the court s four liberal members in the ruling  with the remaining three conservatives dissenting  the court declared that both key provisions of the law   requiring abortion doctors to have  difficult to obtain  admitting privileges  at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital grade facilities   violated a woman s right to an abortion  writing for the court  liberal justice stephen breyer said   we conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes    each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre viability abortion  each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access  and each violates the federal constitution   breyer added  deferring to state legislatures over  questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this court s case law   breyer added  the ruling in the case  whole woman s health v  hellerstedt  represented the most vigorous affirmation of abortion rights in the united states since a  ruling affirmed a woman s right to have the procedure  on a warm sunny summer day  hundreds of people on both sides of the issue converged on the supreme court building  with abortion rights advocates dancing and celebrating after the ruling   we re ecstatic  the reality is today women won   abortion rights activist marcela howell said  the law was passed by a republican led legislature and signed by a republican governor in   ten states currently have admitting privileges requirements on the books while six have laws requiring hospital grade facilities  lower courts have blocked admitting privileges provisions in five states and halted facilities regulations in two states    the decision erodes states  lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost  texas  goal is to protect innocent life  while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women   republican texas governor greg abbott said  since the law was passed  the number of abortion clinics in texas  the second most populous u s  state with about  million people  had dropped from  to   the supreme court has appeals pending in two cases involving admitting privilege laws in mississippi and wisconsin on which it could act as soon as tuesday      the texas law required abortion doctors to have  admitting privileges   a type of formal affiliation  at a hospital within  miles   km  of the clinic so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care  the law also required clinic buildings to possess costly  hospital grade facilities  these regulations covered numerous building features such as corridor width  the swinging motion of doors  floor tiles  parking spaces  elevator size  ventilation  electrical wiring  plumbing  floor tiling and even the angle that water flows from drinking fountains  americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal  in a reuters ipsos online poll involving   u s  adults conducted from june  to june    percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and  percent said it generally should be illegal  views on abortion in the united states have changed very little over the decades  according to historical polling data  the last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled   to uphold a federal law banning a late term abortion procedure  amy hagstrom miller  founder and ceo of whole woman s health  which led the challenge to the texas law  said   every day whole woman s health treats our patients with compassion  respect and dignity   and today the supreme court did the same  we re thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open   presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton on twitter called the ruling  a victory for women in texas and across america    this fight isn t over  the next president has to protect women s health  women won t be  punished  for exercising their basic rights   she said  a dig at presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump  who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face  some sort of punishment   the presidential election is nov    some u s  states have pursued a variety of restrictions on abortion  including banning certain types of procedures  prohibiting it after a certain number of weeks of gestation  requiring parental permission for girls until a certain age  imposing waiting periods or mandatory counseling  and others   it s exceedingly unfortunate that the court has taken the ability to protect women s health out of the hands of texas citizens and their duly elected representatives   texas attorney general ken paxton  a republican  said in a statement  chief justice john roberts  justice clarence thomas and justice samuel alito dissented  the normally nine justice court was one member short after the feb   death of conservative justice antonin scalia  who consistently opposed abortion in past rulings
