palo alto  calif   reuters    u s  president barack obama on friday tried to limit the fallout from britain s vote to leave the european union  which threatens to harm the u s  economic recovery  derail his trade agenda and  distract u s  allies from global security issues     obama  who had argued passionately against britain leaving the eu in a trip to the country this year  vowed that washington would still maintain both its  special relationship  with london and close ties to brussels             while the uk s relationship with the eu will change  one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations  that will endure   he told an event at stanford university  referring to close ally britain   the eu will remain one of our indispensable partners   obama said  he spoke to outgoing british prime minister david cameron and german chancellor angela merkel after the stunning result of thursday s referendum  the biggest blow to the european project of greater unity since world war two  obama said he was sure britain s exit would be orderly and vowed that the united states and britain would  stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability    the brexit result rattled wall street and many other financial markets  with global stock markets losing about   trillion in value on friday       i must say we had looked for a different outcome  we would have preferred a different outcome   u s  vice president joe biden  traveling in ireland  said on friday  the historic divorce launched by the brexit vote could sink hopes of a massive u s  eu free trade deal before obama leaves the white house in january                negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  or ttip  were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti trade sentiment on both continents      as well as the global economic consequences  brexit makes it more difficult for obama and the united states to corral its western allies into joint action against challenges such as islamic state  russia and the rise of china  britain s exit could present the next u s  president with a decision on whether to turn to other key european partners like germany and france  essentially downgrading the united states  special bond with britain  whose foundation was laid in world war two  senator ben cardin of maryland  the top democrat on the senate committee on foreign relations  called on washington s partners in europe to keep their eye on foreign policy threats   we must maintain our trans atlantic consensus on how to deal with a resurgent russia and the growing threat of isis   he said   i urge leaders in london  brussels and across europe to not lose sight of these threats and remain coordinated in our response    the u s  presidential election candidates are casting an eye across the atlantic at the unlikely success of britain s  leave  campaign  which has similarities with republican donald trump s insurgent bid for the nov   election  trump s rise was sustained by a similar brew of anti establishment and anti globalization sentiment and concern about immigration that helped the leave vote    this is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs   and that s donald trump   republican strategist john feehery said                   biden  in remarks prepared for a speech at dublin castle  took a swipe at trump without mentioning him by name  he warned against  politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia  nationalism  and isolationism           brexit supporter trump called the result a  great thing        people want to take their country back  they want to have independence in a sense  you see it with europe  all over europe   trump    said in turnberry  scotland where he reopened a golf course   republican senator jeff sessions said britain s electoral shock showed that national leaders will be punished if they do not  first ensure they have protected the safety and legitimate interests of their own people    brexit is a warning for america   said sessions  a trump supporter who criticized  radical trade policies that erode the power of the people to control their lives              obama had warned british voters against brexit  in an unusually strong intervention into british politics in april  the white house said on friday that he stands by a comment made then that britain would move to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals with the united states if it left the eu         obama hopes his former secretary of state hillary clinton will win the november election and safeguard his legacy but economic volatility in the united states after brexit could hurt her chances of beating trump  in response to britain s decision to leave  clinton said the united states must first safeguard against any economic fallout at home at  this time of uncertainty  and underscore its commitment to both britain and europe       the u s  federal reserve sought to calm global financial markets by saying it was ready to provide dollar liquidity following the british vote  u s  financial regulators said the country s financial system is functioning in an  orderly manner    the financial stability oversight council   which includes the heads of the u s  treasury  securities and exchange commission and federal reserve    noted that the u s  financial system continues to function in an orderly manner  and that the council will continue to monitor ongoing developments   according to a summary released after a phone call among members  after brexit  the u s  central bank s ambitions for two rate rises this year now look unlikely  traders of u s  interest rate futures even began to price in a small chance of a fed rate cut  and now see little chance of any hike until the end of next year   one can forget about rate hikes in the near term   said thomas costerg  new york based economist at standard chartered bank   what i m worried about is that the brexit vote could be the straw that breaks the back of the u s  growth picture
