washington  reuters    president donald trump signed an order on monday that will seek to dramatically reduce federal regulations  but the policy will not apply to most of the financial reform rules introduced by the obama administration  trump s latest executive action will require that agencies cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced and it will set an annual cap on the cost of new regulations  for the rest of fiscal   the cap will require that the cost of any additional regulations be completely offset by undoing existing rules  but  the move does not cover independent agencies that crafted many of the rules required by the  dodd frank wall street reform law  including the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission  the white house said      it also would not apply to rules mandated by statutes    there will be regulation  there will be control  but it will be normalized control   trump said as he signed the order in the oval office  surrounded by a group of small business owners  during a meeting with the business owners  trump described the dodd frank law as  a disaster   he asserted that it was  almost impossible now to start a small business and it s virtually impossible to expand your existing business because of regulations   the creation of new u s  businesses has actually climbed steadily since   according to the u s  bureau of labor statistics   bit ly    white house spokesman sean spicer on monday called the executive order a  first step  and said the administration would work with congress to begin making changes to dodd frank           implementing the new regulatory order may be difficult alongside the trump administration s push to repeal and replace the affordable care act  said tom bulleit  head of the healthcare practice in the washington d c  office of law firm ropes   gray   as the congress passes new legislation on healthcare  there will need to be new rules  bulleit said    there s a great deal of regulation that is either expressly required by legislation or is necessary to make the legislation work   he said  consumer groups and environmentalists criticized the push to peel back regulations  arguing that it would remove important protections for the public     major regulations are typically reviewed by the white house s office of management and budget  omb  before they are issued  that review will continue under this new measure  but agencies will also have to identify what two regulations will be repealed to offset the costs of any new rule  harvard law school professor jody freeman said the new order was  entirely unnecessary   given similar cost benefit regulatory directives made by past presidents and existing agency processes for reviewing older rules   even it is fairly toothless in the end  it will be a weapon that omb can use to harass agencies and slow regulation   freeman said  the new order does not require that the repeal of the two regulations be done simultaneously with the release of additional rules    this vests tremendous power and responsibility in the omb director to ensure the president s direction in how we manage this across the government   a white house official told reporters before the signing  certain categories of regulations will be exempt from this new policy  including those dealing with the military and national security  the omb director will also have the ability to waive this policy in certain instances   trump has tapped u s  representative mick mulvaney of south carolina to lead the omb
