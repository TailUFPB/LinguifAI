new york  thomson reuters foundation    the election of republican donald trump to be the next u s  president raises questions about the impact his administration  could have upon immigrants in the united states and the nation s immigration and refugee policies  during his campaign trump took a hardline position  proposing to build a wall along the united states  border with mexico and deport millions of undocumented immigrants  he also said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in syria and that muslims should be banned from entering the united states  a proposal he later reworded as a call for a limit on immigration from  terror prone regions   here are some experts  views  jennifer gordon  professor at fordham law school in new york and an expert on immigration policy   trump campaigned on a promise to deport over  million undocumented immigrants  to carry this out would require staggering resources  but given his attacks on undocumented people  one thing seems near certain  he will exercise his authority to cancel the deferred action for childhood arrivals program that president obama put in place to protect young undocumented immigrants  this will leave many hard working undocumented teachers  housekeepers  lawyers  construction workers  students  health aides and doctors in a tremendously vulnerable position  our country is richer in every way for their presence  we must fight with every tool at our disposal to defend the core american value of inclusion   lavinia limon  president  u s  committee for refugees and immigrants  washington   we encourage our new president to continue the tradition of the best of american values including equal protection and respect for every member of society  worldwide  millions are denied basic human rights and we are strengthened as a country when all of humanity is recognized  america has always been the beacon of hope for the oppressed and this must continue   throughout our history refugees and immigrants have been welcomed to america by presidents from both parties in war and in peace and the current global refugee crisis is no time to shrink from this leadership   gal adam spinrad  economic empowerment program coordinator  refugee women s network inc   decatur  georgia    the words immigrant  refugee  muslim  walls and terrorism have ignited fear  hostility and division throughout the  presidential election cycle   refugees are scared right now  their safety and future here feels more tenuous  and the messages they have heard throughout this election have in many cases revictimized and retraumatized them  they are concerned their missing family members won t be allowed to join them in america  they fear they will lose their green cards or be deported  like their american counterparts  they worry about how they will get health insurance  whether they will be able to go to college  if their food stamps will be lowered  if they will lose the social security disability coverage they began receiving after an injury at one of the local chicken factories where many of them work   our hope is that the incoming presidential administration   supported by the legislature on both sides of the aisle   will retain a spirit of inclusion that makes refugees feel not only welcome  but safe   doris meissner  director of u s  immigration policy program  migration policy institute  washington   the trump administration can be expected to chart a very different course on immigration and refugee policy  as the candidate s views of immigration as a security and economic threat were central to his campaign  the most immediate changes are likely to be over refugee resettlement and the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program   mr  trump has made clear his intent to end the resettlement of syrian refugees  and it will be within the president s authority to set refugee allocations by country and overall  he also pledged to terminate the daca program  which provides relief from deportation to more than   unauthorized immigrants whose parents brought them here as children  he has also pledged to increase deportations of unauthorized immigrants   stephen yale loehr  professor of immigration law practice   cornell law school  ithaca  new york   donald trump made immigration restrictions a big part of his campaign  now we will see if he follows through on his immigration plans  some actions  like reversing president obama s executive actions that protect millions of young immigrants from deportation  can be done unilaterally  others  like building a wall along the u s  mexico border  will require congress to change current law or spend billions of dollars   although republicans will control congress for the next two years  it is always difficult to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial  moreover  some of his immigration changes could be challenged in court  president elect trump stated in his victory speech that he will be fair to everyone  let s hope he keeps that promise to immigrants     jim demint  president  heritage foundation  and former u s  senator from south carolina   donald trump campaigned on the promise to reverse the liberal policies of the obama administration and pursue a largely conservative agenda  and securing our borders was his signature campaign issue  while pundits focused on  the wall  and who would pay for it  his proposals were more comprehensive  for instance  people overstaying their visas account for  percent of the nation s illegal immigrant population  trump pledged to address that problem by fixing the nation s entry exit tracking system   as for refugees  president obama announced plans to admit   refugees     from the middle east and south asia regions   in fiscal year   trump s preferred plan is to establish  safe havens  in syria  he argues that this approach would safeguard ten times as many refugees as could be accommodated in this country   mark krikorian  executive director  center for immigration studies  washington   a trump administration will restart routine immigration enforcement  this is a major change from the obama policy of ignoring most non violent immigration offenders  this means more border fencing  penalizing crooked businesses and implementing a check out system for foreign visitors to prevent overstays  the main source of new illegal immigration    regarding legal immigration  refugee resettlement from the middle east is likely to be suspended  pending a bottom up review of the system  foreign worker programs will be modified so they can t be used to replace american workers  as now  and over the longer term  our legal immigration system is likely to be shifted from its emphasis on family ties to one that focuses on skills   marielena hincapie  executive director  national immigration law center  los angeles   the election of a candidate who staked his presidential bid on racist  xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric has left our country more polarized than ever  president elect trump touted draconian changes to our immigration system  which should gravely concern everyone who cares about our values of fairness and equality    many of trump s immigration proposals don t square with our constitution  our communities have successfully beaten back similar ill conceived proposals in states like arizona and alabama  and we will continue  fight   in the courtroom  if necessary   to ensure that the rights of immigrant and refugee communities are protected across the country   david bier  immigration policy analyst  cato institute  washington   donald trump promised to limit the flow of muslim refugees  current law leaves refugee admissions up to presidential discretion  and he could accomplish this on day one  compared to a religious test  barring refugees from countries with large muslim populations would be easy to enforce and  assuming no reallocation  could reduce refugee flows by  percent  this would exclude christians  however  whom he promised to save  and that could lead to pushback from congress   trump may adopt one solution to which some republicans have expressed openness  allowing americans to sponsor their refugee family members  this could help christian refugees while overcoming trump s security objections for certain muslims  since dna could verify their u s  connections and sponsors could receive thorough vetting
