healthcare system  as democrats mounted a fierce battle to thwart the bill  two house of representatives committees debated the plan late into the night  two days after the proposals were unveiled by republican leaders  the legislation aims to repeal and replace the obamacare law  which republicans call a government overreach that has ruined healthcare in the united states  trump and fellow republicans in congress campaigned last year on a promise to dismantle the signature domestic policy achievement of democratic former president barack obama   however  they face resistance from conservatives in their own party who have condemned the bill as too similar to the law it is meant to supplant  democrats  meanwhile  have denounced it as a gift to the wealthy that will take insurance away from millions of people   what they re doing is very destructive      it represents the biggest shift of money to the wealthiest people in our country  the top  percent  at the cost of working families   house democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters  doctors and other providers said the bill would probably cause many patients to lose insurance and raise healthcare costs  the american medical association urged senior lawmakers in a letter to reconsider drastic changes to medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor  the ama  which supported obamacare  said the replacement of income based subsidies with age based tax credits to help people buy insurance would make coverage more expensive  if not out of reach  for poor and sick americans   obamacare  formally called the affordable care act  enabled  million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage  about half through a medicaid expansion the new bill would end  insurers are worried about the affordability of the tax structure and proposed major changes in medicaid financing  in a letter to congress  america s health insurance plans  which represents anthem inc and others  indicated that was still a concern  despite many aspects of the draft that would help stabilize the individual insurance market  seven hospital groups  including the american hospital association  america s essential hospitals and the catholic health association of the united states  also voiced opposition  they wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the proposal could lead to  tremendous instability  for people seeking affordable medical coverage  including children  the elderly and disabled  republicans control both chambers of congress and the white house for the first time in a decade  but the bill s fate is far from certain  with a number of republican conservatives saying it is not a full repeal and sets up new entitlement programs  trump and vice president mike pence met leaders of conservative groups who have concerns about the bill   i m encouraged that the president indicated they are pushing to make changes   david mcintosh from one of those groups  club for growth  told reporters after the meeting  a white house official said trump and pence were  open to constructive improvements that maintain the core principles and get the bill over the goal   the house ways and means committee  with jurisdiction over taxes  and the house energy and commerce committee  which oversees health issues  kicked off what could become marathon sessions working on the legislation  the plan would scrap the obamacare requirement that most americans obtain medical insurance and would replace its income based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to coax people to buy private insurance on the open market  trying to mollify skeptics in his party  house speaker paul ryan  an architect of the plan  touted it as  a conservative wish list  and  monumental  exciting conservative reform   representative mark walker  head of the republican study committee  rsc   the largest group of conservatives in congress  said rsc leaders might support the bill if two changes are made  the first  proposed by representative joe barton in the energy and commerce committee  would bring forward the end of enrollment in medicaid expansion by two years to january   the second would make age based tax credits for purchasing health insurance partially rather than fully refundable  with those changes   we d be a hard  yes    walker told reporters  democrats were using every procedural maneuver possible to delay the committee work  including demanding votes to adjourn on the house floor  the top energy and commerce committee democrat  representative frank pallone  called the republican plan  a prescription for disaster  and said not a single hearing had been held to develop the bill  republicans insisted on committee action even though the nonpartisan congressional budget office  cbo  had not yet done its customary assessment of the cost of the measure and how many people it would cover   white house spokesman sean spicer said   if you re looking at the cbo for accuracy  you re looking in the wrong place   ways and means democrats raised questions over the bill s proposed tax break for insurance company executives  with representative lloyd doggett calling it a    million windfall  for insurance company executives  hospital stocks clawed back some of tuesday s losses after the bill s unveiling  community health systems inc rose   percent and tenet
