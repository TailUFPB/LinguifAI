washington  reuters    president elect donald trump accepts the u s  intelligence community s conclusion that russia engaged in cyber attacks during the u s  presidential election and may take action in response  his incoming chief of staff said on sunday  reince priebus said trump believed russia was behind the intrusions into the democratic party organizations  although priebus did not clarify whether the president elect agreed that the hacks were directed by russian president vladimir putin    he accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in russia  so that s not the issue   priebus said on  fox news sunday   it was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the republican president elect s team that trump had accepted that russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of democratic emails during the  presidential election   trump had rebuffed allegations that russia was behind the hacks or was trying to help him win  saying the intrusions could have been carried out by china or a  pound hacker on his bed  with less than two weeks until his jan   inauguration  trump has come under increasing pressure from fellow republicans to accept intelligence community findings on russian hacking and other attempts by moscow to influence the nov   election  a crucial test of republican support for trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks   a u s  intelligence report last week said putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and support trump  the report  commissioned by democratic president barack obama in december  concluded vote tallies were not affected by russian interference  but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the vote in other ways  after receiving a briefing on friday from leaders of the u s  intelligence agencies  trump did not refer specifically to russia s role in the presidential campaign  in a statement  he acknowledged that  russia  china  other countries  outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions  businesses and organizations including the democrat ic  national committee   trump spokesman sean spicer told reuters the president elect s conclusions remained the same and that priebus  comments were in line with friday s statement  priebus  wording did not appear to foreshadow the dramatic reversal of trump s apparent russia policy that experts say would be required to deter further cyber attacks   it will take a lot more than what we heard on television today to make putin cool it   the expert added   in fact  there may not be anything that can deter putin from pursuing a course he s bet his future and russia s on   said a u s  intelligence expert on russia  speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic political positions  the expert added that putin s  multifaceted campaign of cyber attacks and espionage  propaganda  financial leverage  fake news and traditional espionage  had expanded in the united states since the election   and it will be a shock if it does not escalate in france  germany and elsewhere this year   priebus  the former republican national committee chairman trump tapped as white house chief of staff  said trump planned to order the intelligence community to make recommendations as to what should be done   action may be taken   he said  adding there was nothing wrong with trying to have a good relationship with russia and other countries  two senior republican senators urged trump to punish russia in response to u s  intelligence agencies  conclusion that putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the election  appearing on nbc s  meet the press   senators lindsey graham and john mccain said evidence was conclusive that putin sought to influence the election   a point that trump has refuted   in a couple weeks  donald trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy   graham said   you should let everybody know in america  republicans and democrats  that you re going to make russia pay a price for trying to interfere   on saturday  trump wrote on twitter that having a better relationship with russia was a  good thing   u s  representative devin nunes  the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee  said three u s  presidents had tried and failed to be friends with putin   i m just not sure it s possible   nunes said on the  fox news sunday  program   i ve cautioned his administration to be careful with putin  as he remains a bad actor   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell agreed it was not unusual for a new president to want to get along with the russians  he added on cbs  however  that the russians remained a  big adversary  and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election   obama  who himself tried to  reset  relations with russia after he took office in   told nbc he did not think he had underestimated the russian president   but i think that i underestimated the degree to which  in this new information age  it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies  our open systems  to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that i think are accelerating   he said in an interview with  meet the press  broadcast on sunday
