berlin  reuters    britain s nigel farage will be at the republican convention in cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his brexit campaign  so will geert wilders  leader of the dutch freedom party  who sees donald trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an  islamization  of the west  but some mainstream european conservatives who have traveled to previous republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a trump presidency and are boycotting this year s spectacle  which runs from july    many of the center right politicians making the trip from europe admit to secretly rooting for trump s democratic rival hillary clinton  they are going not to support trump  they say  but to witness  the donald  in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest  most unpredictable republican conventions in decades   we will see whether trump can reinvent himself at the convention   guenter krings  a senior lawmaker from german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives who will make the trip with just one other bundestag colleague  told reuters   one can only hope so  but i have my doubts   politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the republican and democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers  pollsters and foreign policy experts  they also spend time in the main convention hall  this year  nearly  politicians from center right parties outside the united states are expected  roughly half of them from europe   trump s candidacy has presented european parties with traditional links to u s  republicans with a dilemma  many view his positions   on issues like immigration  security  trade and the divisive brexit question   as closer to those of upstart far right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain  four years ago  when mitt romney was the republican candidate  the center right european people s party  epp   the largest grouping in the european parliament  sent a delegation of eight members to tampa  this year there will be no epp delegation because no one from the group expressed an interest in attending  despite the wariness  there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin skinned trump too openly  in part out of fear he could win the election in november and punish his foreign critics  as he threatened to do when david cameron  the recently departed british prime minister  slammed trump s proposal for a temporary u s  ban on muslims as  divisive  stupid and wrong   while the conservative mainstream is leery  europe s array of nationalist  anti immigration parties seem fascinated by trump  even if some are uneasy about embracing the new york real estate businessman  who has vowed to  make america great again   a spokesman for britain s ukip party in brussels confirmed that farage would attend to  give them some lessons  on brexit  and wilders told reuters that he would be in cleveland and wanted to meet trump there   i hope donald trump becomes america s next president   wilders said   such a victory would be good for europe  america and europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and islam   austria s far right freedom party  france s national front and the alternative for germany  afd  are not planning to send anyone to cleveland  the parties said   we are neutral   freedom party leader heinz christian strache told reuters when asked if he supported trump   he defends american interests  he is saying some things that need to be said  also absent will be italy s northern league  whose leader matteo salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual  salvini traveled to pennsylvania in april to attend a trump rally  he was photographed shaking hands with the republican candidate and his party said trump had endorsed salvini to become italian prime minister  but a month later  trump denied in an interview ever having met salvini and said he had no interest in doing so  eirik moen of the international democrat union  which coordinates trips to the convention by center right politicians across the world  said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like britain  spain and australia are in the midst of political transitions  making it difficult for some to travel  still  eight british conservatives who sit in the european parliament are expected to be in cleveland  on the continent  france s main center right party  les republicains  is not sending a delegation  and the contingent from merkel s christian democrats  cdu  is unusually small  in germany  political debate is conducted in a sober  reserved manner and personal attacks are rare  even during election campaigns  hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the u s  race  trump has dismissed merkel as  insane  for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country  and his idea to build a wall along the mexican border elicits shudders in berlin  a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the  anniversary of its fall a day after u s  voters cast their ballots on nov     many of donald trump s positions   for example his stance toward muslims  toward immigration from mexico and gun ownership   are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in germany   said juergen hardt  a cdu lawmaker who also acts as the government s coordinator for transatlantic relations  hardt said he is planning to go on vacation with his family next week and won t be able to attend the convention
