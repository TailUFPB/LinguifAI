washington  reuters    russian president vladimir putin ordered an effort to help republican donald trump s electoral chances by discrediting democrat hillary clinton in the  presidential campaign  u s  intelligence agencies said in an assessment  russia s objectives were to undermine public faith in the u s  democratic process  denigrate former secretary of state clinton  make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did  an unclassified report released on friday by the top u s  intelligence agency said   we assess russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in  aimed at the u s  presidential election   the report said   we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for president elect trump  we have high confidence in these judgments   russian authorities  which have previously denied interfering in the u s  elections  offered no immediate comment on the report on saturday  and the reaction of the country s media was low key   the report  although it omitted classified details  was the u s  government s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented russian campaign to manipulate the american body politic  reports of russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled washington  even as the u s  congress on friday certified trump s victory in the electoral college  clinton won the popular vote by nearly  million ballots  the report s conclusions  though lacking details of how the russians may have relayed the material to wikileaks and others  will give ammunition to democrats and trump s fellow republicans in congress who want tougher action against russia  setting the scene for a potential showdown with trump  it could also give a boost to members of congress seeking an independent  bipartisan investigation of russian hacking  trump  who has developed a rocky relationship with u s  spy agencies and at times disparaged their work  defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two hour briefing friday on the report  the report neither assessed  the impact russian activities had on the outcome of the  election  nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions  a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what moscow may have done  in moscow  state tv channel one briefly covered the report  focusing on trump s comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election  the broadcaster  which led its news program on orthodox christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the russian capital  also said the arguments used in the u s  report had been widely mocked by internet users  the report said u s  intelligence agencies believe russian military intelligence  the gru  used intermediaries such as wikileaks  dcleaks com and the guccifer    persona  to release emails that it had acquired from the democratic national committee  dnc  and top democrats as part of the effort  the release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for clinton and triggered the resignation of the dnc s chief  wikileaks founder julian assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the dnc and top clinton aide john podesta from  a state party   however  assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party  russian actors were not found to have targeted u s  systems that are involved in tallying votes  the report said  the report was produced by the central intelligence agency  the federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency  also on friday  the u s  department of homeland security  designated u s  election infrastructure as critical infrastructure  widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks  while the report found russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the democratic and the republican parties  it made clear that the primary aims were to harm clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time   when it appeared to moscow that secretary clinton was likely to win the election  the russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency   it said   we also assess putin and the russian government aspired to help president elect trump s election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him   it said  the cia and fbi had high confidence in this judgment and nsa moderate confidence  the report said  neither the russian embassy in washington  nor clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment  the report suggested putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward clinton   putin most likely wanted to discredit secretary clinton because he has publicly blamed her since  for inciting mass protests against his regime in late  and early   and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him   it said  in a statement after his intelligence briefing  trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies  belief russia carried out the hacking  instead  he said   russia  china  other countries  outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions  businesses and organizations  including the dnc   there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines   trump said  the businessman  who is to be inaugurated as president on jan    also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within  days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret  the report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself  including the means by which russian military intelligence  relayed  the materials filched from the dnc and other hacking targets to wikileaks and others  omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house permanent select committee on intelligence who was briefed on the report on friday  took issue with trump s comments   the president elect s statement that the russian hacking had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election  is not supported by the briefing  report  or common sense   schiff said   it is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying   which is true   it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to     clinton that was made possible by russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns   he said   the consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the president elect and damaging to the clinton campaign  just as the russians intended   senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr  a north carolina republican  said his panel would continue to compile  facts surrounding russia s active measures   adding   this is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story
