washington new york  reuters    one immediate consequence of donald trump s stunning victory in the u s  presidential race is that the identity crisis that convulsed the republican party during his tumultuous candidacy has been resolved  it s trump s party now  for better or worse  although having never before held public office  the businessman and former reality tv star vanquished  other republican candidates to win the nomination and go on to defeat democrat hillary clinton  but established republicans challenged his commitment to party tenets and organized against him  trump s political ascent encountered fierce opposition from some in the party s establishment wing that includes former florida governor jeb bush and ohio governor john kasich and from others in its social conservative faction  such as u s  senator ted cruz of texas  all of them criticized trump at times for straying from orthodox republican positions on such issues as trade  his temperament or his lack of governing experience  but on wednesday  all of that seemed forgotten and forgiven  at least for the moment  as trump  the surprise winner in a  month long election campaign  prepared to take power with the backing of republican majorities in both chambers of congress and the promise of an aggressive conservative agenda    the american people have spoken and it s time to come together   kasich tweeted on wednesday after he scrapped plans for a speech in washington later this week that was intended to pave a new direction for the party after an expected trump loss   bush said he would  pray  for trump  cruz termed trump s win  an amazing victory for the american worker   paul ryan  speaker of the u s  house of representatives who had drawn the ire of trump supporters by refusing to campaign for him  praised trump on wednesday and said that voters had delivered trump a  mandate  to pursue his agenda  having won the electoral vote that counts while clinton likely won the popular vote   had trump lost  both ryan and reince priebus  chairman of the republican national committee  were expected to face challenges to their jobs  now  having protected his house majority  ryan will be trump s top legislative ally   if  as many expect  priebus is tapped by trump to join his administration  trump will be able to replace him with a hand picked successor  thus cementing his grip on the party s apparatus   republican donors who did not support trump  too  were coming around    nothing unifies like these decisive wins  and nothing unifies like the power of having the house  the senate and the white house   said an adviser to a leading donor  representative chris collins  who was an early trump supporter  said without the opposition of president barack obama  a democrat  many divisions within the republican party would dissipate    the big difference is we now have complete republican control   collins told reuters   we re all on the same page give or take  percent  which is nuances more than anything   trump adopted much of the  better way  domestic policy agenda ryan has painstakingly put together in over the last few years  notably revising his tax plan to bring it roughly in line with house republicans  proposal after initially floating much more drastic reform  trump this year proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate to  percent from its current   percent  he had initially said he would drop that rate down to  percent but revised his proposal after tax experts said it would balloon government deficits  while trump has offered a bare bones outline of his replacement plan for obama s signature national healthcare law known as obamacare  advisers told reuters he would draw heavily on the house version  at a news conference on wednesday  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vowed that congress under trump would move quickly to repeal obamacare  it remains to be seen whether house republicans view trump s mandate as extending to other  prominent campaign promises  trump staked much of his candidacy on opposing major trade deals  while republicans have generally favored free trade  trump promised repeatedly not to touch medicare and social security federal retirement benefits  asserting that clinton would slash those programs even though she had not proposed to do so  most mainstream republicans believe revamping medicare and social security is critical to curbing federal spending  trump vowed to repeal the dodd frank financial reform law  during the campaign he met with house financial services chairman jeb hensarling but never endorsed hensarling s proposed bank regulation legislation and instead called for a return to the  glass steagall law separating commercial and investment banking   representative warren davidson  a member of the ultra conservative freedom caucus in the house  said he thought congress could get some early wins on areas of agreement with trump that included replacing obamacare and finding a way to repatriate corporate profits held overseas and using the money to pay for infrastructure repairs   richard hunt  head of the consumer bankers association  which lobbies for some of the biggest u s  banks  said republicans must act swiftly to show that as change agents they can actually govern   they have to show the american people that republicans are able and capable of governing  obviously there was a clear mandate last night that says washington is not working and people want washington to work   he said   part of me says you need to have a clean slate  okay  that was the campaign  now this is governing
