 reuters    in the hours after a gunman shot  police officers  killing five in dallas  republican presidential candidate donald trump and his democratic rival hillary clinton abruptly canceled campaign events  their twitter accounts largely went quiet  the shootings marked yet another convulsive event in the  political season  one in which clinton and trump have scrambled to find the right response to terror attacks abroad  mass shootings at home  and protests over police killings of african americans  much of the violence  captured live on smartphones and endlessly replayed on cable television news  has fueled americans  fears about their personal safety  polls show  it has  evoked memories of   when civil rights leader martin luther king and democratic presidential candidate robert kennedy were assassinated in a turbulent era of protests against the vietnam war and racial segregation   we re seeing wild acts of gun violence and we are polarized in our politics and in the public square   said historian douglas brinkley   every  hours there seems to be some horrific event that jars and jerks our consciousness into a new dimension   historically  uncertain times tend to push the party out of power  witness republican ronald reagan s defeat of incumbent democrat jimmy carter in  during the iran hostage crisis  or obama s victory over republican john mccain in  as the u s  economy collapsed  but that may not be the case for trump  who has yet to convince a majority of americans that his would be a steady hand at the tiller  trump s initial reaction to dallas suggested he understands the stakes  he issued a sober statement of unity that was unlike many of his public utterances that are often derided by critics as hyperbolic or inflammatory   our nation has become too divided  too many americans feel like they ve lost hope  crime is harming too many citizens  racial tensions have gotten worse  not better  this isn t the american dream we all want for our children   he said   this is a time  perhaps more than ever  for strong leadership  love and compassion  we will pull through these tragedies     with race relations becoming a more prominent issue in the white house race  former house speaker newt gingrich  a top contender to be trump s vice presidential running mate  told fox news that trump and his no   can help broaden their appeal by going to inner cities  where many african americans live in responding to the spasm of gun violence  clinton has called for more regulations on the gun industry and has aligned herself with the black lives matter movement  which campaigns against violence against african americans  in a round of tv appearances  clinton said she had been working her whole life to try to bridge the racial divide  her comments follow the police shooting of two black men in two separate incidents in louisiana and minnesota over the past week  the dallas gunman told police he was angry about the killings   i will call for white people  like myself  to put ourselves in the shoes of those african american families     who fear every time their children go somewhere  i m going to be talking about white people   clinton said on cnn  democratic strategist bud jackson said she is hitting the right tone   i don t think this is an issue that she needs to take advantage of   he said   in fact it would probably hurt her if she is perceived as taking advantage of it    but the demand for change is sweeping among voters  according to a reuters ipsos poll taken over the last five weeks  nearly two thirds of americans feel the country is on the wrong track  reflecting their general unease with the economy  terror threats and violence   her challenge is to show she can cope with these issues and that she would bring change and would not be the same   said presidential historian thomas alan schwartz  trump has said a clinton win in the nov   election would amount to a third term for president barack obama  clinton has embraced many of the policies of her former rival in the  presidential election and campaigned with him this week  lanhee chen  who advised  republican nominee mitt romney and  presidential candidate marco rubio  said a more civil discourse in american politics would help to calm people s general fears    i think there s bigger issue around civility and rhetoric and discourse and how our leaders appeal or don t appeal to our better angels  that s really what this is about  i see this as an absence of leadership all around
