washington  reuters    billionaire wilbur ross  chosen by donald trump to help implement the president elect s trade agenda  earned his fortune in part by running businesses that have offshored thousands of u s  jobs  according to labor department data attained by reuters  as a high stakes investor a decade ago  ross specialized in turning around troubled manufacturing companies at a time when the u s  economy was losing more than   jobs yearly due to global trade  a senate confirmation hearing on his nomination to become commerce secretary is set for wednesday  supporters say ross saved thousands of u s  jobs by rescuing firms from failure  data attained by reuters through a freedom of information act request shows that rescue effort came at a price  textile  finance and auto parts companies controlled by the private equity titan eliminated about   u s  positions since  because they shipped production to other countries  according to a labor department program that assists workers who lose their jobs due to global trade    the figures  which have not previously been disclosed  amount to a small fraction of the u s  economy  which sees employment fluctuate by the tens of thousands of jobs each month  but ross s track record clashes with trump s promise to protect american workers from the ravages of global trade   recently  trump claimed credit for saving  jobs at a carrier corp  factory in indiana  even touring the plant to shake hands with employees  he has targeted ford motor co  f n  and other automakers to keep hundreds of jobs inside the u s  borders   that disconnect could draw attention at his hearing  one of many scheduled this week for cabinet nominees ahead of trump s jan   inauguration   he is not the man to be protecting american workers when he s shipping this stuff overseas himself   said don coy  who lost his job at the end of  when a company ross created   international automotive components group   closed a factory in canton  ohio and shifted production of rubber floor mats to mexico  eliminating the final  jobs in a factory that once employed  workers  ross resigned from the iac board of directors in november  and was named chairman emeritus  ross did not respond to several requests for comment  his offshoring activities are not unusual in an era when globalization has lowered international trade barriers  auto parts maker delphi corp   for example  has offshored   u s  jobs since   while textile makers have offshored at least   jobs since then  the labor department said  as iac shuttered its canton plant in the final months of   ross argued on behalf of trump that free trade agreements hurt the united states    when ford offshores new production facilities to mexico  that both boosts the mexican economy and reduces investment in this country   he wrote in september in a washington post opinion piece penned with peter navarro  another trump economic adviser who has been tapped to direct a white house trade council   in a bid to reverse offshoring  trump has threatened to impose  a big border tax  on automakers that choose to build cars in mexico rather than the united states and has talked of resetting free trade deals such as the north american free trade agreement  nafta   a trump transition spokesperson said personnel decisions at ross s auto parts and textile companies were driven by the need to put operations near customers and keep u s  plants competitive  echoing arguments made by other auto industry executives who face pressure from trump    few people have done as much to defend american jobs and negotiate good deals for american workers as wilbur ross   said the spokesperson  who asked not to be named  the offshoring figures for ross s companies came from the labor department s trade adjustment assistance  taa  program  which provides retraining benefits to some workers who lose their jobs due to outsourcing or cheap imports  the program does not cover everybody who is hurt by global trade  service sector workers were not eligible until   and those who don t apply for the program don t show up in its records   only   million factory workers qualified for taa benefits between  and   a time when the united states shed  million manufacturing jobs   despite trump s campaign rhetoric about countries like mexico and china taking u s  jobs  the taa figures show globalization has claimed fewer jobs in recent years  the program covered roughly   workers last year  down from about   in    ross amassed a fortune  estimated by forbes magazine at    billion  by buying up companies in struggling industries and returning them to profitability  labor leaders such as united steelworkers president leo gerard have said that ross over the years saved thousands of manufacturing jobs  in one case  ross bought two struggling north carolina fabric makers out of bankruptcy to create international textile group  itg  in   as textile import quotas were being phased out  between  and   the company laid off   u s  workers as it set up operations in mexico  china and nicaragua  taa records show  itg ceo ken kunenberger told reuters that those job reductions were primarily due to competition from cheap imports  itg now operates six u s  plants  down from nine in   according to its annual reports  ross sold the company in october for an undisclosed sum  ross also created international automotive components group in  to buy up auto parts makers around the world as the industry struggled with overcapacity and slowing sales  taa filings show iac eliminated  u s  jobs because it shifted work from the united states to mexico    we tried every trick in the book to get them to stay but they just weren t interested   said tim scott  who served on the city council in carlisle  pennsylvania when iac decided to close its plant there in   shifting work to mexico and tennessee   an iac spokesperson said the company has expanded in mexico to be near the automakers that buy its parts  a common business strategy in the sector  iac has expanded its workforce in mexico and canada by  percent to   since   and by  percent in the united states to   over the same period  spokesman david ladd said   in another venture  ross combined several mortgage lenders into homeward residential holdings inc  in   just as the housing market was collapsing   homeward laid off  employees in florida and texas and shifted their work to india in   according to taa filings  that was a sizeable portion of the company s global workforce  which it pegged at   a few months after the layoffs were announced   ross sold homeward in october  for   million  which delivered a further return on top of   million in profits the company had already generated    homeward has been profitable in each year of its existence   he said in a press release
