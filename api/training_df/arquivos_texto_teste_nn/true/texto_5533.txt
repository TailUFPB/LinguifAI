 washington  reuters    president donald trump s  wall  along the u s  mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as    billion  and take more than three years to construct  based on a u s  department of homeland security internal report seen by reuters on thursday   the report s estimated price tag is much higher than a   billion figure cited by trump in his campaign and estimates as high as   billion from republican house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   more top news  twitter numbers paint grim profitability picture trump changes tack  backs  one china  policy in call with xi the report is expected to be presented to department of homeland security  dhs  secretary john kelly in coming days  although the administration will not necessarily take actions it recommends   the plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over   miles    km  by the end of    with  miles    km  of the border already fortified  the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border   many cost estimates and timelines have been floated since trump campaigned on the promise of building a wall  the report seen by reuters is the work of a group commissioned by kelly as a final step before moving forward with requesting u s  taxpayer funds from congress and getting started on construction   a dhs spokeswoman said the department does  not comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre decisional  deliberative documents    a white house spokeswoman said it would be  premature  to comment on a report that has not officially been presented to the president   don t miss  japan s love of tiny cars sore spot as for trump exclusive  in call with putin  trump denounced obama era nuclear arms treaty the report said the first phase would be the smallest  targeting sections covering  miles   km  near san diego  california  el paso  texas  and in texas s rio grande valley   the report assumes dhs would get funding from congress by april or may  giving the department sufficient time to secure contractors and begin construction by september  trump has said congress should fund the wall upfront  but that mexico will reimburse u s  taxpayers  mexico has said it will not pay   several u s  congressional delegations are visiting the border this month to assess funding needs  according to several people familiar with the travel plans   the report shows the u s  government has begun seeking waivers to address environmental laws on building in some areas  it also shows the government has begun working with existing contractors and planning steel purchases for the project   trump told law enforcement officials on wednesday   the wall is getting designed right now    the report accounted for the time and cost of acquiring private land  one reason for its steep price increase compared to estimates from trump and members of congress   bernstein research  an investment research group that tracks material costs  has said that uncertainties around the project could drive its cost up to as much as   billion   the second phase of construction proposed in the report would cover  miles   km  of border in and around the rio grande valley  laredo  texas  tucson  arizona  el paso  texas and big bend  texas  the third phase would cover an unspecified   miles    km   essentially sealing off the entire u s  mexico border   the report lays out costs to cover the border with barriers  but funding constraints and legal battles are likely to place limits on those plans   it also does not account for major physical barriers  like mountains  in areas where it would not be feasible to build   a source familiar with the plans said dhs may have to go to court to seek eminent domain in order to acquire some of the private land needed to cover the final and most ambitious phase   the first phase  estimated to cost only   million  could be a relatively easy way for trump to satisfy supporters eager to see him make good on his campaign promises to limit illegal migration  but the rest of the construction will be markedly more expensive  covering a much larger stretch of land  much of it privately owned or inaccessible by road   in addition to seeking eminent domain and environmental waivers  the u s  government would also have to meet the requirements of the international boundary and water commission  a u s  mexico pact over shared waters  the report estimated that agreement alone could bring the cost from   million per mile to   million per mile in one area
