in mosul  the enemy is much tougher than they thought  they ve had a lot of time to get ready   trump said   it s a horrible  horrible situation that s going on  why did we have to tell them we re going in    the operation could last weeks  or even months  islamic state mounted counterattacks on monday across the country against the iraqi army and kurdish forces  trying to deflect attention away from the mosul campaign  trump suggested last week during the final  presidential debate that the u s  backed attack on mosul was orchestrated to help clinton in her white house bid   with just over two weeks to go until the election  clinton  president barack obama s first term secretary of state  leads the new york businessman in national opinion polls  both candidates have been focusing on a small set of political swing states that could decide the contest  seeking to cement a wide advantage she holds with women voters  clinton enlisted the help of firebrand u s  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  who blasted trump over allegations he tried to grope or kiss several women without their consent over a  year span    he thinks that because he has a mouthful of tic tacs that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance   warren told a raucous crowd of   at st  anselm college in manchester   well  i ve got news for you  donald trump  women have had it with guys like you   at least  women have said trump made unwanted sexual advances  including groping or kissing  in incidents from the early  to   according to reports in various news outlets  trump has

that quickly caught fire on social media  sparking hashtags and t shirts   get this  donald  nasty women are tough   warren said   nasty women are smart  and nasty women vote  and on nov   we nasty women are gonna march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever   clinton praised warren for taking the fight to trump   she gets under his  trump s  thin skin like nobody else   the candidate said  warren is one of a handful of high profile surrogate campaigners helping clinton in the final weeks of the race  in california  obama raised money for his former top diplomat and joked on the  jimmy kimmel live  show that he laughed most of the time when he saw trump on television  trump spent the day campaigning in florida  a critical swing state  at an event in tampa  he criticized clinton s position on syria   if you look at her plans for syria  these are the plans of a child  these are the plans of someone who doesn t know what they re doing   he said  at an earlier event for farmers in boynton beach  trump disputed multiple national and state polls that show him lagging clinton and accused the media of distorting poll results to discourage his supporters from voting    i believe we re actually winning   trump said   just the day before  trump s campaign manager  kellyanne conway  acknowledged that the candidate was trailing in the race  saying in a tv interview   we are behind   the former first lady is working to turn out her supporters in states such as ohio  where singer jay z plans to hold a concert in support of her candidacy  the clinton campaign said   according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project  which surveys the vote in battleground states  clinton leads trump in most of the states that trump would need to win to have a chance of amassing the  electoral college votes needed to capture the white house   according to the survey  she had a better than  percent chance of winning  had the election been held last week  the mostly likely outcome would be  votes for clinton to  for trump  the electoral college votes represent a tally of wins from the states
