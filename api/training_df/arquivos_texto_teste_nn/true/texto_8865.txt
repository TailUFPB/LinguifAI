washington  reuters    the fbi recommended on tuesday that no criminal charges be filed over hillary clinton s use of private email servers while she was secretary of state  but rebuked the democratic u s  presidential candidate for  extremely careless  handling of classified information  while fbi director james comey s announcement lifted a cloud of uncertainty that had loomed over clinton s white house campaign  his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her over the email issue by donald trump  her likely republican opponent in the nov   election  comey s comments are likely to reinforce what polls show are widespread public concerns about clinton s honesty and trustworthiness  republicans have pointed to the controversy as evidence that she considered herself above the law  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the highest  ranking elected u s  republican  said in a statement that comey s announcement  defies explanation   ryan called on the fbi to release all of its findings in the case and said comey would be called to testify before the house oversight committee   we need to know more   ryan told fox news   in a lengthy statement on the federal bureau of investigation s conclusions from its yearlong investigation  comey directly contradicted statements clinton has made while defending her use of the private email setup  he said  for example  that the fbi found at least  emails that contained classified information when they were sent   although clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private servers   although we did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information  there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information   comey said  but he said the fbi concluded  no reasonable prosecutor  would bring charges   although the department of justice makes final decisions on matters like this  we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case   comey told reporters in washington  his recommendation will likely stand  the country s top prosecutor  u s  attorney general loretta lynch  said on friday she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the fbi director on whether to charge clinton for mishandling emails  clinton s campaign was anxious to move on after comey s announcement  saying in a statement it was pleased with the fbi decision   as the secretary has long said  it was a mistake to use her personal email  and she would not do it again  we are glad that this matter is now resolved   spokesman brian fallon said  he did not respond to questions about comey s rebuttal of the main arguments clinton has offered in defense of her use of private email  at a rally in raleigh  north carolina  on tuesday night  trump  the presumptive republican nominee  said the controversy should disqualify clinton from being president and that her email system may well have been hacked by u s  enemies   our enemies may have a blackmail file on crooked hillary and this alone means that she should not be allowed to serve as president of the united states   trump said   we now know that she lied to the country when she said that she did not send classified information on her server  she lied   following comey s late morning remarks  clinton became one of the top trending topics on twitter  with about   tweets posted by  p m    gmt   the overall sentiment was more negative than positive  with about two negative tweets for every positive one  according to social media analytics firm zoomph  the fbi director s announcement came hours before clinton s first campaign appearance with president barack obama  in charlotte  north carolina  where neither obama nor clinton mentioned the email probe  it also came less than three weeks before the democratic national convention at which clinton is to be nominated as the party s candidate for the november election  the fbi has been investigating whether clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her chappaqua  new york  home while she was secretary of state from  to   one question is whether she mishandled classified information on the servers  as the investigation wound up  clinton underwent a voluntary    hour interview with the fbi on saturday in washington  comey said the fbi did not find that clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law  and that there was no  intentional misconduct  by her lawyers who sorted her emails  he said her staff should have known clinton s private email was an improper place for classified information  but added there was no evidence anyone had hacked clinton s communications  comey said  however  that  hostile actors  gained access to email accounts of people with whom clinton corresponded  regularly  he also said she used email extensively while traveling  in territory of sophisticated adversaries   experts routinely advise u s  government officials not to bring important digital information to countries with a track record of aggressive cyber activity  clinton traveled to more than  countries during her four years as top u s  diplomat  including trips to china and russia  considered among the most sophisticated u s  cyber adversaries  the fbi found  emails in  email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent  comey said  eight of those chains contained  top secret  information  the highest level of government classification for material that could harm national security  a further  email chains contained  secret  information  and eight  confidential  information  he said  agents also found three classified emails among the thousands clinton never returned to the state department  comey said there were no previous cases that supported filing criminal charges against clinton  other cases had involved intentional mishandling of information  he said  last year  the fbi recommended that former cia director david petraeus be charged with a felony for his mishandling of classified information with his biographer  with whom he was having an affair   in that case  however  the fbi had evidence that petraeus knew the information was highly classified  petraeus eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information  republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of clinton  saying they do not trust the justice department to handle the inquiry with impartiality  republican criticism of the process heated up after clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  met privately with lynch in phoenix last week  lynch  who was appointed by obama  said later she regretted the meeting and that she and the former president did not discuss the investigation
