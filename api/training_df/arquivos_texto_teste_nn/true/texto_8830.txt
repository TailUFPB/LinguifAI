warsaw  poland  reuters    president barack obama on friday made an impassioned plea for the nation to do more to address the combative relationship between local police forces and the black and hispanic communities they serve  after the shootings of two black men by police in minnesota and louisiana in two days   when incidents like this occur  there s a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same   obama said shortly after landing early friday morning in warsaw  poland  for a nato summit   and that should trouble all of us  this is not just a black issue  it s not just a hispanic issue  this is an american issue that we should all care about   he said  the deaths of philando castile at a traffic stop in falcon heights  minnesota  and alton sterling outside a convenience store in baton rouge  louisiana  were the latest in a string of shootings that have led to calls for a revamp in the way police interact with the black community  citing statistics that show that blacks are more likely to be killed by police officers and receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts  obama said it is  incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this   a white house task force on better policing tactics issued recommendations last year on how to improve community relations with law enforcement  obama encouraged local police forces to adopt the practices outlined by the task force  saying that less distrust of police would help to keep officers safe and lead to less deadly shootings by authorities  critics of the push to reform local police tactics have charged that obama has not shown enough concern about police officers who are shot in the line of duty  obama repeatedly stressed that he believes that most police officers do their jobs without bias and that addressing complaints about police brutality would not undermine law enforcement   when people say black lives matter  that doesn t mean blue lives don t matter  it just means that all lives matter  but right now the big concern is the fact that data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of attacks   he said  earlier on thursday  obama issued a facebook post urging the nation to address the  appearance or reality of racial bias  in policing
