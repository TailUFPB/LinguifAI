washington  reuters    a divided u s  supreme court struggled on wednesday with how to resolve a dispute over whether immigrants detained by the u s  government for more than six months while deportation proceedings take place should be able to seek their release  the case takes on additional importance with the expectation that president elect donald trump will ramp up immigration enforcement  placing more people in detention awaiting deportation  when he takes office on jan    as he pledged during his election campaign  during a one hour argument  the court s four liberals appeared to support requiring that immigrants held more than six months be automatically eligible for hearings in which they could argue for their freedom while their deportation cases unfold  conservative justices were skeptical  the shorthanded court could be heading toward another   deadlock  divided along ideological lines  a   split would leave in place an october  ruling by the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals that upheld a lower court injunction requiring a hearing after six months of detention  the justices potentially could issue a narrow decision sending the case back to lower courts without resolving the question of whether hearings are required  the obama administration  which asked the justices to decide the case  has said hearings can be permitted in certain instances but opposed a blanket rule requiring them  the long running class action litigation brought by the american civil liberties union includes some immigrants who were held at the border when seeking illegal entry into the united states and others  including legal permanent residents  who have been convicted of crimes  the case also could affect long term u s  residents who entered the country illegally  liberal justices asserted that hearings should be required in order to meet the u s  constitution s promise of due process   you can t just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness  without any finding of flight risk  for an indefinite period of time  and not run into due process   said justice elena kagan  we are in an upended world if we think  months or  months is a reasonable time to detain a person   added justice sonia sotomayor  conservatives including chief justice john roberts said the court had been asked to decide only whether the immigration laws in question required the hearings and not whether there was a potential constitutional violation  the case would have to be litigated further in lower courts for that issue to reach the justices  roberts said  the lead plaintiff is alejandro rodriguez  a legal immigrant from mexico who was working as a dental assistant when he was detained for three years without a hearing  rodriguez was placed in removal proceedings based on prior convictions for drug possession and joyriding  although he was released eventually  the case brought on his behalf continued
