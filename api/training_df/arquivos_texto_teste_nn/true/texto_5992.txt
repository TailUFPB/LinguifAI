washington  reuters    the trump administration has accepted the resignations of two top state department officials effective on friday  a step entirely within the new president s rights but an abrupt departure for the diplomats  officials said on thursday  under secretary for management patrick kennedy and acting under secretary of state for arms control and international security thomas countryman both plan to leave their posts by friday  the officials said  turnover is the rule  rather than the exception  among the top officials in the u s  government when the white house changes hands from one party to another  in this case from democrat barack obama to republican donald trump  in his first week in office  trump has illustrated stark policy differences from obama on trade and immigration  on monday  trump formally withdrew the united states from the trans pacific partnership trade deal and on wednesday he ordered construction of a wall on the border with mexico and threatened to punish u s  cities shielding illegal immigrants  political appointees chosen by the president and confirmed by the senate were obliged  as usual  after trump s nov   election victory  to submit letters of resignation to give the new president the opportunity to name his own people to the jobs  kennedy and countryman were recently told their resignations had been accepted effective friday  leaving their bureaus   one of which handles the department s management and the other which oversees arms control   in the hands of more junior officials  gregory starr  assistant secretary for state for diplomatic security and michele bond  assistant secretary for consular affairs  are also leaving  officials said  though it was not clear under what circumstances or whether they were asked to step down by friday  trump s nominee for secretary of state  former exxon mobil corp chairman rex tillerson  has yet to be confirmed by the full senate  leaving the agency in the hands of number three official under secretary of state for political affairs thomas shannon  the departures were discussed at state department thursday morning meetings and caused some unease  in part because at least two of the officials had been asked to go by friday    it s not two weeks  notice   said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity  however  the department itself stressed that turnover is the norm when a new political party comes to power   of the officers whose resignations were accepted  some will continue in the foreign service in other positions and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service   acting state department spokesman mark toner said in a statement  it did not provide a detailed breakdown of whose resignations were accepted or when they were leaving  at least one media report suggested that the departures  amounted to a mass resignation  but several u s  officials said this was not the case   it s not a mass protest or a show of indignation   said one senior u s  official  a former senior obama administration official said there were no plans at the national security council for a mass resignation and that recent conversations there with trump s inner circle had been viewed as productive and encouraging  the state department departures amounted to a  huge brain drain   the former official said  adding that their collective experience would be difficult to recover  however  a current state department official rejected this view  saying that while kennedy  in particular  was seen as an institution  he could certainly be replaced   everybody is  acting  like it is a big apocalypse  he has large shoes to fill  but the culture of the state department is about change and moving around every few years   said the official   it s not like the building is going to fall apart
