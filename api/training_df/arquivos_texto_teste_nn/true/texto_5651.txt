london  reuters    formula one s new owners liberty media may have made a mistake  in ousting commercial supremo bernie ecclestone immediately after completing their takeover of the sport  according to former fia president max mosley  ecclestone    was replaced by american chase carey on jan   as chief executive of formula one and appointed  emeritus chairman    a position without a clearly defined role for the briton  liberty have  however  said they hope ecclestone will continue to offer advice to the board   if it had been me in the case of liberty  i d have kept bernie on to do the things that he s superbly good at   such as dealing with the promoters and the organizers and all that side of it   mosley told reuters  the briton  a close ally of ecclestone while running the governing body  said liberty could have concentrated on  doing the things that up to now have not been done  in formula one such as virtual reality and digital technology   but of course they bought a business and are fully entitled to come in and think they can run the whole business better and we ll just have to see what happens   added the  year old  speaking at  s annual zoom charity auction on friday night  mosley  who stood down as president of the international automobile federation in   cautioned against too much rapid change in the sport  liberty have spoken about increasing the number of grands prix  particularly in the americas  changing the weekend format and giving every round of the championship the  super bowl  treatment  carey  who has appointed former espn executive sean bratches to run the commercial side with former mercedes principal ross brawn overseeing motorsport matters  has spoken of  being like   super bowls  in a season   you ve always got to be careful  if it ain t broke don t fix it  but they are fully aware of that   said mosley   they  liberty  are serious business people  whether they can deal with everything better than they could have dealt with it using bernie for the things he s good at  and then doing the things that they know about  is an open question  we shall see   mosley agreed that liberty had plenty on their plate in the coming months and might find a few bumps in the road ahead despite their undoubted expertise   it always looks easy from the outside   he warned   it s like if i think i could go and fix horse racing  but if you actually go and try and do it  you find there are a whole mass of problems you never even knew about  but maybe they will be very successful and get the job done   with super bowl  coming up in houston on sunday  mosley was also wary of comparisons between how the national football league spectacular is presented over the course of a week and grand prix racing   i think that s easy to say  it s not quite clear to me what that means   he said of the suggestion that every race could be treated like a super bowl  with more razzamatazz and events leading up to it   but the super bowl   is that so wonderful  i don t want to be unkind  but americans always think they can do everything better than anybody else  and they re not always right as a lot of recent history shows
