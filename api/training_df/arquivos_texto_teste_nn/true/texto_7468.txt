washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump may try to improve ties with russia  tear up trade deals with mexico and pacific nations and abandon u s  allies in europe and asia if they don t spend more on their own defense   or  he may not  foreign governments are uncertain how much of trump s rhetoric will be translated into policy because he has frequently made contradictory statements and provided few details of how he would deal with the world or who he would appoint to key posts  french foreign minister jean marc ayrault pledged to work with trump but said his personality  raised questions  and he admitted to being unsure what a trump presidency would mean for key foreign policy challenges  from climate change and the west s nuclear deal with iran to the war in syria  trump  who has no foreign affairs or military experience  will confront the absence of a national or even republican political consensus on how to deal with syria  the islamic state militant group  the rise of china and a newly assertive russia   this is virtual terra incognita   said aaron david miller  a middle east negotiator who served democratic and republican presidents and is now with the woodrow wilson center for scholars in washington   the biggest danger of a trump presidency is the unpredictability and sheer lack of stability that our allies and adversaries would feel  and he turns that into a virtue by saying that he wants to be unpredictable   he said  among the names said to be in consideration for top national security jobs in a trump administration are former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and one time united nations ambassador john bolton for secretary of state  and general michael flynn  a former head of the defense intelligence agency  for national security adviser a republican foreign policy expert who has occasionally counseled trump  cautioned that he is more likely to make his own decisions and impulses than to follow the advice of his aides  many top republicans have publicly repudiated him  and a number of professional diplomats  intelligence and military officers have privately said they would retire if trump wins   if he does everything he says he s going to do  we can kiss goodbye our leadership role in the world   former cia deputy director john mclaughlin told reuters   so let s hope he doesn t mean it or that someone talks him out of it   trump has suggested he could accept japanese and south korean nuclear arms development  abandon the iran nuclear deal  negotiate with north korea on its nuclear weapons program  and embrace russian president vladimir putin  trump has adopted an open minded stance toward putin  whom many current and former u s  officials consider an autocrat bent on suppressing dissent at home while bullying his neighbors and projecting russia s power abroad  russia has annexed crimea from ukraine  backed syrian president bashar al assad and  according to u s  intelligence officials  hacked  emails of prominent democratic party leaders and organizations   i would hope to have a good relationship with russia and i would hope to have a good relationship with putin   trump told reuters in an interview last month   if we had a good relationship with russia that would be a wonderful thing   james dobbins  a former u s  diplomat now at the rand corp   said he would not be surprised to see an effort to  reset  u s  relations with russia  trump has taken a more aggressive tone toward china  threatening to slap tariffs on chinese products to show beijing the united states is  not playing games anymore  when it comes to leveling the field on trade   china s foreign ministry said on wednesday it would work with trump to ensure the steady development of bilateral ties  trump also says he could scrap the north american free trade agreement that took effect in mexico  the united states and canada in   and he has threatened to impose tariffs of up to  percent on mexican made goods to help u s  industry  trump has taken aim at the trans pacific partnership trade deal championed by president barack obama  calling it a  death blow  for american manufacturing    less conflict averse  trump has also floated the idea of abandoning nato s guarantee of mutual defense  suggesting that the united states would help defend other nato members such as the baltic states only if they had  fulfilled their obligations to us   asked in march if he would object if japan or south korea developed their own nuclear weapons  trump told the new york times there might come a time that the united states could not protect them as it has in the past and they might need to develop their own arsenals  both positions violate bedrock principles of u s  foreign policy that have stood for decades  that an attack on one nato member would be regarded as an attack on all and that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is to be avoided at all costs  jon alterman  the head of the middle east program at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington  said trump s predilection for keeping other nations guessing could itself be a source of instability   countries may feel more at risk and maybe less conflict averse if they feel they have to protect themselves   he said  robert zoellick  a former deputy secretary of state who in may signed a letter saying trump  would be the most reckless president on american history   suggested that trump s temperament could lead to unexpected outcomes   no one knows how mr  trump s vanity will respond if a foreign counterpart diminishes him   he wrote in the financial times last month
