washington  reuters    the u s  consumer financial protection bureau  already in legal limbo after an october court decision  could find its powers scaled back by president elect donald trump and a republican led congress  according to members of both political parties  lobbyists and lawyers   that may mean the end of many of the agency s rule making actions that have enraged critics  including a proposal to stop companies from blocking customers from class action lawsuits and another one to limit payday lending  creation of the cfpb was authorized in the  dodd frank wall street reform law enacted in the aftermath of the   financial crisis  the agency began operations in   an agency to protect consumers  finances was the idea of liberal democratic senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  its creation is considered one of democratic president barack obama s top domestic policy achievements  a trump administration is expected to be hostile to the agency as it is currently formulated   the election spells very bad news for the cfpb   said alan kaplinsky  head of the consumer financial services group at law firm ballard spahr   many republicans opposed the agency s creation  they now say they dislike its structure and believe it oversteps its authority in enforcement   it s a very fragile thing  it was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack   said consumer attorney deepak gupta  who worked at the cfpb in its early days   it may not survive the way we know it through this administration   a single director leads both rule making and enforcement  and can be dismissed only for cause  furthermore  the agency is funded by the u s  federal reserve system  which means it is not dependent on the typical congressional appropriations process  the republican led house of representatives financial services committee in september passed legislation without any democratic votes that would change the name and structure of the agency and would create a five member commission to govern it  republicans also have pushed for the agency to receive funds from congress to make it accountable to elected leaders  both of those proposals would greatly weaken the power of richard cordray  the agency s original and current director  obama has blocked these republican efforts with veto threats  trump  though he has not directly addressed the cfpb  has said he wants to roll back parts of dodd frank  trump could  if he wanted to  fire cordray on the first day of his presidency  especially following an october ruling by a three judge federal appeals court panel that found the agency s structure unconstitutional and that the president should be able to dismiss the director at will  that ruling was put on hold while the cfpb decides whether to petition the entire u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for a review or appeal the ruling to the u s  supreme court  the agency has until nov   to decide  trump s administration could withdraw any appeal  letting the decision stand  cordray  appointed in   is halfway through his five year term  few in the banking industry think the entire agency will be eliminated  democrats who support the agency will have a large presence in the senate  warren  who was obama s first choice to head the agency  has promised that democrats will fight efforts to defang it  even some bankers want to see it stay  richard hunt  president of the consumer bankers association  said his group would fight to maintain the cfpb in some form because it consolidates consumer banking rules under one regulator   trump takes office on jan    cordray could be replaced early in   said mark calabria  an economist at the libertarian cato institute think tank  trump s transition team is already looking into cordray replacements  he said  the law allows for the president to terminate a director over inefficiency  malfeasance or neglect of duty  which leaves room for trump to find cause regardless of what the appeals court decides  calabria added  cordray has set precedent with enforcement cases that calabria and other critics have called backdoor rule making    cordray has left the cfpb vulnerable to what his successor may want done because he didn t hardwire rule making   calabria said  if cordray quits or is removed  statute calls for his deputy to step into the job temporarily  acting deputy director david silberman  also a strong consumer advocate  would likely continue to carry out the current agenda  said quyen truong  a partner at washington law firm stroock   stroock   lavan  truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the cfpb until earlier this year  the cfpb did not respond to requests for comment on cordray s possible departure or the fate of current rule making actions
