washington moscow  reuters    russian president vladimir putin and u s  president donald trump are likely to discuss the sanctions that washington imposed on russia over the conflict in ukraine when the two leaders speak by telephone on saturday  a senior white house aide said  trump has said in the past that  as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with russia  he is prepared to review sanctions that his predecessor  barack obama  imposed on russia over its  annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula  that move would face resistance from both influential figures in washington and foreign leaders who believe sanctions should only be eased if moscow complies with the west s conditions on ukraine  among the u s  sanctions causing the most pain to russia are those targeting its financial services  limiting the russian economy s ability to raise debt  and its energy companies   on the same day he speaks to putin  trump will have telephone conversation with german chancellor angela merkel and french president francois hollande  white house spokesman sean spicer wrote in a tweet  both hollande and merkel have argued that it is premature to ease the sanctions  trump senior aide kellyanne conway said in u s  television interviews on friday that trump and putin would likely discuss a range of issues  including joint efforts to combat terrorism   asked on fox news s  fox   friends  program to comment on suggestions that the obama administration sanctions would be on the agenda  conway said   all of that is under consideration   the call will be the first between the russian and u s  leaders since putin called trump to congratulate him on his election victory in november   it is a first step towards what trump has billed as a normalization of relations after three years of tensions sparked by the conflict in ukraine  trump and putin have never met and it was unclear how their very different personalities would gel  trump is a flamboyant real estate deal maker who often acts on gut instinct  while putin is a former soviet spy who calculates each step methodically  both have spoken about ending the enmity that has dragged u s  russia relations to their lowest ebb since the cold war       wouldn t it be nice if we actually got along with people  wouldn t it be nice if we actually got along  as an example  with russia  i am all for it   trump told a news conference in july last year  trump is under intense scrutiny at home from critics who say he was elected with help from russian intelligence   an allegation he denies   and that he is too ready to cut deals with a country that many of his own officials say is a threat to u s  security  putin s spokesman dmitry peskov  said the russian leader would use the call to congratulate trump on taking office and to exchange views on u s  russian ties  asked by reporters if ukraine would come up  peskov said   this is the first telephone contact since president trump took office  so one should hardly expect that  it    will involve substantive discussions across the whole range of issues    we ll see  let s be patient   if putin and trump can establish a rapport  it could pave the way for deals on ukraine and syria  two sources of friction during the administration of barack obama  for the russian leader  there is much to gain  putin is expected to run for re election next year  but is hampered by a sluggish economy  a softening or removal of sanctions would allow western investment and credit to flow in  lifting growth and strengthening putin s election prospects  any move by trump to ease sanctions would create a dilemma for the european union  which has its own set of sanctions against russia linked to the ukraine crisis  some governments in europe are sympathetic with trump s stance and keen for relief from sanctions that are hurting trade with russia  others in the bloc believe moscow has not met the conditions for the sanctions to be lifted  merkel  who faces a re election battle  has invested considerable political capital in keeping the eu aligned behind the sanctions  a german diplomat told reuters last month   if trump lifts the sanctions  i fear the consensus in europe would crumble   merkel and french president francois hollande met in berlin on friday  underlining the challenges for european unity in the face of a new u s  president who has promised to shake up the status quo in international affairs   let s say it honestly  there is the challenge posed by the new u s  administration  regarding trade rules and what our position will be on managing conflicts in the world   hollande  who will leave office after an april may election  told reporters
