wichita  kansas  reuters    after moving to kansas  tad stricker visited a state motor vehicle office to perform what he thought was the routine task of getting a new driver s license and registering to vote  it was a familiar procedure for stricker    who has moved from state to state frequently in his work as a hotel manager  he filled out a voter registration form and got his driver s license  he was not asked for more documents  he said  so he was stunned when he tried to cast a ballot in november  and was told he was not on the voter rolls  a month later  a letter from the state said why  his registration had been placed  in suspense  because he had failed to meet a state requirement he did not know about   proving he was an american  spurred by secretary of state kris kobach  a national leader in pushing for anti immigration and voting changes  more than   kansas residents have joined stricker in limbo since early  under a state law that raises a new and higher barrier to voting in the united states  proof of citizenship  while you must be a u s  citizen to vote in american elections  most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens and provide a driver s license number  social security number  or other proof of residency   a reuters analysis of the kansas suspense list shows the law disproportionately hits young voters  who often do not have ready access to the needed documents  as well as unaffiliated and democratic voters in the republican controlled state   what a shock   said stricker  who was born in missouri and moved to kansas with his wife from illinois   i was under the impression i had registered to vote  i had done everything i needed to  i just thought   this can t be happening    while the law won t affect its status as a safe republican state in november s presidential election  it thrusts kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions that has accelerated since the supreme court struck down parts of the voting rights act in   a signature legislative achievement of the  civil rights movement  kobach s involvement has raised the stakes in the fight against the kansas law  democrats and voting rights advocates say his influence with conservatives could help spread the concept to other states  his critics scored a victory on may  when a federal judge weakened the law  kobach quickly appealed  the lawsuit was brought by the american civil liberties union  and stricker was a plaintiff in the case  photo identification laws and other voting measures have proliferated in recent years in republican held states  but  the one that gets me most nervous  is the proof of citizenship requirement in kansas  said pratt wiley  director of voter expansion for the democratic national committee   what you will see is that what is learned in one state  or doesn t work in one state  there is a small adjustment and then it s applied in a different state   wiley said  calling kansas  patient zero  in that process  kobach has gained a national reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti immigration measures across the country  leading one democratic congressman to dub him  the dark lord  of the anti immigration movement   a label he wears proudly   i don t know if i would call it a badge of honor but it reflects that i m moving the ball in what i think is the right direction   kobach said in an interview in his topeka office across from the state capitol  three other states have adopted proof of citizenship laws championed by kobach  although officials said two of them had not implemented them  bills have been introduced in at least nine other states to create a similar law since   although none have advanced very far  according to the national conference of state legislatures  the law kobach spearheaded in kansas requires registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents  including birth certificates and passports  they are placed on the suspense list if they can t  since late last year  those who did not complete the requirements for registration have been purged from the voter rolls after  days and had to begin the process over again  about  percent of kansans who tried to register between the law s onset in  and late  failed to meet the requirement and went on the suspense list  according to documents filed in a lawsuit challenging the requirement   it s created a system that is needlessly complex and very discouraging  particularly for young people   said steve lopes  head of the johnson county voting coalition  which helps register voters   now people just say   forget it  i m not going to vote    kobach rejects accusations the law is designed to suppress voter turnout  particularly among minority and low income voters who tend to back democrats  he says it is aimed at stopping what he describes as a rampant problem of non citizens voting in u s  elections   even though there is little evidence of the problem   every time an alien votes  it cancels out the vote of a u s  citizen  that s real disenfranchisement  it s happening every election and it s happening in every state   kobach said  estimating thousands of non citizens are on voting rolls in big states with large immigrant populations  citing that threat  kobach convinced the kansas legislature in  to give him the power to prosecute voter fraud  but he has won just four misdemeanor illegal voting convictions  mostly involving people who owned at least two properties and cast votes in both locations  none involved non citizens voting  although kobach said more complaints will be filed  u s  district court judge julie robinson  who issued a may  order that kansas begin to register more than   voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law  noted kansas could identify only three non citizens who voted between  and the onset of the law in    the court cannot find that the state s interest in preventing non citizens from voting in kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters   she wrote  of the   people on a late april suspense list obtained by reuters  more than half were ages  through   and more than  percent were age  or under  they were clustered in the high population areas of wichita  topeka and the kansas city suburbs  and the college towns of lawrence and manhattan  about  percent were unaffiliated  more than the approximately  percent of registered kansas voters who are unaffiliated  about  percent of those on the list were democrats  compared to  percent of registered voters  twenty three percent were republicans  compared to  percent of registered voters  according to a reuters analysis of the data  younger voters  who are more likely to register as unaffiliated or democrats  have a harder time getting the documents needed and have less patience with what has become an unwieldy process  said michael smith  a professor at emporia state university who has studied the kansas suspense list  kobach said it was  natural  that young people were heavily represented on the suspense list because they are the majority of new registrants  he rejected criticism that a proof of citizenship requirement created a higher barrier for registrants   if you define a barrier to voting as just having to do something before you vote  every state has that barrier  virtually every state requires proof of address   he said   in her court ruling  robinson said the kansas requirement conflicted with a federal law designed to make it easier to register while getting a driver s license  she ordered kansas on june  to begin registering stricker and other residents who had submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship  they will be able to vote in federal elections for the presidency and u s  congress    but robinson s ruling did not end the proof of citizenship requirement for kansans who register by mail or at locations other than motor vehicle offices  and it left even those registering while getting a driver s license ineligible to vote for state and local offices  for now  that has created a chaotic two tier system where some kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot  some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not  and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed   it s a complete mess   said marge ahrens  co president of the nonpartisan kansas league of women voters
