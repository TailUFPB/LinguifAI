washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s pick to lead the u s  treasury  steven mnuchin  said on wednesday the administration would make tax reform and trade pact overhauls top priorities as they seek a sustained pace of  percent to  percent economic growth  mnuchin also signaled a desire to remove u s  mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac from government ownership  a move that could have wide ranging ramifications for how americans pay for their homes  the one time goldman sachs banker  together with wilbur ross  trump s nominee for commerce secretary  outlined trump s economic agenda  including what mnuchin called the largest tax overhaul since the ronald reagan administration  in an interview on cnbc   trump announced the economic team nominations  along with that of chicago cubs co owner todd ricketts as ross s deputy  in a statement on wednesday  mnuchin and ross reinforced the sweeping proposals trump put forth in september to simplify the tax code and slash the corporate tax rate to  percent  cutting the top rate for all businesses from the present  percent   we think by cutting corporate taxes we ll create huge economic growth and we ll have huge personal income   mnuchin said in the interview  tax experts have questioned trump s assertion that the proposals would not add to the nation s debt and deficit       mnuchin and ross said lower tax rates would be offset by reductions in the number of income tax deductions   taxes are way too complicated and people spend way too much time worrying about ways to get them lower   mnuchin said  he also said the administration would cap mortgage interest deductibility but would allow for some deductions   in a separate interview on fox business network  mnuchin said a major tax reform that includes a large middle income tax cut would be achieved within  days of the trump presidency  he also said he expected to reach  percent to  percent economic growth in the next couple of years   i think it s very achievable   mnuchin told fbn  mnuchin also told fbn mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac must get out of government ownership  common shares of both  which trade on the lightly regulated pink sheets market  shot up by around  percent to their highest levels in more than two years  the two companies have operated under treasury department conservatorship since the  financial crisis  when plunging home prices crippled their finances and threatened to bring down the u s  financial system  repeated efforts since then to reform the u s  housing finance system have foundered in congress  trump  throughout his presidential campaign  pledged to redraw trade deals to win back american jobs  he has threatened mexico and china with punitive tariffs that some economists have warned could spark a trade war that could potentially roll back decades of liberalization  mnuchin and ross said trade reform would be a top agenda item in the new administration  both men criticized regional trade pacts  saying they favor bilateral agreements with trade partners   there s trade  there s sensible trade and there s dumb trade  we ve been doing a lot of dumb trade   ross said  trump has vowed to kill the trans pacific partnership  an ambitious asia pacific trade pact linking the united states and  countries   mnuchin said the treasury and commerce departments have trade enforcement capabilities  with regard to china s foreign exchange policy  he said on cnbc   if we determine we need to label them as a currency manipulator  that s something the treasury would do   ross told fbn the united states will impose tariffs if necessary   there ll be especially tariffs for punitive purposes for people who dump   he said  the plans put forth by mnuchin and ross mirrored trump s stated agenda  said brad mcmillan  chief investment officer for commonwealth financial in waltham  massachusetts   the color is in how they plan to do it  and here the news is good   he said   for mnuchin  tax reform rather than tax cuts  offsetting cuts to deductions matching rate reductions  means that the deficit impact will be smaller than was feared    similarly  for ross the note that we will be working on improving trade agreements but with tariffs as a last resort helps reduce fears of disruption   he said   overall  should be positive for markets by emphasizing the business positive policies will be pursued in a minimally disruptive way   thomas simons  money market economist with the jefferies in new york  characterized the plans as containing  a lot of things that sound good  but offered few details about how they will be executed  mnuchin and ross also criticized the financial reform legislation known as dodd frank  passed after the   financial crisis  as too complicated and cuts back lending  asked on cnbc about federal reserve chair janet yellen s performance  both men said they believed she had done a good job  that assessment conflicts with trump s earlier criticism of yellen during the campaign  ross said he believes it is likely the fed will raise interest rates at its meeting in december
