cuidad juarez  mexico  reuters    both u s  presidential candidates routinely criticize free trade deals they blame for the loss of american jobs  but tweaking the north american free trade agreement  nafta   as hillary clinton has pledged to do  or ripping it up  as donald trump demands  may do nothing to help companies like element electronics corp  which owns america s last television factory   winnsboro  south carolina based element  and the television industry more broadly  offer a window into the complexity of industrial supply chains and illustrate why pushing manufacturing jobs back to the united states is so difficult  element s plant in south carolina is nearly identical to a rival factory operated by taiwanese conglomerate tatung company that sits on a dusty back street in this mexican border town  both import nearly all their components from asia  the parts often flow in through the same southern california ports  but there s a big  and costly  difference  the mexican plant  by sitting just over the border from el paso  texas  doesn t have to pay duty on those parts  even when the finished televisions are sold in the united states  but element s factory has to foot the tariff bill  which makes its televisions more expensive   for a graphic on the trade loophole  click tmsnrt rs     it s pretty crazy that i m disadvantaged for using u s  labor   says michael o shaughnessy  element s president  that s a sentiment that trump  the republican nominee  has forcefully tapped as he makes the case that radically revamping the trade deal would level the playing field and bring jobs back  many trade experts  though  say it would be a costly disaster to try to unravel these production networks  which essentially treat mexico as a  state   the peterson institute for international economics  a washington think tank that favors free trade  released a study last month that predicted imposing stiff tariffs on mexico and china would disrupt north american producers that have created global supply chains and push the united states into a recession   the tv industry is characterized by particularly dense webs of cross border supply chains with mexico and china   says marcus noland  the economist who directed the study   there d be chaos and a trade war   even many who oppose nafta acknowledge it would be disruptive to suddenly erect barriers  given the way companies have shifted supply chains to integrate mexico  nafta  implemented in   forged a common market between the united states  mexico and canada  in response  many industries  including television manufactures  have transformed themselves by creating supply chains that crisscross the border   televisions once were produced in the united states and elsewhere with hundreds of parts  often tucked into elaborate wooden cases  a modern flat screen  by contrast  has relatively few parts  and more than  percent of its value is packed into the glass and the electronics integrated directly into the panel  the heart of the industry  including that core glass technology and production  is now based in asia  about half of all tvs imported to the u s  come from mexico  says paul gagnon  an expert on the industry s supply chain at ihs markit  an economic research firm    the main reason for that is so the producers can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand   he says  tv sales are highly seasonal  spiking late in the year  in mexico  some of the factories double their workforce for just a few months to respond to this  gagnon doubts the jobs would come back to the united states  because margins on tvs are so low   if there were any major cost increase  in mexico   you d probably see some shift to asia for production   rather than seeing that production happen in the u s   some mexican plants mold the plastic casing and do other tasks in the assembly process  but in many cases   including at both the element and tatung plants   the assembly plants do mostly finishing touches like inserting printing circuit boards and tuning the units  this creates relatively few jobs compared to the kind of television manufacturing done in the u s  industry s heyday  in the   there were some  domestic television manufacturers in the united states  and employment peaked at about   in the   mexico s cost advantage over the united state is formidable  o shaughnessy said he pays his  workers  who operate in a converted shirt factory  about   an hour  the pay at the juarez plant is about    an hour  even with this edge  it s getting harder to do the work in mexico  said chan hsing diao  manager of the tatung plant   tatung doesn t sell televisions under its own name  but rather is paid by other manufacturers to assemble their name brand products    the industry is consolidating and the cost pressures are enormous   he said  noting that over the last six years  the amount he is paid to assemble a  inch television has fallen by half  from about   a unit to   a unit   the profits are this   he said  holding up two fingers almost touching  the tatung plant in juarez occupies a cavernous space that was once a windshield factory  it now features long assembly lines for televisions and produced  million tvs over the last seven years  diao said  some  million of those were sold in the united states  in january  the company lost its main customer  a chinese tv manufacturer that diao declined to identify  tatung is scrambling to find a new manufacturer that wants to build tvs for the united states  in the meantime  it continues assembling tvs for mexico and some other latin american markets  diao warned there would be a trade war if a new u s  administration tore up the nafta agreement  with profits already so tight in mexico  many chinese producers might find it easier to ship finished goods directly from asia rather than move production and jobs to the united states  he said  o shaughnessy  for his part  said he just wants to get the same break on import duties as mexico gets under nafta  his decision to build in the united states  he said  was driven entirely by his only customer for the u s  plant  wal mart  which uses element as a centerpiece of its campaign to promote domestic manufacturing  the south carolina tvs are shipped in boxes emblazoned with american flags and bearing the words  assembled in the usa   o shaughnessy has appealed for a tariff exemption from his local congressman  rep  mick mulvaney  a republican  mulvaney said he is sympathetic but has been unable to win over many fellow lawmakers who consider special exemptions a form of earmarks for special interests  which many oppose on principle   element makes clear the real world implications of these trade deals we have signed   said mulvaney  adding that it s time to  review  nafta to iron out this and other loopholes     back in juarez  the annual ramp up of hiring is under way at the tatung plant to supply the surge of televisions bought over the holidays  employment at tatung goes as low as  each year  for instance  but is now on its way up to   diao said   you could never do that in america   at least not easily   he says  referring to this cycle of hiring and firing large numbers
