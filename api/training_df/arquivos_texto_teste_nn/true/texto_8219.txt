kansas city  mo   reuters    u s  democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton reflected on her religious faith on thursday during the first of a series of speeches her campaign said would focus on her values and vision rather than those of republican opponent donald trump  the shift comes as opinion polls tighten between clinton  the former secretary of state and u s  senator  and trump  a new york businessman  ahead of the nov   election  clinton has focused many of her public remarks on criticism of trump  including his provocative comments on illegal immigrants  muslims and women  trump has criticized clinton s record in public office and questioned her honesty and qualifications for the white house  but the clinton campaign acknowledged she had to spend more time focusing her remarks on herself so voters could see the  aspirational  vision she hopes to enact if she becomes the first woman elected u s  president   we believe we have to work extra hard to make sure that the positive notion of what she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest that there is  in trump  and what he says and also in what we say about him   clinton s communications director  jennifer palmieri  told reporters on her plane  clinton will do that with speeches on the economy  children and families  and national service in the coming weeks   she started on thursday night with an address to the national baptist convention  made up primarily of african americans  that focused on her own religious life  clinton spoke of teaching the occasional sunday school class and being married for more than  years to former president  bill clinton  a southern baptist  despite being a lifelong methodist herself  she told the crowd about her gruff navy father praying by his bed every night and her mother  who experienced love during a tough childhood that grounded her faith  reflecting on her christianity  clinton said jesus christ s greatest command was to love   we re not asked to love each other  not urged or requested  we are commanded   she said   some days it s really hard for me   she said to laughter  clinton does not speak frequently about her faith  although she discussed its importance to her in a televised town hall event in february during her battle with u s  senator bernie sanders for the democratic presidential nomination  her words on thursday seemed to connect with members of the mostly black audience  who applauded and raised their hands in affirmation of many of her comments  clinton polls strongly among black voters   i ve learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults  and there are plenty   she said  noting the importance of humility among leaders
