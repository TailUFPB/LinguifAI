dubai  reuters    the future leader of the middle east s top foreign ally is  in the words of a saudi prince  an anti muslim  disgrace   openly disdainful of arab security partnerships  who believes saudi arabia would cease to exist for long without the united states  donald trump s presidential election victory means he is the man washington s arab allies must deal with after his january inauguration  as they seek u s  help to end wars from syria to mosul  manage humanitarian crises and provide jobs for their populations at a time of low oil prices  trump s campaign tirades against muslim migrants   the target of prince alwaleed bin talal s comments on twitter   and against arab allies who don t  pay  for u s  support suggest the relationship could be delicate  how far trump the president will differ from trump the polarizing election candidate is not clear  brief  congratulatory messages flowed quickly from arab allies  including one from saudi king salman bin abdulaziz  who wished trump success in  achieving security and stability in the middle east and the wider world   but underneath the protocol  for many arab rulers and royals trump s victory is a source of anxiety  they now face a new america led by trump who  they fear  could upend a regional order that has prevailed for decades  some ordinary arabs like trump s no nonsense style  and praise what they see as his capacity for tough leadership   a strong leader     that is what is needed here in the middle east and all across the world   said ali al muhannadi    a qatari owner of an electrical company  filling his car up at a petrol station in doha on wednesday  muhannadi saw trump as a useful ally in confronting the jihadist threat  saying he is  very frank and not like a politician  islamist radicals are bad for the west and for us too   but privately there are concerns about a lack of clarity in trump s policies for the world s most combustible region as it struggles to break free from war while trying to safeguard the free flow of its oil exports  in particular there are worries that trump s hostile rhetoric towards muslim migrants will play into the hands of islamic state and al qaeda  which are eager to recruit disaffected young arabs to wage war on the regional governments they despise as stooges of washington  gulf arab leaders want a u s  president who understands their concerns after eight years of what they regard as diffidence under president barack obama  someone who did not provide the kind of personal contact they value  in particular they want help to push back against iran  their main rival  but they fear trump s public praise for vladimir putin will encourage russia to expand its support for syrian president bashar al assad  an ally of iran and an enemy of most gulf arab states  apart from a commitment to israel s security  a constant in u s  foreign policy  and an isolationist tone to his comments  much in trump s statements about the region remains vague and poorly thought out  diplomats and analysts say  opinion is divided about whether trump s remarks on the campaign trail will be enacted when in office  among these is his comment that he would consider halting u s  purchases of saudi oil unless riyadh provides troops to fight islamic state  faisal al yafai  a commentator at the national newspaper  said many people thought trump had used his extravagant comments to win votes and once in office he would mellow   i am unconvinced  i think he actually believes his rhetoric  it s quite worrying that he doesn t seem to understand how global politics works   he said   for example you don t go around saying  if our allies were threatened we wouldn t intervene  why can t they build their own nuclear weapons      that sort of stuff doesn t help confidence  that collapse of confidence between the u s  and its allies has a knock on impact on the economies and in the decisions those countries take on a political level   yafai  whose newspaper is based in the united arab emirates  noted iraqis were putting their lives on the line to regain  mosul  islamic state s main stronghold in the country   that is not just a war for the region  it is a war for the world   he said  others are more sanguine  a senior turkish official predicted continued strong relations with the united states and argued that  comments in an election period always have a harder and more hawkish tone than is necessary  but they remain peculiar to the election period   prince sultan bin khaled al faisal  a former saudi special forces officer and now senior fellow at the king faisal center for research and islamic studies in riyadh  said that in u s  elections  what they say and what they do are two totally different things     foreign policy is not made by one man   he said   but it s difficult to pinpoint what his policy actually is   trump s remarks have been combative  and eye catching  he has said the united states should be reimbursed by the countries it provides protection for  without america   saudi arabia wouldn t exist for very long   trump told the new york times in march  trump s win drew a cautious welcome in syria  which has entered its fifth year of war between rebels and assad s forces  in damascus  syrian member of parliament sherif shehada said u s  policy could shift assad s way   we must be optimistic  but cautiously optimistic   shehada told reuters by telephone  trump s statements on syria  and his more open minded stance towards assad s ally russia  have fueled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on the conflict  in which the russian air force has been bombing insurgents   but beyond all that  many officials and observers see another ominous consequence  trump s win has not only delighted western right wingers but also jihadists who told supporters the election had revealed the true position of the united states towards muslims   the masks have slipped   one supporter said on islamic state websites    trump s  moronic declarations alone serve us even if his decisions will be under the supervision of the senate      wrote another
