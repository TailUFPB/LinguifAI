hanover  germany  reuters    u s  president barack obama said on sunday he would do whatever he could to advance a controversial trade deal with the european union in his last eight months in office  but warned that time was running short  obama has pushed to complete two trade agreements before his term ends on jan     with pacific nations and with the eu   but has run into a growing swell of populist concerns about the impact on jobs  consumer protections and the environment   time is not on our side   he conceded to business leaders at the hanover messe  a massive industrial trade fair   if we don t complete negotiations this year  then upcoming political transitions in the united states and europe would mean this agreement won t be finished for quite some time   obama is in germany to promote the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  ttip  with german chancellor angela merkel  but the issue was overshadowed by discussions on the crises in syria  ukraine and libya when the two leaders met  on monday  they are set to hold talks with british prime minister david cameron  french president francois hollande and italian prime minister matteo renzi on some of the same issues  but first  they had dinner in a  century palace with chief executives of some of the largest u s  and german companies such as microsoft  dow  lockheed martin  honeywell  basf  bayer and siemens  also at the dinner was matthias m√ºller  ceo of volkswagen  whose company has admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests in the united states  a scandal that involves  million vehicles worldwide  obama normally does not sit through lengthy opening ceremonies  but in a sign of the political capital he is spending on trade   and his affection for merkel   he took a front row seat for an unusual interpretative dance performance featuring robots  futuristic music and acrobatic break dancing  the day before obama arrived  thousands of protesters holding placards with slogans like  stop ttip  marched to express their opposition to the deal  and his motorcade whizzed past a few more as he drove through the north german city  obama acknowledged his message about the benefits of trade has not broken though   the benefits oftentimes are diffuse  whereas a particular plant or business that feels it s been hurt by outside competition feels it very acutely   he told reporters  obama said he hoped the deal  which supporters say could boost economies on each side of the atlantic by   billion  would be agreed this year  but final ratification will take more time  the trans pacific partnership is first in the queue for the u s  congress  which is not clamoring to hold a final vote  obama said that could change after the democratic and republican parties make their final selections of candidates this summer   when we re in the heat of campaigns  people naturally are going to worry more about what s lost than what s gained with respect to trade agreements   he said  germany is the last stop on a six day foreign tour where obama has sought to shore up u s  alliances he views as important not only for the economy but also to defeat islamic state militants and counter russian intervention in syria and ukraine   strong growth in europe is particularly important given the array of pressing challenges   whether it s security  defense  migration or refugees   obama said  obama came to germany from london where he urged britons to vote to stay in the european union in a closely watched june referendum or face being at  the back of the queue  as a non eu member hoping for a new trade deal with the u s  earlier in the week  he met with gulf leaders in riyadh to try to allay fears that washington had become less committed to their security  especially after the nuclear deal with iran  the regional rival of saudi arabia  obama said he was  deeply concerned  about a surge in violence in syria  where government forces have stepped up bombing of rebel held areas around the strategic city of aleppo  merkel urged the parties participating in troubled peace talks in geneva to agree to humanitarian zones where fleeing syrians could feel safe from bombardment  she and obama made clear that they did not favor the creation of classic  safe zones  which would need to be protected by foreign forces  both leaders expressed concerns about ceasefire violations in eastern ukraine and said sanctions imposed against russia following its  intervention there  could not be eased if the situation on the ground did not improve  ties between washington and berlin reached a low point three years ago following revelations of widespread surveillance of german citizens  including the bugging of merkel s mobile phone  by the u s  national security agency  but in recent years  the two cold war allies have patched things up  obama praised merkel for her  steady leadership  and handling of europe s refugee crisis  saying her decision last year to welcome hundreds of thousands of migrants to germany had put her  on the right side of history   he joked that merkel  who lacks his easy going charm  had a  really good sense of humor  even if it wasn t always on public display  drawing chuckles from the  year old chancellor  merkel refused to be drawn when asked whether she was concerned that she might soon have to work with donald trump  the leading republican candidate for president  who has labeled her refugee policies  insane   she said only that she was watching the american election campaign  with interest
