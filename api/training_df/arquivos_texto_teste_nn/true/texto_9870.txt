washington  reuters    the secretive u s  foreign intelligence surveillance court has issued its first order allowing the national security agency to collect telephone records under a new electronic spying law congress passed last year  according to an order from the court posted tuesday on a website operated by the office of the director of national intelligence  the court issued the order on dec    the order  signed by fisc chief judge thomas hogan  said the court concluded that a surveillance application  apparently submitted by the nsa  met the requirements of the usa freedom act  which president barack obama signed last year  that law replaced an older one that allowed nsa to collect telephone  metadata    records of american citizens  and residents  calls  including their origin and destination  when a call was placed and how long it lasted  however  u s  intelligence officials have said the nsa did not collect the content of phone calls under this program and did not look at the data without some specific justification  former nsa contractor edward snowden revealed classified details of the collection program in   and last year  congress and the obama administration narrowed the government s power to collect such domestic telephone metadata  under the new law and revised procedures  the government no longer collects bulk telephone metadata  but must request targeted information from telecoms companies after obtaining authorization from the foreign intelligence court  the identities of the telecoms  providers  and the individuals or numbers whose metadata the nsa has targeted were redacted from the version of the court order released on tuesday  hogan says in the opinion that the government was seeking  the ongoing daily production of detailed call records relating to an authorized international terrorism investigation   but does not offer further detail about the nature of the investigation  in his order  the judge accepts the argument that while the government was obliged to explain why targeting the telephone numbers of individuals is  relevant  to its investigation  it does not need to demonstrate the same relevance when examining numbers called from the initially targeted phones  the judge also said that although the new surveillance law requires government agencies to promptly destroy telephone metadata that it might have mistakenly collected on u s  persons  they sometimes can retain such data for as long as six months if they have reason to believe it could provide evidence of a crime
