 reuters    u s  president donald trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judge s temporary hold on his travel ban on seven mainly muslim countries  but the outcome of a ruling on the executive order s ultimate legality is less certain   any appeals of decisions by u s  district court judge james robart in seattle face a regional court dominated by liberal leaning judges who might not be sympathetic to trump s rationale for the ban  and a currently shorthanded supreme court split   between liberals and conservatives  the temporary restraining order robart issued on friday in seattle  which applies nationwide  gives him time to consider the case in more detail  but also sends a signal that he is likely to impose a more permanent injunction     the trump administration has appealed that order  the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals said late on saturday that it would not decide whether to lift the judge s ruling  as requested by the u s  government  until it receives briefs from both sides  with the administration s filing due on monday  appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo  which in this case   for now   is the suspension of the ban   the upheaval prompted by the new republican administration s initial announcement of the ban on jan    with travelers detained at airports upon entering the country  would potentially be kickstarted again if robart s stay was lifted  the appeals court might also take into account the fact that there are several other cases around the country challenging the ban  if it were to overturn the district court s decision  another judge somewhere else in the united states could impose a new order  setting off a new cascade of court filings   if the appeals court upholds the order  the administration could immediately ask the u s  supreme court to intervene  but the high court is generally reluctant to get involved in cases at a preliminary stage  legal experts said  the high court is short one justice  as it has been for a year  leaving it split between liberals and conservatives  any emergency request by the administration would need five votes to be granted  meaning at least one of the liberals would have to vote in favor    i think the court s going to feel every reason to stay on the sidelines as long as possible   said steve vladeck  a professor at the university of texas school of law  trump last week nominated a conservative appeals court judge  neil gorsuch  to fill the vacancy  but he will not be sitting on the supreme court for at least two months  gorsuch s vote  if he is confirmed by the u s  senate  could come into play if the case were to reach the court at a later stage of the litigation  once the case proceeds past the injunction stage of the litigation and onto the merits of whether the order is legally sound  legal experts differ over how strong the government s case would be   richard primus  a professor of constitutional law at the university of michigan law school  said the administration could struggle to convince courts that the ban was justified by national security concerns   the supreme court has previously rejected the idea that the government does not need to offer a basis for its actions in the national security context  including the landmark  pentagon papers case  in which the administration of president richard nixon tried unsuccessfully to prevent the press from publishing information about united states policy toward vietnam   the government s argument so far in support of the order is pretty weak   primus said  jonathan adler  a professor at case western reserve university school of law  said the administration has legal precedent on its side  with the courts generally deferential to executive action on immigration   however  he said it is unusual for the courts to be asked to endorse  a policy that appears to have been adopted in as kind of haphazard and arbitrary way as this one appears to have been
