washington  reuters    u s  senator john mccain said on thursday that president barack obama was  directly responsible  for attacks on americans like the one in florida because of policies that contributed to the rise of the islamic state  but the arizona republican later  said he misspoke  mccain  who is in a tough re election race  made the comments after reporters chased him down a marble stairway and into a hallway of the u s  capitol  they asked what he was hearing from constituents about gun control issues being debated in the senate after sunday s shooting rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to islamic state militants   i m hearing a lot from my constituents about what happened and of course i am making them realize that barack obama is directly responsible for it   mccain said   because when he pulled everybody out of iraq  al qaeda went to syria  became isis  and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama s failures  utter failures   mccain said   so the responsibility for it lies with president barack obama and his failed policies   after media reports began to appear about his comments  mccain  who lost the white house to obama in the  presidential election  posted a clarification on twitter and then issued a statement that said he meant to blame obama s policies  not the president personally   i misspoke  i did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible  i was referring to president obama s national security decisions  not the president himself   mccain said in the statement  forty nine people died in the shooting in orlando  the worst mass shooting in modern u s  history  the gunman was u s  born omar mateen    whose parents immigrated from afghanistan  mccain    faces multiple opponents in a republican primary race in august  and some analysts say he is in danger of losing the senate seat he has held for three decades  earlier this week  presumptive republican presidential candidate donald trump appeared to suggest obama may have been complicit in the orlando attacks   look  we re led by a man that either is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind   trump told fox news   and the something else in mind   you know  people can t believe it     there s something going on  it s inconceivable  there s something going on
