washington  reuters    hillary clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in wall street  boosted by wall street s toughest critics  u s  senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren  the democratic candidate has declared  the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top  and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations  she has encouraged regulators to break up too risky banks  and yet  wall street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a clinton presidency  in fact  the banking industry has supported clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the clinton campaign stumbles  privately  bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the dodd frank wall street reform legislation passed in    i don t think clinton wakes up thinking about wall street   one senior banking industry lobbyist said  there are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among clinton s campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly   pressed during the campaign by progressive democrats to call for a revival of the glass steagall act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking  clinton ultimately refused  she also weighed another progressive favorite   a tax on financial transactions  but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders  ultimately  what bankers most like about clinton is that she is not donald trump   many financiers fear her unorthodox republican rival could disrupt global trade  damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets  industry analysts and participants say   those are the kind of things that corner offices think about   said karen shaw petrou of federal financial analytics inc  whose firm advises financial firms about u s  regulatory policy   the overriding concern about trump has dominated people s thinking   trump s candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the republicans have been flinging money at clinton  employees of the  largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her   for every   they contributed to trump  according to a reuters analysis  in   the same group contributed twice as much to republican candidate mitt romney as it did to president barack obama s re election campaign    people who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than   million to clinton s presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations  trump s campaign and related groups received just    from donors in the same sector  according to data from the center for responsive politics   it s basically going with the devil you know over the devil you don t   said brian gardner  a managing director of new york investment firm keefe bruyette   woods  what also helped  he said  was the familiarity with hillary and bill clinton dating back to the  when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation   there is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on wall street and the clintons   he said  for bankers  the biggest worry is a scenario where clinton wins and the democrats take control of the house and the senate  with progressives such as warren and sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators  already  warren has called for immediate dismissal of the securities and exchange commission chair mary jo white  last year  warren successfully led a movement to derail obama s plan to appoint banker antonio weiss to the top job at treasury  warren and other progressives will press clinton to be tough on wall street in return for their campaign support   clinton  leaned heavily on senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders  and progressive ideas  when she needed to excite voters   adam green with the progressive change campaign committee said   elizabeth warren has proven she s a very powerful ally to have on your side  and it s well known she s also a formidable opponent to have against you   green said   however  recent polls suggest it is unlikely that democrats will take the house and the future of the senate is far from certain  even if the senate goes democratic  it is likely to be led by new york senator chuck schumer  a moderate who has represented wall street with the industry s backing  clinton has said she will propose a  risk fee  on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds  like trump  she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy  termed  carried interest   yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months  if not a year or more  of horse trading in washington  ultimately  it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals  such as infrastructure funding  college affordability  or raising the minimum wage  those are the causes that clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti bank rhetoric  say bankers  one industry trade group representative said   we re not in her top  to take care of
