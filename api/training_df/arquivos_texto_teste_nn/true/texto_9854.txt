boston  reuters    support for republican presidential front runner donald trump among his party s church going catholics has risen since pope francis suggested the u s  businessman was not a real christian  a reuters ipsos poll shows  trump has averaged support among   percent of catholic republicans in the  days since the leader of the world s   billion roman catholics made the comment on feb    up from   percent in the  days that preceded it  their brief tiff is one of a series of controversies that have failed to dent the new york billionaire s popularity  including his call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country  his insults to women  and his plans to wall off mexico if elected president on nov    the reuters ipsos poll of   church going catholic republicans had a credibility interval of   percentage points  asked about plans for a wall on the border with mexico  the pope said in february   a person who thinks only about building walls  wherever they may be  and not building bridges  is not christian   a papal spokesman later said the pontiff was  in no way  singling out trump or trying to sway voters  the blunt candidate  after initially saying it was  disgraceful  for the pope to judge another s faith in god  said francis was  a nice man  who was probably misinterpreted by the media   catholics are a sizable u s  voting bloc  comprising about a quarter of the electorate  says georgetown university s center for applied research in the apostolate  catholics nearly evenly split their presidential votes between republicans and democrats  according to a pew research center analysis   part of the increase in trump s support among catholics is likely related to the dwindling number of republican white house candidates  a field that has dropped from  in january to three   the presbyterian trump  u s  senator ted cruz of texas  a southern baptist  and ohio governor john kasich  an anglican  but mark gray  a senior research associate at georgetown  said the results also showed that catholics who heard the pope s message about trump were not swayed   many catholics probably felt that the pope s comments were not a directive on how they should vote or who they should support  and still others may never have been aware of the pope s comments to begin with   he said  while opinion polls have shown few u s  catholics think it necessary to agree with the pope on every issue to be a faithful church member  a washington post abc poll last september showed the pope had an  percent favorability rating  father william paul mckane  a catholic priest in rural montana who supports trump  said he felt the pope s comments had backfired with his flock   i call it paradoxical  to put it gently  that the pope said that  when he lives behind walls that are about  feet high and  feet across   he said  referring to the walls around vatican city   that comment hurt his credibility with my parishioners   mckane said he appreciates trump s speaking plainly about issues like security and the economy   issues he said were in line with christian values of protecting the innocent   even if he dislikes some of the candidate s more fiery comments   trump s verbiage does not sound compassionate   mckane said   i don t hold him up as a paragon of christian virtue  but i m not looking for that in a candidate  i m looking for someone who is prudent and can make good political decisions   while support for trump among ordinary catholic republicans is high   roughly equal to that among republicans as a whole   the small sums of money flowing to the candidates from christian priests  bishops  pastors and other clergy of all denominations tend to favor the evangelical cruz  cruz received    in contributions from about  members of the christian clergy who each gave above the   reporting threshold through february  compared with about   from  people for trump and    from nine people for kasich  mckane is the only contributor listed in trump s campaign finance disclosures who identified himself as a catholic priest  based on a reuters review  on the democratic side  u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont   the only jewish candidate   has received some    from about  people ordained for religious duty in the church  compared with about    from about  individuals for former secretary of state hillary clinton      clinton polls much better among church going catholic democrats  with   percent support  compared to sanders    percent  according to reuters ipsos polling  despite sanders  bid to liken his view to the pope s  especially on wealth inequality and climate change  sanders and the pope met briefly on saturday at the vatican  where sanders addressed a conference on social justice
