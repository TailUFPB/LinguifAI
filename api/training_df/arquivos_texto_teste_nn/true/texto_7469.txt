new york  reuters    donald trump s white house victory puts a spotlight on reince priebus  an establishment republican figure who emerged as a trusted adviser to the new york businessman and helped encourage discipline in the campaign s final weeks  priebus  chairman of the republican national committee  has been mentioned as a contender for chief of staff  in a pre election interview  priebus told reuters that trump won over voters who were frustrated with washington and its politicians   they viewed donald trump as the antidote to so many things that they re frustrated with  whether it be washington  whether it be their job  whether it be what they were promised  and all sorts of things in life  and how it wasn t delivered   he said   and trump was the antidote to all of those feelings   trump s victory was a vindication for priebus  who refused to bow to pressure to distance the party apparatus from him  he talked to trump almost every day  sometimes more than once a day  and frequently traveled with the candidate  he helped prepare him for trump s debates against democrat hillary clinton  trump made clear his high regard for priebus when he invited him on stage during his victory speech early wednesday morning and asked him to say a few words  comparing priebus to the race horse secretariat  trump said   i tell you reince is really a star and he is the hardest working guy   henry barbour  an rnc member from mississippi  said priebus had  developed a position of trust  with trump   he had regular conversations with trump about different ideas and not surprisingly some ideas trump had were probably not the greatest and reince kind of talked him off some of those cliffs   he said  once trump vanquished  seasoned politicians to win the republican presidential nomination  priebus threw the weight of the rnc behind trump and built a voter turnout effort that paid off despite trump s refusal to invest more money in it   he has been a prodigious fundraiser  he invested heavily in bringing our data and analytics up to speed  and he put the full resources of the rnc to help build out the trump campaign   said steve duprey  a prominent republican from new hampshire    and he helped coach donald trump in how to be a presidential candidate    trump s unpredictable nature and views on issues such as trade that break with republican party orthodoxy have led to rifts with many establishment figures in the party  but priebus told reuters that his staunch support for trump was based on the fact that trump won more republican votes than any previous nominee    million   these are the same people who say the party is irrelevant and in the next breath they say that the party ought to singlehandedly nullify the wishes of   million people   he said  if trump had lost  priebus would have faced pressure to step down as party chairman  since he also presided over the loss of mitt romney in   he remains extremely popular among the  elected members of the rnc who would most likely re elect him  priebus is being talked about for re election at the rnc or possibly being appointed by trump to serve as his white house chief of staff  where he may be a potential conduit between trump and paul ryan  the speaker of the u s  house of representatives  both priebus and ryan hail from wisconsin and are friends   we hope priebus goes into the trump white house in a senior position   said scott reed  a prominent republican strategist in washington  asked whether he would seek re election as rnc chairman  priebus said he did not yet know   i ve honestly put that in a box and decided that i would deal with it wednesday or thursday  kind of think about it a little bit  kind of see where things are at   he said
