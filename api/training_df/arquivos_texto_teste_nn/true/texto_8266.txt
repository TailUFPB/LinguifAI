new york  reuters    the federal appointees tapped to help map puerto rico s economic future are technocrats more than political actors  and that could make the u s  territory s fiscal turnaround look more like a corporate restructuring than a politically charged municipal bankruptcy in the vein of detroit   the law known as promesa  which created the board when it passed the u s  congress in june with bipartisan support  envisioned a pragmatic solution for an island combating   billion in debt   percent poverty and a brain drain as residents bolt in droves for the mainland united states  its members  four republicans and three democrats appointed last week  were chosen by republican and democratic lawmakers and president barack obama  the board has broad powers to help stabilize the island s economy  from investigating puerto rico s government to working with that government on projects to spur economic growth  it must also approve the island s annual budgets  and will eventually facilitate debt restructuring talks with creditors  in the latter endeavor  it will have to navigate a minefield of competing interests   the island has  separate debt issuers  backed by different revenues streams  as well as   billion in so called general obligation debt backed by the  full faith and credit  of the territory s government  while that promise is legally weak in a bankruptcy setting  it is a sacrosanct pledge in municipal debt markets  holders of all that debt will jockey for payouts against government vendors and beneficiaries of the island s public pensions  which have less than   billion in assets to cover some   billion in liabilities    detroit s bankruptcy  which ended in december   treated city pensions much better than its outstanding bonds  which were largely insured  some puerto rico creditors  still suffering detroit flashbacks  feared puerto rico could look similar   especially since governor alejandro garcia padilla has pushed big haircuts and railed against the idea of reducing government services  but the makeup of the puerto rico board has offered some reassurance  said nader tavakoli  chief executive officer of ambac  which insures    billion of puerto rican bonds and also insured some of detroit s bonds   these board members are technocrats  and it gives us confidence that this is not going to be overly politicized   he said  deal makers also feature prominently  with an ex bankruptcy judge  a banker and a hedge fund operator in the mix   republicans  generally seen as creditor friendly  nominated a bankruptcy academic who favors restructuring the island s debt  david skeel  and democrats nominated a banker  jose ramon gonzalez  and a democratic finance expert in ana matosantos who directed california s budget under former republican governor arnold schwarzenegger  experts see the group as likely to push a solution that sees all sides share a burden  a typical approach for companies restructuring under chapter    there are no ideologues in the group   said keefe bruyette   woods analyst chas tyson      that does not mean there are not drawbacks  for one  the board will have to navigate a testy local political climate with residents who largely revile a panel they see as an extension of colonial rule  island voters broadly unhappy with the garcia padilla administration in november will elect a new governor as well as members of the legislature and scores of mayors   there are still politics here   said veteran bankruptcy attorney richard levin  who is following the situation   the governor and legislature retain some authority    for height securities analyst daniel hanson  the board is short on expertise in economic development  any real solution for puerto rico requires fundamental economic changes  including at its underperforming education department  and it s unclear whether the board can facilitate such change  but from a financial perspective  at least  the board seems less inclined to promote a political agenda than figure out a collaborative fix and then get out  said matt fabian  partner at municipal market analytics    the board is not being installed to fight with puerto ricans or to impose some kind of federal view   fabian said   they just want these troubles to be fixed
