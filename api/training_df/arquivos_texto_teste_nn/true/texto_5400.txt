washington  reuters    wary democrats on thursday challenged republicans who control the u s  congress to conduct a credible investigation into contacts between president donald trump s associates and russia  a process that will likely take months and may never become public   we will be watching very carefully  if the intelligence committee investigation is not proceeding to unearth the entire truth  we will seek alternative tools and structures to get to the truth  because get to the trust we must   said charles schumer  the democratic leader in the senate  a growing number of republicans showed their willingness to buck the white house and accept expanded congressional inquiries after the resignation of trump s national security adviser michael flynn over disclosures that he discussed u s  sanctions with the russian ambassador before taking office  trump has reacted angrily in the aftermath of flynn s resignation  blaming journalists and blasting leaks  on thursday  he dismissed a growing controversy about ties between his aides and russia as a  scam  and a  ruse   perpetrated by a hostile news media  but without the authority to hire a watergate style special prosecutor or convene a special committee  democrats will have to rely on the republican led senate and house of representatives  intelligence committees to demand classified documents and get to the bottom of any ties between trump s associates and moscow  after eight years with a democrat in the white house  republicans want to work with trump and his administration to advance their party s legislative priorities  from repealing obamacare to rolling back regulations and cutting taxes  but some congressional republicans said they would support independent investigations only if committee level probes proved inadequate   the jurisdiction for counterintelligence programs falls on the intelligence committee  which is undertaking a bipartisan investigation  which i have full confidence will     do a very good job and conduct a serious inquiry   said senator marco rubio  a republican member of the intelligence panel   if it doesn t  which would surprise me  then i ll be one of the first ones out there to say that it didn t do so   rubio told reporters  a probe could take a year or more  in part because u s  intelligence agencies have just begun to gather and analyze material  there will likely also be deep partisan divisions over which of its findings could ultimately be released  democrats and republicans have not agreed on the scope of an investigation  democrats want flynn to testify in a public hearing  but richard burr  the senate intelligence committee chairman  has said only that public hearings would take place when they are appropriate  some democrats had questioned burr s commitment to a thorough investigation  but schumer said on thursday that burr  is now working well  with senator mark warner  the top democrat on the intelligence committee  senator ron wyden  another democrat on the intelligence panel  said there would be  tough battles  ahead  partisan divides are deeper in the house  where many republicans   like trump   have focused on the dangers posed by leaks from his white house  rather than aides  potential ties to russia  rep  devin nunes  the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee  questioned whether the recordings of flynn s conversations were even legal under federal surveillance rules  but critics say republican calls for leak investigations may just be aimed at deflecting attention from possible misconduct by trump aides  paul ryan  the republican house speaker  took a different view  telling his weekly news conference on thursday   if it s classified information  that is criminal and there should be a criminal investigation of these leaks  that does compromise our national security
