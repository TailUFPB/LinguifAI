washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s national security transition has been more chaotic than others in recent memory  with important positions unfilled and many of his people less able  or willing  to engage on substance  u s  officials said  the uncertainties surrounding trump s personnel  policies  and rise to power have rattled many of america s allies  including japan  germany and britain  at a time when china is more assertive  russia more aggressive  terrorism more diffuse  the middle east still unstable and north korea nuclear armed and unpredictable  said u s  and foreign diplomats  disruption and uncertainty can provide strategic advantages  mark lagon and ross harrison of georgetown university wrote in foreign policy magazine   but what is seriously in doubt is whether trump s disruption will be strategic or beneficial to u s  foreign policy interests  even before getting elected  he acted like a missile without a guidance system   top trump officials  however  described the transition as having gone smoothly  including on national security  republican trump s camp announced on thursday it had asked more than  of democrat obama s appointees to stay on   however  at least three officials  a senior intelligence officer and two diplomats whose names are on a list of  requested political holdovers   will depart  principal deputy director of national intelligence stephanie o sullivan  under secretary of state catherine novelli and assistant secretary of state toria nuland appear on a jan   partial list of people the transition wanted to remain after trump s inauguration on friday  the two diplomats have told colleagues they are going  and o sullivan is keeping her long standing plans to retire  a u s  official said that nuland was never asked by the transition to stay on and was unaware of her name appearing on such a list  the state department declined comment  the trump transition and the office of the director of national intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment  it is not clearly whether the uncertainties extend to other parts of the government  but another senior official at a national security agency said trump s effort was  much slower  than the  bill clinton to george w  bush or the  bush to barack obama handovers   personnel appointments were far more advanced in both those cases   said the official  who spoke on condition he not be identified   in both cases  advance teams were working on substance   during the   transition  the official said  incoming and outgoing officials had worked together on issues  in a very harmonious fashion    none of that is the case in this transition   he added  he said that he had expected to have met by now with his likely replacement or others on the transition  but had not   it s not just me  everybody s experience is like mine   speaking to reporters on thursday  vice president elect michael pence said trump s transition was being completed ahead of schedule and under budget   our job is to be ready on day one  the american people can be confident that we will be   trump spokesman sean spicer also told reporters that contact between the incoming and outgoing national security council staffs had been  tremendous    we ve had reams of briefings   he said   that is one area where frankly they have been very  very aggressive and robust with both meeting with their counterparts and ensuring that the team is ready to go day one  trump s team did not respond to requests for further comment  three state department officials  though  called the transition there  a mess   and said that until recently the trump team had little contact with department officials and read few if any of their briefing books      that has left many career officials with misgivings about the incoming administration and the possibility that many foreign policy and national security veterans may be swept out  a dozen serving officials at four intelligence agencies said they are troubled by trump s apparent disdain for their work  by his designated national security advisor michael flynn s perceived bent for conspiracy theories and hostility toward some of his former colleagues  and by what some say is the incoming president s disinterest in the briefings he has received  two officials with knowledge of those briefings said trump s attention has wandered  he has asked few questions  has read few if any of the briefing books he s been given   including the one on russian hacking of the  election   and has requested few topical sessions  one of which was on north korea  secretary of state john kerry and his nominated replacement  rex tillerson  were to meet on thursday  but their schedules did not mesh  state department spokesman john kirby told reporters  one obama official  who has dealt with the trump transition team at the state department and spoke on condition of anonymity  said it appeared  totally disconnected  from trump s top echelon of advisers and from tillerson  tillerson s nomination is not expected to get a senate foreign relations committee vote before monday at the earliest
