 reuters    president donald trump s administration on wednesday revoked landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice  reversing a signature initiative of former democratic president barack obama    reversing the obama guidelines stands to inflame passions in the latest conflict in america between believers in traditional values and social progressives  and is likely to prompt more of the street protests that followed trump s nov   election  obama had instructed public schools last may to let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity  threatening to withhold funding for schools that did not comply  transgender people hailed the step as  victory for their civil rights  trump  a republican who took office last month  rescinded those guidelines  even though they had been put on hold by a federal judge  arguing that states and public schools should have the authority to make their own decisions without federal interference      the justice and education departments will continue to study the legal issues involved  according to the new  superseding guidance that will be sent to public schools  about  people gathered in front of the white house to protest against trump s action  waving rainbow flags and chanting   no hate  no fear  trans students are welcome here   the rainbow flag is the symbol of lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  or lgbt  people   we all know that donald trump is a bully  but his attack on transgender children today is a new low   said rachel tiven  chief executive of lambda legal  which advocates for lgbt people  conservatives such as texas attorney general ken paxton  who spearheaded the lawsuit challenging the obama guidance  hailed the trump administration action   our fight over the bathroom directive has always been about former president obama s attempt to bypass congress and rewrite the laws to fit his political agenda for radical social change   said paxton  a republican  transgender legal advocates have criticized the  states  rights  argument  saying federal law and civil rights are matters for the federal government to enforce  not the states  white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration was pressed to act now because of the pending u s  supreme court case  g g  versus gloucester county school board  that case pits a virginia transgender boy  gavin grimm  against officials who want to deny him use of the boys  room at his high school  although the justice department is not a party in the case  it typically would want to make its views heard  the trump administration action on wednesday also withdrew an education department letter in support of grimm s case   i ve faced my share of adversaries in rural virginia  i never imagined that my government would be one of them  we will not be beaten down by this administration   grimm    told the protest outside the white house  the federal law in question  known as title ix  bans sex discrimination in education  but it remains unsettled whether title ix protections extend to a person s gender identity   attorney general jeff sessions said in a statement that the obama guidelines  did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of title ix   new york attorney general eric schneiderman vowed to ensure title ix and his state s civil rights protections are enforced   president trump s decision to rescind anti discrimination protections for transgender students is yet another cruel move by an administration committed to divisive policies that roll back the clock on civil rights   he said in a statement   the courts are likely to have the final say over whether title ix covers transgender students  the supreme court could pass on that question in the virginia case and allow lower courts to weigh in  or go ahead and decide what the law means  obama s education department issued the guidance in response to queries from school districts across the country about how to accommodate transgender students in gender segregated bathrooms  it also covered a host of other issues  such as the importance of addressing transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns and schools  responsibility to prevent harassment and bullying of transgender children  thirteen states led by texas sued to stop the obama guidelines  and a u s  district judge in texas temporarily halted their full implementation  the white house previously boasted of trump s support for lgbt rights  noting in a jan   statement that he was the first republican presidential nominee to mention the community in his nomination acceptance speech   revoking the guidance shows that the president s promise to protect lgbt rights was just empty rhetoric   james esseks  director of the american civil liberties union s lgbt project  said in a statement
