washington  reuters    president donald trump castigated a democratic senator on thursday for saying u s  supreme court nominee neil gorsuch had voiced dismay in a private meeting over trump s attacks on the judiciary  while republicans came forward to back up the lawmaker s portrayal  the republican president has publicly vented his frustration with a court order last week that temporarily halted his travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries  criticizing the judge who issued the order  the appeals process and the wider judiciary  that has morphed into a dispute over comments made by his pick for the supreme court  senator richard blumenthal said on wednesday that gorsuch had told him that trump s comments about the judiciary  which have included calling the judge who blocked his travel ban a  so called judge   were  disheartening and demoralizing   on thursday  blumenthal urged gorsuch to condemn trump s attacks  publicly  unequivocally and clearly   trump  in a twitter post and in a later meeting with a bipartisan group of senators  accused blumenthal of misrepresenting gorsuch s comments  white house spokesman sean spicer  at a briefing with reporters  defended trump and said gorsuch had not been commenting specifically about the president s attacks on the judiciary  blumenthal s account of gorsuch s comments was backed up by ron bonjean  a republican strategist and spokesman for the nominee  and by kelly ayotte  a republican former senator who has accompanied the judge during meetings with lawmakers to build support for his senate confirmation  other senators  including republican ben sasse and democrat chuck schumer  also said gorsuch made similar comments to them  in blasting blumenthal  trump sought to revive a years old controversy over the senator s military service during the vietnam war era   sen  richard blumenthal  who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had  major lie   now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him   trump wrote in a twitter post  trump nominated gorsuch  a conservative federal appeals court judge  on jan   as his nominee to fill the supreme court vacancy left when justice antonin scalia died a year ago  democrats have said they will push to establish that gorsuch can exercise independence if he is confirmed to the lifetime position on the country s highest court  blumenthal said there were numerous white house staffers in the room when gorsuch made the comments  ayotte said in a statement that gorsuch  speaking in discussions with senators including blumenthal  had said  he finds any criticism of a judge s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing   while making clear he  was not referring to any specific case   gorsuch has not made any public comment on the matter  sasse  who has been critical of trump s attacks on the judiciary  described his meeting with gorsuch    i asked him about the  so called judges  comment because we don t have so called judges or so called presidents or so called senators   sasse said on msnbc  he added that gorsuch  welled up with some energy  and said any attack on his  brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges   spicer said the president had no regrets about his comments on the judiciary and that his behavior would not change    the president is going to speak his mind   he said      a federal judge in seattle  james robart  last friday put on hold trump s jan   executive order that temporarily barred entry to the united states by people from seven muslim majority countries and by all refugees  an appeals court is considering robart s order and is expected to rule in the coming days  on saturday  trump called robart a  so called judge  whose  ridiculous  ruling  essentially takes law enforcement away from our country   on wednesday  he stepped up his criticism of the judiciary  calling courts  so political  and describing the  proceedings in the appeals court as  disgraceful   democrats have called trump s comments an attack on a core principle of american democracy by which the judiciary is independent and upholds the rule of law  republican senators  who have the majority in the senate   painted gorsuch s comments as evidence of his independence from the president  but schumer  leader of the senate democrats  said the judge s comments were  mild  at best and  insufficient  in terms of showing independence    i think president trump is going to harm both judge gorsuch s chances at confirmation and his standing as president if he continues to undermine the independence of the judiciary    democratic senator chris coons told cnn on thursday  trump s spat with blumenthal overshadowed a meeting with senators that was aimed at trying to build support for gorsuch  if confirmed  the judge would restore a conservative majority on the supreme court   ask senator blumenthal about his vietnam record   trump told reporters at the meeting  in   while running for the senate  blumenthal said he had  misspoken about my service  by earlier stating he had served in vietnam when he in fact got military deferments before joining the u s  marine corps reserve in   allowing him to avoid combat overseas  blumenthal expressed regret over his previous comments but said he would proud of his service as a reservist  trump himself received five deferments during the vietnam war  including one for bone spurs in his heel  the new york times reported last august  and never served in the military
