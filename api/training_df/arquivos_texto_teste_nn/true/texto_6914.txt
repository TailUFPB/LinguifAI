new york washington  reuters    president elect donald trump will be able to make many of his promised changes in immigration policy unilaterally by exercising the same kind of executive powers he criticized president barack obama for using   but while most of the measures laid out in a ten point immigration policy plan on trump s transition website could be set in motion without legislative approval  fully implementing them would require funding that congress would have to approve  legal experts said      two core pieces of trump s plan  for example  involve removing more criminal immigrants who are in the country illegally and ending  catch and release  of those who cross the border illegally and are awaiting court hearings   shifting policy on both issues could be accomplished by putting out new enforcement directives to agents in the field from the department of homeland security       but the changes would be expensive  requiring a dramatic expansion of immigration courts and detention facilities used by immigration and customs enforcement  said  stephen yale loehr  an immigration law expert at cornell law school   more deportations would require more staff at every level of the system to investigate  apprehend and process those targeted  immigration courts already have a backload of more than   cases  detention space is currently stretched to house   immigrants currently awaiting deportation or hearings and far more holding facilities would be needed if detainees were no longer released while awaiting court dates    even then  completely ending the release of immigrants awaiting hearings would be difficult  a recent court decision has prohibited detention longer than  days for adults and children migrating together  a demographic that surged to more than   in fiscal year   trump s transition team has not explained how the new president intends to implement his plans    the president elect is very focused on naming his cabinet  building out his administration and preparing to hit the ground running on inauguration day   said jason miller  a spokesman for the trump transition team   there will be plenty of time to discuss detailed policy specifics after the swearing in   democratic attorneys general and civil rights groups are already busy preparing legal arguments to try to stop trump s executive actions should he implement some of his proposals  the pushback will be similar to the challenges obama faced from republican attorneys general and conservative groups when he acted alone to try to shield nearly  million immigrants from deportation       among the easiest immigration promises for trump to fulfill will be his vow to reverse obama s executive orders  the president elect could eliminate with a pen stroke obama s  policy allowing immigrants brought here illegally as children to apply for work permits  a program known as daca that trump has said he will end   what would happen next is unclear  more than   people have been approved for deportation relief under the program  and many worry that their addresses and other identifying information could be used by the new administration to target them for deportation   steve legomsky  former chief counsel at u s  citizenship and immigration services  said no laws would prevent the trump administration from using program records for immigration enforcement  but the president elect has not said he would do so   denying visas to people from countries  where adequate screening cannot occur   another point on trump s immigration plan  could also be easily accomplished by the president   under current law  the administration can unilaterally suspend visas for any individuals or groups of people deemed  detrimental to the interests of the united states    in the past  presidents have chosen to apply this statute narrowly   to keep out particular dictators or to deal with emergencies  for example  but the law is worded very broadly and could theoretically be applied to entire countries  said david martin  emeritus professor of international law at university of virginia school of law  trump s promise to make legal immigration better serve america and its domestic workforce would likely focus  at least initially  on temporary employment visas such as the  b  which are issued to specialized workers in fields such as technology   while congress sets the maximum number of visas that can be issued annually  trump could ask the department of justice to step up investigations of companies using those visas  with a focus on whether they are discriminating against american workers  this could include banning more tech outsourcing firms  which are the largest users of h  visas  from the program if they violate the rules  said ron hira  a professor at howard university    employers are going to be caught up in the cross hairs   said business immigration lawyer matthew dunn from the law firm kramer levin
