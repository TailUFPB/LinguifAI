washington  reuters    donald trump s successful campaign for the white house broke every tradition and upended the political establishment with the same bluster  hyperbole and media mastery that made him one of the world s best known businessmen  trump told supporters at a rally early on wednesday he had received a call from his democratic rival hillary clinton  congratulating him on his victory  from his grand trump tower escalator entrance into the republican presidential race on june     trump managed to be simultaneously charismatic and combative  elitist and populist  lewd and pious as he drilled into a lode of polarity and anti washington anger among american voters  it was his first run for public office and trump  a real estate developer  reality television star and self confessed owner of a big ego  called it a movement  not a campaign  he drew large  enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for  just saying what everybody s thinking   critics labeled him misogynistic  ill informed  uncouth  unpresidential  a racist  a hypocrite  a demagogue and a sexual predator  all accusations he denied  it took trump    little more than  months to vanquish  other republican candidates and win the party s nomination  becoming the first major party nominee without government experience since general dwight eisenhower in the   he drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the republican party  then trump squared off against clinton    in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff  charges he had groped women and unheeded demands that he release his tax records  he said that as president he would investigate clinton for her use of email while secretary of state  he vowed to send her to jail  his campaign took a scandalous turn in october with the release of a  video in which trump  unaware he was being recorded  told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that  because he was rich and famous  he could grab them by the genitals with impunity  trump dismissed the remarks as  locker room talk  and denied the subsequent accusations from more than  women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances  throughout his campaign   and especially in his republican convention speech in july   trump described a dark america that had been knocked to its knees by china  mexico  russia and islamic state  the american dream was dead  he said  smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians  and he said he alone could revive it  trump said he would make america great again through the force of his personality  negotiating skill and business acumen  he offered vague plans to win economic concessions from china  to build a wall on the southern u s  border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make mexico pay for it  he vowed to repeal obamacare while being the  greatest jobs president that god ever created  and has proposed refusing entry to the united states of people from war torn middle eastern nations  a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on muslims  trump promoted himself as the ultimate success story  he dated beautiful women  married three of them  had his own television show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters  everything in his life was the greatest  the hugest  the classiest  the most successful  he said  even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies  the failures of his atlantic city  new jersey  casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes  trump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand  it was expected to be short lived but as the election season progressed  he became the republican front runner  winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large scale rallies and mostly ignored grass roots work  his hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein in trump  his inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children   donald jr   eric and ivanka  along with ivanka s husband  jared kushner  the rise of trump  once a registered democrat  threatened to blow up the republican party  its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him  prominent republicans   including former presidents george h w  bush and george w  bush and congressional leaders   shunned him or offered lukewarm support  trump used twitter as a weapon  firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him  including  crooked hillary  and republican rivals  little marco  rubio  jeb  low energy  bush and  lyin  ted  cruz  another target was the family of a muslim u s  army captain who died fighting in iraq after the soldier s father had spoken against trump at the democratic national convention  trump sniped back for days despite his advisers urging him to move on  as of late october  the new york times had counted  people and things he had insulted on twitter since declaring his candidacy  the trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions  the candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the united states had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries  the man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself  undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country  he said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged  he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate carly fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of fox news  megyn kelly  trump s campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of  the apprentice   a reality tv show where he barked a crowd pleasing  you re fired   at contestants who fell short in competitions  his speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his iq  he peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations  misperceptions and false statements  he suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop clinton from nominating liberal u s  supreme court justices  a remark the clinton campaign called dangerous  trump boasted of a fortune he put at   billion  although in september forbes magazine estimated it at    billion  making him the  richest american  trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate  such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on  avenue in new york and not lose a single vote  in may he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge   born in the united states to mexican immigrants   who was hearing a lawsuit against him  no other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate  he was flattered when russian president vladimir putin called him a  brilliant and talented leader       trump mocked senator john mccain  the republicans  presidential candidate in   for having been captured during the vietnam war and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face at a trump rally  trump was born to money on june     in the new york city borough of queens  the fourth of five children of fred trump  who would become one of the city s biggest developers and landlords  and his wife  it was fred trump who taught donald the value of self promotion and a killer instinct  by his own admission  trump was not an easy child and in the eighth grade his parents sent him to the new york military academy in hopes of instilling needed discipline  through student and medical deferments during the vietnam war  trump would never serve in the u s  military but said the school gave him  more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military   after graduating from the university of pennsylvania  trump went to work for his father s company  which focused on the outer new york city boroughs of queens  brooklyn and staten island and owned an estimated   apartments  in  the trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the u s  government  with a   million loan from his father  trump eventually went into business himself in manhattan  where he became a regular at some of the city s most exclusive clubs and developed a reputation as a ladies  man  he soon made his mark with a series of real estate and development deals  including redoing an old hotel at new york s grand central terminal  in  he opened his flagship   story trump tower  which serves as both his primary residence and trump organization headquarters  more projects around the world would follow  including golf courses  the mar a lago private resort in florida  new york s venerable plaza hotel and casinos  trump s projects had mixed success  the flops included the real estate oriented trump university  trump mortgage  trump airlines and trump vodka but it was his experience with four casinos in atlantic city  new jersey  that took the golden luster off his empire  timothy o brien  author of  trumpnation  the art of being the donald   wrote that in the  trump was out of money and twice had to go to his siblings for loans  a former employee said the trump organization would have shut down if the family had not come through but trump disputed that in his  book  trump  the art of the comeback   while he never filed for personal bankruptcy  the downturn in the gaming industry sent parts of trump s corporate empire to bankruptcy court in      and   in the  bankruptcy  the unsecured creditors received less than a penny on the dollar for their claim  trump resigned as chairman four days before the filing
