washington  reuters    democrat hillary clinton said on monday she could resume presidential campaigning in a couple of days after a bout of pneumonia that she initially had not believed was  that big a deal   clinton s health scare after she almost collapsed at an event on sunday  causing her to cancel some campaign trips  revived concerns about a tendency toward secrecy that has dogged her campaign  and underscored perennial worries about the medical fitness of candidates for one of the world s most demanding jobs   well  it will be in the next couple of days      i just want to get this over and done with and get back on the trail as soon as possible   she said in an interview on cnn on monday night  adding she had ignored doctor s orders to rest    i just didn t think it was going to be that big a deal    her campaign acknowledged on monday it may have been too slow disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis after she nearly fainted at a new york memorial ceremony for the sept      attacks  she was diagnosed with the lung infection on friday   i think that in retrospect  we could have handled it better in terms of providing more information more quickly   clinton spokesman brian fallon told msnbc earlier in the day  the health problem was the latest blow for the democratic presidential nominee at a time when republican rival donald trump has erased most of her lead in national opinion polls and is competitive again in many battleground states where the nov   election is likely to be decided  clinton    said she had dealt with similar episodes of dizziness before   you know  it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life  i m aware of it and usually can avoid it   she told cnn  asked if she passed out during the incident on sunday  she said   no  i didn t  i felt dizzy and i did lose my balance for a minute  once i got in  once i could sit down  once i could cool off  once i had some water  i immediately started feeling better     her campaign said her husband  former president bill clinton  would campaign on her behalf while she rests  both clinton and trump    said they intended to release more of their medical details in the coming days  as their campaigns gear up for the november election  questions about the incident reinforced the perception of clinton as secretive  a view fueled by the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while serving as president barack obama s secretary of state from  to   a federal investigation of that issue said she was  extremely careless  in her handling of classified emails  but did not recommend criminal charges  trump said on monday that health was a campaign issue but he did not attack clinton over her physical condition   i just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail   he said in an interview with fox news  he focused his criticism on comments by clinton last week in which she dismissed half of his supporters as a  basket of deplorables  of racist  homophobic people  clinton said she regretted the remark  trump has compared the comment with a much criticized remark by  republican presidential nominee mitt romney that  percent of the electorate was dependent on the government   i was deeply shocked and alarmed to hear my opponent attack  slander  smear  demean these wonderful  amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions   trump told a conference of national guard members in baltimore  trump has himself aroused controversy with comments in which he called some mexican immigrants criminals and rapists  questioned whether a u s  born judge could be fair because of his mexican heritage and criticized the muslim parents of an american soldier who died in combat in iraq   short term turbulence  clinton s pneumonia disclosure was made public hours after her campaign said she had become  overheated  to explain why  her knees buckling and unsteady  she was rushed from the sept   ceremony   the short term turbulence will be more about the handling of this than the substance   david axelrod  a former political adviser to obama  told reuters    antibiotics can take care of pneumonia   axelrod tweeted later   what s the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems   trump had suggested for weeks that clinton lacked the energy needed to be president  he has raised questions about her stamina  reprising a tactic from the republican primary campaign when he derided rival jeb bush as a  low energy  candidate   democrats said her attendance at events despite her pneumonia diagnosis proved her toughness  trump s campaign has issued a short letter from his doctor saying he was in excellent health with  extraordinary  strength and stamina  but the letter did not mention what medicine trump might be taking or other details typically included in such disclosures  in july   clinton released a two page letter outlining her medical condition that sought to reassure americans about her health after she fell and suffered a concussion at home in  near the end of her tenure as secretary of state
