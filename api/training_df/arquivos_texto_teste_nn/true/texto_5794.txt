  in this jan   story  in  paragraph corrects to show two iranian plaintiffs are a man and a woman  not two men  by scott malone and dan levine boston san francisco  reuters    legal challenges to president donald trump s first moves on immigration spread on tuesday  with three states suing over his executive order banning travel into the united states by citizens of seven majority muslim countries  massachusetts  new york  virginia and washington state joined the legal battle against the travel ban  which the white house deems necessary to improve national security  the challenges contend the order violated the u s  constitution s guarantees of religious freedom  san francisco became the first u s  city to sue to challenge a trump directive to withhold federal money from u s  cities that have adopted sanctuary policies toward undocumented immigrants  which local officials argue help local police by making those immigrants more willing to report crimes  the legal maneuvers were the latest acts of defiance against executive orders signed by trump last week that sparked a wave of protests in major u s  cities  where thousands of people decried the new president s actions as discriminatory  both policies are in line with campaign promises by republican businessman turned politician trump  who vowed to build a wall on the mexican border to stop illegal immigration and to take hard line steps to prevent terrorist attacks in the united states  the restrictions on the seven muslim majority countries and new limits on refugees have won the support of many americans  with  percent of respondents to a reuters poll conducted monday and tuesday saying they agreed with the order  while  percent disagreed  massachusetts contended the restrictions run afoul of the establishment clause of the  amendment of the u s  constitution  which prohibits religious preference   at bottom  what this is about is a violation of the constitution   massachusetts attorney general maura healey said of the order halting travel by people with passports from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  the order also barred resettlement of refugees for  days and indefinitely banned syrian refugees   it discriminates against people because of their religion  it discriminates against people because of their country of origin   healey said at a boston press conference  flanked by leaders from the tech  healthcare and education sectors who said that the order could limit their ability to attract and retain highly educated workers  massachusetts will be backing a lawsuit filed over the weekend in boston federal court by two iranian men who teach at the university of massachusetts at dartmouth  a federal judge blocked the government from expelling those men from the country and halted enforcement of the order for seven days  following similar but more limited moves in four other states  the attorneys general of new york and virginia also said their states were joining similar lawsuits filed in their respective federal courts challenging the ban   as we speak  there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to virginia   virginia attorney general mark herring told reporters   this is not an action i take lightly  but it is one i take with confidence in our legal analysis   on monday  liberal leaning washington state became the first u s  state to have its attorney general initiate a lawsuit against trump to challenge the travel ban  multiple foreign nationals have also filed lawsuits challenging the ban  they included one filed in colorado on tuesday by a libyan college student and two filed in chicago   including one on behalf of an iranian father of three children all living in illinois  protests against trump s executive action continued on tuesday in several cities    a crowd of several thousand demonstrators gathered at the federal courthouse in minneapolis  chanting  hey  hey  ho  ho muslim ban has got to go   dozens of protesters chanted the same slogan at los angeles international airport  and more than  demonstrators gathered in downtown miami to protest both the travel ban and trump s crackdown on sanctuary cities  san francisco city attorney dennis herrera filed suit over trump s order threatening to cut funds to cities with sanctuary policies  a move that could stop the flow of billions of dollars to major u s  population centers including new york  los angeles and chicago   if allowed to be implemented  this executive order would make our communities less safe  it would make our residents less prosperous  and it would split families apart   herrera said  sanctuary cities adopt policies that limit cooperation  such as refusing to comply with u s  immigration and customs enforcement detainer requests  advocates of the policies say that  beyond helping police with crime reporting  they make undocumented immigrants more willing to serve as witnesses if they do not fear that contact with law enforcement will lead to their deportation  both the san francisco and massachusetts actions contend that trump s orders in question violate the  amendment of the u s  constitution  which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states  michael hethmon  senior counsel with the conservative immigration reform law institute in washington  called the san francisco lawsuit a  silly political gesture   noting that prior federal court decisions make clear that the u s  government  can prohibit a policy that essentially impedes legitimate federal programs
