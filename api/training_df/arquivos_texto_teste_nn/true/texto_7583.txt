washington  reuters    in a blow to republican presidential candidate donald trump  a u s  judge on thursday upheld a pennsylvania state law that could make it difficult for his supporters to monitor election day activity in democratic leaning areas  trump has repeatedly said tuesday s presidential election may be rigged  without providing scant evidence  and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in philadelphia and other heavily democratic areas   democrats worry that could encourage trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether trump or his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  wins the presidency  voting rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment  democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down trump s poll watching efforts in pennsylvania and three other battleground states  arguing in lawsuits that republican monitoring efforts amount to  vigilante voter intimidation  that violates federal law  they filed a fourth lawsuit in north carolina on thursday  democrats are also trying to stop the republican national committee from supporting the poll watching efforts of the trump campaign or state parties   those cases have not yet been resolved  the rnc has said in legal motions that it is not involved in poll watching  which would violate a long standing court order  state parties have argued that they are engaged in legitimate efforts to make sure the election is conducted accurately  while trump s vice presidential running mate  mike pence  and his campaign manager  kellyanne conway  said they misspoke when they told media outlets that the campaign was working with the rnc on poll watching efforts  in pennsylvania  trump s poll monitoring plan faces a significant hurdle because state law requires partisan poll watchers to perform their duties in the county in which they are registered to vote   that could make it difficult to recruit monitors in places like philadelphia  where democrats outnumber republicans by a ratio of eight to one  the city has   registered republicans and   voting locations  the pennsylvania republican party sought to suspend that requirement so that poll monitors could come from anywhere in the state  which would enable them to bring in supporters from suburban and rural areas where trump has stronger support  but u s  district judge gerald pappert said that would be too disruptive to change the law less than a week before tuesday s vote   the republican party of pennsylvania did not respond to a request for comment  republican training materials submitted as evidence in several cases show the party is instructing poll monitors not to interact directly with voters  but to contact officials if they see a problem  that appeared to be the message in southern ohio as well  where trump supporter becky covey said the observers she had recruited were told not to interfere with voting activity   people think they re going to be a watchdog  but that s not their job   covey said  those guidelines could have little influence on trump supporters who decide to engage in anti fraud efforts of their own on election day  the oath keepers  a paramilitary group  plans an undercover effort to monitor voting locations  while trump ally roger stone is mobilizing supporters to conduct an exit poll to double check election results  one right wing group told the news website politico that it has already installed hidden cameras in philadelphia polling stations   with early voting underway  civil rights advocates said they were already receiving reports of intimidation and harassment   palm beach county  florida  plans to station law enforcement officers at an early voting site through election day after fielding complaints about bullhorn wielding trump supporters getting too close  according to propublica  democrats in nevada alleged that trump supporters have yelled at voters and tried to block them from entering early voting sites  while civil rights groups in north carolina and texas said they have received reports of intimidating behavior at early voting sites   we are seeing an uptick in the number of complaints compared to    said kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  a watchdog group
