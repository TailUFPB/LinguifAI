san juan  reuters    the congress  latest attempt to solve puerto rico s debt crisis appears to strengthen some   though not all   creditor positions in what has been a robust fight to influence the writing of a bill that lawmakers started to debate on tuesday  the house natural resources committee presented the legislation  formally called the puerto rico oversight  management and economic stability act or promesa  last week after several false starts  the bill would put puerto rico s finances under a federally appointed oversight board  while allowing the u s  territory to restructure a   billion debt load that threatens to collapse an economy already hamstrung by rampant emigration and a  percent poverty rate  while that structure is unchanged from prior drafts  several small tweaks seem to benefit bondholders  including restricting the government s ability to override decisions of the seven member board   still  other elements of the bill are ambiguous  experts say   including the ability of puerto rico to enforce cuts to creditors  debt portfolios through a bankruptcy like court process without their consent  this is also referred to as a  cram down    it doesn t strike me that there are obvious winners and losers   said david skeel  a bankruptcy expert and professor at the university of pennsylvania law school  adding   a lot will depend on who ends up on the control board  and what stance the control board takes   the bill also allows provisions for puerto rico s  distinct debt issuing agencies to try to come to terms consensually with creditors  through a cooperative process where creditors would be able to vote on debt restructuring plans  two thirds of a creditor class would need to support a plan for it to take effect  promesa  also referred to as h r    gives significant latitude to the board to manage puerto rico s books and form a plan to stabilize its finances  in a change from a prior version released in april  the bill would strengthen language barring the puerto rican government from passing any laws to curb the board s authority   at the end of the day  the real virtue and vice of this bill is the strength of the control board   height securities analyst daniel hanson  who follows puerto rico closely  said in an interview      the latest draft would also restrict the government s ability to transfer property on which creditors have liens  in the case of a proposal to cut repayments to creditors  it would compel a judge to assess the fairness of the proposal against puerto rico s constitution  a protection absent from the april draft  such protections seemed to modestly reassure markets when the bill was unveiled last week and investors bid up prices on puerto rico s benchmark july  general obligation debt   the revised language is certainly more positive for the commonwealth s go  general obligation  and go guaranteed bondholders as it attempts to preserve the constitutional protections they currently enjoy   bank of america merrill lynch analysts wrote clients   cram down   still  the new bill retains enough ambiguity to make some creditors nervous  most significantly  it preserves cram down power and in one sense makes it easier to start the process   that is because the latest draft of promesa removes a pre condition to cram down which would have required puerto rico to first complete consensual workout talks with creditors  allowing them to vote on a restructuring plan   the current bill merely requires puerto rico to make  good faith efforts  toward a cooperative deal before initiating a cram down action   determining when puerto rico had satisfied that fuzzier standard would be up to the oversight board  giving the board more leeway on deciding when to push puerto rico into bankruptcy  and thus more leverage in creditor talks  said melissa jacoby  a bankruptcy expert and professor at university of north carolina school of law    it s important that the restructuring provisions are strong enough to provide the leverage to encourage voluntary deals   jacoby said in an interview   this bill asks a lot of puerto rico in some respects  and therefore  it s not a good deal for puerto rico unless it has a robust restructuring possibility   one creditor source who was not authorized to speak to the press voiced concern over how the  good faith efforts  standard would be assessed   we don t know how the it will be enforced and those are the questions we ll be asking
