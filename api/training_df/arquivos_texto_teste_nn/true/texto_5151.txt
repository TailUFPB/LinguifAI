washington  reuters    with his administration on the defensive over investigations into alleged russian meddling in last year s election  u s  president donald trump is no longer tweeting praise for his kremlin counterpart  less than five weeks after he took office  the chances of a spring thaw in relations between washington and moscow   once buoyed by an apparent  bromance  between trump and president vladimir putin during the u s  political campaign   are looking much dimmer  u s  officials say  his top foreign policy advisers have started talking tougher on russia  and the apparent cooling of trump s approach follows the resignation last month of his first national security adviser  michael flynn  a vocal advocate of warmer ties with moscow  he was replaced by army lieutenant general h r  mcmaster  who is more hawkish on russia and allied with defense secretary jim mattis  a retired marine corps general  in one other sign of a stiffening attitude  two officials said the administration had offered the job of top russia adviser at the national security council to russia scholar fiona hill  a leading putin critic  her books include  mr  putin  operative in the kremlin   an allusion to the russian leader s past as a kgb officer  it was not immediately known whether she had accepted the post   pressure also has come to bear from trump s fellow republicans in congress  long wary of his campaign overtures to putin  and from european allies anxious over any sign that the president might prematurely ease sanctions imposed on russia after its annexation of crimea and support for pro russian rebels in ukraine  posing fresh obstacles to rapprochement with russia  analysts say  is mounting evidence that attorney general jeff sessions  the president s son in law jared kushner  and other members of trump s team communicated with russian officials during and after the presidential campaign  the mushrooming inquiry   which is now focused on sessions and his contacts with moscow s ambassador to washington   has fueled calls for expanded investigations into allegations that moscow sought to sway the election s outcome   there is so much panic in the u s  political establishment over russia right now that trump will be boxed in on what he can do   said matthew rojansky  a russia expert at the wilson center think tank in washington  white house officials say there were no improper contacts  and russia denies any meddling  while trump has yet to lay down his russia policy  most signs suggest no swift changes in the relationship  which sank to a post cold war low under his predecessor barack obama  mostly due to bitter differences over syria and ukraine  mattis sought to reassure nato allies during a visit to europe last month  telling them there would be no military cooperation between the united states and russia in the near future  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley this week denounced russia for casting a veto to protect the syrian government from security council action over accusations of chemical weapons use  and also recently insisted the united states would not recognize russia s seizure of crimea  trump s openness to closer ties to russia and his emphasis  particularly during the campaign  on fighting terrorism sparked concerns among current and former u s  officials that he might trade away u s  interests in other areas in exchange for military and intelligence cooperation against groups such as islamic state  trump s language on russia now has shifted somewhat from campaign days  when he tweeted his admiration for putin as a strong leader  and the russian president paid him compliments  trump told a news conference in mid february that   i would love to be able to get along with russia   but added that   it s possible i won t be able to get along with putin       two senior european officials this week told reporters in washington they discerned an evolution in the trump administration s stance toward russia  saying there appeared to be no desire to engage in such a  grand bargain  in which  for example  ukraine related sanctions might be eased in return for russian action on other issues       what we consider reassuring is that  at least during our meetings  nobody came with this idea of a grand bargain  with the idea of a big deal   said one senior european official on condition of anonymity      said a second senior european official   vis a vis russia  to be frank i have the impression that the analysis and the positions of this administration are probably now closer to our position than  they  may have been two or three months ago    recent russian actions have created new complications  including a stepped up offensive by pro russian separatist forces in eastern ukraine and what the pentagon described as the bombing this week by russian and syrian aircraft of u s  backed syrian rebels   something moscow denied had happened  for its part  the kremlin said on wednesday it was patiently waiting for  some kind of actions  from the trump administration so that it could understand what the future holds for relations   we have heard different statements from president trump   dmitry peskov  putin s spokesman  told reporters  u s  senator marco rubio  a republican member of the foreign relations committee and former  presidential candidate  had words of caution for trump about future dealings with putin   we have had two presidents   a republican and a democrat   previous to the current president who thought they could do such a deal with vladimir putin   he said on the senate floor on wednesday   both of them fell on their face because they did not  understand what they were dealing with  it is my sincerest hope that our current president doesn t make the same mistakes   rubio said   this version of the story corrects defense secretary s first name  paragraph
