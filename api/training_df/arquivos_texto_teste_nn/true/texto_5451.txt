san francisco  reuters    the most consequential legal challenge to u s  president donald trump s travel ban will proceed on two tracks in the next few days  in a u s  appeals court vote in san francisco and the seattle courtroom of a federal judge  the  u s  circuit court of appeals will vote on whether to reconsider an appeal in the case that was decided in the seattle court last week  that vote could reveal which judges disagree with their colleagues on the bench and support the arguments behind the new president s most controversial executive order  in seattle  the state of washington will attempt to probe trump s motive in drafting the jan   order  in another case  in virginia  a federal judge on late monday halted enforcement of portions of the order against virginia visa holders or permanent residents  concluding that the travel ban likely violates the u s  constitution s protections for freedom of religion   the rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits  ultimately  they will have to address questions about the extent of the president s power on matters of immigration and national security  traditionally  judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch s authority in such matters  legal experts say  trump s directive  which he said was necessary to protect the united states from attacks by islamist militants  barred people from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen from entering the country for  days  refugees were banned for  days  except those from syria  who were banned indefinitely  the ban was backed by around half of americans  according to a reuters ipsos poll  but triggered protests across the country and caused chaos at some u s  and overseas airports   u s  district judge james robart in seattle suspended the order nationwide after washington state challenged its legality  eliciting a barrage of angry twitter messages from trump against the judge and the court system  a three judge panel at the  u s  circuit court of appeals in san francisco upheld the ruling last week  raising questions about trump s next step  in the virginia case  u s  district judge leonie brinkema said there was a lack of evidence showing a national security purpose for the executive order and issued a preliminary injunction against parts of it   while the ruling is not on the underlying merits of the case  brinkema noted   the  muslim ban  was a centerpiece of the president s campaign for months    legal experts said no other judge has so fully considered the question of whether the order amounted to a discriminatory ban on muslims  according to brinkema   the evidence indicates the government s purpose was based on religion   said nelson tebbe  a professor at brooklyn law school  adding that the ruling could influence other judges  views on the matter  at a seattle court hearing on monday  robart said he would move forward with discovery in the case  meaning the request and exchange of information pertinent to the case between the opposing parties   meanwhile  an unidentified judge on the  circuit last week requested that the court s  full time judges vote on whether the temporary restraining order robart imposed on trump s travel ban should be reconsidered by an  judge panel  known as en banc review  the  circuit asked both sides to file briefs by thursday  since judges appointed by democrats hold an   edge on the  circuit  legal experts say it is unlikely a majority will disagree with the court s earlier ruling and want it reconsidered   arthur hellman  a professor at the university of pittsburgh school of law who has studied the  circuit  noted that one of the three judges who issued the original ruling was appointed by president george w  bush   even if the en banc vote fails  however  judges on the  circuit who disagree with last week s ruling will be able to publicly express their disagreement in court filings  which could help create a record bolstering trump s position  meanwhile  the government has signaled that it is considering issuing a new executive order to replace the original one  in that case  it could tell the  circuit later this week that it does not want en banc review  because the case would be moot   you would think jeff sessions would do whatever he had to do to get this case ended as soon as possible   hellman said  referring to the recently appointed u s  attorney general
