washington ft  lauderdale  fla   reuters    a top aide to hillary clinton urged the fbi on tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between donald trump and russia  accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into clinton s email practices while staying quiet about the republican presidential candidate  the federal bureau of investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with russian people or businesses  but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation  according to sources familiar with the matter  the agency has not publicly discussed the probe  a week before election day  the clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by fbi director james comey on friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to clinton s use of a private server while she was secretary of state  clinton has voiced confidence the fbi will not find anything problematic  she campaigned on tuesday in the battleground state of florida  where she was joined in dade city by former miss universe alicia machado  whom trump had mocked for gaining weight  chants of  lock her up   from dozens of trump supporters gathered nearby could be faintly heard while clinton spoke  in ft  lauderdale  a young man who yelled   she s a liar  was escorted out of the rally  several other protesters removed during the course of her speech   i am sick and tired of the negative  dark  divisive  dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump   clinton said as another protester was removed from the rally  trump and other republicans have seized on comey s announcement  which did not indicate any wrongdoing by clinton  to ratchet up criticism of the democratic candidate  she leads in most opinion polls ahead of the nov   election  trump urged people on tuesday who voted early for his democratic rival to cancel their ballots and switch to him   this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and who are having a bad case of buyer s remorse  in other words you want to change your vote   trump told a wisconsin rally   so if you live here or in michigan or pennsylvania or minnesota  you can change your vote to donald trump   several states  including those cited by trump  have a process to allow voters who cast early ballots to change their votes  either by submitting new ballots or showing up at their polling place on election day   clinton campaign manager robby mook questioned why the fbi director had not released any information about the agency s russia inquiries   if you re in the business of releasing information about investigations on presidential candidates  release everything you have on donald trump  release the information on his connections to the russians   mook said on cnn  the fbi inquiry reviewed allegations that trump or his associates might have violated the foreign corrupt practices act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in russia who are subject to u s  or international financial sanctions       the u s  government has blamed russia for cyber attacks on democratic party organizations  democrats criticize trump for taking what they say is a pro russia foreign policy stance  russia s possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the trump organization and computers inside a russian company  alfa bank in moscow  trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks said the server  which had been used to send out hotel marketing material  had been dormant for years                 prominent u s  cyber security company fireeye said it had been hired by alfa bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the bank s systems in moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with trump s company or any signs of hacking or infection  fireeye said so far it had found no emails being sent back and forth or any other link  opinion polls showed clinton s lead has narrowed slightly since early last week but it was too early to say whether the email controversy was hurting her  clinton led businessman trump in the latest reuters ipsos poll of likely voters released on monday  by  percent to  percent  clinton  hoping to be the first woman elected president  strengthened her lead over trump in polls after the release last month of a  video in which the republican bragged in vulgar terms about groping women          but in a dramatic twist  comey told congress in a letter on friday that the fbi was reviewing the newly discovered emails  comey had announced in july that the fbi had completed a probe into the email practices  concluding there were no grounds to bring any charges  clinton s team has been pressing the fbi to provide details on the new trove of emails  which comey said may or may not be significant in the case   little is publicly known yet about the emails  other than that they were found during an unrelated probe into former u s  representative anthony weiner  the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin  comey s letter has provided republicans with fresh fodder for attack in the waning days of the campaign  u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on tuesday that a clinton presidency would bog down in  scandal baggage   congressional republicans  who had been concerned trump risked damaging their majorities in the house and senate  were also encouraged by his recent statements on efforts to repeal the affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  a campaign aide said if trump wins  he would ask congress to begin working on legislation to repeal the law before the jan   inauguration
