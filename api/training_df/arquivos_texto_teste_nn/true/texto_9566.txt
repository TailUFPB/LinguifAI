geneva  reuters    hollywood actor michael douglas  a u n   messenger for peace   wants president barack obama to issue a strong message against nuclear weapons when he visits hiroshima in japan later this month  douglas told reporters at the united nations in geneva  where nuclear negotiations have been stuck for  years  that the nuclear danger was greater than during the cold war   largely due to a  huge escalation  in u s  russia tensions and increasing recklessness in their close quarter contacts   there s this kind of crazy tension between u s  and russia  we have our issues but i don t quite see that all of this posturing is helping anybody   he said   the number of weapons that are on trigger alert is frightening  so the time for somebody to possibly make a mistake and correct it is very very short   douglas said he  found religion  in the anti nuclear cause after the three mile island nuclear accident in   within days of the opening of his film the china syndrome  which dealt with an emergency at a nuclear plant    standing beside joseph cirincione  president of ploughshares fund  a global security organization  douglas recalled obama s  speech in prague  where the president promised concrete steps to wards a nuclear free world   i think we could say he s been a disappointment because there s not been follow through  and i do hope now for his legacy as he begins to leave office  that he s going to have something strong to say at hiroshima   cirincione said obama had made good early progress on nuclear non proliferation  but had made only modest cuts in arsenals and was leaving   trillion in new nuclear contracts in the pipeline for his successor   every single weapon in the nuclear arsenal is now due for replacement or an upgrade  it s a looming disaster   he said  douglas    said he was also a friend of donald trump  but he was not confident the united states would make any advances in nuclear disarmament if trump won the presidency    i guess one of his strengths  or weaknesses depending how you look at it  is his unpredictability   he said
