washington  reuters    u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday  all options  were being considered over the possible discipline of house democrats for protests they held on the house floor to call for action on gun control measures  with democrats already rejecting a republican gun bill and warning of further protests  the republican controlled house appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the june  mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando  florida  ryan  who was speaking at a news conference  had previously said the house would vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism  but it is no longer clear when a vote might be held  democrats say the republican backed legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked
