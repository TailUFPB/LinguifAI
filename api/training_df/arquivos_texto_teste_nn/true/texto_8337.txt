paris brussels  reuters    france cast serious doubt on tuesday on the prospects of an eu free trade deal with the united states  adding to opposition within germany and growing scepticism among americans  washington and brussels are officially committed to sealing the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  ttip  before u s  president barack obama leaves office in january  but their chances of doing so are being eroded by approaching elections on both sides of the atlantic and britain s vote in june to leave the european union   everything is moving  in this situation it s just not going to happen   said peter van ham  senior research fellow at dutch think tank clingendael and author of a paper on tuesday called  ttip is dead  long live transatlantic trade   french trade minister matthias fekl said he would request a halt to ttip talks at next month s eu trade ministers  meeting in bratislava after german economy minister sigmar gabriel declared at the weekend that talks were  de facto dead   observers say both are responding to public mistrust of a deal that critics say would lower environmental and food standards and allow foreign multinationals to challenge government policies   stop ttip campaigns have been particularly vocal in germany and austria  which supporters of ttip say are among the countries most likely to benefit from increased u s  trade  in the united states  obama has promoted the accord  saying it would fuel growth  but the public mood is turning increasingly negative  with republican presidential candidate donald trump making attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign  saying they have cost u s  jobs   his opponent  democratic nominee hillary clinton  has also stepped back from her previous support for free trade when she was u s  secretary of state  and has questioned whether trade deals hold down u s  wages     german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier  of gabriel s social democratic party  spd   urged diplomats and business chiefs on tuesday to counter anti globalization sentiments that are fuelling opposition to free trade deals  ahead of elections in france and germany next year  politicians are keenly aware that ttip is not a vote winner   the bertelsmann foundation poll showed only  percent of germans saw ttip as a good thing in april  down from  percent two years earlier   there may be an economic rationale  but everyone is scrapping for votes and you lose votes if you support ttip   van ham said  adding that any credit from potential free trade gains  would be two to three years away  supporters say ttip could boost each economy by   billion  creating jobs at a time of economic uncertainty as growth and consumption slow in china and emerging markets  eu leaders backed ttip talks at a summit in june  speaking to reporters in washington  white house spokesman josh earnest admitted  significant aspects  of the deal were unresolved  but said u s  trade representative michael froman would travel to europe in an effort to push the talks forward   i anticipate that when he travels to europe in mid september that they ll be engaged in substantive discussions and hopefully will be able to make some additional progress   earnest said  three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences  however  including over public procurement and rules to protect foods from particular regions  such as parma ham  which the eu wants  and greater access to services and for its agricultural products  as demanded by the united states   practically there s no real change  it s been stuck for the better part of two years   said hosuk lee makiyama  director of brussels based think tank ecipe  eu trade chief cecelia malmstrom told journalists  negotiations had not failed and that many eu countries had said they still backed ttip  they included italy  whose trade and industry minister said it was essential for italian exporters that the negotiations bore fruit  germany s gabriel is the chairman of the spd who share power with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives  merkel backs the talks and her spokesman insisted on monday that they should continue    malmstrom added that it made no sense to suspend talks in september because the two sides could still make advances in regulatory cooperation  agreeing standards that are important to industries such as the auto sector  and that could be picked up by obama s successor even if a deal was not sealed this year   the more work we have done  the easier it is to resume   she said before a planned video conference with froman   froman has said britain s eu exit will affect ttip because britain consumes about a quarter of u s  exports to the bloc  trade analysts say that washington may be preparing for the end of trade talks  which typically conclude with each side holding the other responsible for failure   president francois hollande told ambassadors on tuesday that talks were  bogged down  and  unbalanced  and it was an illusion to imagine that a deal could be sealed during obama s term   very soon you end in a blame game   said lee makiyama   but trade negotiations never really die  they just go into a stock taking phase
