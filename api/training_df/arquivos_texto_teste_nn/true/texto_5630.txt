washington  reuters    president donald trump on sunday ramped up his criticism of a federal judge who blocked a travel ban on seven mainly muslim nations and said courts were making u s  border security harder  intensifying the first major legal battle of his presidency  in a series of tweets that broadened his attack on the country s judiciary  trump said americans should blame u s  district judge james robart and the court system if anything happened  trump did not elaborate on what threats the country potentially faced  he added that he had told the department of homeland security to  check people coming into our country very carefully  the courts are making the job very difficult   the republican president labeled robart a  so called judge  on saturday  a day after the seattle jurist issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of a  day ban on citizens from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen and a  day bar on all refugees  a u s  appeals court later on saturday denied the government s request for an immediate stay of the ruling  vice president mike pence defended trump earlier on sunday  even as some republicans encouraged the businessman turned politician to tone down his broadsides against the judicial branch of government   the president of the united states has every right to criticize the other two branches of government   pence said on nbc s  meet the press  program  it is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary  which the u s  constitution designates as a check on the power of the executive branch and congress  u s  senator patrick leahy  the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee  said trump seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis  some republicans also expressed discomfort with the situation   i think it is best not to single out judges for criticism   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on cnn s  state of the union  program   we all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about  but i think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually   republican senator ben sasse  a vocal critic of trump  was less restrained   we don t have so called judges     we don t have so called presidents  we have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the constitution   he said on the abc news program  this week       the ruling by robart  appointed by former republican president george w  bush  coupled with the decision by the  u s  circuit court of appeals in san francisco to deny the government s request for an immediate stay of the ruling dealt a blow to trump barely two weeks into his presidency   it could also be the precursor to months of legal challenges to his push to clamp down on immigration  including through the construction of a wall on the u s  mexican border  and complicate the confirmation battle of his u s  supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  the senate s top democrat  chuck schumer  said on saturday that gorsuch  a conservative federal appeals court judge from colorado  must meet a higher bar to show his independence from the president  trump  who during his presidential campaign called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  has vowed to reinstate his controversial travel ban  he says the measures are needed to protect the united states from islamist militants  critics say they are unjustified and discriminatory  the legal limbo will prevail at least until the federal appeals court rules on the government s application for an emergency stay of robart s ruling  the court was awaiting further submissions from the states of washington and minnesota on sunday  and from the federal government on monday  the final filing was due at  p m  pst on monday   gmt on tuesday   the uncertainty has created what may be a short lived opportunity for travelers from the seven affected countries as well as refugees to get into the united states    sara yarjani  an iranian student with a u s  visa who was attempting to return to los angeles to visit her parents  was among those who boarded flights to the united states after learning that trump s travel ban had been blocked  her visa had been stamped  revoked  and she was sent back to vienna last week  she was slated to arrive in los angeles on sunday  according to her sister  sahara muranovic    this is our only window   muranovic said   maybe they ll blow it again by monday   trump s jan   travel restrictions have drawn protests in the united states  provoked criticism from u s  allies and created chaos for thousands of people who have  in some cases  spent years seeking asylum  reacting to the latest court ruling  iraqi government spokesman saad al hadithi said   it is a move in the right direction to solve the problems that it caused   in his ruling on friday  robart questioned the use of the sept     attacks on the united states as a justification for the ban  saying no attacks had been carried out on u s  soil by individuals from the seven affected countries since then  for trump s order to be constitutional  robart said  it had to be  based in fact  as opposed to fiction   the   attacks were carried out by hijackers from saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  egypt and lebanon  whose nationals were not affected by the order  in a series of tweets on saturday  trump attacked hobart s opinion as ridiculous   what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone  even with bad intentions  can come into u s    he asked  trump told reporters at his private mar a lago resort in florida late on saturday   we ll win  for the safety of the country we ll win   the justice department s appeal criticized robart s reasoning  saying the ruling violated the separation of powers and stepped on the president s authority as commander in chief  it said the state of washington lacked standing to challenge trump s order and denied it  favors christians at the expense of muslims  the u s  state department and department of homeland security said they were complying with robart s ruling and many visitors were expected to start arriving on sunday  while the government said it expected to begin admitting refugees again onmonday  a spokesman for the international organization for migration  leonard doyle  confirmed on sunday that about   refugees were ready to travel to the united states   we expect a small number of refugees to arrive in the u s  on monday  feb    they are mainly from jordan and include people fleeing war and persecution in syria   he said in an email  iraqi fuad sharef  his wife and three children spent two years obtaining u s  visas  they had packed up to move to america last week  but were turned back to iraq after a failed attempt to board a u s  bound flight from cairo  on sunday  the family checked in for a turkish airlines flight to new york from istanbul   yeah  we are very excited  we are very happy   sharef told reuters tv   finally  we have been cleared  we are allowed to enter the united states
