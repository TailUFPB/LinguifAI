cleveland  reuters    on the floor and corridors of the basketball arena hosting the republican national convention  in restaurants and bars  hotel lobbies and conference rooms across cleveland  the talk was of the rise of donald trump  whose unlikely presidential candidacy has caused seismic fractures in the republican party  while the venues changed  the question didn t  where do we go from here  this was the week that trump was officially nominated as the republicans   presidential candidate and was effectively given control of a party whose leaders have criticized him for his incendiary rhetoric  personal attacks on fellow republicans  and tendency to stray from decades old party orthodoxy   he packed the convention hall with his grassroots army of supporters  who seemed almost completely disinterested in his policy positions  even though they could reshape the party for years to come on core issues like trade  immigration and foreign policy  those who were interested   party veterans  lawmakers  donors and lobbyists   found little clarity in any of the speeches delivered from the convention stage or in conversations with members of the trump campaign  are we still a party that embraces free trade and free markets  they asked  are we still committed to ending abortion rights  do we want to create a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants or ship all of them out of the country  paul ryan  speaker of the u s  house of representatives and the most powerful elected republican  acknowledged that trump has transformed his party  but he hedged on whether he believes trump s impact will be lasting or simply a temporary phenomenon that will dissipate if he loses on nov      i don t know the answer to that question  i really have no idea   ryan said at an event in cleveland  trump had changed the party  he said  but  how specifically and in what direction  i don t know    even after two days of speeches  utah delegate matt throckmorton was still trying to figure out what a trump presidency would mean for the republican party   what happens next   asked throckmorton  in many way the uncertainty about trump reflects the conflict within the republican electorate  the party has struggled to find consensus on a number of key issues  according to reuters ipsos polling during the  campaign season  for example  when asked in march about international trade  the same number of republicans said it  creates jobs  as said it  causes job losses   when asked about abortion in june  the number of republicans who wanted it to be illegal  in all cases  was matched by those who wanted it to be legal  in most cases    trump had his biggest stage on thursday night  when he officially accepted the party s nomination  to spell out his vision of where he would take the republican party if he won the presidency  but his speech  rich in rhetoric  offered scant detail beyond sweeping promises to put  america first    if this trump speech   and this gop platform    defines what a republican is today  then it s hard to say i m one  hard for a lot of us   tweeted tony fratto  a white house spokesman under president george w bush   a week earlier  republican activists were celebrating the adoption of a deeply conservative political platform that condemned gay marriage and opposed abortion with no exceptions  among other things  trump s lineup of speakers at the convention this week barely referenced it    it s a little bit frightening   said chris herrod  another utah delegate  explaining that the platform was one of the main ways delegates could help shape party policy   and he seems to have an attitude of just completely disregarding it    trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks said trump was  the future of the republican party   away from the floor  some anti trump republicans were quietly debating whether it would be better in the long term interests of the party to lose the white house in november   this week we re having some real anguished discussions   said vin weber  a former congressman from minnesota   people are falling in line  with trump  weber said   but what does this party believe   take trade  for example  republicans have long been the party of free trade  but trump has said current trade deals have impoverished american workers and wants to renegotiate them or in some cases block them altogether  like president barack obama s signature trans pacific partnership  newt gingrich  a former house speaker and a close trump ally  worked to ease fears that a trump administration would derail the u s  economy by scrapping trade alliances   he has no interest in breaking up the world market   gingrich told a group of diplomats  adding that trump was  in fact  committed to free trade with some added protections for american companies    now how trump will work this out  i have no idea   gingrich added  some attendees at the convention expressed the hope that trump would align himself with many of their cherished conservative values but admitted they just didn t know what he would do once he was in office  they would have found little solace in gingrich s remarks to the diplomats   you will not know what he s doing every morning  because he will not know what he s doing every morning   gingrich told them  suggesting a trump presidency would be similar to his candidacy   reactive  spontaneous and centered almost entirely around trump s instincts  but trump s instincts are sometimes at odds with key elements of the party  for example  he has been more accepting of gay rights and has see sawed on abortion rights  first defending them and then saying he opposes abortion    conservatives are prepared to believe trump might be wrong     maybe  percent of the time   richard viguerie  a veteran republican activist  told reuters at an anti abortion event  but  trump s opponent  democrat hillary clinton   will be wrong  percent of the time   asked if trump supported the conservative social values espoused in the platform  he laughed   well  i don t know   he said   we ll have to wait and see   some lawmakers at the convention dismissed some of trump s most provocative proposals  like his vow to deport an estimated  million undocumented immigrants  as unlikely to be implemented    full blown deportation is not going to sell politically and i don t think a republican congress  or any congress  would stand by and watch it happen   representative tom cole of oklahoma told a group of convention attendees    some republicans believe should trump lose  the party will simply return to its more traditional conservative principles    the republican party is bigger than any one candidate  even a presidential candidate   said frank luntz  a republican pollster  but trump supporters said those republicans were in denial and that trump had permanently wrested control of the party away from the establishment elites    where s mitt romney  where are the bushes   said mary lou mccoy  who had traveled to cleveland from buffalo  new york  referring to the  republican nominee and the bush political dynasty   the people have spoken
