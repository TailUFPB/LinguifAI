washington  reuters    u s  voting rights advocates scored a string of courtroom victories this year that rolled back some of the nation s most restrictive voting laws  now they face another challenge  making sure those rulings are not undermined by officials who oversee elections at the local level  with early voting already under way ahead of the nov   election  local officials in several states are trying to enforce restrictions that have been suspended or struck down in court  civil rights advocates say  in some cases  the action appears to be the result of bureaucratic confusion  in other cases  they appear to be actively resisting the law   there are still too many places where voting is going to be difficult and confusing  not easy and straightforward   said leah aden  senior counsel at the naacp legal defense fund  the foot dragging by local officials adds another element of uncertainty to what already promises to be a volatile election  the supreme court ruled in  that states with a history of racial discrimination don t have to win approval from the u s  justice department when they want to change the way they conduct elections   the first time the deep south will be free of federal oversight since    that same ruling has also hobbled the justice department s ability to dispatch observers to potentially troublesome spots  raising concerns that it will be harder to deal with any problems that unfairly stop voters from casting their ballots   voters in  states will also face new voting restrictions  from scaled back early voting hours to photo identification requirements  according to new york university s brennan center for justice  roughly  percent of eligible voters do not have a government issued photo id  including a disproportionate share of minority  poor  student and elderly voters  republican state legislators who have passed laws paving the way for these changes say they are needed to fight voter fraud  numerous studies of the issue  however  suggest there is scant evidence of voter fraud in past elections   one study by justin levitt  a loyola university law professor who now heads the justice department s voting rights section  found only  cases of voter impersonation out of more than  billion votes cast between  and    voting rights advocates have managed to roll back some of those restrictions in texas  north carolina  north dakota  kansas  ohio and wisconsin  potentially making it easier for millions of people to vote in states that have the potential to determine the outcome of the election  not all court challenges have been successful  civil rights groups in arizona have failed to defeat a new law that makes it illegal for them to collect absentee ballots by hand  a popular practice in hispanic and native american neighborhoods  republican legislators said the law was needed to combat fraud  though they could cite no examples   now if i go help a neighbor of mine and i take his ballot for him i can serve a year in prison  that s really scary   said antonio valdovinos  who heads la machine  a hispanic activist group  in other states  local officials in some of those states have resisted putting those rulings into effect   after a federal judge ruled that texas  stringent photo id law discriminated against black and hispanic voters  state officials agreed to allow voters who have trouble getting a drivers  license or other approved id card to provide other forms of identification  such as a utility bill  but in september  the same judge found the state had not properly told voters about the loosened requirements and ordered the state to rewrite voter education materials   with early voting under way  poll workers in at least seven counties in texas are still posting misleading signs that tell voters they must provide a photo id  according to the texas civil rights project  a coalition of grassroots groups  officials at the state and the county level say they are in the process of updating posters and educating workers about the new rules  which have been in place since august   in wisconsin  clerks in many state offices have refused to issue voting cards to people who don t have the documents necessary to get a photo id  despite a court order requiring them to do so  activists say  a federal judge found earlier this month that the state had not done enough to tell its employees  as well as voters  about the ruling   in some cases state officials have only agreed to comply after months of wrangling  in kansas  secretary of state kris kobach   a leading proponent of stricter voter identification requirements   refused for months to comply with a may court ruling that ordered him to restore the voting rights of   residents who had been kept off registration lists because they did not provide proof of u s  citizenship  he gave in last month  when he was threatened with contempt of court      we think we ve won these cases  we get the good legal ruling  but the implementation is where the actual details are   said dale ho  head of the american civil liberties union s voting rights project  on top of that  republican presidential candidate donald trump has encouraged his supporters to patrol voting sites to look for possible signs of fraudulent voting  raising fears that his supporters might try to intimidate black  hispanic and muslim voters    we are on the precipice of the most chaotic election for people of color in  years   said wade henderson  president of the leadership conference on civil rights  a coalition of more than  national rights groups
