 new york  reuters    the race for the oval office tightened significantly in the past week  as several swing states that republican donald trump must win shifted from favoring democrat hillary clinton to toss ups  according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project   the two presidential candidates are now tied in florida and north carolina  and clinton s lead in michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call  ohio remains a dead heat and pennsylvania is now tilting to clinton   while clinton remains the odds on favorite to win tuesday s election  trump now has a plausible route to victory  especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among african americans from the levels of the  election   still  trump must win both florida and north carolina to have a good chance of winning the white house  clinton could lose both states and still win   the states of the nation project estimates clinton s odds of winning the needed  electoral college votes at about  percent  down from  percent last week  if the election had been held on wednesday  the project estimates  she would have had  solid electoral votes and an estimated final tally of about  votes  to  for trump  last week  she had  solid votes and a final tally of  votes  to  for trump   by any measure  however  trump has had a good run in the past week  he has seen his support grow in  states while losing ground in   conversely  clinton s support grew in  states while shrinking in    trump s gains came in a period in which he had few new controversies to fend off  while clinton faced renewed scrutiny of her email practices   most respondents to the latest survey were asked about their support for the candidates after fbi director james comey announced last friday the agency was examining newly discovered emails that might pertain to clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state   comey had concluded in july at the end of a year long fbi probe of the email issue that there were no grounds to bring any charges against clinton  his brief letter to congress last week said the new trove of emails might or might not be significant   trump and other republicans seized on the news to question clinton s credibility  while democrats complained it could unfairly influence voters so close to the election   the states of the nation project is a survey of about   people every week in all  states plus washington  d c  state by state results are available by visiting here it is unclear if the fbi inquiry upset the balance in the race  but many national polls have found the race tightening in recent days  polling averages last week showed clinton with a lead of between  and  points  those averages now show her lead at just  to  points  last week  the project had her leading  percent to  percent  this week  it dropped to  percent to  percent   in the reuters ipsos daily tracking poll from oct   to nov    clinton led trump by  percentage points among likely voters  the same margin as before the fbi announcement   there are other reasons for the clinton campaign to worry  among voters who have cast early ballots  she leads trump by about  points  at the same point in the  race  president barack obama had a lead of  points among early voters over republican rival mitt romney  obama s gap narrowed  however  to  points just before election day  according to the states of the nation project and separate reuters ipsos polling   in florida  where the candidates are tied at  percent  clinton leads by  points among early voters  in   obama led by about  points   in ohio  where the race also is tied  she leads by about  points among early voters  at this point in   obama led by about  points   it is not clear why clinton s early voting support has fallen short of obama s  the shift could indicate a broader cross section of voters is casting early ballots than in   but the drop might also foreshadow lower than expected turnout among the core democratic constituencies who propelled obama to victory in  and    clinton s success is built on holding together those blocs of voters  she does not  for example  enjoy the same support among african americans as obama  the first black u s  president  diminished support among blacks  coupled with a large drop in black turnout  would hurt the democrat   if black democratic turnout drops by  points nationally  for example  clinton s odds of winning drop to about  percent  by a projected margin of just  electoral college votes  a drop of  points would reduce the odds of a clinton victory to little more than a coin toss  according to the project   even a  point drop in black democratic turnout coupled with a  point increase among white republicans would flip the race to trump  the project found   the good news for clinton is that about  percent of likely hispanic voters are supporting her  similar to the numbers obama enjoyed in   a  point increase in hispanic turnout would go a long way toward offsetting a  point decrease in black turnout  according to the project   the outlook is not all gloom for clinton  she has made the race close in arizona  a longtime republican stronghold  she has also regained the lead in pennsylvania and is leading in nevada
