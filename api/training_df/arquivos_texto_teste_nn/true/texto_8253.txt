boston new york  reuters    u s  companies that have expressed the most fervent public support for president barack obama s environmental agenda are also funding its biggest enemies   the scores of u s  lawmakers who are climate change skeptics and oppose regulation to combat it  according to a reuters review of public records  ahead of the nov   presidential and congressional elections  the donations from companies including pepsico  dupont  and google reveal a disconnect between how these companies present themselves to the public on environmental issues  and how they manage their political contributions to support business friendly policy   click here for a graphic  tmsnrt rs   many companies active in u s  politics spread their political donations broadly on both sides of the aisle and consider multiple issues when deciding whom to support  but inconsistency between a company s environmental positions and its political giving may point up a need for better oversight  according to jon lukomnik  head of the investor responsibility research center institute    there really needs to be a process that looks at these issues     at c suite and board levels on a periodic basis   lukomnik said  the reuters review covered donations made during the  election cycle by the political action committees  pacs  of  of the biggest publicly traded u s  companies that signed obama s  american business act on climate change pledge  in   a public promise to enact climate friendly corporate policies and support strong climate change oversight like the global climate accord signed in paris  the review found that  of the  companies are funding the campaigns of lawmakers featured on a  climate deniers  list that was put together by organizing for action  a non profit created by former obama campaign aides to advocate his agenda  the list includes more than  members of congress  nearly all republicans  and is a who s who of the biggest opponents of obama s plan to combat climate change  some of those on the list dispute the label  denier  and describe themselves as climate change  skeptics   the list includes republican congressman kevin cramer of north dakota  an energy advisor to presidential candidate donald trump who once argued the earth was cooling not warming  and republican u s  senator jim inhofe of oklahoma  who last year held up a snowball on the senate floor as evidence global warming does not exist   the review found pepsico and dupont s political action committees gave about half or more of the money from their top donations in support of senators and congressmen on the list  that amounted to    from the pepsi pac s  donations of    and above  and    from the dupont pac s  donations of    and above  other signatories to the american business act on climate change pledge that gave more than a third of their top political contributions to lawmakers on the list include google  at t  ge  verizon  and mondelez  according to the review   those levels of donations given to climate skeptics are relatively high given that the list covers about a quarter of u s  congress members  officials from pepsico  google  at t  and verizon did not respond to requests for comment  dupont declined to comment  and mondelez referred reuters to the press release announcing its participation in the climate pledge  a ge spokeswoman said the company supports  elected officials based on a wide range of issues  but we have consistently been outspoken about the need to address climate change and have invested over   billion in cleaner technology r d over the last  years    pepsico has also been working to become more energy efficient  and now operates the country s largest fleet of electric delivery trucks  but it still has a sizeable carbon footprint  it produced some   million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in   down  percent from   according to its website  a more recent figure was not available  dupont  also working to increase its energy efficiency  emitted   million metric tons of greenhouse gases in   congressman cramer  a self described climate skeptic who opposes obama s climate agenda but has taken donations from companies that signed the climate pledge  said companies tend to consider issues like tax policy  national security  and regulatory policy when picking who to support   as opposed to a single issue like the environment  he  like other lawmakers featured on the organizing for action  climate deniers  list  said the debate over climate change was not as clear cut as obama s allies depict it    it is not a black and white issue  like if you agree with obama you re enlightened  and if you don t you re in the dark   he said   it is more of a spectrum   a spokeswoman for senator chuck grassley of iowa  another lawmaker featured on the list  said he had  done more than almost any other member of congress to increase the use of clean energy  sources like wind and biofuels   but she added he was opposed to obama s climate change initiatives  like the clean power plan to curb carbon output  because he felt that it could hurt the competitiveness of u s  businesses globally  senator inhofe  who said he doesn t mind the label  climate denier   suggested that some companies had signed the american business act on climate change pledge for superficial reasons   these are competitive companies  and the board might have said  look  right now it might be a popular thing to join this  and there s no downside since we re not really committing to anything   that absolutely goes on   he said  the five companies reviewed by reuters that did not fund opponents to obama s climate change agenda either had no political action committee  like apple  or made only a small number of contributions  like coca cola   lauren compere  managing director at sustainable investment manager boston common asset management  said consistency between policy and political giving was becoming increasingly important to environmentally minded investors   no company should want to be perceived as espousing progressive climate policies on the one hand  while funding climate deniers on the other   she said
