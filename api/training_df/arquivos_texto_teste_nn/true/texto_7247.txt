new york washington  reuters    president elect donald trump shuffled his transition team again on tuesday  jettisoning a national security expert and lobbyists from his inner circle as he closed in on naming two loyal wall street backers to key economic positions  trump  a republican outsider who won a surprise election victory last week  also cleared a paperwork snag that had temporarily stalled his transition after he put his vice president elect mike pence in charge of the process   very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions   trump said on twitter after taking his family to dinner at  club  a manhattan restaurant  his motorcade slipping away from reporters gathered at his apartment building   i am the only one who knows who the finalists are   trump said  at the top of his list for senior economic positions are  campaign finance chair and wall street veteran steve mnuchin as treasury secretary  and long time backer and billionaire investor wilbur ross for commerce secretary  according to trump ally and activist investor carl icahn  however  a well known republican moderate was pushed out of transition planning  mike rogers  a former u s  representative from michigan who had been mentioned as a possible pick for cia director  suddenly left the transition team  rogers had worked with new jersey governor chris christie  who on friday was abruptly replaced by pence as head of the transition team  that overhaul had put the brakes on transition talks with the white house  pence needed to sign a memorandum of understanding  which the white house received on tuesday evening  the trump team still needs to provide more paperwork before detailed agency by agency briefings can take place  a white house spokeswoman said  the team will need to provide a code of conduct and certify that its transition team members do not have conflicts of interest  additional changes are likely  pence and rick dearborn  the executive director of the transition team  are  removing any lobbyists   a transition aide said    this is to ensure president elect trump s commitment to ban lobbyist involvement is being upheld at all levels of the transition   the aide said  trump  who had pilloried opponents for being beholden to industry interests during his campaign  came under fire from his frequent sparring partner  democratic senator elizabeth warren  for including lobbyists on his transition team   based on public reports  your transition team and your potential cabinet include over twenty wall street elites  industry insiders  and lobbyists making decisions that could have huge implications for their clients or employers   warren wrote in a letter  trump has fewer than  days until his jan   inauguration  to settle on cabinet members and other senior appointees  he will eventually need to fill roughly   open positions  wall street is closely watching who trump picks for treasury chief because republicans have majorities in both chambers of congress  giving trump a clearer shot at tax and financial regulatory reforms  mnuchin declined to comment to reporters at trump tower about cabinet picks  but said the team was  making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed  the biggest tax changes since reagan   a parade of advisers had been seen going in and out of trump s building on tuesday  including u s  senator jeff sessions of alabama  touted as a possible secretary of defense or attorney general  u s  senator ted cruz of texas  who ran against trump for the republican presidential nomination  also dropped by for a meeting  telling reporters he was  looking forward to fighting hard to actually accomplish and deliver the promises we made  during the election  bloomberg later reported that trump was considering nominating cruz as attorney general  rogers was pushed off the team in part because trump s advisers believed he did not pursue democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton aggressively enough when he headed the house of representatives intelligence committee  a source familiar with the decision said  rogers led an investigation into the sept      attacks by militants on u s  facilities in benghazi  libya  the probe dismissed many of the conspiracy theories that had been circulated by critics of clinton  who was then secretary of state  trump s team viewed the investigation as a whitewash  according to one source familiar with the operation  some current u s  intelligence officials worried that rogers  departure would mean trump was leaning toward more confrontational hardliners to lead his foreign policy team  two national security officials said trump s operation had been slow to get up to speed and had not yet engaged deeply with security and intelligence agency personnel who were ready to start helping them  loyalists such as former new york city mayor rudy giuliani and former u n  ambassador john bolton were being considered for secretary of state  according to sources close to trump  giuliani  new york s mayor at the time of the sept      attacks by islamist al qaeda militants  is known as a hardliner on national security matters  bolton is also a foreign policy hawk who said last year the united states should bomb iran to halt its nuclear program  retired lieutenant general mike flynn  a leading candidate for trump s national security adviser  has called for the united states to pull back from protecting long time allies such as south korea and japan  trump has filled two positions so far  his choice of republican party insider reince priebus to be white house chief of staff was heralded by republican leaders as an indication he wanted to work with congress  republicans maintained their majority in both the senate and house in the election  but a number of republicans in congress opposed trump s candidacy  however  trump s appointment of steve bannon as chief strategist was criticized by democrats  civil rights organizations and some republicans  they denounced the former breitbart news chief  whose website is a forum for the  alt right   a loose grouping of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites   neither priebus nor bannon need senate confirmation for their posts  but cabinet posts do  and some of trump s possible picks could face a difficult time winning approval   republican u s  senator rand paul of kentucky said on cnn he could not vote to confirm bolton unless he repudiated his support for the iraq war and bombing of iran  paul  who also ran for the  republican presidential nomination  said he was concerned by giuliani s work on behalf of foreign governments  one loyalist who will not be playing a role in trump s cabinet is retired neurosurgeon ben carson  who advised trump after dropping his own presidential bid earlier this year   his life has not prepared him to be a cabinet secretary   said armstrong williams  carson s business manager
