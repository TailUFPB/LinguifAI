washington  reuters    the chances that the federal government could hand off the u s  air traffic control system to private management are increasing  say advocates who report they are getting supportive feedback from president elect donald trump and his team  u s  rep  bill shuster  who chairs the house of representatives transportation committee  has met with trump and incoming transportation secretary elaine chao to make his case for moving the nation s   air traffic controllers and their mission out of government control and into a non profit organization  shuster and other privatization advocates argue that spinning off air traffic control into a non government entity would allow for a more efficient system and rapid  cost effective improvements of technology  in part by avoiding the government procurement process   the national air traffic controllers association  the union that represents controllers  came out in favor of shuster s legislation earlier this year  but he has run into bipartisan opposition in both the house and the senate and push back from some of the nation s airlines  opponents say the u s  system is so large that privatization would not save money  would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk  there also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private company board and limit access to airports by business jets  the national business aviation association  which represents thousands of corporate and individual business jet owners  strongly opposed shuster s bill earlier this year   our nation s airspace and airport system should benefit the public and not be controlled by airline interests   the organization said in april  the landscape might change once trump  who campaigned on improving the nation s infrastructure and is a regular user of his own private plane  occupies the white house on jan    apart from shuster  officials and lobbyists who work in infrastructure construction say the idea of privatizing air traffic controllers as part of an infrastructure bill is gaining steam  especially among those who are concerned that congress will not be able to pass a separate sweeping transportation bill  congress has been averse to spending money  but privatizing air traffic control systems would shift the cost of upgrades from tax coffers to air travelers  the kind of move that makes lawmakers view it as free instead of an increase in federal spending    i ve had some conversations with trump transition folks and they seemed very interested in putting this in their larger infrastructure bill   shuster said   the air traffic control system is in need of expensive upgrades  including the multi billion dollar implementation of  nextgen   a system that would utilize gps to direct aircraft instead of the outdated use of radar  in shuster s vision  the move would not enrich any particular company as air traffic control would be overseen by a nonprofit that reinvests any profits back into infrastructure improvements   shuster first broached the subject with trump two years ago  he said  and the two have discussed it several additional times  he met with chao last week  it could take a strong presidential push for the privatization effort  earlier this year  it failed to get even enough support from republican members for a vote on the house floor  in february  delta released a study arguing that privatization would cost air travelers more and would not achieve any savings  many air traffic controller operations are funded through ticket taxes   which are levied on every flight  historically  those taxes have been kept low by the government s aversion to raising rates  but should the ticket tax become the control of an outside board  opponents are concerned that could drive up ticket prices
