washington  reuters    after years of rising u s  russia tensions over ukraine  syria  cyber attacks and nuclear arms control  donald trump s election as u s  president may offer a narrow window to repair relations as he and russian president vladimir putin size up each other  but trump s ascent to the white house carries the risk of  dangerous miscalculation if the u s  president elect and putin  two willful personalities and self styled strong leaders who have exchanged occasional compliments  decide they have misjudged one another  according to russia experts and others  u s  officials and private analysts predict that putin  who has reasserted moscow s military and political muscle from eastern europe to the middle east  will avoid openly provoking trump before he takes office   putin has the ability to advance his interests in many different ways  sometimes tactical diplomacy can help   said fiona hill  a senior fellow at the brookings institution  a washington think tank   we re in temporary truce phase   said hill  who has served as the u s  national intelligence officer for russia and eurasia in the george w  bush and obama administrations and co authored a book on putin  michael mcfaul  a former u s  ambassador to moscow under president barack obama  said putin likely will wait to see if he can reach some accommodation with trump to allow the lifting of ukraine related sanctions imposed by washington and the european union that have contributed to russia s growing economic woes  during the campaign  trump was criticized by his democratic party rival  hillary clinton  for praising putin as a strong leader and saying ties with russia should be improved at a time when moscow and washington are at odds over syria and ukraine  trump rattled washington s european allies with comments questioning nato s mutual self defense pledge and suggesting that he might recognize russia s  annexation of ukraine s crimea region  putin last year called trump  a really brilliant and talented person  and the kremlin said on thursday that the u s  president elect s foreign policy approach was  phenomenally close  to that of the russian leader  putin  has a future president who has expressed a desire to cooperate  who has expressed a desire to move away from the obama policies  why would you screw that up with a provocation   asked mcfaul  now at stanford university  in syria  a u s  official said  putin appears to be extending a  humanitarian  pause in air strikes against moderate rebels holding the eastern side of aleppo to give trump an opportunity to affirm the willingness he expressed during the campaign to seek a more cooperative u s  russian relationship   i think they were holding their fire for the purpose of decreasing the international pressure on them  and now  like the rest of the world  they may be taking stock of the current situation   said the official  speaking on condition of anonymity  but u s  officials caution that russia still may feel compelled to launch more attacks after dispatching a naval task force led by the aging aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov to the eastern mediterranean in a show of force  the u s  government has publicly accused moscow of hacking the democratic national committee and other party organizations during the election campaign  which russia has denied  trump declined to blame russia  and the election day russian cyber attacks that some officials feared never materialized  trump has not laid out a detailed russia policy  and many in his party  including potential top advisors and cabinet officials  have taken a hawkish view of moscow  former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich  a trump ally rumored for a senior post  lambasted in  what he called obama s weak response to russia s land grab in ukraine  putin  gingrich wrote  is  a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive   and while there was celebration in moscow after trump s victory over former secretary of state clinton  who has been sharply critical of putin  some russians cautioned against euphoria   the idea that it will be easier to strike a deal with trump than clinton is wrong      everything will be tested when we get down to business   analyst vladimir bruter told the daily pro kremlin tabloid komsomolskaya pravda before tuesday s election  some experts and u s  officials say there is a high risk of miscalculation or even confrontation  given trump s history of  taking slights and challenges personally    that s actually where reality is going to intrude   hill said   putin s pretty thin skinned  too   putin has a penchant for challenging adversaries  particularly when he senses weakness  and he has long made it clear that he intends to reassert what he considers russia s rightful global role  suspending a treaty with washington on cleaning up weapons grade plutonium last month  putin listed conditions for resuming russian participation that amounted to a laundry list of grievances against the united states  the demands included lifting ukraine related u s  economic sanctions  compensating moscow for those sanctions and reducing the u s  military presence in nato s eastern european states to the levels of  years ago  russia s bedrock concern  is whether they believe the threat of u s  promoted regime change is abating under a president trump   said andrew weiss  vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace   everything else is a secondary  lower order problem   putin has accused the u s  government of promoting widespread street protests in russia following its  elections  as well as the  color revolutions  in georgia  ukraine and elsewhere  on specific issues  weiss said  there are few if any easy opportunities for rapid u s  russian agreements   the agenda s really threadbare   he said   we re basically at a standstill           this version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph two
