new york  reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump said as many as  percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated if he is elected in november  just hours after an adviser said the candidate would seek to cut  percent      trump  who blamed regulations for stifling business  told a crowd at a town hall event in new hampshire on thursday night that regulations for the environment and safety would remain    we are cutting the regulation at a tremendous clip  i would say  percent of regulations can go   trump said   it s just stopping businesses from growing   earlier in the day during an online discussion with reuters  trump campaign adviser anthony scaramucci  a wall street financier who has raised campaign money for trump  said trump would eliminate  percent of regulations   we need regulation but immediately every agency will be asked to rate the importance of their regulations and we will push to remove  percent of the least important   he said      another trump campaign adviser reached by reuters confirmed the  percent regulatory cut was part of their economic plan   jeff holmstead  a former assistant administrator for the environmental protection agency under george w  bush s presidency  said the goal was hard to comprehend   you could reduce the number of regulations by  percent without accomplishing very much   he said  he added it would make more sense for trump to try to reduce the cost of regulatory compliance by  percent   i think it probably would be possible for a new administration to make changes that would reduce the cost of these programs by at least  percent while still maintaining essentially the same level of environmental protection   he said  officials at the epa and the u s  department of the interior declined to comment  citing internal policies  scaramucci also said that trump  a fierce critic of the federal reserve  would probably get along well with fed chair janet yellen   trump has repeatedly accused the fed of serving as a political arm of the obama white house  he says yellen has put off raising interest rates in order to let president barack obama end his term in january without the economic shock that a rise in interest rates might entail  scaramucci  a founder of skybridge capital  joined reuters global markets forum to discuss his views of the campaign  he said trump would strive for a better balance in federal regulations      scaramucci was not as dismissive of yellen as trump is  saying he believes the new york property developer would warm to her eventually   there are many well qualified candidates but i think mr  trump has to spend some time with chairwoman yellen  i think knowing what i know about his personality he will like her   he said  trump would seek to streamline regulations as a way to generate economic growth and help the flow of capital  the adviser said  trump has specifically singled out the energy industry as an area that he would look at for reducing regulations   wall street is not the devil   said scaramucci   in fact we are at our best when  there  is harmony between main street and wall street and we hope to restore that   scaramucci singled out several areas that trump would look to for reforms   labor department rules expanding the fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products would likely be stopped   legislation similar to the former glass steagall act that limited the banking industry would be on the table for review    the dodd frank banking reforms that emerged from the great recession of   will be reviewed and  the worst anti business parts of it will be gutted     the volcker rule will be adjusted  named after former federal reserve chairman paul volcker  it is part of the sweeping  dodd frank financial reform law  it aims to reduce risk taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets
