washington  reuters    president barack obama plans to transfer as many as  more prisoners from the guantanamo bay military prison before leaving office  a source close to the matter said  further shrinking the inmate population but still far short of meeting his longtime pledge to close the facility  the obama administration notified congress it intends to send the detainees  nearly a third of the remaining  held at the u s  naval base in cuba  to at least four countries  including italy  oman  saudi arabia and the united arab emirates  before president elect donald trump is sworn in on jan    the source said  the notification came just before this week s deadline  which by law requires obama to give congress  days  warning before moving prisoners out of guantanamo  it will be the last in a flurry of recent transfers aimed at leaving as few inmates as possible for the next administration  but the transfer plan   first reported by the new york times   also signifies that despite obama s pledge dating back to the  presidential campaign to close the facility  it is all but certain to be turned over to trump  he has vowed to keep it open and  load it up with some bad dudes   the administration wants to move out  or  of the  prisoners who have been declared eligible for transfer in parole style hearings  the source said  while cautioning that  it was still possible one or more of the countries could back out  if the transfers go according to plan   or  prisoners would be left at guantanamo  including  alleged plotters of  the sept     attacks charged in military tribunals  the others have not been charged but are deemed too dangerous to release  the white house and pentagon declined to comment  obama  who inherited  detainees when he took office and has called it a  recruiting tool  for terrorists  has slowly whittled the number down to the lowest since shortly after his predecessor george w  bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the sept   attacks  under bush  the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture  obama s efforts to close the prison have been blocked by mostly republican opposition in congress  which has barred him from moving any prisoners to the u s  mainland  foot dragging by pentagon officials has also been blamed for slowing repatriation and transfers to third countries  administration officials have made clear that obama has no intention of resorting to the legally risky option of using executive action to close the prison before leaving office  critics of guantanamo  however  appeared to hold out hope    while welcome  these transfers are not nearly sufficient   said naureen shah  amnesty international usa s director of security with human rights   we are demanding and expecting bold moves from president obama to finally shutter the detention camp at guantanamo in his final days  he must not leave it to trump
