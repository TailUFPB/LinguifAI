washington  reuters    kathryn stellmack expects the world from donald trump  after listening to his speeches and casting her vote for him  she expects trump to toughen immigration laws  restore lost jobs  upend a corrupt political system  build a wall on the border  and be  as the millionaire put it  the  greatest jobs president that god has ever created    we expect him to move forward on all the items he has promised to move forward on   said stellmack    a retiree in west palm beach  florida   and if he doesn t  we will hold his feet to the fire   after a presidential race fueled by brash but constantly shifting policy proposals  trump s millions of followers   from social conservative activists to struggling blue collar workers to hardline militant groups   say if he does anything less than take a wrecking ball to business as usual washington  they will be disappointed   we ll be watching  mr  trump   said stellmack  trump s promises have been hard to pin down  with many policy details left elusive and vague  nbc news identified   distinct shifts  on  major issues since trump announced his candidacy on june      still  his fiery rhetoric had an unmistakable message of ending big government and the entrenched power of establishment elites in both parties  that inspired hope that trump can break through washington s gridlock to make progress on plans to invigorate the economy  eliminate terrorist threats  rip up trade agreements and repeal president barack obama s healthcare plan known as obamacare   i totally trust him   said laura czarniak    of manistee  michigan  a rust belt state that leans democrat in presidential elections but which flipped to trump on tuesday    i know he ll build the wall  i know he ll take care of the syrian refugee problem  i know he ll get rid of obamacare  there is not a chance in hell he won t do those things   she said  but even with republicans retaining control of congress  trump will have to accept limits and compromises on some of his plans  many republicans  for example  are wary of his proposals to scrap trade deals and boost spending on infrastructure improvements  some of his plans have already been rolled back  trump faces his highest expectations on the issue of immigration  given his intense focus on attention grabbing campaign proposals like forcing mexico to pay for a border wall  and temporarily banning muslims from entering the country  but he recently indicated he would at first deport only criminal undocumented immigrants  after previously pledging to deport all undocumented aliens  while the muslim ban has softened into  extreme vetting  of immigrants from some countries  he told the wall street journal in an interview on friday that he would consider keeping parts of obamacare intact   easing off his calls for a total repeal   after obama spoke to him on the issue at the white house on thursday  mark morris  a leader of the colorado based three percent united patriots militia group  said he understood trump would need time on some issues  but he expected quick movement on repealing obamacare and appointing a conservative supreme court justice to fill the seat of the late antonin scalia  he said he hoped trump would stand with ranchers in their disputes with the federal government over fees charged for cattle grazing on public land   a call to arms for many in the patriot and militia movement  morris warned trump should not count on his followers to stay with him if he did not produce results   people voted with a lot of faith that he will come through   he said   i don t think it is going to work out very well if he doesn t get the things done and he comes back at the end of four years and says i need four more years to accomplish what i need to accomplish   trump had to take strong action on immigration given his rhetoric  said roy beck  head of numbers usa  a group that favors reduced immigration levels  he said numbers usa and other grassroots groups would pressure trump to keep his promises to bolster enforcement and cut back on legal immigration and foreign workers  including eliminating immigration by low skill and non extraordinary skilled workers   there s no way he would have been elected president if he had not so boldly made immigration his top issue   beck said   you have to come through on your top issue  the question is in the details   he said many trump supporters understood his talk about the border wall was  shorthand  for restoring the rule of law in immigration  although it was a promise by which he would be judged   we re in the best position we ve ever been in since the  to get control of this issue  but we still have big challenges   beck said  for many activists in the anti abortion movement who are suspicious trump s promises are fueled by politics more than conviction  he still has plenty to prove   i think we re seeing a mix of emotions  from excitement and some fear to somewhere in between   jeanne mancini  president of the anti abortion group march for life education and defense fund said of trump s election   for us the most important thing will be to hold him to his campaign promises  particularly on the supreme court  we want to be sure he is true to his word   she said of trump s vow to appoint justices who will vote to overturn roe vs wade  the  decision legalizing abortion  but trump needs to move quickly  said thomas pyle  a trump supporter and president of the free market advocacy group american energy alliance   washington is a very  very difficult place to turn the ship  he has a limited window before the culture in washington seeps in   pyle said   but if he acts boldly  he can do a lot
