 new york  reuters    a majority of americans say democrat hillary clinton won monday night s presidential debate  but her performance doesn t appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters  according to a reuters ipsos national tracking poll released on wednesday   the online poll  which gathered responses from more than   people on tuesday  found  percent of american adults felt that clinton did a better job than trump in the first of their three televised debates  compared with  percent who felt that trump did better   of those who thought clinton emerged the victor   percent were democrats and  percent were republicans   u s  presidential debates have historically been seen as a crucial test of candidates  poise and policies  monday s was watched by a record  million viewers and was billed as a rare prime time opportunity for two unpopular candidates to convince millions of undecided voters to back them   afterward  both candidates claimed victory     every single online poll had me winning   trump said at a campaign stop in council bluffs  iowa on wednesday   you sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate  i don t think she did well at all    clinton campaign spokesman jesse ferguson said the democrat clearly won the debate as trump  was unprepared  became unhinged and was incoherent throughout    among those who are expected to take part in the nov   general election   percent said they felt that the debate changed their view of clinton in a positive way  compared with  percent who said the same of trump   some  percent of likely voters said the debate improved clinton s chances of winning the white house  while  percent said the debate benefited trump   even so  clinton s performance seemed to have little impact on her support among america s likely voters  the poll showed  percent supported clinton while  percent supported trump  over the past few weeks clinton has maintained a lead of between  and  points over trump   narrowing the focus to likely voters who watched the debate  clinton led trump  percent to  percent   one possible reason for the lack of movement in her support is that it usually takes several days to measure the full impact of a single event  like a debate  said donald green  a political scientist at columbia university   the reuters ipsos poll is conducted every day in english in all  states  monday s sample of   american adults included   people who were considered to be likely voters from their voting record  registration status and stated intention to vote in the election  among those likely voters    said they watched some portion of the debate on live tv  online or in media clips that were circulated after the debate   the poll has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of  percentage points for the entire sample and the sample of likely voters  it has a credibility interval of  percentage points for the likely voters who watched the debate   national opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for clinton and trump  some polls  like reuters ipsos  try to include only likely voters  while others include all registered voters  the reuters ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week  so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls   polling aggregators  which calculate averages of major polls  have shown that clinton s lead over trump has been shrinking this month to about  percentage points
