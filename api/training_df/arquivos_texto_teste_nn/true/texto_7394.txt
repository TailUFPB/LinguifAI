brussels  reuters    nato promised on wednesday to defend all allies despite election victor donald trump s call to set conditions for u s  help  as the alliance braced for a more impulsive leader some fear could withdraw funding to deter russia  during the presidential election campaign trump threatened to abandon u s  allies in europe if they do not spend enough on defence  comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex soviet baltic states on russia s border which fear moscow might try a repeat of its  annexation of ukraine s crimea  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said nato s promise to defend any ally under attack was an unconditional guarantee set out in the western alliance s founding treaty in    all allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned   stoltenberg told a news conference  saying he would try to speak to trump by telephone as soon as possible and would welcome him to a nato summit in brussels next year   the u s  commitment to nato and the collective defence of europe has been rock solid for almost  years and i am absolutely confident that it will still be the case   stoltenberg said  noting that two world wars had shown the importance of stability in europe to the united states  trump s suggestion of making the united states  defence of its western allies conditional was the first time a leading presidential candidate had raised the idea  putting him directly at odds with nato s  other member states    diplomats questioned how long nato s chief would be able to maintain a  business as usual  tone with a new u s  leader who has expressed admiration for russian president vladimir putin  condemned by the west for his actions in ukraine   the idea that trump s presidency is not going to create problems for nato is delusional   said dana allin  a u s  foreign policy expert at the international institute for strategic studies  iiss   the north atlantic treaty organisation was founded around the central promise that an armed attack against one ally is an attack against all  whether it be on land  in the air or on the seas  nato leaders in july added the area of cyberspace to that list of war fighting domains  although allies have to request nato s help and decisions are on a case by case basis  trump  a republican who had never previously run for office  assumes the presidency on jan   after defeating democrat hillary clinton in tuesday s u s  election  in one demonstration that not all u s  republicans share trump s scepticism about nato  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he believes the nato alliance  is every bit as important today as it ever was    i think article   of the nato treaty  means something  you attack any member of nato  you have us to deal with  i want the russians to understand that fully   mcconnell said in washington when a reporter asked him if he shared trump s attitude toward the alliance and russia   one of nato s top commanders stressed that the debate about the alliance s role was not a theoretical one  given the powerful russian air defence systems in the baltic region  in crimea and in syria that could limit nato s freedom of movement  allies need to build up a sophisticated air deterrent that can counter russian long range missiles  said general denise mercer  whose brief is to focus on future threats   after the fall of the soviet union a quarter of a century ago  nato s european allies cut defence spending to historic lows  leaving the united states to make up around three quarters of the alliance s military expenditure   a newly assertive russia under putin has begun to change that and europe is again spending more on defence  but britain  poland  greece and estonia are the only european nations to meet a nato goal of spending at least  percent of gross domestic product on defence  germany  europe s biggest economy  spends far less than  percent of its gdp on defence  asked if she would now seek more funding for germany s military  defence minister ursula von derv leyden told reuters   i have to make it clear  to german lawmakers  what our posture is  what we need and that is the right way to proceed   stoltenberg said he expected an overall  percent real increase in european defence spending in   he said if all european allies and canada reached the  percent spending target it would generate an additional   billion for nato   on financial markets  shares in european defence companies rose as investors bet arms spending would rise in response to trump s calls for europe to pay more for its security  a first sign of trump s tough stance could come as early as next year  when the united states is due to deploy troops and heavy combat equipment to eastern europe under a    billion u s  spending plan for europe to deter russia  trump could scale back president barack obama s plan to quadruple funding under the european reassurance initiative  err  from just under   million   a significant investment in europe after decades of cutting its presence in europe   france saw an opportunity to strengthen european defence   donald trump said he wanted to     stop paying for nato  so countries like poland need to ask themselves  what this means    foreign minister jean marc assault said   rather than lowering our heads  we must rise to the challenge   trump has also threatened to withdraw u s  forces from europe if allies fail to pay more for u s  protection  although u s  ambassador to nato douglas lute sought to reassure allies  saying   nato has always been a bipartisan venture for the united states   trump has said nato could become obsolete if it does not focus more on isla mist militant groups hostile to the west  an area that is not traditionally a core focus of the alliance  stoltenberg  a former norwegian prime minister whose own country borders russia  sought to remind the new president elect that the only time nato has activated its article  commitment was following the septa   attacks in
