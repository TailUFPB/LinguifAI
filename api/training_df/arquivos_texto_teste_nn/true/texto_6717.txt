san francisco washington  reuters    alphabet s google is racing to hire more conservatives for its lobbying and policy arm  trying to get a foothold in president elect donald trump s washington after enjoying a uniquely close relationship with the administration of president barack obama  in the weeks since the nov   election  google has ramped up efforts to hire republican lobbying firms and in house lobbyists to change the composition of its washington office  according to three lobbyists with knowledge of the matter   the company also posted an advertisement for a manager for conservative outreach and public policy partnership  seeking a  liaison to conservative  libertarian and free market groups        while the position is not new  it gives google a chance to make a hire that reflects the new political climate  conservatives already are represented in the office  a google spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this article  chief executive officer larry page of alphabet  googl o   google s parent company  is expected to be in the room on wednesday when trump convenes a gathering of leaders of some of the largest technology companies in his new york headquarters  the session  organized by trump son in law jared kushner  adviser reince priebus and trump supporter and tech financier peter thiel  is billed as an introductory meeting that would not result in any job or investment announcements  two sources briefed on the talks said  others attending are apple inc  aapl o  chief executive officer tim cook  facebook inc  fb o  chief operating officer sheryl sandberg  amazon com  amzn o  ceo jeff bezos  tesla motors inc  tsla o  ceo elon musk  microsoft corp  msft o  ceo satya nadella and oracle ceo safra catz  according to sources familiar with the session plans   the information technology industry council  a trade group whose members include google  apple  facebook and amazon  had a conference call last friday to discuss policy objectives it could agree on to present to trump  according to a person familiar with the call  trump clashed with silicon valley on several issues during the election campaign  including immigration  government surveillance and encryption  his surprise victory alarmed many companies  which fear he might follow through on his pledges  trump has also opposed the obama administration s  net neutrality  rules  ordered in  by the communications regulator to reclassify broadband internet services to treat them more like public utilities  the rule is now said to be headed for a reversal  liberal leaning silicon valley bet heavily on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton winning the white house  and many technology companies have found themselves scrambling in the wake of trump s election  but google  which forged deep ties to the obama white house and was the largest corporate contributor to clinton s campaign  appears to have been caught especially off guard  washington insiders said   only  employees of google and its parent company alphabet donated   or more to trump  for a total of     clinton received donations from   google or alphabet employees for a total of    million  google netpac  the company s political action committee  made  percent of its contributions to republicans in the  election cycle  according to data from the center for responsive politics  during obama s presidency  more than  people moved between jobs at google or related firms and the federal government  national political campaigns and congress  according to a report this year by the campaign for accountability  a watchdog group  the company notched several wins during the administration  including favorable policies on net neutrality   google seemed poised to enjoy similar treatment under a clinton administration  schmidt was seen wearing a staff badge at clinton s election night party  a sign of their close relationship  but those ties are now something of a liability as the company tries to re position its presence  lobbyists said  the hiring push will adjust the political makeup of google s washington office  where the team of lobbyists for congress and the agencies contains more democrats than republicans  according to people familiar with the operation  such a skew is not unusual given that democrats controlled the white house the past eight years  to be sure  conservatives are well represented in the company s washington office  susan molinari  a former republican congresswoman from new york  has been the top lobbyist since   and seth webb  who worked for a former republican speaker of the house  helps lead congressional lobbying   but the company has tended toward moderate republicans in past hiring  its previous director of conservative outreach was alumnus of mitt romney s  presidential campaign  and a number of former staffers for sen  john mccain have passed through the office as well  but the company still has to reconcile the lobbyists it hires with its liberal leaning existing staff  said one lobbyist for a rival tech company   i think they are going to have a tough time really finding the cultural fit
