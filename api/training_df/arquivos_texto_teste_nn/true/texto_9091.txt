washington  reuters    a long running battle over gun control in the united states reaches a critical stage next week in the u s  senate amid signs americans are more willing to accept limited restrictions after the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history  while it is far from likely new measures will pass  the orlando  florida  gay nightclub massacre of  people and a suggestion by republican presidential candidate donald trump that something be done have fostered a different atmosphere  while president barack obama was in orlando consoling the survivors of the rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to islamic state militants  the u s  senate moved closer to votes on limited gun control measures  about  percent of americans  including eight out of  democrats and nearly six out of  republicans  favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns  according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted from monday to thursday  that was up from  percent in late  and late   as always  democrats were challenging republicans to vote for new restrictions and reject pressure from the national rifle association  the powerful gun lobby that has been known to punish politicians who thwart its will  u s  senator chris murphy of connecticut and fellow democrats set the u s  capitol abuzz by talking on the senate floor for nearly  straight hours to demand that congress act on gun control  they ended their speeches before dawn  citing a republican pledge to hold votes soon on measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and to prevent people on u s  terrorism watch lists from buying guns  the senate is expected to vote on monday on four proposals  one from democrat dianne feinstein would let the government prevent terrorist suspects from buying guns  a second from republican john cornyn  the no   senate republican  would require court approval within three days for a government ban on an individual s attempt to buy a gun  democrats have said cornyn s plan is unworkable  republicans say feinstein s might harm the rights of people wrongly on terror suspect lists  a third proposal  from democrat murphy  would expand background check procedures to the sales of all firearms  including those online and at gun shows  a fourth proposal  from republican senator chuck grassley  would provide for law enforcement to be notified if a person investigated for terrorism in the last five years tries to buy a gun   gun control is a potent issue in u s  politics  republicans  who control the senate  have blocked democratic backed gun control measures over the years  saying they infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the u s  constitution  any bill would have to pass both houses of congress and be signed by the president to become law  at his weekly news conference on thursday  paul ryan  speaker of the house of representatives  injected a note of caution   we don t take away a citizen s rights without due process   said ryan  the top u s  elected republican   if you have a quick idea in the heat of the moment that says let s take away a person s rights without due process  we re going to defend the constitution   a string of mass shootings across the united states in schoolhouses  churches  movie theaters and other public places has failed to break the deadlock  the last major gun control measure was a ban in  on semi automatic assault weapons such as the one used in orlando on sunday  the ban expired  years later  one of the most dramatic moments in the senate debate came when republican senator john mccain  who is in a tough re election race in arizona  told reporters obama is  directly responsible  for islamic state inspired attacks on americans like the one in orlando  he later said he meant to say he blamed obama s decision to withdraw most u s  forces from iraq  and that this had fueled the rise of islamic state  murphy  asked what would be the message if the senate fails to act on the gun control measures next week  suggested it could be a campaign issue for the nov   election   there are going to be a lot of voters in this country who are going to watch     the votes that are cast next week   he said  trump  the presumptive republican nominee for president has been endorsed by the nra  he jumped into the gun debate by saying he would meet with nra leaders to talk about barring people who are on terrorism watch lists from buying guns   i ll be looking at it very  very seriously   the terror watch list and the no fly list  i m going to be talking to the nra about that and starting a real dialogue  i think a lot of people agree with me but i want to really hear what they have to say   trump told fox news on wednesday night  democrats were deeply skeptical that trump s word signaled any sort of shift toward more republican support for democratic backed gun control proposals   he is going to meet with the nra      what s he going to come out saying   oh the nra and i agreed we shouldn t have terrorists have guns   but doing nothing about it   u s  senator chuck schumer of new york told reporters
