washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s drive to rebuild u s  roads  bridges  ports and other public works projects with a   trillion infrastructure investment plan would come as the country faces a shortage of skilled laborers    before any dirt can be moved  trump would have to get approval from congress  but with democratic support and a push from business groups  there is some optimism that trump could win over skeptical republicans who control congress  if the plan does not add significantly to federal debt    more than two thirds of u s  roads are in less than good condition and nearly   bridges need repair or improvement  the transportation department estimates      at the same time  construction contractors have reported tight labor conditions in the south  midwest and southwest  causing project delays  the federal reserve noted last month  earlier this year  the national association of home builders estimated there were around   unfilled construction jobs in the united states  an  percent increase in the last two years   infrastructure projects need highly trained workers  such as heavy equipment operators and iron specialists  but as a result of the   recession  which caused an estimated  percent of construction jobs to vanish  their ranks have thinned   graphic  tmsnrt rs   many of these workers went back to school  joined the military or got lower paying jobs in retail  services and other sectors  some just got too old for the rigors of construction   they wandered off into other careers   said leonard toenjes  president of associated general contractors of missouri  which represents contractors in the state  undocumented immigrants  who otherwise might help replenish those ranks  are unlikely candidates however  since companies do not want to invest in training people with an uncertain status  especially given trump s anti immigrant bent  the labor shortage is driving up construction costs  according to government and industry experts  which could cut into the scope of any new washington investment scheme  in response to the construction  skills gap   the u s  department of labor and federal highway administration are aiming to expand help to localities training workers for road and bridge building  according to a fhwa spokesman  even if the scope of work is not as grandiose as trump originally envisioned  it would benefit a range of businesses  from steel maker nucor corp and concrete firm us concrete inc to construction machinery companies such as caterpillar inc  more infrastructure spending would boost trade unions  too  which appeals to democrats        we will build new roads  tunnels  bridges  railroads  airports  schools and hospitals   trump boasted in a dec   speech in cincinnati  a trump transition representative  who asked not to be named because the topic was still under discussion  said that enactment of  infrastructure funding legislation  is one of the top priorities for the first  days of the new administration  a trump website refers to taking steps that would fill a   trillion gap in infrastructure investments over  years  like many trump campaign proposals  his infrastructure plan is thin on details  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters earlier this month   what i hope we will clearly avoid  and i m confident we will  is a trillion dollar stimulus   in a departure from past fiscal policies  trump has proposed slashing taxes and expanding infrastructure investment at a time of economic stability  historically  such steps have been used by the government to provide economic stimulus in recessions  trump has discussed investor tax credits for infrastructure projects  democrats have attacked this as a boon to wall street that would spark too few projects and create too few jobs  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters last week infrastructure is something her party could collaborate on with republicans  but she said democrats would reject anything  disguised as infrastructure  it has to be a real infrastructure bill that grows the paychecks of american workers       if congress balks at writing a big check  there is talk of a mix of alternatives  one could involve new corporate income tax revenue from bringing foreign profits into the country  others could be an infrastructure revolving fund  raising the gasoline tax or a new surface freight fee  experts said  these could help marquee projects move forward  a hudson river rail tunnel between new york and new jersey  a deeper port in charleston  south carolina  expanded rail service in southern california  fixing the crumbling i  freeway in missouri  replacing a key bridge linking ohio and kentucky  harry holzer  professor of public policy at georgetown university  said fixing roads and bridges would boost u s  productivity and  depending on how it is structured  generate good paying jobs for those without college educations  given shortages of high skilled construction labor  he said government ought to ramp up the projects carefully to allow time to train a new generation of skilled workers   i m not sure anyone has thought that through   he said   click here for graphics on  u s  construction employment  spending  here
