hollywood  fla   reuters    reince priebus  the unassuming head of the republican national committee  often plays the piano late at night  sometimes with a glass of wine nearby  tickling the ivories is a lifelong passion for priebus and he has been doing it  more than usual  lately  he told reuters in an interview last week  it s his way of easing the stress from the most combustible republican presidential race in generations   it has been a rough ride for the  year old party chairman from wisconsin  who presided over a three day meeting of republican officials in florida last week  one reason for all that piano playing is the unconventional campaign being run by republican front runner donald trump  the bellicose billionaire has said that the party rules are  rigged  and could give trump s chief rival  ted cruz  a chance to become the nominee through a brokered convention  even if trump racks up more victories in state nominating contests  he said priebus  should be ashamed of himself    yet privately  the relationship between the two has improved  their aides told reuters  priebus has taken frequent calls from trump to explain nomination rules or simply hear him out  aides said  but priebus also has been catching fire from anti trump forces who want him to drop his neutrality and do more to thwart trump s march toward the nomination ahead of the party s convention in cleveland in july  when it must settle on a nominee to face democrat hillary clinton or bernie sanders in the nov   election  if trump wins the nomination   a prospect increasingly likely after his string of state victories   priebus will need to unify his party or risk losing in november  on friday  when priebus urged the party to rally around the eventual nominee  the blowback from the stop trump crowd was intense   the best way for the republican party to unite  win and to grow is to reject donald trump   said rory cooper  senior adviser to a group called  nevertrump  adding to priebus s dilemma is his task of choreographing a convention when the outcome remains uncertain  in most elections  the nomination is settled by late spring  giving party leaders time to focus on the messaging and stagecraft of the summer convention  which is typically centered on building excitement for the nominee  priebus must plan for several scenarios  a traditional win in which trump gets the   delegates he needs ahead of the convention  a contested convention in which trump still wins  or the selection of cruz or ohio governor john kasich on a second or third ballot  the republican convention has not been contested since  and henry barbour  an rnc member from mississippi  noted it was  uncharted waters  for the party not to have presumptive nominee so late in the cycle  some corporations are so alarmed about how the race has turned out they have decided not to pour funding into sponsoring the convention  there also is the potential for protests of trump in cleveland  trump himself has warned of riots in a contested convention  trump s criticism of the nominating rules has been jarring to party officials and the feud could undermine efforts to unify the party  colorado republican party chairman steve house said on facebook his family received death threats after cruz swept the state s  delegates  in private discussions with trump  priebus said he talks about  the daily events of the day or the week or the moment or the debate   he also talks regularly with cruz and kasich  does trump  with his inflammatory remarks  get under his skin   no  he doesn t because i kind of know where he s coming from  i m not unfamiliar with his opinions  so it doesn t really bother me because i know what the truth is   priebus said  trump senior adviser paul manafort said trump and priebus were  communicating frequently  and communicating better these days   they don t agree on everything but they agree to try to work things out and they are working things out   he said  an rnc member close to priebus agreed   they re not best buddies or anything but they have a pretty good relationship   the member said   i consider all this back and forth as a little bit of  heat of the battle  tensions   trump s complaints about the party s system have prompted some of his own supporters to roll their eyes in dismay   he ain t read the rules   said ada fisher  a retired physician and republican national committee member from north carolina  who was wearing a trump button at the florida event  the prevailing opinion among rnc members was that trump is simply energizing his anti establishment supporters  a point hammered home by manafort  who privately told party leaders trump is  projecting an image  and will transition to a more serious demeanor  rnc members vow to protect priebus from any attempt to replace him should trump become the nominee   i think any effort to oust reince will fail and it s not the job of our nominee to select the rnc chair  it s the job of the rnc members to select the rnc chair   said matt moore  chairman of the south carolina republican party
