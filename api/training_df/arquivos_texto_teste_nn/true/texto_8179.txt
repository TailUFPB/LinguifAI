washington  reuters    it was classic hillary clinton  ignoring medical advice and attending a ceremony on a sultry new york city day while battling pneumonia   a decision ex aides and other associates speculated was rooted in her longstanding desire to prove that women can compete in the male dominated world of politics  the move backfired on the famously stoic democratic presidential candidate after she had to leave sunday s september   remembrance early and was caught on camera buckling from dehydration as she was helped into a van   clinton    has since acknowledged she went too far in trying to soldier on with a jam packed schedule  daniel scherb  a south bend  indiana  cardiologist interviewed by reuters  who was not privy to clinton s medical records  said pneumonia can leave a patient  feeling blah for seven to  days  under the best of circumstances and  at worst   people can die from it   former subordinates who are fiercely loyal to clinton said there are plenty of instances in which she drove herself remarkably hard as first lady from    as a u s  senator from   and as u s  secretary of state from    in her first year at the state department in   she traveled abroad extensively shortly after undergoing surgery for a broken arm  one retired ambassador said clinton sees herself as part of a generation of women who had to work extra hard to overcome barriers to female advancement  the ambassador describes this as part of an ethos that  you could never be weaker than a man   at the same time  the ambassador blamed clinton s aides in part for allowing her to put herself into difficult situations  at an event in congo after breaking her arm  clinton snapped at someone who posed a question she disliked  the ambassador recalled  while the question may have been translated into english incorrectly  the ambassador said clinton also was clearly exhausted   it s not necessarily that she is running roughshod over the advice of her staff  her staff doesn t seem to take very good care of her   the ambassador said  working to defeat republican presidential candidate donald trump    on the rough and tumble campaign trail  clinton has said she is held to a different standard   women are seen through a different lens   clinton told humans of new york  a group organized around a project to photograph and catalog stories of new yorkers   i ve learned that i can t be quite so passionate in my presentation   she said  adding   i love to wave my arms  but apparently that s a little bit scary to people  and i can t yell too much  it comes across as  too loud  or  too shrill  or  too this  or  too that    even though those attending her rallies  are loving it   in all her roles  including as president bill clinton s healthcare chief and a two time presidential candidate  clinton has been known as an almost unstoppable  detail oriented policy wonk   her constant work  internal in meetings or external on capitol hill  was virtually incomprehensible   said david dreyer  a white house deputy communications director during bill clinton s first term  dreyer  who said he had a  front row seat  to the healthcare reform fight that hillary clinton spearheaded as first lady  said she is  wired  to always be fully prepared and compelled to public service   can t win situation  three other people  one close to clinton when she was secretary of state and as a presidential candidate  said efforts to persuade her to temper her travel and appearance schedule can go nowhere because she insists it is expected of her  one  a prominent former official who has advised clinton on foreign policy issues  said   she pushes herself so hard because she s convinced that only she can do what needs to be done  and that s compounded by a very small inner circle that in some cases doesn t like to contradict or confront her  and as a result just ends up encouraging this compulsion   matt bennett  who served as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs in bill clinton s second presidential term  said hillary clinton is  in a can t win situation here   noting competing  unsubstantiated attacks from trump and his supporters about her health versus criticisms that she does not know how to pace herself   either she is frail or reckless with her health   bennett added   i don t view her as disregarding medical advice  over past blood clots  a fall that caused a concussion and other maladies   but i do think she s super tough   bennett  now a vice president at the third way think tank  said the increasingly frantic pace of campaigning for the white house has pressed candidates to the limit  as an aide to retired general wesley clark while he unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in   bennett noted that clark would constantly remark about the rigors of the campaign   he was shot multiple times in vietnam and went through  elite army  ranger training and he s saying this is really tough running for president
