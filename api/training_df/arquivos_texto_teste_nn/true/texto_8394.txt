moscow  reuters    when donald trump named a little known u s  energy consultant as part of his foreign policy team  the adviser s ex boss was puzzled  how could the relatively junior banker he knew in moscow a decade ago be qualified to brief a presidential candidate  carter page  who worked in russia at u s  investment bank merrill lynch  paints an impressive picture of his three year stint from   saying on his company s website that he advised on  key  transactions involving some of the country s biggest energy groups  but sergey aleksashenko  who became head of the bank s moscow operation toward the end of page s assignment  expressed  doubts about whether he has the experience to act as an adviser on washington s fraught ties with the kremlin   for me it was a strange choice   said aleksashenko  who served as a deputy finance minister and deputy central bank governor in the  before running merrill russia in     carter was never a person who would discuss foreign policy or u s  russian relations    the achievements of page   whom trump named as an adviser in march   are summarized on the website of new york based global energy capital llc  a firm that he founded after leaving merrill  he did not respond to reuters questions about his time in russia and merrill lynch declined comment  when contacted by reuters  trump s spokeswoman hope hicks played down page s role in the campaign   mr  page is an informal adviser named as part of a much larger group several months ago  he does not speak for or represent the campaign in any official capacity   she said  trump  who is now the republican nominee  named page as being among five foreign policy advisers in an interview with the washington post on march   hicks did not answer reuters questions seeking to clarify what page had done since then for the campaign and why trump had picked him      aleksashenko  a kremlin critic  was page s boss in   and is now a nonresident senior fellow at the left leaning brookings institution in washington    three other former merrill employees in moscow also told reuters that page could not have played a leading role in the bank s deals due to his rank  and at the time showed no real interest or expertise in foreign policy  shortly after trump named his foreign affairs team   campaign member sam clovis said the aim was to recruit people with  real world  and military experience rather than the retreads that other candidates relied on   these are people who work for a living   the new york times quoted clovis as saying   if you re looking for show ponies  you re coming to the wrong stable   clovis was not immediately available for further comment  russia has been a central issue in the u s  election campaign  with trump calling president vladimir putin a  strong leader   flattering coverage of trump in russian state media has left little doubt that he would be the kremlin s preferred candidate over democratic nominee hillary clinton  like trump  page holds views that contradict the obama administration s stance on russia and in recent years he has expressed them  reflecting the kremlin s views on occasions  in a february  article in the journal global policy  he said u s  policy toward russia had been  misguided and provocative  and blamed the state department for precipitating the ukraine conflict  in a speech given in moscow last month  page also criticized western countries for what he said was their  hypocritical focus on democratization  in the post soviet world  at the event  he did not respond to questions about his time in russia  andrey kortunov  director general of the russian international affairs council  said trump wanted to show the incompetence and weakness of the foreign policy pursued by the democrats  page was useful as his views fit with that aim  added kortunov  who does not know the trump adviser personally   there are people in the u s  who are bored with ukraine  who think it is not an american problem that washington should be involved in   said kortunov  whose think tank is close to the russian foreign ministry but who has also expressed independent views   despite hicks s comments  trump s former campaign manager corey lewandowski told reuters that when he left the campaign in late june  page had  definitely  been an adviser to trump  another member of the five strong foreign policy team  walid phares  told reuters on aug   that page continued to advise trump  a mid tier banker the global energy capital llc website says page was responsible for opening merrill s moscow office and that he was  an advisor on key transactions  for russian firms including gazprom  the world s top gas producer  and rao ues  a power company that no longer exists  reuters spoke to four former merrill employees in moscow  three of whom overlapped with page  as well as three moscow based bankers who competed with the u s  bank for business   with the exception of aleksashenko  none agreed to speak on the record about their recollections which differ from page s   page was a vice president at merrill  a mid tier banker who was not originating deals   said aleksashenko   gazprom was a vip client and in no transaction with such a client could a vice president play a decisive role    in an interview with bloomberg in march  page said he advised gazprom on the purchase of a stake in the sakhalin energy project in russia s far east from shell  aleksashenko said merrill s contribution to that deal was merely to provide a straightforward document saying the transaction was at fair value to gazprom shareholders  alongside other banks  gazprom declined comment  another ex merrill banker said   page was a general dogsbody who would have sat in on most meetings and prepared documents   a third ex merrill banker  whose comments were corroborated by aleksashenko  said merrill s business with gazprom when page worked there involved investor relations work  page also said he worked on deals in central asia  two sources who were involved in the initial public offering of shares in kazakh firm kazmunaigas ep in  said although merrill was one of the ipo s managers  they did not remember page participating in the deal  bankers at rivals when page worked in moscow said merrill was not the main bank gazprom turned to when it needed to raise capital  although the u s  bank handled its investor relations   merrill did act as a manager on two gazprom eurobonds when page worked in moscow but tom adshead at moscow based consultancy macro advisory  which helps foreign investors in russia  said it was not a major player with the energy group   there are other bankers who were viewed in the market as being closer to the company   said adshead  who worked in moscow as an analyst and was a fund manager at the time that page was at merrill  merrill lynch declined to respond to reuters questions on page s work with the bank in moscow
