new york  reuters    after immigration agents detained two iraqis on saturday at new york s john f  kennedy international airport  their lawyers and two u s  lawmakers accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area to consult with the men   border protection agents held them back  sparking a heated exchange   step back  step back   the agents shouted  a few minutes later  heidi nassauer  chief of passenger operations for u s  customs and border protection  cbp  at the airport  was called over   u s  congress members jerrold nadler and nydia velazquez  both  democrats from new york  wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on friday by president donald trump prevented the iraqis from consulting with attorneys  nassauer had no clear answer    we are as much in the dark as everybody else   said the border protection official at one of the largest u s  airports   the tense exchange  witnessed by reuters  was representative of the confusion at airports across the united states and others overseas after trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees   the trump administration  facing criticism over the executive order s implementation  on saturday it would have been  reckless  to give details to government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures  which it says aimed to prevent attacks from foreign groups  but career officials in the homeland security and state departments told reuters that the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines  throughout much of saturday  government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the united states legally and who could not   the day ended with u s  district judge ann donnelly in brooklyn issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the united states  the american civil liberties union  which sought the stay  said it would help  to  people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at u s  airports   across the country  more than a dozen similar petitions on behalf of individuals being held at airports had been filed by the end of saturday  according to a reuters review of data collected by westlaw  by sunday morning  federal judges in three more states   massachusetts  washington and virginia   issued orders blocking authorities from deporting travelers impacted by trump s executive orders  a senior administration official said trump s order   aimed at citizens of iran  iraq  syria  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen   needed to be implemented urgently to protect americans   there s a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the united states   the official told reporters in a briefing   it would be reckless and irresponsible to     broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you re going to take   key figures at the department of homeland security were informed  the official said  declining to elaborate  at the state department  one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration  most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media  according to two department officials   while some offices were aware an executive order was coming  there was no official communication or consultation from the white house  they said    was there any inter agency coordination or consultation  no   said one senior official  speaking on condition of anonymity  immigration enforcement is among the federal government s most complex endeavors  involving seven agencies from the u s  coast guard and cbp to the state and justice departments  two senior officials in the department of homeland security said on saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies   or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them   who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president s order   if the result is confusion and inconsistency  the responsibility all lies at one address   said one of the officials  referring to the white house   the official  like others  requested anonymity to discuss trump s order   another homeland security official told reuters that the white house worked on the executive orders with  limited department participation    it has been a challenge but folks are working through it   the official said  affected travelers had varying experiences at different airports  according to nearly  accounts gathered by the american immigration lawyers association  aila    many holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite trump s executive order banning them  but some lawful permanent residents   those with so called green cards   were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the cbp that they should be allowed to travel  at about  p m  on friday in seattle  some eight hours after trump signed the executive order  an iranian with dual canadian citizenship from vancouver was sent back to canada  the traveler reported to aila  a half hour later in new york city  an iranian arrived at jfk and entered the united states on a valid visa without any problems  according to aila  one of the iraqis detained at jfk was hameed khalid darweesh  a  year old kurd who had worked as a u s  army translator in iraq and had been threatened there for helping the americans   visas for him and his family were issued on jan    according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of darweesh and another iraqi  who had also worked with u s  military  but as soon as he landed at jfk  he was detained by cbp officers and barred from contacting his attorneys  when his attorneys  from the international refugee assistance project  asked the cbp officers whom they could contact  the agents responded   mr  president  call mr  trump   according to the lawsuit   eventually  darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers  clutching his passport and weeping with joy  the other iraqi who was detained  haider sameer abdulkhaleq alshawi  was also allowed to enter the country   on sunday morning  seven more detainees at jfk airport were allowed to enter the united states  said aclu immigration attorney andre segura  the organization knew of at least five others that remained in the custody of border protection officials  segura told reuters  conflicting media and government reports have caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order  cbp informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on friday  said a person familiar with the agency s communications  cbp then sent written guidance before noon on saturday saying that green card holders were  not included  in the ban and could continue to travel to the united states  the source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise   the trump administration official later told reporters that u s  green card holders traveling outside the united states need to check with a u s  consulate to see whether they can return   it s being cleared on a case by case basis   the official said   on sunday morning  the administration addressed the issue again but left questions over how green cards holders would be screened and by what agencies   the executive order doesn t affect green card holders moving forward   white house chief of staff reince priebus addressed told nbc s  meet the press   he added that they would be subjected to extra questioning by cbp agents when they tried to re enter the united states   a senior administration official told reuters  however  that it had not been determined where and how those screenings would be carried out  the nature of the screening will be up to cbp or the state department  the official said  and specific guidelines were being drafted   they could be screened in many different ways and in many different places   the official said in an interview
