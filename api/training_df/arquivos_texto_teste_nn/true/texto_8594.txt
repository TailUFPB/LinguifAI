 san francisco washington  reuters    the fbi is investigating a cyber attack against another u s  democratic party group  which may be related to an earlier hack against the democratic national committee  four people familiar with the matter told reuters   the previously unreported incident at the democratic congressional campaign committee  or dccc  and its potential ties to russian hackers are likely to heighten accusations  so far unproven  that moscow is trying to meddle in the u s  presidential election campaign to help republican nominee donald trump   don t miss   alphabet and amazon wind up  smokin   quarter for big tech why russian pump prices rise as oil prices fall democratic campaign group for congress confirms computer hack the kremlin denied involvement in the dccc cyber attack  hacking of the party s emails caused discord among democrats at the party s convention in philadelphia to nominate hillary clinton as its presidential candidate   the newly disclosed breach at the dccc may have been intended to gather information about donors  rather than to steal money  the sources said on thursday   it was not clear what data was exposed  although donors typically submit a variety of personal information including names  email addresses and credit card details when making a contribution  it was also unclear if stolen information was used to hack into other systems   the dccc raises money for democrats running for seats in the u s  house of representatives  the intrusion at the group could have begun as recently as june  two of the sources told reuters   that was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the dccc  for some time  internet traffic associated with donations that was supposed to go to a company that processes campaign donations instead went to the bogus site  two sources said   the sources said the internet protocol address of the spurious site resembled one used by russian government linked hackers suspected in the breach of the dnc  the body that sets strategy and raises money for the democratic party nationwide   cyber security experts and u s  officials have said there was evidence that russia engineered the dnc hack to release sensitive party emails in order to influence the u s  presidential election    i have concerns that an agency of foreign intelligence is hacking and interfering with a u s  election   said clinton campaign chairman john podesta  who added he had not seen news of the dccc attack   asked by reuters to comment on whether russia played a role in a cyber attack on the dccc  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said   we don t see the point any more in repeating yet again that this is silliness    the release of the dnc emails by activist group wikileaks caused uproar in the party because they appeared to show favoritism within the dnc for clinton over u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  who ran a close race for the nomination for the nov   election  the committee is supposed to be neutral   the dnc and the dccc share the same office space on south capitol street in washington   the dccc and donation processing company actblue had no comment on thursday  crowdstrike  the california based cyber security firm that investigated the dnc breach  declined to comment   justin harvey  chief security officer at fidelis cybersecurity company  said the suspect website in the hack was affiliated with others that host sophisticated malware undetected by the vast majority of antivirus providers    it s really rare malware   which would be more likely to be wielded by government hackers than ordinary criminals  he said   russian officials have dismissed allegations of moscow s involvement in hacks of u s  political groups   it is so absurd it borders on total stupidity   kremlin spokesman peskov said on thursday   some democratic officials have accused russia of hacking the dnc emails in order to help trump win the race for the white house    it s no coincidence someone is hacking into democratic party computers  it s almost sounding like a repeat of watergate   gilberto hinojosa  the chairman of the texas democrats said  after reuters reported the dccc hacking    this is just the kind of dirty politics we expect from donald trump  i have no doubt donald trump is behind it   he said  citing the businessman s praise of russian president vladimir putin and recent remarks about russia and clinton s deleted emails   trump angered democrats this week by inviting russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival clinton s tenure as u s  secretary of state  trump said on thursday his comment was meant to be sarcastic   jim manley  a democratic strategist who once worked for senate minority leader harry reid  said the possibility of the dccc being hacked was cause for great concern    until proven otherwise  i would suggest that everyone involved with the campaign committee operate under the assumption russians have access to everything in their computer systems   manley said   the federal bureau of investigation referred questions about the dccc attack to a statement it made on monday about the dnc hack    the fbi is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the dnc and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter  a compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously  and the fbi will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace    director of national intelligence james clapper said on thursday the u s  intelligence community was not ready to  make the call on attribution  as to who was responsible for the dnc hack   clapper  speaking at the aspen security forum  acknowledged   there s just a few usual suspects out there  who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion  suggesting it was the work of a state actor rather than an independent hacking group   clapper said in may he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the november election neared  the last two u s  presidential cycles in  and  witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting president barack obama s campaign and the campaigns of his republican foes  officials have said
