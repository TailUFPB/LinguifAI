washington  reuters    republican foreign policy veterans and outside experts warned that the suggestion by republican presidential nominee donald trump that he might abandon nato s pledge to automatically defend all alliance members could destroy an organization that has helped keep the peace for  years and could invite russian aggression   statements like these make the world more dangerous and the united states less safe   senator lindsey graham of south carolina  a trump critic who is one of the republican party s leading foreign policy voices and a member of the senate armed services committee  said in a statement on thursday   i can only imagine how our allies in nato  particularly the baltic states  must feel after reading these comments from mr  trump  i m  percent certain how russian president putin feels   he s a very happy man   he said trump s comments in a new york times interview  would seem to put him on the same page with mr  putin   richard armitage  who was deputy secretary of state in the george w  bush administration  said in an interview with reuters  in the new york times interview  trump  in response to a question about potential russian aggression toward the baltic states   latvia  lithuania and estonia   said that if moscow attacked them  he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations  have fulfilled their obligations to us   he added   if they fulfill their obligations to us  the answer is yes    it s the end of nato   robert hunter  a former u s  ambassador to the alliance under president bill clinton  told reuters   the essence of nato  more than any other single factor  is the commitment of the united states of america to the security of the other  members   asked about trump s comments  european union foreign policy chief federica mogherini said the eu knows it needs to  work more on our defense capabilities   but said the united states needs to keep solidarity with its allies   it s very simple to realize that in the world of today  which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one  you need friends   said mogherini  who spoke in washington at the carnegie endowment for international peace  a letter signed by a bipartisan group of  national security experts said trump s  inflammatory remarks  do not represent the interests of the united states   the strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests   said the group  which includes prominent republicans such as former homeland security secretary michael chertoff and former state department official eliot cohen  the united states must uphold the north atlantic treaty organization s commitments  to all of our allies  including poland  estonia  latvia and lithuania   the letter said  u s  senator bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the atlantic alliance  but he added that both republicans and democrats  are becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations  for military spending  corker  a tennessee republican  said in a statement  responding to trump s suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance  former diplomat richard haass  president of the council on foreign relations  said it is important not to see nato or any alliance solely in budget terms   more important is the net benefit the u s  derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the u s  would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined   haass told reuters  article  of the washington treaty  which created nato in  and calls an attack on one member an attack on all  has been invoked once   to help defend the united states after the attacks of sept      following the attacks  nato sent awacs planes to patrol over u s  skies  with more than  crew members from  nato countries flying over  sorties  as part of the eight measures approved to support the united states  nato  about three weeks later  sent elements of its standing naval forces to patrol the eastern mediterranean and monitor shipping  expanding that to include the entire mediterranean several months later  a nato official  speaking on condition of anonymity  also noted that the alliance  deployed a third of the troops in afghanistan for over a decade  where over one thousand soldiers from non u s  nato allies and partners gave their lives   still  some experts downplayed trump s comments  even as they criticized them  kurt volker  who was u s  ambassador to nato under both republican president george w  bush and democratic president barack obama  said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries  minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country   putin loves it   volker said  but he said the general european attitude was to take trump s pronouncements with a grain of salt   everyone knows it s an election campaign   he said
