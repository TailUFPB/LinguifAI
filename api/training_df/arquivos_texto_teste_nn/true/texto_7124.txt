washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s plan to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement  nafta  to make it  a lot better  for u s  workers would not be a one way street for his administration  as canada and mexico prepare their own list of demands that could require difficult u s  concessions  the  year old nafta and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the u s  industrial heartland states that swept trump to power this month   trump   who on monday vowed to file notice of his intent to quit an asia pacific trade deal on his first day in office   has pledged to leave nafta if it can t be improved to his liking  but he has said little about what improvements he wants  apart from halting the migration of u s  factories and jobs to mexico  trade experts  academics and government officials say canada and mexico would also seek tough concessions and that nafta s zero tariff rate would be extremely difficult to alter  and any renegotiation would likely take several years   in a renegotiation  one side can come in with requests  but the other side is going to expect concessions   said wendy cutler  a former deputy u s  trade representative  ustr    we need to know what we re going to ask for and what we can give   when cutler helped renegotiate a stalled trade deal with south korea in   ustr won concessions for u s  automakers  but at the expense of a longer phase out on steep korean pork tariffs and allowing korea to largely maintain a health care reimbursement system that favors domestic generic drugmakers  trump  who during the campaign called nafta the  worst trade deal ever  and threatened to levy a  percent tariff on mexican assembled autos and other goods  would have a hard time raising u s  tariffs without scrapping the agreement  trade experts say   there is no precedent in free trade negotiations for one side raising tariffs more than the other   said chad bown  a senior fellow at the peterson institute of international economics in washington   if u s  workers are more expensive than mexican workers  the only way to level the playing field is to do things that raise costs in mexico   bown said    negotiating stronger environmental and labor protections would be one way of doing this  as it would increase manufacturing costs in a lower income country like mexico  the trump transition leader for trade  dan dimicco  declined reuters  requests for comment  dimicco  who is under consideration to be trump s top trade negotiator  is a former chief executive of steel giant nucor corp  who has long fought for protections against unfairly traded imports  in a youtube video message published on monday  trump vowed to quit the trans pacific partnership  tpp   a proposed  country pacific rim trade bloc  although the tpp terms were settled more than a year ago  the pact was never taken up by u s  republican leaders in congress due in part to anti free trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign       calling it a  a potential disaster for our country   trump said his administration would instead negotiate  fair  bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores    his comments would appear to snuff out any hopes among other tpp countries that the pact championed by president barack obama could be revived under the new administration  mexican president enrique pena nieto said at a pacific rim summit on saturday that he would be willing to discuss nafta with trump to  modernize  the treaty   but not renegotiate existing provisions  he said that modernization could include adding environmental  labor and other provisions that weren t contemplated when nafta was being negotiated in the early   canadian prime minister justin trudeau  who met with pena nieto on the apec sidelines  said he was  keeping our options open  on trade discussions with the u s  president elect     but if nafta is reopened  canada will insist that any renegotiation bring an end to a decades old dispute over canadian exports of softwood lumber  said david macnaughton  canada s ambassador to the united states  u s  producers claim the canadian wood is unfairly subsidized because it comes from federal lands and have threatened to seek billions of dollars in tariffs  which canadian officials say would make a  mockery  of free trade  for mexico s part  any concessions that would favor u s  industrial goods could be met with demands to increase u s  import quotas for mexican sugar and protections for mexico s potato crop  and both mexico and canada would likely demand greater access to compete for u s  public sector procurements  now largely protected by  buy america  laws  a major trump administration infrastructure spending program would make this a more enticing target  cutler said  since nafta was enacted  total u s  trade with canada and mexico has quadrupled to    trillion a year  but the u s  combined goods trade deficit with canada and mexico has grown from    billion in  to    billion in    graphic showing trend in u s  trade deficit  imports  tmsnrt rs   nafta s effect on u s  jobs is disputed  critics such as the left leaning economic policy institute charge that it has led to the loss of some   u s  manufacturing jobs  while proponents such as the u s  chamber of commerce claim the trade growth has added a net  million jobs in the united states    the non partisan congressional research service concluded that nafta has had only a small positive effect on u s  growth  but has helped u s  manufacturers become more competitive due to more efficient supply chains       a renegotiated nafta could  ironically  end up borrowing key elements from the tpp to stiffen provisions on environment  labor and digital economy standards  trade experts said  mexico and canada have already agreed in the tpp to  fully enforceable  labor and environmental improvements  meaning that punitive duties could be imposed on countries that don t comply   a major step up from nafta  tpp also included provisions governing e commerce and cross border data flows   sectors that barely existed as nafta was negotiated in the early    to better protect intellectual property and ensure a free and open internet  officials in all three countries say nafta needs modernization in this area  trump economic advisers peter navarro and wilbur ross have suggested  however  that the tpp environmental  health and safety standards aren t strong enough   in an economic white paper and various opinion pieces  navarro  a university of california irvine business professor and ross  a billionaire private equity investor who is being considered by trump to lead the commerce department  said they want future u s  trade deals to include  prompt triggers and automatic renegotiation if trade gains are not distributed fairly   they also want  ironclad sanctions  against currency manipulation  and  zero tolerance  for intellectual property theft   in any negotiation or renegotiation  our guiding principle should be this  enter into a free trade agreement only if it both increases total trade and reduces our trade deficit   they wrote
