washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump knew for weeks that national security adviser michael flynn had misled the white house about his contacts with russia but did not immediately force him out  an administration spokesman said on tuesday  trump was informed in late january that flynn had not told vice president mike pence the whole truth about conversations he had before trump took office with russia s ambassador to the united states  white house spokesman sean spicer said  pence learned of the  incomplete information  that he received from flynn when news reports surfaced late last week  spokesman mark lotter said on tuesday  flynn quit on monday after trump asked for his resignation  and the president hopes to pick a new national security adviser by the end of the week  spicer said  the departure was another disruption for an administration already repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas since the republican businessman assumed the presidency on jan    the new york times reported late on tuesday that members of trump s campaign and other associates had contact with senior russian intelligence officials in the year before the nov   presidential election  although u s  officials told the newspaper they had not uncovered any evidence that trump s associates colluded to disrupt the election  u s  lawmakers  including some leading republicans  called for a deeper inquiry into not just flynn s actions but broader white house ties to russia  trump has long said that he would like improved relations with russian president vladimir putin   representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee  said trump only moved against flynn because of news media attention  not concern about any wrongdoing    the reason they lost faith or trust in general flynn only last night when they knew for weeks that he had been lying was that it became public   schiff told msnbc  a timeline of events outlined by spicer and a u s  official showed that trump had known for weeks about flynn misleading the vice president   trump  a former reality tv star whose catchphrase was  you re fired   has often boasted of his eagerness to get rid of subordinates  he was not quick to fire flynn  a strong advocate of a better relations with russia and a hard line against islamist militants  the justice department warned the white house in late january that flynn had misled pence by denying to him that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with ambassador sergei kislyak  a potentially illegal act  a u s  official said   flynn did talk about sanctions with the diplomat  whose calls were recorded by u s  intelligence officials  the official said  but pence went on television in mid january and denied that flynn had discussed sanctions  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed flynn in his early days as trump s national security adviser regarding his conversations with the russian ambassador  a white house official confirmed  spicer stressed that the administration believed there was no legal problem with flynn s conversations with kislyak  but rather an issue over the president s trust in his adviser  the turning point  spicer said  was a washington post story published on thursday in which flynn  through a spokesman  said for the first time he could not say with  percent certainty that he had not discussed sanctions with kislyak  spicer said the justice department sought to notify the white house counsel on jan   about the discrepancies in flynn s accounts    the white house counsel informed the president immediately  the president asked them to commit a review of whether there was a legal situation there   spicer told reporters  saying it was a  trust issue   flynn s conversations with the ambassador took place around the time that then president barack obama imposed sanctions on russia  charging that moscow had used cyber attacks to try to influence the  presidential election in trump s favor  a u s  official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said flynn indicated that if russia did not retaliate in kind for obama s dec   order expelling  russian suspected spies and sanctioning russian spy agencies  that  could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving u s  russian relations once trump took power      flynn s discussions with the russian diplomat could potentially have been in violation of a law known as the logan act  which bans private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about disputes or controversies with the united states  there have been no modern prosecutions using the  law   the logan act is a red herring  the better question is whether he made any false statements to the fbi at any point  which would be a much bigger deal   said university of texas law professor stephen vladeck  adding the fallout would likely be  political  in nature  flynn could also face legal trouble if it emerges that he violated other federal laws in his communications with the russians  said andrew kent  a professor at fordham university school of law in new york  the espionage act criminalizes sharing information with foreign governments         democrats  who do not have control of congress  clamored for probes into flynn  and asked how much trump knew about his connections to russia  u s  senate democratic leader chuck schumer called for an investigation of potential criminal violations surrounding the resignation of flynn   what i am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions   schumer told reporters  saying such a probe could not be led by newly installed u s  attorney general jeff sessions or white house lawyers  two leading senate republicans  bob corker and john cornyn  said the intelligence committee should investigate flynn s contacts with russia   but the highest ranking republican in congress  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  sidestepped questions about whether lawmakers should look into flynn s russia ties  saying he would leave it to the trump administration to explain the circumstances behind flynn s departure  a broader investigation of the white house and its ties to russia is not possible without the cooperation either of the justice department or the republican led congress   russia s aggression in ukraine and syria and republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on russia make any white house attempt to embrace putin problematic  senator john mccain  a leading republican voice on foreign relations  said flynn s resignation raised questions about the administration s intentions toward putin s russia
