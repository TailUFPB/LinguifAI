 reuters    u s  president donald trump said on friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks  here is what trump s order on  extreme vetting    denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory   includes  the order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for  days  while no countries are specifically named in the order  it refers to a statute that would apply to seven muslim majority nations  syria  iran  sudan  libya  somalia  yemen and iraq  there is an exception for certain types of visas  including for diplomats and the united nations  the temporary halt is aimed at giving the department of homeland security  the state department and the director of national intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat  the order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country  which could include holding more in person interviews  searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms   under the current system  some visa applications require interviews but others do not  the government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded        the order suspends the visa interview waiver program  which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face to face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration  immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process  in an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are  not unduly affected   the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in u s  embassies abroad   the order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary  although there will be case by case exceptions  the order also implemented a blanket ban of all syrian refugees until  sufficient changes  have been made to the refugee program  without giving more details  after the suspension is lifted  the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious based prosecution  but only if they are minorities in their country  trump said in a television interview that the move would protect christians  it could also protect ethnic minorities like the yazidis in the middle east  this could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination  some legal experts say  once refugee admissions resume  fewer will be allowed  the  cap was set at   people  compared to   designated by president barack obama for   in a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement  the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there  completing the  biometric entry exit tracking system  the system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors  arrival and departure using information like finger prints  former president barack obama s administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the country s largest airports by   some experts have said that for the system to work properly  it would need to cover all land  air  and sea ports of entry  which is a major undertaking  according to a  report from the bipartisan policy center the system would be expensive to implement and would  offer mixed value for enforcement objectives    this version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of  iraq  in paragraph
