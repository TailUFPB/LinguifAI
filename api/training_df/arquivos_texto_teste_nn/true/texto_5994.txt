guadalupe  mexico tornillo  texas  reuters    president donald trump s plan to end the policy of  catch and release    where illegal immigrants are caught and then freed pending hearings   could hit a wall  immigrant advocates warn  and not the one he is planning to build on the mexican border   ok  mr trump  you don t want them released  show me where you are going to hold them   show me the building   said ruben garcia  the director of annunciation house  a roman catholic charity in el paso  texas  that gives shelter to migrant families   garcia s group received more than  migrants released by u s  immigration and customs enforcement just between monday and wednesday  the day trump announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration   they are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release  but because detention centers don t have enough space   said garcia  that underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of  catch and release    almost half the immigrants apprehended by u s  officials are now central american families or children  and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants  trump did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers  but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges  legal experts on immigration said    a reuters review of u s  customs and border patrol data shows an accelerating trend of central american families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request  in the last three months of   the number of people   almost all of them families and children   who handed themselves in to agents along the u s  mexican border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before  cbp data shows   agents apprehended a total of   people crossing the mexican border  the highest number since   and  percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children   nearly   parents with children were apprehended in the october december quarter  but the border currently has beds for only around   people in this category of immigrants  mostly at the karnes and dilley detention centers in texas  according to ice data from   because most of the families are from central america  they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to mexico  lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants  who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in honduras  guatemala and el salvador  are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet  given a court date and released  many end up requesting asylum  a process that can take five or more years to be resolved  immigration lawyers say  even without requesting asylum  it can take years to deport families through the united states  bunged up immigration courts  trump could expand a policy practiced under former president barack obama of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants  the fort bliss base in el paso has housed thousands of children since september  for example  he could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families  building more detention centers like karnes and dilley will take longer  they also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them  trump could also seek to expand an obama program aimed at increasing the number of central american asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country  in the long term  he could ask mexico to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there  although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of trump s vow to force mexico to pay for a wall on the southern u s  border  garcia  the shelter director  acknowledged that if trump was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families  that would slow the numbers coming    the word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher   garcia said  central americans are usually deported from the united states on flights back to their home countries  while the number of  turn ins    those who hand themselves in to u s  authorities   are highest around mcallen  texas  the jump has been particularly noticeable in the el paso sector of the border with mexico  here   percent of the immigrants apprehended between october and december were children or families  for years a quiet spot on the immigration map  el paso saw   families apprehended in the period  nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago  and    or double  the number of unaccompanied children  u s border patrol agent jose romero has observed the trend first hand along the tall  rust colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some  miles   km  from el paso to beyond tornillo  texas   a lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups     coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in   romero said  calling it a change from the past  when more people were trying to sneak in undetected   they want to be apprehended   the fence  finished in   ends abruptly near pecan orchards and irrigation ditches on the texan side  across the rio grande from mexico s drug war torn valle de juarez  a  cotton farming region now littered with burned out homes  last february  mexican president enrique pena nieto and obama s secretary of commerce  penny pritzker  opened a major new border crossing from tornillo on the texan side  to guadalupe on the mexican side  hoping to boost trade between the countries  by november  truck traffic was still light across the bridge  instead  ice opened a temporary holding center  with  places in white tents on the asphalt on the u s  side of the bridge  to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by u s  officials in the surrounding area
