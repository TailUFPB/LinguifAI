washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on wednesday appeared poised to throw out the corruption convictions of former virginia governor robert mcdonnell  a move federal prosecutors fear could undermine their ability to bring crooked politicians to justice  during the one hour argument  several of the eight justices signaled that mcdonnell s acceptance of    in luxury gifts and sweetheart loans from a businessman seeking to promote a dietary supplement did not constitute a criminal act  they voiced concern that the broad interpretation of u s  anti corruption law used by federal prosecutors could criminalize numerous commonplace actions by politicians  u s  justice department lawyer michael dreeben told the justices overturning mcdonnell s conviction and giving politicians more leeway to accept gifts in return for certain actions would be a  recipe for corruption   mcdonnell s lawyer noel francisco argued the former governor s conduct was no different than what politicians across the united states do on a daily basis when responding to requests from donors and constituents  mcdonnell    is a former republican party rising star who served as governor from  to  and once was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate  his wife  maureen  was convicted in a separate trial  prosecutors during his trial described the luxurious lifestyle the mcdonnells lived thanks to virginia businessman jonnie williams including vacations  designer clothing and shoes  a    rolex watch     for their daughter s wedding  golf outings and more  liberal and conservative justices alike raised concerns about the justice department s interpretation of u s  bribery law  stephen breyer described as  dangerous  the  enormous power over elected officials  that federal prosecutors would hold if the court endorsed the justice department s position  a ruling is due by the end of june  a decision in mcdonnell s favor could limit the type of cases federal prosecutors could bring against politicians in the future by requiring that any action taken in return for a bribe must be more than  for example  simply arranging a meeting between a benefactor and a government official  the impact of the decision would depend on how far the justices are willing to go in narrowing the scope of the corruption laws  the justices potentially could overturn the conviction but issue a narrow ruling focusing on the specifics of mcdonnell s case  including the judge s instructions to the jury on how to weigh the evidence  rather than finding that the corruption law used in the case was flawed  even if his conviction is overturned  mcdonnell could face a retrial  chief justice john roberts appeared to favor a broad ruling saying the statutes under which mcdonnell was convicted could be unconstitutionally vague because they can cover many different activities  roberts cited the example of a businessman seeking state tax breaks in return for opening a new plant  roberts wondered if it would be considered a corrupt act if the state s governor accepted an invitation from the businessman to go on a fishing trip to discuss the proposal  breyer and justice anthony kennedy said politicians need guidance so they know what conduct potentially could be prosecuted  if the law is interpreted broadly   political figures will not know what they are supposed to do and what they are not supposed to do   breyer said  after a trial that laid bare rifts in his marriage  mcdonnell was convicted of  corruption counts including conspiracy  bribery and extortion for taking the gifts and loans in exchange for promoting a dietary supplement called anatabloc made by williams  company star scientific  williams wanted mcdonnell to press researchers at virginia state universities to conduct studies that could help win u s  regulatory approval for anatabloc   a judge sentenced mcdonnell to two years behind bars  but the supreme court last year said he would not have to report to prison while appeals were ongoing  mcdonnell s wife was found guilty of nine criminal counts and received a one year sentence  she remains out of prison while pursuing her own separate appeal  sonia sotomayor  one of the only justices to indicate support for the prosecution  suggested it was reasonable to infer that mcdonnell s intent was to help williams when he accepted money and gifts  some justices appeared troubled by the signal a ruling in his favor would send  ruth bader ginsburg appeared alarmed by the idea of officials being able to accept payments to arrange meetings without facing potential prosecution  officials could simply say  i ll do it for you if you pay me a thousand dollars   she said  mcdonnell  one of few high level politicians to have his appeal of a criminal conviction heard by the supreme court  sat with his wife in the courtroom for the last oral arguments of the justices  current term  mcdonnell s lawyers contend the former governor s conduct did not constitute  official action  in exchange for a thing of value  as required for conviction under federal bribery law
