jerusalem  reuters    israeli officials welcomed on friday what they took as u s  consent to expand existing settlements  after the white house reversed a long standing policy of condemning building on occupied land  in its first substantive announcement on the israeli palestinian conflict  the trump administration said it did not see existing settlements hampering peace with the palestinians  although it recognized that  expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal   at one level  that appeared to be an attempt to rein in prime minister benjamin netanyahu  who has announced wide ranging settlement expansion plans since the jan   inauguration  including around   new homes  but on closer reading  the statement was a softening of policy from the obama administration and even that of george w  bush  because it does not view settlements as an obstacle to peace or rule out their expansion within existing blocs   netanyahu will be happy   a senior israeli diplomat said in a text message   pretty much carte blanche to build as much as we want in existing settlements as long as we don t enlarge their physical acreage  no problem there   israel s deputy foreign minister  tzipi hotovely from the right wing of netanyahu s likud party  interpreted it in a similar way  saying construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem  which the palestinians want for their own state together with gaza  would go on unhindered   it is also the opinion of the white house that settlements are not an obstacle to peace and  indeed  they have never been an obstacle to peace   she said   therefore  the conclusion is that more building is not the problem   israel seized the west bank and east jerusalem in the  middle east war  the  anniversary of the occupation  which israel marks as a reunification of jerusalem  is in june   there was no immediate comment from the palestinians  since taking office  president trump has largely kept quiet on the israeli palestinian issue  making no comment in response to netanyahu s announcements for thousands more settler homes  a silence interpreted as endorsement  during the campaign  trump said he would not interfere or push israel to negotiate on a two state solution to the conflict  he has nominated david friedman as ambassador to israel  a religious jew who has raised money for the settlements and supports moving the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  trump supported that idea during the election campaign  but it has been put on the back burner in recent weeks  under barack obama  the white house maintained a firm anti settlements line  calling them illegitimate and an obstacle to peace  most of the world considers settlements illegal under international law  a position israel rejects  the european union and britain issued statements this week criticizing netanyahu s settlement plans  which they see as further breaking up the west bank and undermining the possibility of a contiguous palestinian state ever emerging  netanyahu  who will visit trump in washington on feb    may see the white house statement as doubly beneficial  as well as not ruling out building within existing blocs  which israel hopes to retain in any final agreement with the palestinians  it may allow him to silence far right voices in his own coalition calling for much greater settlement growth and annexation of parts of the west bank   trump has effectively set a limit on how far ranging settlement building can be  so netanyahu will be able to tell the far right their ambitions are out of the question  at the same time  netanyahu may have to curtail some of the plans he himself has announced in recent days  while most of the   settler homes he has promised are in existing blocs  many are not and may have to be scrapped if he wants to adhere to the white house line  he may also have to rethink a pledge this week to build the first new west bank settlement since the
