washington  reuters    u s  presidential candidates hillary clinton and donald trump kicked off a fierce general election battle  with democrats accusing trump of erratic behavior and the republican threatening to bring up old clinton scandals             clinton  the former secretary of state  made history when she became the first woman to lead a major political party in its quest to capture the u s  presidency  big primary election wins on tuesday in california and elsewhere catapulted her to victory over democratic opponent bernie sanders  if elected on nov    the  year old former u s  senator from new york would return the clinton family to the white house  years after her husband  bill clinton  completed two terms as president  all signs point toward a negative campaign as clinton accused trump of being temperamentally unfit to serve and the new york businessman charged that clinton had a dark past and a weak record as president barack obama s first term secretary of state  clinton told nbc on wednesday she would not run a  campaign of insults   but she sought to portray the  year old trump as not fit for the oval office after the real estate developer repeatedly accused a mexican american judge of showing bias against him because of his ethnic heritage  the clinton campaign has pointed to criticism from leaders in trump s republican party to make this case   i m going to talk about why he s unqualified to be president based on his own words and his deeds  and i m going to continue to make the case he is temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief   she said in the interview  trump gave a carefully crafted primary race victory speech on tuesday laying out his own plan of attack  to keep from straying off message  he used a teleprompter and avoided his typical stream of consciousness delivery  trump said money given to the clinton foundation charity from foreign donors had earned the clintons millions of dollars and had a corrupting influence when clinton was secretary of state   hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund   the russians  the saudis  the chinese   all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return  it s a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens   trump said      he said he would give a speech next week  discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons    a reuters ipsos poll on tuesday showed clinton leading trump by  percentage points nationally  little changed from a week earlier   both clinton and trump must unite their parties but the democrat appeared to face the easier path with sanders  a leftist u s  senator from vermont  nearly out of options to challenge her   trump has an uphill battle  u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan described trump s remarks about the judge as a  textbook definition of a racist comment   but said he would still support him  trump said on wednesday he was  disappointed and surprised  by charges of racism from republicans    i had just won more votes than anyone in the history of the party   he told time   but you know  they have to say what they have to say  i m a big boy  they have to say what they have to say       ryan met behind closed doors on wednesday with house republicans  an aide said ryan  discussed with his members the thinking behind his endorsement  of trump  and how to move forward  and reiterated he had confidence trump would support the house republican agenda       i d say the general attitude is   good  now let s just move on    said u s  representative chris collins of new york  a trump supporter   the irony here and the frustration was that he s not racist   others said trump needed to stop engaging in petty battles with former rivals and build a fundraising organization  trump will meet on thursday in new york with top fundraisers of the republican national committee  a party official said  hopes flickered among some anti trump republicans that there would be a revolt against him when delegates convene to nominate him formally in cleveland from july  to    representative morgan griffith  a virginia republican  said that was unlikely but that trump needed to improve as a candidate   don t step into the cow pie   griffith said   he can t afford to be stepping into any more controversies like that   clinton edged sanders out in a rough and tumble battle that stretched over four months and  states  she won support  especially among older voters  with a more pragmatic campaign focused on building on the policies of fellow democrat obama  clinton said she had spoken to sanders on tuesday to congratulate him on his campaign   i am looking forward to working with him to unify the democratic party against the threat that donald trump poses to our country   she told pbs on wednesday   so we are talking  we will be having an opportunity to discuss in greater detail in the days ahead how we can best work together       democratic party elites are lined up squarely behind clinton  including most likely obama  who may endorse her as early as this week  white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters that obama would not endorse until after he meets with sanders on thursday  obama and sanders have spoken three times in the past month  earnest said  the president s eventual endorsement would put pressure on sanders to exit graciously and throw his support to clinton  sanders is also due to meet with senate minority leader harry reid
