west palm beach  fla   reuters    u s  president elect donald trump said on saturday that his administration would  do all it can  once he takes office on jan   to help increase freedom and prosperity for cuban people after the death of fidel castro  but his initial reaction to castro s death sidestepped whether the incoming president would make good on a threat made late in his white house campaign to reverse president barack obama s moves to open relations with the cold war adversary  obama used his executive powers on a series of steps to ease trade  travel and financial restrictions against cuba  arguing it was time to try diplomacy after the half century long economic embargo against cuba had failed to shake the regime  trump s first statement on cuba policy since the nov   election  issued from his palm beach  florida  resort where he and his family were spending the weekend after the thanksgiving holiday  did not address whether he would roll back obama s measures because of concerns about religious and political freedom in cuba   though the tragedies  deaths and pain caused by fidel castro cannot be erased  our administration will do all it can to ensure the cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty   trump said in the statement    while cuba remains a totalitarian island  it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long  and toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve   he said  trump has just begun to fill out the top ranks of his national security team  and has not yet named his top diplomat   the secretary of state   who will play a major role in formulating policy on cuba  he last week named mauricio claver carone  a political lobbyist who has strongly criticized obama s efforts to normalize relations with cuba and supports maintaining the u s  embargo against the island  to his transition team at the u s  treasury department  the agency is responsible for enforcing u s  trade and travel restrictions on cuba  claver carone is director of the u s  cuba democracy political action committee  claver carone was not immediately available for comment on saturday  trump s initial statement was viewed by some to mark a softening from his rhetoric on cuba policy late in the campaign  one u s  intelligence official told reuters  speaking on the condition of anonymity   this may be one place where his business interests prod him to take a more pragmatic course  even if that angers the hard core  anti castro elements of both parties   the official told reuters  a second u s  official noted the foreign policy advisers trump has named thus far are not known to have any particular interest in cuba  that may mean trump s economic team will have more sway over cuba policy  which could lead to a more pragmatic approach  the second official said  an aggressive policy by trump would close off lucrative opportunities to u s  businesses and hand them to european or asian firms  and would hurt companies like american airlines  aal o   due to start commercial flights to havana on monday for the first time in half a century  trump   a new york businessman and former reality tv star with an unconventional approach to politics   started his campaign saying he was open to lifting the long standing embargo on trade with cuba  in january  he said on fox news that he was in favor of  opening it up  with cuba  but wanted a better  deal  than obama had made  comments he repeated in a debate with republican rivals in march   i would want to make a strong  solid  good deal because right now  everything is in cuba s favor   trump said in march  saying he would  probably have the embassy closed  in havana until a new deal was made  when obama visited cuba later that month  trump said in an interview with cnn that he  probably  would continue to normalize economic and diplomatic relations with cuba  and would even open a trump hotel in cuba if the conditions were right   i think cuba has certain potential  and i think it s ok to bring cuba into the fold  but you have to make a much better deal   he said  noting he was worried cuba would sue the united states for reparations for damage caused by its decades long embargo on cuba  cuba policy was not part of a major foreign policy address trump delivered in april  after he secured his party s nomination  his position shifted to a more traditional republican position  at a miami rally in september  trump said he would roll back obama s cuban policy reforms unless cuban leaders allowed religious freedom and freed political prisoners   the next president can reverse them  and that i will do unless the castro regime meets our demands   trump told supporters  his vice presidential running mate  mike pence  also took a hard line   let me make you a promise   pence said in miami just days before the election   when donald trump is president of the united states  we will repeal obama s executive orders on cuba   on saturday  pence tweeted   the tyrant castro is dead  new hope dawns  we will stand with the oppressed cuban people for a free and democratic cuba  viva cuba libre   trump will face pressure to reverse obama s orders on cuba from a bloc of mostly republican cuban american lawmakers that has worked to keep tight restrictions on trade and travel with cuba for years  they believe cuba s government is still too repressive to ease economic and travel restrictions   the dictator has died  but the dictatorship has not   said u s  senator marco rubio of florida  a cuban american who ran against trump to be the republican presidential candidate   the future of cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the cuban people  and now more than ever congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights   but some republicans want to continue with obama s opening  u s  senator jeff flake of arizona  a leading republican anti embargo voice  said on saturday that  more frequent and consequential ties between cubans and americans  would more likely boost income and sap the strength of the castro government  democratic congresswoman kathy castor  who represents a tampa  florida  district with a significant cuban population  said she thinks castro s death could make it easier for the trump administration to change its cuba stance   while fidel castro was alive  there was an emotional impediment for greater engagement  from the cuban exile community in miami  castor told reuters   that emotional impediment now is gone   she said
