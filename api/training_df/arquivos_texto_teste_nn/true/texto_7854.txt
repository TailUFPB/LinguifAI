new york  reuters    hillary clinton s campaign was worried about the  hard balance  she would need to strike as the presidential candidate prepared to oppose a pacific trade pact championed by president barack obama that she once supported  according to emails published on tuesday by wikileaks  wikileaks released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of clinton campaign chair john podesta with exactly four weeks left in the  presidential campaign before the nov   election  white house hopefuls have made trade a key theme of their campaigns  with the  nation trans pacific partnership  tpp   a prime target for criticism by both democrat clinton and republican opponent donald trump   in an oct      email the day after the obama administration finalized the details of the tpp  clinton speechwriter dan schwerin circulated a new draft of a statement the campaign was preparing about clinton s position  according to wikileaks   this is indeed a hard balance to strike   schwerin wrote in the email to a handful of top advisers   since we don t want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed  or over claiming how bad it is  since it s a very close call on the merits    the next day  as she campaigned in iowa  the first state to pick candidates during the nominating contest  the campaign released a statement from clinton saying the pact did not meet the  very high  bar she had set to earn her support  the clinton campaign declined to verify the authenticity of the latest batch of podesta emails released by wikileaks  podesta told reporters on tuesday that the federal bureau of investigation notified him it is investigating the  criminal  hack of his emails published by wikileaks as part of a broader political hacking probe  the u s  government last week formally accused russia of hacking democratic party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election  a charge russia has denied  as a result  clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails    clinton s october  announcement on the tpp came just a week before the first debate in her primary race against u s  senator bernie sanders  a vocal opponent of the deal  key democratic constituencies  such as progressives and organized labor  have also criticized the pact  clinton had previously declined to say whether she would support the tpp  a main tenet of obama s strategic pivot to asia that began when she was his secretary of state from  to   explaining that she wanted to wait to assess the final negotiated terms   i accept the position we re taking but she has generally been more pro trade than anti   clinton strategist joel benenson responded to the draft from schwerin   while we re opposing this  don t we want to say something generally about ensuring american manufacturers can compete around the world   clinton s nascent campaign began meeting with advisers to u s  senator elizabeth warren even before clinton announced her second white house bid  according to the hacked emails  in a january  email sent three months before clinton officially launched her campaign  schwerin briefed close aides about a meeting with a longtime policy adviser to warren  a firebrand leader of the democratic party s liberal wing   warren s team was concerned that clinton would staff her campaign with economic advisers that were too closely associated with the centrist policies of her husband  former president bill clinton  such as those championed by his treasury secretary  robert rubin  the warren adviser  dan geldon   laid out a detailed case against the bob rubin school of democratic policy makers  was very critical of the obama administration s choices   schwerin wrote  schwerin said he and geldon went over a list of recommended hires that warren had sent to clinton  geldon told him they would be  watching carefully  to see how clinton staffed her campaign  schwerin wrote   they seem wary   and pretty convinced that the rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not   schwerin wrote of warren s advisers  geldon declined to comment on the email  schwerin also added that geldon expressed  some flexibility on glass steagall   a depression era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities that was repealed during bill clinton s administration   said too big too fail is the bigger issue   schwerin wrote  many democratic activists believe that reinstating glass steagall would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the u s  economy in   warren has said that there are two ways to break up too big banks  either based on size alone or by instituting a modern version of glass steagall  she introduced a bill in the u s  senate to reinstate a version of the law  clinton weighed supporting a new glass steagall law but eventually rejected that route  announcing a risk based approach for breaking up banks  according to an email wikileaks released on monday
