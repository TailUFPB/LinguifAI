philadelphia  reuters    as he seeks re election to his u s  senate seat this november  pennsylvania s pat toomey can make an unusual claim  he is the sole republican nationwide running with the endorsement of top u s  gun control advocates gabby giffords and michael bloomberg  that pair of endorsements could give the first term senator an edge over democratic challenger katie mcginty  a former environmental official in the white house and the pennsylvania governor s office  the race is one of a handful of close contests on nov   that could determine whether republicans  currently with a   majority  maintain control of the senate  both candidates are targeting educated moderate voters  particularly in the philadelphia suburbs  many of whom may be turned off by the rhetoric of republican presidential candidate donald trump  according to political analysts in pennsylvania  mcginty  who calls her support of gun control measures stronger than toomey s  is working hard to dismiss his endorsements from giffords and bloomberg  and has touted her own endorsement by a pennsylvania anti gun violence group  giffords  considered a hero by many gun control advocates  is a democratic former u s  congresswoman from arizona who survived being shot in a  assassination attempt and has become an activist for gun restrictions  bloomberg is the billionaire former new york city mayor who considered a run for the presidency this year and  since leaving office  has focused much of his energy on gun control  mcginty has called toomey s commitment to gun safety  paper thin  and notes that the republican incumbent received an  a  rating from the influential national rifle association gun rights lobbying group during his first senate run in   the issue of gun rights is potent in a nation where the right to  keep and bear arms  is enshrined in constitution s second amendment  the nra opposes candidates who support gun control efforts including restricting the types of firearms people can own or expanding background checks required for gun buyers  many republicans side with the nra  while many democrats support gun control  opinion polls show toomey s race as virtually tied  even as democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads trump by several percentage points in a state that has voted democratic in the past six presidential contests  starting in   pennsylvania is home both to rural communities where hunting is a popular pastime and big cities including philadelphia and pittsburgh where crime and gun violence are major concerns  shifting attitudes on guns in the state have emboldened both parties in pennsylvania to distance themselves from the nra s stance opposing almost any effort to restrict gun rights  the state s law mandating background checks for private handgun sales already goes beyond federal law  said terry madonna  director of the franklin   marshall college poll in lancaster  pennsylvania   pennsylvania has a very substantial hunting and fishing culture   madonna said   but hunters aren t opposed to that   toomey s position on guns sets him apart from most of his republican u s  senate counterparts  as he tries to attract moderates while keeping conservative voters in his column  in a telephone interview  toomey said the giffords and bloomberg endorsements recognized  that what i did was a very hard thing to do politically   he also emphasized his belief that most gun owners share his position   i m a strong second amendment supporter   toomey said   i see no contradiction between that support and insisting on background checks  so that people who ve got no right to the second amendment because they re dangerous criminals or they re dangerously mentally ill or they re terrorists  should be denied a firearm any way we can   giffords has also endorsed illinois senator mark kirk  another republican running for re election  though bloomberg has not weighed in on that race  in an email  mcginty told reuters toomey is  no moderate  when it comes to gun violence   time and again  he has sided with the gun lobby instead of doing what s right to keep communities safe   mcginty said   pat toomey has completely run away from legislation to expand background checks  since it failed to pass the senate three years ago   toomey made headlines in  following an elementary school massacre in newtown  connecticut  when he and democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia introduced legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers nationwide  that legislation  fiercely opposed by the nra  failed in the senate  but toomey gained praise from democrats for bucking the majority of his party  he voted for a similar bill after the mass shooting last year in san bernardino  california  and supported republican backed legislation in congress this year following the orlando nightclub shooting to restrict access to firearms for people on official  terrorism watch lists   mcginty backed a stricter democratic backed version  none of the measures passed  mcginty  who called toomey s gun control positions weak  favors more sweeping restrictions such as bans on military style  assault weapons  and high capacity ammunition clips that toomey opposes  in a recent television ad  mcginty used a clip of toomey telling voters this summer that he had a  perfect record  with the nra  the nra has not yet released ratings or issued an endorsement in the race  toomey called mcginty a  political opportunist  and again pointed to his support from giffords and bloomberg   the idea that somehow they ve all got it wrong and katie mcginty  my opponent  has it right is just laughable   he said   this story corrects senator mark kirk s home state to illinois from ohio in  paragraph
