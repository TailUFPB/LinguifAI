 reuters    scientists may steal a page from the oil industry s playbook to stop president donald trump rewriting the u s  position on climate change  by relying on an obscure law meant to ensure federal agencies present accurate information  the  information quality act  passed under republican president george w  bush  has for years provided a way for companies and their lobbyists to challenge federal agencies  assumptions on issues ranging from the threats posed by global warming to the health effects of petrochemicals  now  as trump s leadership seeks to get the environmental protection agency into line with the new administration s more pro business and anti regulation agenda  the act could become a tool for rebellious scientists and climate advocates  legal experts said  trump has expressed doubts about the science behind climate change  putting his administration on a collision course with an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that human consumption of fossil fuels is warming the planet and triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms  a spokesman for trump s epa said last week that the agency s website is under review  raising worries of a rewrite that could put the site at odds with epa employees  own research  a trump administration official did not respond to a request for comment   posting blatantly false information on the epa s website would violate the information quality act   said romany webb  a climate law fellow at columbia university   the guidelines clearly state that information disseminated to the public  including via a website  must be substantively accurate   michael halpern  deputy director for the center for science and democracy at the union of concerned scientists  a non profit climate science advocacy group  said the information quality act could be one of the options scientists consider using to ensure federal agencies match scientific research  the information quality act allows individuals who object to information presented by a federal agency to request a correction  if the agency denies the request  the individual can appeal in a process overseen by an independent inspector general  in the case of the epa  the appeal would go to a panel of political appointees   who will likely be named after trump s pick to head the epa  oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  is confirmed  the epa s inspector general  however  is already in place  arthur elkins  a former epa lawyer appointed by barack obama in    we have discretionary authority to look at anything we think is important and valuable to the agency s activities   alan larsen  counsel to the inspector general  told reuters   if employees were asked to do something improper     they could bring that to the ig s office   the washington post reported this week that a member of the trump transition team had sent an email stating inspectors general across federal agencies were being held over on a  temporary basis   after some backlash  trump transition team members then sought to reassure the inspectors general they would not be forced out  the post reported  there are other ways employees can flag their concerns  including by complaining to the agency s scientific integrity officer  the scientific integrity office meets quarterly with the inspector general s office to discuss complaints  industry s use of the information quality act over the years has had mixed results  just five of the  requests for correction filed in  ended up fully or partially corrected  according to a report to congress  halpern said  however  that he expected better results if scientists file complaints rather than industry   overruling a correction request brought by scientists within the agency  he said  could violate the epa s scientific integrity policy  which states agency scientists have the right of last review over information that relies on their expertise  a former epa official who asked not to be named said that  under normal circumstances  the internal mechanisms to protect website accuracy should work  but added  we re in uncharted territory
