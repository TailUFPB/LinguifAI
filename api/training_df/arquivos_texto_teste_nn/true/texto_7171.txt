washington  reuters    on his way to the polls on election day  michael flynn pulled out his phone and took a video of himself saying his vote for donald trump was part of a larger fight against  the dishonesty and deceit of our government   for flynn  a retired u s  army three star general and one of trump s closest advisers  it was another parting shot at an administration he thinks unfairly fired him from the defense intelligence agency  dia  in  for telling hard truths about the war on islamist extremism  named on thursday to become trump s national security adviser  flynn is now poised for a second act in public life   and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval      we just went through a revolution   flynn    told a forum on saturday   this is probably the biggest election in our nation s history  since bringing on george washington when he decided not to be a king  that s how important this is   flynn s advocates say his experience battling radical islamist militants in iraq and afghanistan  along with candor that has ruffled feathers in washington more than once  makes him the kind of ally trump needs on his national security team  david deptula  a retired air force lieutenant general who used to work with flynn  praised his willingness to  speak truth to power and not politicize his answers    mike flynn is a straight shooter and a no bullshit kind of guy  and that s exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership   deptula said  his critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at dia  a lumbering bureaucracy that flynn sought to shake up  that s an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement  flynn could not be reached for comment  several former u s  officials who worked closely with flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the dia that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials   flynn understood that dia was a mess   one said   but he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas  no matter their merits   two other former officials also said they had concerns about flynn s management style  a potential liability in a white house job that requires coordinating u s  policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies  one of the officials said senior career dia officials and other agency employees held flynn responsible for an offensive  dress for success  presentation that was distributed to the workforce in january   it recommended gender specific fashion guidelines  urged people to  consider your body type  and said makeup made women  more attractive       flynn apologized for the presentation in a subsequent memo that said neither he nor the agency  condone this briefing   flynn s policy views suggest he will take a more aggressive approach against islamist militants  former colleagues expect his effort to bolster america s battle against jihadists to be shaped by his belief that the united states is losing a global war against islamist extremism that may last for generations  in a new book flynn co authored  he prescribes a harder political line on iran  including information warfare to expose shortcomings in iran s revolution  like trump  flynn calls the  invasion of iraq a strategic blunder and says that energy should have been directed instead toward political support for opponents of iran s theocratic rulers  he shares trump s vision of warmer relations with israel  but also advocates stronger ties with egypt  whose autocratic president  abdel fattah al sisi  ousted the muslim brotherhood and was the first world leader to congratulate trump on his victory  flynn s appearances on russia s government run broadcaster rt  particularly at a gala last year attended by president vladimir putin  have also raised eyebrows in military circles   however  he has also expressed skepticism about moscow s intentions   a view that does not seem to fit trump s vision of a new era of detente with the kremlin   although he has more experience battling the taliban  al qaeda and other militant groups than anyone else in trump s inner circle  flynn s critics in the intelligence community and the military question whether his ouster from the dia has changed him   the whole experience seems to have made him bitter   said another former u s  official who worked with flynn and spoke on condition of anonymity  representative adam schiff  the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee  questioned flynn s temperament  saying trump needs someone more steady and  thorough in their analysis  to temper him    i m not sure that s what you get with general flynn  and i would be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive security adviser   schiff told cnn  former colleagues are alarmed by his adoption of trump s divisive campaign rhetoric   including leading chants of  lock her up   aimed at hillary clinton during the republican national convention and saying on twitter  fear of muslims is rational    i think what you have is frustration that eventually turns to anger after he leaves   said this former u s  official   he was frustrated over dia  he was frustrated over administration policy toward syria  and he s frustrated and angry over his removal from the department of defense
