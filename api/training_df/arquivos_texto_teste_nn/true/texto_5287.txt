brussels  reuters    when donald trump called the european union  wonderful  and said he was  totally in favor of it   some brussels officials feared the headline was a hoax  given the u s  president s earlier apparent disdain for the bloc  trump s remarks in an interview with reuters late on thursday appeared to contrast sharply with comments he made last month when he labeled the eu a  vehicle for germany   called brexit a  great thing  and said more countries would follow britain out of the bloc   european diplomats were quick to credit vice president mike pence with persuading his boss of the union s merits after himself being convinced by top eu officials he met in brussels at the start of the week  officials said it was unclear  however  if trump s policies would match the pro eu language which pence used on monday or that of white house strategist steve bannon  whose scepticism about the bloc had been reflected in trump s earlier comments  as pence was preparing to fly to europe to reassure allies that trump backed the nato defense pact and wanted cooperation  bannon told germany s ambassador last week that washington would deal with individual states  but not the eu  in the reuters interview  trump delivered a conciliatory message  when asked if he supported the european union as a governing body for the continent  he said   i do  sure     the eu  i m totally in favor of it  i think it s wonderful  if they re happy  if they re happy  i m in favor of it    pence   bannon    at the end of the first quarter   one senior eu official said   these statements clearly  explicitly  go against what bannon has been saying   said another    we are starting to see traces of pragmatism in washington   a third senior eu foreign policy official said  a senior diplomat spoke of the union now seeing  some return on the investment  in laying out its concerns to pence over the risk of reversing decades of active u s  encouragement for europe to pool its sovereignty and resources  but the question remained   will trump be saying the same thing tomorrow   asked about trump s new remarks  a commission spokesman said only that the eu executive read them  with interest    on monday  eu officials said they were reassured that pence had understood a strong message from european council president donald tusk and european commission president jean claude juncker  in separate meetings  that the eu as a bloc was good for the united states   pence clearly understood something in the meeting   one eu official said of talks with tusk  a former polish prime minister who said that he spoke with unusual directness in the talks  at a news conference  pence repeatedly name checked the  union  as a partner  in contrast to earlier statements on his european visit that focused only on u s  cooperation with  europe   tusk  jailed during soviet backed military rule in poland  seized on pence bringing up his own youthful travels to divided cold war berlin to remind him at the news conference of commitments made by an earlier republican president  ronald reagan    i think pence was surprised by the strength of tusk s questions and anxiety   an eu official said of the earlier meeting between the two men   he said he would take the message back to trump  it sounds like trump listened
