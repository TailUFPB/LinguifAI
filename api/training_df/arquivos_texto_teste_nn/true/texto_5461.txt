washington  reuters    president donald trump s national security adviser  michael flynn  resigned late on monday after revelations that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office and misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  flynn s resignation came hours after it was reported that the justice department had warned the white house weeks ago that flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with russian ambassador sergey kislyak before trump took power on jan    flynn s departure was a sobering development in trump s young presidency  a  day period during which his white house has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas  the departure could slow trump s bid to warm up relations with russian president vladimir putin  flynn submitted his resignation hours after trump  through a spokesman  pointedly declined to publicly back flynn  saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to pence  flynn had promised pence he had not discussed u s  sanctions with the russians  but transcripts of intercepted communications  described by u s  officials  showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the russian ambassador  such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy  known as the logan act  pence had defended flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled   unfortunately  because of the fast pace of events  i inadvertently briefed the vice president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the russian ambassador  i have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president  and they have accepted my apology   flynn said in his resignation letter  retired general keith kellogg  who has been chief of staff of the white house national security council  was named the acting national security adviser while trump determines who should fill the position  kellogg  retired general david petraeus  a former cia director  and robert harward  a former deputy commander of u s  central command  are under consideration for the position  a white house official said  harward was described by officials as the leading candidate  a u s  official confirmed a washington post report that sally yates  the then acting u s  attorney general  told the white house late last month that she believed flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the russian ambassador  she said flynn might have put himself in a compromising position  possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail  the official said  yates was later fired for opposing trump s temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly muslim nations  a u s  official  describing the intercepted communications  said flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions  but he did indicate that sanctions imposed by president barack obama on russia for its ukraine incursion  would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the u s  and russia   the official said  flynn  a retired u s  army lieutenant general  was an early supporter of trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in washington  he frequently raised eyebrows among washington s foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade trump to warm up u s  relations with russia    a u s  official said flynn s departure  coupled with russia s aggression in ukraine and syria and republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on russia  removes trump s most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward putin  flynn s leaving  may make a significant course change less likely  at least any time soon   the official said  another official said flynn s departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries  including defense secretary jim mattis and secretary of state rex tillerson  however  the second official said  flynn s exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides steve bannon and stephen miller  whom he described as already having the president s ear  congressional democrats expressed alarm at the developments  surrounding flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened   we are communicating this request to the department of justice and fbi this evening   said democratic representatives john conyers of michigan and elijah cummings of maryland  u s  representative adam schiff of california  ranking democrat on the house permanent select committee on intelligence  said flynn s departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the russians   the trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of flynn s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials  or with their knowledge   schiff said  the committee s chairman  republican devin nunes  thanked flynn for his service   washington d c  can be a rough town for honorable people  and flynn   who has always been a soldier  not a politician  deserves america s gratitude and respect   he said
