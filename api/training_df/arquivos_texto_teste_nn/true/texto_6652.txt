washington  reuters    president barack obama on friday strongly suggested that russian president vladimir putin personally authorized the computer hacks of democratic party emails that american intelligence officials say were aimed at helping republican donald trump win the nov   election  but with only a month left in office  during a somber press conference before leaving for a family holiday in hawaii  obama spoke despairingly about the  nasty  state of u s  politics  saying the chasm between democrats and republicans has made it possible for russia to cause mischief  obama said he has  great confidence  in intelligence reports he has seen showing that russians hacked into emails belonging to the democratic national committee and to john podesta  who was campaign chairman for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  the leaked emails revealed details of paid speeches clinton gave to wall street  party infighting and comments from top aides to clinton who were shocked about the extent of her use of a private server to send emails while secretary of state  the leaks led to embarrassing media coverage and prompted some party officials to resign  obama  who campaigned vigorously for clinton  said she was treated unfairly and found the media coverage of her troubling   this happened at the highest levels of the russian government   obama said when asked whether putin was personally involved in the hacks  he added that  not much happens in russia without vladimir putin   obama said he warned putin in september to stop meddling in american political campaigns  telling his russian counterpart to  cut it out  during a face to face encounter in china at a group of  meeting  obama said he did not believe that u s  electronic voting systems were tampered with  obama  however  stopped short of directly blaming putin and said he also wanted to give u s  intelligence officials more time to produce a report that is due before he leaves office on jan   and trump is sworn in as his successor  obama called russia a smaller and weaker country than the united states that  does not produce anything that others want to buy  except oil and gas and arms    the comments underscored what obama called the  sadly deteriorated  relationship between washington and moscow  which are also at odds over russia s role in syria s civil war and its aggressive actions in ukraine      russia has denied u s  accusations that it was behind the hacks  two senior government officials told reuters that the federal bureau of investigation backs the cia s view that russia indeed intervened to help trump win the presidential election  trump has maintained that he won the election fairly and has bristled at suggestions that moscow influenced the outcome     but at one point during the heated presidential campaign  he   publicly encouraged russia to hack clinton s emails  trump spoke glowingly in the campaign about putin  and since winning the election he has named top aides who have ties to russia  including his nominee for secretary of state  exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson  obama left open the door to u s  retaliation against russia to discourage further cyber attacks   countermeasures that may be up to trump to implement  obama said he has had  cordial  discussions with trump since the election and has stressed that he would do everything he can to ensure a smooth transition  but the outgoing president also criticized trump s fellow republicans broadly  referencing polls showing that more than one third of republicans approve of putin  who used to lead the kgb spy agency  obama said that conservative icon  ronald reagan would roll over in his grave                    in some cases  you have voters and elected officials who have more confidence and faith in a foreign adversary than they have in their neighbors   obama said  adding to the gloomy tone of obama s remarks  he addressed two other difficult foreign policy issues that will outlast his time in the white house   obama warned about the economic and geopolitical consequences of any breakdown in the u s  china relationship  and said trump should think carefully about the diplomatic repercussions if he decides to  upend  longstanding u s  diplomatic norms  trump angered china earlier this month when he took a congratulatory phone call from taiwan s president  tsai ing wen   the first call of its kind since  when president jimmy carter acknowledged taiwan as part of  one china   obama also condemned attacks on syrian civilians trying to flee the city of aleppo  blaming president bashar al assad and his allies in russia and iran for  atrocities   obama defended his decision to keep u s  troops out of syria and avoid military intervention  although he acknowledged the protracted anguish has weighed on him   everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do  but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap   he said
