north charleston  s c   reuters    u s  senator tim scott faced a quandary on saturday in hosting his town hall  he promised to meet with his south carolina constituents  but he wanted to avoid the kind of adversarial free for all so many republicans encountered this week  scott decided to ban placards from his north charlestown meeting in hopes of averting the raucousness that erupted at dozens of town halls during the first congressional recess of donald trump s month old presidency  the senator also required the crowd submit questions in writing ahead of time after other republican lawmakers faced a wave of anger on issues ranging from trump s immigration and healthcare policies to the president s ties to russia   despite scott s precautions  arguments broke out and constituents told one another to shut up  though many in the audience   mostly white and over the age of    said the senator remained respectful and sincere  and it never degenerated into an all out shouting match  scott  the only african american republican in the u s  senate  began his town hall by pulling slips of paper from a box and reading the questions aloud  but the overflow audience of   evenly divided between trump opponents and supporters  reacted with loud boos and cheers  even before he could begin to answer  to a question about a rise in hate crimes  scott said the trend predates the president s campaign    we can blame trump for a lot of things but i don t think we can blame him for this one   he said  following a pattern of distancing himself from trump without directly criticizing him   some people have come to the conclusion that this president has already failed   scott said   i hope that most of us  whether you voted for him or not  hope that he succeeds   when asked about trump s repeated denunciations of the media  scott said he believed the press was more biased than in the past  even so  he said   i do not believe the press is an enemy to the american people   a phrase coined by the president  still  the meeting s format started to break down almost from the outset  with the audience shouting asides  while others tried to silence them  scott answered some of the comments  but if he was interrupted  he tried to talk over the offender  the confrontational tone of this week s town halls is part of a tide of anti trump protests  marches and rallies that show little sign of abating just over a month into the new administration   the anti trump energy has prompted talk of a liberal style tea party movement  in reference to the protests in  that helped reshape the republican party and arguably laid the groundwork for trump s surprise electoral victory last year      at scott s town hall  the senator did allow a mother to stand up and tell her story  she said one of her two premature children died and the other was  years old with medical bills totaling more than   million  she said tearfully    the affordable care act is imperfect but it is a good law  it saved my family   she said to a standing ovation  referring to the health care program known as obamacare   that s a heartbreaking story   scott said  pointing out that he chose aca coverage for himself and his staff  even so      obamacare is not sustainable   the session almost broke down when a man stood up and faced the crowd as audience members were peppering scott with loud comments   let the man answer the question   the man said on the senator s behalf   sit down and shut up    two men who wore red  make america great again  hats clapped loudly  arguments broke out in the crowd   eventually  scott threatened to walk out   i know we prefer to blame trump for our incivility   he said   let me ask  if we want to continue this conversation  that we do so in a way that no one feels threatened   his admonitions appeared to work  order was eventually restored  and scott gave up on picking questions from the box and started calling on audience members if they raised their hands  the session ended on a relatively civil note    story corrects paragraph  to read  the only african american republican in the u s  senate  instead of  the only african american in the u s  senate
