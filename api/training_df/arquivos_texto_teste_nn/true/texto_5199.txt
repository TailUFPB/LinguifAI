washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump showed a different side in his first address to congress  this trump was part deal maker  part salesman  asking for unity and trying to repackage his populist message in more palatable terms   he was less combative  less thin skinned and more inclusive   and where five weeks ago at his inauguration  he slammed washington s politicians as out of touch elitists who prospered at the expense of the public  his message on tuesday night was different  i need you  republicans and democrats alike  always a showman  the reality tv star turned politician laid out plenty of promises  a massive infrastructure and public works program  tax cuts for the middle class  immigration reform  a healthcare overhaul  an education bill  all of it would require congressional action  likely by different coalitions of conservatives  moderates and democrats    this is our vision  this is our mission   trump said   but we can only get there together   trump  a republican who has taunted democrats over his  election victory and publicly fumed as they held up his cabinet nominees  did not criticize them this time  repeatedly  he asked for their help  arguing that the country s problems call for bipartisan solutions   after weeks of attacks on the media  political rivals and the judges who ruled against his executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven muslim majority countries  trump finally eased off  although his proposals were short on specifics   it was a softer tone and he gave a speech and not a tweet and that s more suitable when you re president of the united states   said democratic representative peter welch   the challenges are going to be the details on his policies    he was presidential tonight in a way he has not been before this   said republican consultant matt mackowiak  the address appeared to show some recognition by the white house that trump s bombastic go it alone style has its limits  after a parade of executive orders  trump must now turn his attention to the big ticket items on his agenda requiring legislative action    he s done all he can unilaterally   said bradley blakeman  a former aide to president george w  bush   now he needs to pass bills   even though republicans control congress  blakeman said trump needs democrats to build a majority that would allow conservative republicans to oppose some of his more centrist proposals  such as hefty infrastructure spending and talks on immigration reform    the president is as transactional a person as we ve ever seen   blakeman said   he understands that you might not like this deal  but i need you for three other deals    despite the softer tone  trump s divisive policies and months of hostile rhetoric will not be forgotten by his adversaries  senate democratic leader chuck schumer  in a round of television interviews on wednesday morning  dismissed trump s speech as detached from reality  saying the softer tone did not match the administration s hard line agenda presented so far   his speeches are populist  they re aimed at the working folks who supported him  but his governing and what he does is hard right  favoring special interests over the working class   schumer told cbs  nancy pelosi  the leading democrat in the u s  house of representatives  told msnbc that trump gave a good sales pitch but has offered little in the way of concrete proposals   all they have is rhetoric  we don t have any reality in terms of any legislation   congressional democrats said they liked trump s infrastructure program  his childcare tax credit  his call to reduce the prices of prescription drugs  and his vow to preserve some key elements of former president barack obama s signature  health insurance law  democrats remain troubled  among other things  by trump s desire to slash domestic programs to increase military spending  his plans to reduce taxes for the wealthy and corporations  as well as his aggressive policy to deport illegal immigrants    to be sure  the more foreboding elements of trump s campaign rhetoric were still present  albeit slightly dialed down  as he did during the campaign  he portrayed a country in ruinous economic shape and plagued by terrorism  drugs  gangs  and illegal immigrants  in coming days  the white house is likely to release a revised version of its travel ban  reigniting a controversy that overshadowed the first weeks of trump s presidency   trump came into the address struggling with public opinion  in an interview with fox news he acknowledged that he and his staff had not been effective communicators  the most recent reuters ipsos tracking poll found about  percent of americans disapproved of trump s performance  with  percent backing him  poor numbers for a new president   mackowiak said trump s address could reverse his fortunes in a  crucial moment  for his presidency   his public support will improve from this speech   he said    but john geer  a public opinion expert at vanderbilt university  was not convinced   he s going to have to do more than give a speech
