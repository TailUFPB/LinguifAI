new york  reuters    former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani is now the leading candidate to become president elect donald trump s secretary of state  but even some republicans say his tough guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy  giuliani    has been one of trump s most vocal and high profile supporters  and according to sources close to him and trump  he is eager to become the top u s  diplomat and expects a decision by trump as early as next week  the other top candidate  the sources said  is former united nations ambassador john bolton  a foreign policy hawk  new york mayor at the time of the sept      attacks by al qaeda militants  giuliani is also considered a hard liner on national security matters  but he has little diplomatic experience  still  some prominent republicans said he is qualified to take command of u s  diplomacy at a time of chaos in the middle east  rising nationalism in much of europe  and growing challenges from russia and china  senator lindsey graham  a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the senate armed services committee and who made a rather short lived bid for the  republican presidential nomination  on tuesday called giuliani  competent and capable  of being secretary of state    rudy is an internationally known figure  he s a personal friend  he has dealt with the unimaginable  which was    he s a loyal supporter of president trump  he should be rewarded in my view   graham told reporters  giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with fox news channel s sean hannity on tuesday    i ve been in  countries   different foreign trips   giuliani said   a lot of it for different reasons  speeches  security consulting  where i helped bring down crime   critics  however  said they are troubled not only by giuliani s combative nature and lack of experience  but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an iranian exile group that was on the u s  terrorism list until four years ago  the trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of giuliani for secretary of state  after serving as new york mayor for eight years  giuliani founded management and security consulting firm giuliani partners in   which he left in  when he campaigned for the republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties   the firm s clients have included colombia and  reportedly  the government of qatar  giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his  failed presidential bid  and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of giuliani partners on the giuliani security and safety website  he joined a texas law firm as a name partner in   the firm did lobbying work for citgo  a u s  subsidiary of venezuela s state owned oil company  which at the time was  controlled by president hugo chavez  venezuela s late socialist ruler  at the time  giuliani s office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said giuliani believed that  chavez is not a friend of the united states   giuliani s dealings in russia may face scrutiny in senate confirmation hearings  his ties to triglobal strategic ventures  a consulting firm that helps western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former soviet union  date back to   when giuliani visited moscow to meet russian businessmen and politicians  according to the company s website  the consulting firm s president  vitaly pruss  has  created and developed strategies  for companies including russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft and has  worked closely  with giuliani partners  according to his profile on triglobal s website  state owned transneft was among russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by western powers following russia s annexation of crimea under president vladimir putin  giuliani also has spoken in support of the people s mujahedin organization of iran  a group of islamic leftists who opposed iran s late shah  but fell out with the shi ite clerics who took power after the  revolution and later aligned itself with iraqi leader saddam hussein  the u s  government considered it a terrorist organization until   senator rand paul of kentucky  who also was a contender for the  republican presidential nomination  told cnn on tuesday he was worried about giuliani s ties to foreign governments       whether or not you have divided loyalties obviously is very important   paul said   i hope donald trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail   iraq war was a mistake  regime change in the middle east is a mistake   you want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy   he said  critics  however  say the bottom line is that giuliani is no diplomat  either personally or professionally      the challenge for giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights  democratic accountability  and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink america s influence abroad   said ken roth  executive director of human rights watch  who worked for giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between  and
