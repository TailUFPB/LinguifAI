washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump s proposal for suspending immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism could have a legal basis  but his assertion that it be part of a broader ban on muslim immigrants makes it constitutionally untenable  legal scholars say  the new twist in trump s anti muslim rhetoric came in the aftermath of a weekend shooting massacre at a florida nightclub by the american born son of afghan immigrants  in a fiery speech on monday  he expanded on his proposed temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  vowing if elected to halt immigration from any area of the world where there is a  proven history of terrorism  against america or its allies  he also accused the muslim american community of broad complicity in attacks such as the orlando shooting  which was carried out by a gunman pledging allegiance to islamic state  and threatened  big consequences  for those who fail to inform on their neighbors  many legal experts said trump s proposal for a religion based ban would be unlikely to pass the test of u s  constitutional guarantees of religious freedom  due process and equal protection and would likely be struck down by the courts if he tried to implement them by presidential decree  however  a ban on immigrants from certain countries has some precedent and might pass muster   some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional chinese exclusion act of   which was used for years to halt the influx of chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on america s immigration record  but trump s overall immigration plan would go beyond that  targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion  something that no modern u s  president has done    this is an absurd proposal to build a fortress america and pull up the drawbridges   said john bellinger  former legal adviser to the bush administration  president barack obama took a veiled swipe at trump on tuesday  saying such ideas represented a  dangerous  mindset  but u s  presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters  and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly trump framed it  they note  for instance  that democratic president jimmy carter barred iranian nationals from entering the united states during the  iran hostage crisis   if a trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries  rather than certain religions  it would not violate the constitution   said john yoo  a law professor at the university of california berkeley and former justice department official who advised the george w  bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects  herman schwartz  a law professor at american university in washington  said if trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on muslim immigrants  that raises significant constitutional questions and  shows his shaky command of the legal facts   in monday s speech in new hampshire  trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban muslims from entering the united states  which he first laid out in december after an islamic state linked deadly mass shooting in san bernardino  california  debate over the legality of trump s proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected  while legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries  the united states does not currently ban immigration from any country  officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such syria and iran  under the broadest interpretation of trump s pronouncement   immigration could be barred not only from the muslim world but from u s  allied countries in europe and asia where militant attacks have taken place  this could include india  the source of many skilled engineers for the u s  technology sector  critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive   is mr  trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries   said bellinger   rather than increase economic growth  mr  trump s plan could cost the u s  economy billions of dollars   republican senator jeff sessions  a trump foreign policy adviser  justified the candidate s pronouncement  saying  it is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest   but orrin hatch  the longest serving republican in the senate  when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion  said   i m not sure he does   legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of trump s demand that members of the american muslim community  cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad  or else they will be  brought to justice  themselves   critics have accused him of anti muslim fear mongering to win votes   generally  the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the united states   said daniel richman  a columbia university law professor and former federal prosecutor  if trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president  he said  potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self incrimination and continue to remain silent
