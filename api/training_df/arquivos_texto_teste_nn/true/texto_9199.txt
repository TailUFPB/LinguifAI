 reuters    s p global ratings warned on thursday that the credit rating for key alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the state s long term fiscal problems   alaska governor bill walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal  and closing the state s nearly   billion deficit  which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices   s p on thursday put the state s aa plus general obligation  aa appropriation  and a plus moral obligation ratings on alaska s debt on creditwatch with negative implications   the bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation related projects    the creditwatch placement indicates that we may lower alaska s credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state s structural budget deficit   said gabriel petek  a s p global ratings credit analyst   since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a    billion spending plan for fiscal  and a bill to reduce the cost of the state s oil and gas tax credit program  s p said   but it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the state s permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state house of representatives  the bill  sb   would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund  even if it passes  s p said it remains to be seen whether sb  and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put alaska s fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory    enactment of sb  alone would shrink the deficit  but it wouldn t eliminate it  in order to fully close the structural fiscal gap  other measures   such as new income tax or more spending cuts   would also be necessary   s p said   despite the budget deficit  s p said alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high
