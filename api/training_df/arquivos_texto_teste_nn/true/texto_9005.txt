washington  reuters    democrats in congress ended a  hour sit in on the floor of the house of representatives where they have been countless times before  short of the votes needed to tighten u s  gun laws  but many see their latest defeat as a prelude to victory in the nov   elections  spurred by the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history  democrats are showing a new willingness to make gun laws a top issue in washington and on the campaign trail  defying powerful lobbying groups like the national rifle association that have helped make the united states the most gun friendly country in the developed world  the effort is not likely to change federal firearms laws this year  as republicans who control congress have shown little interest in proposals that they say weaken americans  constitutional right to bear arms  but democrats and their allies say that defeat now on capitol hill could help them win control of the white house and both chambers of congress in the nov   elections  that is a shift from previous elections when democrats have downplayed the issue on the campaign trail   the tide has turned  and republicans ignore this issue at their own peril   said robert weiner  a former democratic congressional aide   hillary clinton  the democrats  presumptive presidential nominee  talks frequently in her campaign about banning military style assault rifles and expanding background checks   a marked contrast to president barack obama  who avoided talk of guns during his  and  elections  in congress  democrats have resorted to confrontational tactics to force gun votes since june   when a gunman killed  people at a florida nightclub  senator chris murphy s  hour speech in the senate last week forced five votes this week on measures that would make it harder for terrorism suspects to buy guns  though none have advanced  in the house  democrats occupied the chamber for  hours in an unsuccessful attempt to force votes on terrorism suspects and expanding background checks for gun buyers  republican pollster kellyanne conway said democrats  willingness to talk about guns reflects the party becoming more liberal  not a change in public sentiment   most voters view the shooting in orlando as an act of terrorism inspired by islamic state  she said   the shooter called  to pledge allegiance to isis  he did not call  and pledge allegiance to smith   wesson   she said  referring to an acronym for islamic state and the firearms manufacturer  still  democrats  willingness to take a stand on gun control has shifted the debate  said democratic strategist hank sheinkopf   there s a potentially a good electoral outcome for democrats out of this  they will probably pick up seats   he said  after landslide defeats in  and   most democrats who remain in office tend to represent safely liberal congressional districts where gun control is popular  but those up for election in competitive states have spoken up as well  u s  representative patrick murphy  who hopes to unseat republican u s  senator marco rubio in gun friendly florida  said during the house sit in that gun rights groups like the nra are  largely responsible  for the country s   annual gun deaths    this passion you re seeing is what s needed to get people to wake up   he said on the house floor  the nra did not respond to a request for comment  democrats have public opinion on their side  a reuters ipsos opinion poll conducted this week found that  percent of those surveyed support strong gun regulations  while  percent support minimal rules  support runs higher for specific proposals  like imposing background checks on all gun buyers   bit ly   but intensity has been a sticking point for gun control advocates  the nra has been able to mobilize supporters who are willing to vote for or against a candidate solely because of their position on guns  while gun control supporters typically consider other issues as well  such as abortion and the environment   anytime the democrats start a gun movement  it costs them votes   said dave  mudcat  saunders  who has worked for centrist democratic candidates   i can t imagine it s changing   shootings in newtown  connecticut  san bernardino  california  charleston  south carolina  and  most recently  orlando have changed that dynamic  others say    mass shootings are highly visible  and force people to pay attention and realize that we have a problem that isn t going to be solved by more guns   said tharon johnson  a democratic strategist in atlanta who worked on obama s  campaign  the gun control lobbying group everytown for gun safety says its members generated   telephone calls to congress  and brought hundreds of its members to congress to press for action during the debate   i ve been in the fight for a number of years and i ve never seen anything like this   said colin goddard  an advocate with the group who was wounded during the  virginia tech mass shooting
