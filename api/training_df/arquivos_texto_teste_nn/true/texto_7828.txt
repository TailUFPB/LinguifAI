washington  reuters    with donald trump s u s  election prospects dimming and controversy swirling around him  future republican presidential hopefuls may be weighing whether standing by their man is the savvy move  party strategists fear voters fleeing trump will also fail to support republican candidates for the u s  senate and house of representatives  possibly costing the party control of congress  if trump loses the nov   presidential election to democrat hillary clinton  his polarizing candidacy may reverberate well past   tarring future republican white house hopefuls  potentially including house speaker paul ryan  u s  senator marco rubio and indiana governor mike pence  trump s vice presidential running mate  trump was struggling in opinion polls before a  video released last week showed him talking in sexually aggressive terms about seducing women  afterward came stories in several news outlets alleging trump had inappropriately touched women   trump has angrily denounced the stories  the media and republicans who have declined to support him   the brand has already been irrevocably damaged  there s nothing we can do in the short term   said doug heye  a former top official with the republican national committee  looking to the  u s  congressional election and the  presidential election  heye said   in two to four years  the stain on our party s soul won t be washed away   to be sure  a trump loss is no guarantee the republicans would suffer for long  four years after barry goldwater s massive loss in   richard nixon staged a republican comeback  the conservative heritage foundation think thank has said goldwater launched a shift to the right that would end half a century of liberal dominance in american politics   for republicans weighing a run for president in four years  deciding whether to back trump may be a defining moment equal to what politicians faced in  when they decided whether to back republican president george bush s iraq invasion  by   public sentiment had turned harshly against the iraq war  some republican politicians lost their jobs  and democrats seized both the house and senate  republican presidential hopefuls of the future may be asking  how can i be loyal and stand by trump while at the same time expand the party s base to include sectors the candidate has alienated   more broadly  they may ask  what s the right side of history  trump s candidacy has attracted passionate support from a core group of voters but also driven away some moderates and independents  republicans such as heye fear trump  who already has alienated large populations of hispanic voters because of his hard line on immigration  will cost the party a generation of women voters as well  ryan  rubio and pence all have  to some degree  sought to distance themselves from trump  ryan this week told colleagues he would no longer publicly defend trump  in essence washing his hands of him  rubio  who ran against trump in the republican primary and is fighting for re election in his home state of florida  has criticized trump s remarks about women  but has not withdrawn his support  pence is routinely forced to answer for his running mate s conduct  but managed at last week s vice presidential debate to outline policy differences with him  if trump leads the party to crushing defeat next month  he may for years haunt republican office holders who supported him   i predict a chaotic round of finger pointing after the election  as people try to justify their position   said jim manley  a former top aide to senate minority leader harry reid who witnessed the democratic wave in  first hand  democrats are trying to link vulnerable senate candidates to trump at every turn  on thursday  the advocacy group american bridge highlighted trump s praise of rubio on local florida television  even as rubio has avoided appearing at any trump events in the state  clinton on twitter this week noted that ryan has not recanted his endorsement of trump  strategists say pence would have the hardest time emerging from trump s shadow   i think for pence  it s really tough   said republican operative liz mair  pence excited some conservative voters with his debate performance  a politico morning consult poll taken afterward showed him as the top choice for  among republicans  at  percent  ryan  texas senator ted cruz and rubio followed  cruz  who was trump s leading rival for the  republican nomination  illustrated the perils of trying to respond to trump s candidacy  after holding out  cruz endorsed trump last month  just before the candidate went into a public opinion tailspin  cruz and rubio  as well as ryan  have come under fire from some republicans for appearing to waver on trump  at times standing by him and at other times criticizing him   people that waffle are going to have more trouble than people who pick a side   said brian bartlett  a republican strategist who worked for mitt romney s  presidential campaign  he said ohio governor john kasich  another presidential candidate who consistently refused to endorse trump  may emerge in the strongest position of all  other potential  contenders  such as south carolina governor nikki haley  may benefit from not being on the ballot this year  thus being spared from being asked constantly about trump while campaigning  but that assumes the anti trump forces in the party hold sway after the election  there will still be a significant chunk of the party who will view trump s critics as disloyal  bartlett warned  which may put some establishment politicians on the spot to explain why they did not do more to support the nominee
