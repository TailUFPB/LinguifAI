new york  reuters    u s  treasury secretary jack lew on tuesday said puerto rico s financial crisis risks turning the commonwealth into a chaotic mess unless the u s  congress can enact a plan to restructure its debt   the challenge is for congress to act fast enough so that the unfolding crisis in puerto rico doesn t cascade out of control   lew said during an on stage interview at the annual milken institute conference in los angeles  the island faces   billion in debt overall  a staggering  percent poverty rate and a shrinking population  it owes another    billion on july  that governor alejandro garcia padilla says it cannot pay  on monday the government development bank defaulted on a   million debt payment while it agreed to a tentative restructuring framework with some large creditors who promised to hold back from taking legal action for  days  congress is debating a bill to put the island s finances under federal oversight and allow it to restructure debt in a bankruptcy like process  the bill has faced criticism from conservative and liberal wings of both parties  lew reiterated there was so far little spillover from puerto rico s problems into the    trillion u s  municipal bond market where it is a major issuer of triple tax free debt   in the absence of a restructuring  what you will end up with is a chaotic unwinding which does enormous harm to millions of americans  including veterans who served loyally in our military  that i believe is something that has more of a potential spillover risk to the municipal bond market than anything else   lew said  as a u s  territory  puerto rico cannot file for bankruptcy protection  it is struggling to pay for basic services like police and firefighters as well as combat the spread of the  zika virus  lew reiterated that putting in place an independent oversight authority to work out an orderly restructuring would also ensure fairness to all stakeholders  some investors are concerned that if all bondholders are treated the same  there is a risk of eroding well established rules governing who gets paid and when in a restructuring   the cost of delay is that you get to a point where there is nothing to restructure  if you get to a point where the restructuring can t work  then you either let chaos happen or you have a bailout  i believe restructuring is the alternative to a bailout   lew said
