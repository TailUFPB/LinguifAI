seoul  reuters    u s  treasury secretary jack lew said on friday china would see  very bad consequences  for its economy and bilateral u s  relations if it backs away from its stated goals to open its markets and rebalance its economy toward consumer led growth  lew  in an interview with reuters in seoul  said he would  keep the pressure  on chinese officials during talks in beijing next week to stick to their reform commitments and execute pledges to reduce excess industrial capacity that is distorting world markets  china faces diminished economic prospects in the medium and long term if it fails to continue its reforms  lew said   frankly  if china takes a time out or a step back on the reform agenda  that will have very bad consequences for china s economy and it will flow over and not be good in terms of our bilateral economic relations   lew said  the u s  china strategic and economic dialogue meetings on june   in beijing come at a time of increasing trade tensions between the world s two largest economies  the u s  commerce department has recently imposed steep anti dumping and anti subsidy duties on a wide range of chinese steel products  while u s  business groups have complained about new chinese regulations they say favor local firms  meanwhile  the chinese yuan is plumbing five year lows against the dollar  raising concerns about the potential for another devaluation as the federal reserve prepares to resume interest rate increases after pausing for the past few months  lew said china had largely been keeping its  commitments to avoid competitive currency devaluations  adding that its action in recent months to spend reserves to support the yuan  also known as the renminbi or rmb  have been consistent with those commitments     china s intervention in the last year has not been to devalue but it s been largely to support the rmb   lew said   i think the test of whether china s moved decisively in an orderly way to a more market oriented exchange rate is whether they re willing to tolerate movement in both directions   likewise  lew said south korea also needed to resist temptations to intervene in currency markets when there is upward pressure on the won  he said seoul had refrained from active interventions for the past six to nine months   we have made it clear that we ve recognized that  but we ve also said that that has to be a durable policy  it has to be a policy that can withstand pressure when markets are going in both directions   he said  he said south korea s interest in joining the trans pacific partnership free trade bloc  assuming the deal is ratified   would provide an incentive to improve its exchange rate policy  a currency side agreement to the tpp would require transparency in interventions and commitments to avoid interventions to gain trade advantages  the u s  china economic and foreign policy talks in beijing will also provide a forum to air u s  business groups  concerns about regulations in china that they say favor domestic firms  for example  foreign insurers have raised concerns about new cyber security regulations that require  secure and controllable  information technology   whether it s an anti monopoly law  or a national security law  if it s being either designed or implemented in a way that s designed to create undue burdens on foreign competition  that s problematic   lew said  lew said it was important for the next u s  president to continue the strategic and economic dialogue because otherwise such disputes may not be discussed on a bilateral basis  at a separate meeting on friday with south korean finance minister yoo il ho  lew said that coordinated global action was needed to increase pressure on north korea to drop its pursuit of nuclear weapons  a senior treasury official said that this would require additional actions by china to adhere to new sanctions aimed at cutting off north korea from the international financial system until it changes its behavior
