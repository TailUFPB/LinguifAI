new york  reuters    the email donald trump s campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar   meet me in new jersey   it urged  but something was different   you will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally   it added  the cost     during the months long battle for the republican presidential nomination  rallies staged by trump  the party s likely candidate in the nov   election  were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a day s wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse  supporters could buy snacks or hats or t shirts while they waited  but they never had to pay for admission  the may  rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for new jersey governor chris christie  a former presidential rival now working for trump who  according to news reports  needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign  the emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser  it was not clear whether trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers   the new york billionaire has claimed he was self funding his campaign and did not need donations  he has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the white house with loans to himself as well as around   million in unsolicited donations from fans  now that trump is pivoting toward the general election  where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around   billion  things are changing   the move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between trump and his fans  many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support  it will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity  either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears       when asked whether the format of the christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future  trump s spokeswoman  hope hicks  did not comment   this is a fundraiser for governor christie   she said  supporters have said trump s about face on fundraising does not bother them  susan kihne  a mandan  north dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the   it cost her was worth it   he s self funded up until now  so i don t mind supporting him   she said
