new york  reuters    supporters of billionaire donald trump appear unfazed by his decision to accept money from outside donors  despite his earlier vow to self fund his presidential campaign and his  criticism of rivals as puppets of wealthy special interests  the vow has been a cornerstone of trump s election strategy to present himself as an outsider who is not in the pocket of rich donors  even though he has accepted more than   million in contributions so far  the strategy paid off last week when the new york businessman emerged as the republican party s presumptive presidential nominee  after sweeping a series of state nominating contests  since then  trump has said he would no longer self finance and would work with the party to raise more than   billion to help him fight his eventual democratic party challenger  critics accused him of flip flopping  but some supporters don t agree  three dozen of the  pro trump voters reuters interviewed said they were not concerned about his reversal  only four indicated the switch made them uneasy  though all of them said they would still support him  most of those interviewed applauded the way the celebrity businessman billed himself as a  blue collar billionaire  who didn t need other people s money  but said they understood trump would need far more resources to compete in the general election  they would have no problem donating to the billionaire  albeit in the same kind of small increments that democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has used to build his nearly   million fundraising juggernaut    even though i m on welfare  i would donate to trump   said pamela thompson  a  year old mother of three school age kids from tulsa  oklahoma   and my kids would run a lemonade stand to help elect him   the supporters interviewed said trump s pledge to self finance his campaign was less important to them than his promises to crack down on undocumented workers and ease the pain of mostly white  blue collar towns that have seen manufacturing jobs lost to developing countries  sharon jones  a  year old wal mart cashier from coleman county  alabama  says her anger over undocumented immigrants shopping at her store on welfare benefits is animating her support for trump  who has promised to deport undocumented workers and build a wall along the u s  border with mexico   they are doing better than i am on my    an hour   jones said  the majority of supporters interviewed said they thought trump s decision to fundraise was strategically wise given that hillary clinton  the front runner for the democratic nomination  has raised more than   million so far   in the  election  republican nominee mitt romney and his democratic opponent  president barack obama  each raised   billion   you gotta fight fire with fire  bring it on   said cheryl ressler halvorson  a cattle rancher from williston  north dakota  whose support for trump stems mainly from her ire over having to pay    a month for health insurance with a    deductible due to the government mandate known as obamacare  halvorson is not an outlier  most trump supporters have stayed loyal despite the candidate frequently reversing or updating policy positions on key economic and social issues  trump is not the first u s  presidential candidate to change his mind about financing his election campaign  in the  election  obama also did an about face  he said he would forego public financing of his general election campaign against republican john mccain  this was a reversal of his earlier stance and it allowed him to pursue a record fund raising effort  supporters were unfazed by the shift and obama went on to win the election
