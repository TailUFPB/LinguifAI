washington  reuters    while president donald trump has suggested that the united states must expand its nuclear arsenal  many experts say u s  nuclear forces are unrivaled and will remain so as they undergo a modernization program that could cost more than   trillion  in an interview with reuters on thursday  trump said the united states has  fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity   he pledged to ensure that   we re going to be at the top of the pack    while moscow currently deploys  more strategic nuclear warheads than the united states does  both countries are bound by the  new start treaty to slash their deployed strategic warheads to no more than   each by february   the lowest level in decades  the accord also limits their deployed land  and submarine based missiles and nuclear capable bombers          however  nuclear weapons experts say  the  year modernization program  which maintains many existing weapons and their computers  communications  electronics  and other systems  is more important than having as many warheads as russia has  trump  says we can t fall behind  fall behind who and how   said stephen schwartz  an independent nuclear weapons expert    it is not clear to me  and it s not clear to many of my colleagues  what the president is talking about when he pledges to expand u s  nuclear weapons capacity  schwartz said  moreover  the u s  advantage is based not on the numbers of warheads it can field compared to russia  but on more advanced delivery systems      most of moscow s nuclear force   now being modernized  as well   is comprised of land based icbms whose locations it discloses to washington under arms control accords  said schwartz  former publisher of the bulletin of the atomic scientists leading journal  the united states maintains an  invulnerable  fleet of nuclear armed submarines beneath the atlantic and pacific oceans that are immune from detection  he said  in contrast  russia s accident prone missile submarines rarely conduct their  deterrence patrols  far from their docks     in a fiscal  report to congress  the pentagon assessed that even if russia broke out of the limits imposed by the new start treaty and deployed more nuclear weapons  it could not gain strategic advantage over the united states   the russian federation  therefore  would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces  even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the new start treaty   the report said    trump  clearly needs to get a briefing on the capacity of u s  nuclear forces   said hans kristensen  director of the nuclear information project at the federation of american scientists  a leading arms control organization  the  year u s  modernization program is intended to maintain the american advantage  it upgrades and extends the lives of every u s  nuclear weapons system   intercontinental ballistic missiles  long range bombers and submarines   and their warheads  in addition  the pentagon has drawn up plans to replace many systems with a new bomber  new ballistic missile submarine  and new missiles  many lawmakers and experts are concerned about the price tag of the effort  given the high cost of repairing and modernizing the country s conventional military forces and the budgetary demands of non military programs  the costs of the modernization program  has been estimated at as much as   trillion over the next  years  but a report published this month by the congressional budget office indicated that the overall cost is rising  nuclear force plans set out by the pentagon and the energy department   the caretaker of the u s  nuclear arsenal   in their fiscal  budget requests would cost an estimated   billion during only the  year period ending in fiscal
