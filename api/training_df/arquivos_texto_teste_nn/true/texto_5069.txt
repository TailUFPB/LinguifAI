new york  reuters    the house republican health insurance plan suggests health insurance after obamacare will be less affordable  investors  insurers and industry sources said on tuesday  raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation  the draft legislation  released on monday night  rolls back some of the key tenets of former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  known as obamacare  including the individual mandate and the expansion of medicaid  in addition to eliminating the requirement that most americans obtain medical insurance  it creates a system of new tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market  the bill has the support of president donald trump  who has vowed to repeal and replace the  law  but some republican lawmakers whose support is needed for the final legislation   and democrats   said they wanted details on how it would affect u s  consumers   under the draft legislation  obamacare s income based and location based tax credits are replaced by credits with fixed amounts up to a maximum income level   because the bill has just been proposed and aims mostly to repeal the existing law rather than introduce new policies  it is unclear exactly how future changes could make the plan affordable and draw insurers into the market   but some initial reaction  particularly from hospitals  was critical  the american hospital association said in a letter to congress that it could not support the draft legislation in its current form  the bluecross blueshield association  which represents bcbs insurers across the country that cover the vast majority of the about  million people enrolled in  obamacare plans  said the insurers were glad to see the extension of many obamacare aspects into   but it emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable        it is important that the tax credit for  creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford   bcbsa senior vice president alissa fox said in statement  the association for community affiliated plans  which represents health plans serving medicaid for the poor and other public health programs  said it was concerned the structure would raise costs for people currently in the marketplace  because insurance costs  healthcare costs and incomes vary so dramatically around the country  the new tax credit would affect some people more than others   i think there s a reasonable concern that people in high cost states who are lower income will have a hard time finding affordable care   said paul howard  director of health policy at the conservative manhattan institute  but the draft legislation also sets up a   billion fund over  years that states could use to structure subsidies for their members and offset some of that  he noted  insurers have also asked to be able to offer plans with fewer benefits that could be sold at lower prices  howard said  since the draft removes the mandate requiring people to have insurance  the impact on enrollment from that measure is not clear  standard   poor s estimated that the draft plan would reduce individual enrollment  now at around  million  by  to  million people  steve brozak  managing partner at wbb securities  said he believed that under the republican package   people will be forgoing insurance    he also said that  as it is currently designed  insurers will have difficulty attracting people who do not have an immediate need for healthcare  like younger  healthy people who are less expensive to insure  still  brozak expects that this draft is only a first step and likely to change  it is expected to be voted on this month in the house before moving to the u s  senate   the draft plan  along with republicans  proposed restructuring of the medicaid program for the poor and the loud opposition from some republican lawmakers  created uncertainty that drove down shares of hospitals and insurers  republicans will need the buy in from bluecross blueshield insurers like anthem inc  particularly after unitedhealth group inc  unh n   aetna inc  aet n  and humana inc  hum n  exited most of the states where they sold individual insurance plans under obamacare       shares of hospital operators sold off  with community health systems  cyh n  down more than  percent and tenet healthcare

and anthem  antm n  was little changed  the american hospital association and the american medical association  which represents doctors  declined to comment on the draft legislation  support for government run health insurance has risen over the past five years  according to the reuters ipsos national tracking poll   between february and march   percent of americans said the government should
