tokyo  reuters    u s  defense secretary jim mattis said on saturday he was not considering hiking the number of u s  forces in the middle east to address iran s  misbehavior  at this time  but warned that the world would not ignore iranian activities  president donald trump has vowed a more aggressive policy against tehran and his administration is warning of concrete action if iran does not curb its ballistic missile program and continues support in regional proxy conflicts  the united states announced new sanctions on friday  just two days after the trump administration put iran  on notice  following a ballistic missile test  mattis said putting iran on notice was worthwhile  given its behavior   as far as iran goes  this is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and i think it is wise to make certain that iran recognizes that what it is doing is getting the attention of a lot of people   mattis told a news conference in tokyo in his most detailed remarks on iran since taking over the pentagon  still  he firmly played down the idea of any military buildup   i don t see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the middle east at this time  that s not in the cards right now   he said   we always have the capability to do so  but right now i don t think it s necessary   the united states has already sent a navy destroyer to patrol off the coast of yemen to protect waterways from houthi militia aligned with iran  but there are other actions washington could take  including giving greater priority to rotating aircraft carriers through the gulf  there is currently no u s  aircraft carrier in the gulf  for example  the u s  navy believes having a robust presence helps deter any moves by iran to block that strategic waterway  in  and   in moves that prompted critics to accuse iran of destabilizing the region  the islamic republic threatened to disrupt oil shipping in the gulf by shutting the strait of hormuz if there were any attack on its nuclear sites  mattis said ignoring iranian behavior   something former president barack obama s critics routinely accused him of doing   wouldn t work        it does no good to ignore it  it does no good to dismiss it   mattis said  without citing obama or his policies  the white house has said that while the latest sanctions were a reaction to recent events  they had been under consideration before  it added that a landmark  deal to curb iran s nuclear program was not in the best interest of the united states  iran denounced the sanctions as illegal and said it would impose legal restrictions on american individuals and entities helping  regional terrorist groups   state tv quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying  those affected under the sanctions cannot access the u s  financial system or deal with u s  companies and are subject to secondary sanctions  meaning foreign companies and individuals are prohibited from dealing with them or risk being blacklisted by the united states
