washington  reuters    the united states was relegated to the sidelines of the syrian war on friday as an all out assault by syrian government and russian forces on opposition held aleppo threatened to unleash a new refugee wave and drive u s  backed rebels into the ranks of al qaeda s syrian branch  u s  officials and experts said  moscow s direct participation in the offensive left fading hope for u s  russian peace efforts  raising the likelihood that u s  president barack obama s successor will inherit a worsening conflict  entering its sixth year  the syrian civil war already has left some   people dead  uprooted more than  million and provided a base for islamic state to launch and inspire attacks in the west   for the next president on day one  this becomes the problem from hell   said frederic hof  a former obama adviser on syria who is now at the atlantic council think tank   it s a problem that s going to persist in one way or another throughout the first term of the next president and probably beyond   a u s  official suggested white house plans to keep syrian chaos under control as obama leaves office have been upended   it was hoped that they could turn over a simmering mess to the next president   said a u s  official   but what happened was that the simmering mess blew up and now they are going to have to figure out what to do   u s  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said that russian aircraft  long range artillery and special forces advisers were directly participating with syrian government forces in the drive to conquer eastern aleppo  the largest urban stronghold of the u s  backed moderate opposition  shiite militiamen from lebanon  iraq and afghanistan also were involved in the assault on the devastated enclave  where an estimated   civilians were suffering the most intense airstrikes of the war  they said   the russians are actively participating in the current offensive in aleppo   said one u s  official   it appears to be a no holds barred attempt to crush the opposition    russian aircraft were flying sorties at the same rate   about  per day   as they were before washington and moscow negotiated a failed ceasefire between the syria government and opposition forces in february  the officials said  some u s  intelligence officials believe that russian president vladimir putin is taking advantage of obama s refusal to intervene militarily in syria and his lame duck status to seize as much territory as possible before the new u s  president takes office  these officials argue that russia has not sincerely engaged in peace making efforts and that putin aims to weaken the opposition as rapidly as possible  a goal in which he is gradually succeeding  damascus announced the offensive on thursday as secretary of state john kerry and russian counterpart sergei lavrov failed to salvage a ceasefire that collapsed on monday  the ceasefire was supposed to lead to u s  russian cooperation on airstrikes against islamic state and al qaeda s syrian affiliate  formerly known as the nusra front  what course obama will now take remained unclear   there doesn t seem to be a plan b right now   hof said  obama has sought to restrict u s  involvement in syria  repeatedly rejecting proposals by advisers for actions such as establishing a no fly zone or arming the moderate opposition fighting to topple president bashar assad   one of the things that haunts me the most was our failure to ask ourselves about the consequences of inaction   said one former senior official involved in syria policy   we were always focused on the consequences of action     but we should have also considered how doing nothing for several years might have an impact on u s  credibility and the conflict more broadly   obama has limited the u s  role to supporting groups fighting islamic state in northeastern syria  he has pursued  talks with russia  which intervened on assad s behalf in september   on a peace accord between u s  backed moderate rebels and damascus  obama  however  no longer can count on securing a ceasefire that will keep a lid on the crisis until his successor is sworn in on jan    experts said  charles lister of the middle east institute think tank said he doubted that obama would adopt a more robust policy   given the posture the obama administration has developed with regards to how it faces the war in syria  i don t see it shifting the strategy   he said   that would be the most extraordinary foreign policy shift in the last eight years   obama  however  faces the prospect of a deepening humanitarian disaster  officials and experts said  the fall of aleppo could unleash a new wave of migrants fleeing toward europe  which has been struggling since last year to accommodate more than  million refugees  moreover  u s  backed rebels  dismayed over what they saw as obama s abandonment of aleppo  could begin joining al qaeda s syrian branch  it is widely regarded as the most effective opposition group and has vehemently rejected a negotiated settlement with assad  u s  officials and experts said  lister  who maintains contacts with rebels inside syria  said opposition leaders are growing disillusioned with u s  efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution with assad s main military backer   things are deteriorating so quickly now  the u s  is losing leverage on the ground every week   he said
