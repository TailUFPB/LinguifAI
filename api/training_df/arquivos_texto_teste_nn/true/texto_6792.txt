washington paris  reuters    key u s  allies in europe are quietly expressing concern over president elect donald trump s approach to syria  warning that his pledge to work more closely with russia  damascus  main backer  will do little to diminish the terrorist threat emanating from syria  the diplomatic persuasion campaign has taken on new importance in recent days as the syrian army  backed by russia  iran and shi ite militias  appears poised to retake all of aleppo city in a major defeat for western backed rebels  moscow and syrian president bashar al assad are expected to cast aleppo s fall as the end of a revolt against assad that began in march   although western analysts predict the civil war  which has killed more than   people and made more than half of syrians homeless  will continue  perhaps for years  western diplomats  who described discussions with trump advisers on condition of anonymity  said their message was that a u s  alliance with russia  and by extension assad  to crush groups like islamic state will backfire  trump has said defeating islamic state was a higher priority than persuading assad to step down   on syria the new administration says crushing islamic state is its priority  but we ve explained our view that without a  political solution in syria those efforts will be fruitless because new pockets of radicals will re form   a senior french diplomat told reuters  france has been the target of coordinated attacks claimed by islamic state  western capitals fear that a prolonged conflict will exacerbate mass refugee flows in which radicalized individuals might hide  a political solution in syria  as envisioned by western powers  would involve a transition in which assad eventually left power  assad  from the minority alawite sect  cannot unite syria and quash extremists after nearly six years of warfare  they argue  in a rare public speech in london on thursday  alex younger  chief of britain s mi  intelligence agency  said   we cannot be safe from the threats that emanate from  syria  unless the civil war is brought to an end  and brought to an end in a way that recognizes the interests of more than a minority of its people and their international backers   trump has frequently said that he wants to work with russia to fight islamic state  which holds territory in iraq and syria  and other militant groups   when you think about it  wouldn t it be nice if we got along with russia   he said during a campaign rally in july   wouldn t it be nice if we got together with russia and knocked the hell out of isis   trump added  using another name for islamic state  u s  defense officials have repeatedly said the vast majority of russian strikes in syria are not against islamic state  how trump will actually proceed remains unclear  he has not named a secretary of state  and some current and prospective members of the president elect s national security team have voiced more skeptical views of russia  trump s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allies  concerns   what we re getting from our conversations with the trump administration is that already they are toning down the prospect of a russia u s  deal on fighting islamic state and a full on rapprochement with moscow   the senior french diplomat said  a senior arab diplomat also was cautious about trump s syria policy   we can t really predict it now   the diplomat said  a diplomat from another u s  ally  while declining to discuss the american political transition  expressed doubts about the advisability of a western alignment with moscow and assad   there is no way that allying with assad would do anything to reduce the terrorist threat to the west  rather  it would drastically increase it   the diplomat said   it s an inconvenient truth of the conflict   he said   the russians have grozny ified aleppo   the diplomat said  referring to the total destruction the russian military inflicted on the capital of chechnya  former u s  ambassador to syria robert ford said that once aleppo falls  the russian backed syrian government will not turn its attention to islamic state  but rather try to destroy the remainder of the secular anti assad rebellion  the united states has three options  said ford  a fellow at the middle east institute think tank   the first option is to switch and join the russians and implicitly the syrian government and the iranians against sunni extremists  but the problem is that the russians and the syrian governments     aren t really fighting sunni extremists very much   he said  the second option  ford said  is for washington to walk away from the conflict  which would likely mean diminished u s  influence in the region  and continued refugee flows  the third is to work with turkey and saudi arabia to get a partial ceasefire   none of them are good  there is no easy answer  we ran out of easy answers in  and    ford said
