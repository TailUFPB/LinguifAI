washington  reuters    the first gripe came three minutes into president donald trump s first solo news conference on thursday  when he accused reporters of ignoring a poll showing him with a  percent approval rating   a figure at odds with most other surveys  from there  the president s criticism of the media went from barbed to personal in a cutting assessment of what he viewed as unfair coverage of his first few weeks in office   a period that has seen a succession of crises  on a day when he ceded a loss over a signature policy in a federal appeals court  had to replace his labor secretary pick and faced questions over the resignation of his national security adviser  trump chose to make the media a central focus of an unusually long and combative presidential news conference  when asked by journalists of contacts between his presidential campaign and russian operatives  he deflected the questions and put the focus instead on what he described as  illegal  government leaks and  dishonest  media coverage   the press is out of control   he said   the level of dishonesty is out of control    after weeks of disclosures in newspapers over turmoil in his administration  he told one reporter to  sit down  for a rambling question   tomorrow  they will say   donald trump rants and raves at the press    trump said   i m not ranting and raving  i m just telling you  you know  you re dishonest people  but i m not ranting and raving  i love this  i m having a good time doing it   trump s message in the  minute session appeared aimed at the same voters who elected him president last november  a large number of whom feel washington has left them behind and who like his image as an outsider trying to shake up the establishment  he sought to cast problems buffeting the white house as  the mess  he inherited from former democratic president barack obama  and boasted about the  fine tuned administration  he is running   in one unusual exchange near the end of the news conference  trump called on a questioner  asking if he was  a friendly reporter   when the journalist asked about recent threats to  jewish centers across the country and signs of rising anti semitism  trump appeared to take the question personally  replying   i am the least anti semitic person that you ve ever seen in your entire life   he added he was also the  least racist person   told the reporter to be  quiet   accused him of lying and then dismissed the question as  insulting   most opinion polls show trump struggling with low approval numbers less than a month into his presidency  a reuters ipsos poll conducted feb   to  gave trump a  percent approval rating  while many presidencies have started off on rocky ground  trump s administration has been particularly marked by controversies  fights with the media and a legal battle over an executive order to ban people temporarily from seven muslim majority countries   i turn on the tv and open the newspapers and i see stories of chaos  chaos  and yet  it is the exact opposite   trump said  trump waved away questions about a new york times report that members of his campaign team had frequent contacts with senior russian intelligence officials last year  his main complaint was that the news media had uncovered leaks about intercepted communications between michael flynn  ousted this week as national security adviser and russian ambassador to the united states sergei kisylak  and leaks about his own conversations with the leaders of mexico and australia   the first thing i thought of  how does the press get this information   he asked
