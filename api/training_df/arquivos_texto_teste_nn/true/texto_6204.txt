jerusalem  reuters    israel s right wing has been eagerly awaiting donald trump s arrival in the white house  hoping a republican president will usher in a new era of support for israeli settlement building on land palestinians want for a state  the far right jewish home party  along with members of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s likud party  is promoting legislation that would effectively annex one large settlement in the occupied west bank to israel and another bill that would legalize dozens of unauthorized outposts  but there could be a question mark over the issue  with netanyahu possibly looking to curb settlement laws  wary of the dangers of the far right s ambitions being too freely unleashed as he feels his way forward with the new u s  administration   the israeli leader s spokesman declined to comment on netanyahu s position  in its final weeks  the obama administration angered the israeli government by withholding a traditional u s  veto of an anti settlement resolution at the united nations security council  enabling the measure to pass  president barack obama on wednesday said he was worried that the prospects for a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict   the idea of israel and palestine living side by side in peace and security   were waning   israeli right wingers contrast obama s warnings with what they see as positive signals from trump that indicate washington s attitude towards settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem  areas israel captured in a  war  is about to change  trump s nominee to be u s  ambassador to the united nations   nikki haley  echoed his condemnation of the world body over its treatment of israel at her senate confirmation hearing on wednesday  trump  who has said he wants to meet netanyahu  at the first opportunity   has pledged to move the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  in his remarks on wednesday  obama cautioned against  sudden unilateral moves  that could be  explosive   israel regards all of jerusalem as its capital but most of the world does not  seeing its final status as a matter for peace negotiations that have been frozen since   in a move that has emboldened israeli right wingers  the president elect has already appointed a new u s  ambassador to israel  david friedman  who is considered far right on issues  including settlement building  naftali bennett  leader of the jewish home  hopes that under  trump s administration the notion of establishing a palestinian state will be abandoned  he wants to promote a bill extending israeli sovereignty to maale adumim  a west bank settlement of about   israelis that lies just to the east of jerusalem   that would in effect mean israel annexing some of the land it has occupied for almost  years   it s either  israeli  sovereignty or palestine   bennett told army radio this month   the question is not what will trump do but what will israel ask for  what will israel present as its vision  we are in the money time now for forming this vision   but professor itamar rabinovich  a former israeli ambassador to the united states  believes the right wing may be getting ahead of itself and its ambitions could backfire    in reality  where the united states needs to live not just with us but also with the arab and muslim world  supporting extremist measures in israel could turn out to be something the united states cannot live with   rabinovich said  bennett ultimately advocates the annexation of most of the west bank  leaving just the major palestinian towns and cities in palestinian hands  but first he is testing the water with the annexation bill  entitled  sovereignty in maale adumim first   it is due for a first discussion in a ministerial committee on sunday  two of its drafters said   i believe this is the gift that the people of israel deserve in the run up to trump s inauguration   bennett s fellow party member  betzalel smotrich  told parliament on tuesday  a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas said annexation was a red line   any such israeli decision will be considered a dangerous escalation that would end any possible hope for peace   nabil abu rdainah told reuters  late last year  a separate bill that would retroactively legalize settlement outposts built on privately owned palestinian land in the west bank passed the first of three votes in parliament required to make it law  no dates have been set for final approval  and it has since disappeared from the agenda  asked about the delay  a source in netanyahu s office said   he wants to freeze the outpost bill   asked about the law  a legislative source said   it s stuck in committee  there will be attempts to bring it back on the agenda after jan    but i think it is pretty much buried at this point   he said  referring to the date of the inauguration  the legislation had drawn anger from the palestinians and  international condemnation  smotrich told reuters that it will be brought to a second and third reading in february   we were waiting for the end of the obama age   he said  a political source close to netanyahu said that with regard to the proposed maale adumim annexation  the prime minister may say he wishes to hold off until after he meets trump  tzachi hanegbi  a likud minister and netanyahu confidant  said netanyahu understood that such steps would further isolate israel  most countries regard israeli settlements as illegal  a view that israel disputes   he does not want to shake the entire world and put israel at the center of contention  isolation and criticism   hanegbi told army radio   i hope the government will not let itself be dragged after jewish home s agenda    at the same time  netanyahu is competing with jewish home for right wing  pro settlement voters  he may disagree with the party s approach  but he can t ignore it       if the  annexation  bill comes up  likud ministers will support it  they can do nothing else   the source said
