riyadh  reuters     where are you  oh arabs  oh muslims  while we are being slaughtered    an old man s cry  in a video posted online from aleppo s ruins  poses an uncomfortable question for the mainly sunni muslim arab states backing rebels fighting president bashar al assad and his allies iran and russia   for saudi arabia  locked in a regional struggle with iran  assad s capture of the rebel haven reflects a dangerous tilt in the middle east balance of power toward tehran  dismayed by this boost to iranian ambitions for a  shi ite crescent  of influence from afghanistan to the mediterranean  riyadh is determined to reverse tehran s gains sooner or later  countering iran  buoyed by its  nuclear deal with world powers  remains central to gulf arab policy but it is not clear how this might be achieved  especially when other concerns are multiplying  beset by low oil prices  at war in yemen  and ties with egypt strained  riyadh and gulf allies are questioning how much armed help they should now give the rebels  diplomats say  the monarchies are frustrated with president barack obama s light touch approach to the war   relying on local fighters instead of large u s  military deployments or missile strikes  president elect donald trump poses an intriguing contrast  seen as more decisive than obama  trump s choices of james mattis  a retired marine general distrustful of iran  as defense secretary  and oil man rex tillerson as secretary of state  have pleased gulf arab energy exporters  but much remains uncertain  not least trump s admiration for russian president vladimir putin  an assad ally   what we have learned from the u s  election is to wait for actions  not words   said former saudi intelligence chief prince turki al faisal  a senior western diplomat said saudi officials were curious to see how trump translates into policy his campaign criticism of iran and his praise of putin  saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir said he had spent time in the united states to sound out the next administration   officials said gulf states were asking trump associates about syria  to assess whether he would pursue a u s  led effort with gulf states  turkey and western nations to arm the rebels  trump has indicated he may abandon the rebels to focus on fighting islamic state   gulf arab states want to test that view  said one western official  a gulf state foreign ministry official described trump as  a businessman with whom you can make a deal   gulf humanitarian aid will remain  sunni arab societies will not accept curbs on relief to the mostly sunni country  after a war that has forced  million syrians to flee and killed    but the extent of their armed support appears in question  qatar  with saudi arabia the most enthusiastic backer of the rebels  says it would prefer to continue military aid but insists this should remain a collective effort   proclaiming  great faith  in trump  asaad al zoubi  saudi based chief negotiator for the main opposition body  the high negotiations council  said some rebel backers had met trump advisers to explain their cause   they did not receive an answer from trump s people  they  the advisers  wanted to listen more than they wanted to answer   he said  sami alfaraj  a security adviser to the gulf cooperation council of six gulf arab states  told reuters that the gulf countries  need to regroup  have a strategic pause and look at how we pursue our objectives in the time ahead    the syrian case has not been closed   he said  they would push for a transitional administration in syria   something neither assad nor tehran accepts  any notion of gulf arab leverage in future negotiations   seems far fetched  given the determination of assad  moscow and tehran to carve out territorial gains  but jubeir told the arab league in cairo that if world powers failed to constrain assad there would be no political solution to the war   if we cannot find an effective way to pressure the syrian regime  we will not reach a political solution and the killing  displacement  and injustice in syria will go on   jubeir said  while drawn to trump  the gulf monarchies feel his views are not fully formed  and they want to do nothing that might cause him to harm their interests  alfaraj said he expected trump to deal favorably with gulf states  which have the wealth to help create u s  jobs  he believed a suggestion by trump that gulf states pay for safe zones in syria was worth considering   if he wants to create jobs there is no better field than selling weapons   alfaraj said   we are the only people who have surplus cash   however  arab resentment at western inaction over syria appears deep and enduring  sheikh khalifa bin salman al khalifa  foreign minister of bahrain  an ally of riyadh  told reuters   the whole thing in syria was because of disengagement from world powers about how to deal with the matter  so with all the changes in the political leadership  in the west  let s hope for some new commitment for syria   asked if it was realistic to back rebels who had lost their major urban stronghold  he replied   do you think its realistic that we should also allow such bloodshed and people dying to go on and on and on  what s the next city after aleppo
