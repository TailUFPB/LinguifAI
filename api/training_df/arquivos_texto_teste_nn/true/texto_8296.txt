new york  reuters    in a speech on wednesday in phoenix  arizona  republican presidential nominee donald trump outlined his plan for reforming the u s  immigration system  the new york businessman has made immigration a central issue of his bid for the white house  taking a harder line than his democratic rival  former secretary of state hillary clinton  ahead of the nov   election  trump s plan includes    building a wall along the border between the united states and mexico  trump emphasized that this would be a physical wall  albeit bolstered by technology    ending  catch and release   a term often broadly used to refer to practices under which not everyone apprehended by immigration agents is necessarily deported    immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes  trump has promised to begin these deportations on his first day in office  going forward  undocumented immigrants arrested for committing a crime would be placed into immediate deportation proceedings    blocking funding for  sanctuary cities   places that limit  to differing extents and through different methods  how much they help immigration officials in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants    cancellation of executive orders and enforcement of immigration laws  this point would particularly hit two of president barack obama s executive actions  known by their abbreviations  daca and dapa  the actions gave a certain legal status to certain undocumented immigrants  such as those brought to the united states as children or those who now have american children     suspending visas to immigrants from parts of the world where screening procedures are deemed inadequate  trump singled out syria and libya as two countries from which immigration would be suspended    ensuring that other countries take back their citizens when the united states moves to deport those immigrants  the u s  supreme court has ruled that these people cannot be detained indefinitely  but without a country to which to return they often are simply released from detention  trump said he would force the immigrants  home countries to take them back    completing a biometric entry exit visa tracking system  many undocumented immigrants enter the country legally  and then overstay their visas  in those cases  this kind of system would be more effective than a border wall  while such a system has been discussed for years  the logistics remain a major challenge  putting in such a system would likely require major overhauls of u s  points of entry  such as airports and ports     making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get jobs and benefits  trump specifically cited the e verify system as part of this  that system allows employers to check whether their employees are legally eligible to work in the united states  trump also mentioned ending access to benefit programs such as public housing or food stamps    serving the best interests of american workers  trump s final point serves as something of a catch all for his immigration proposal  but he also mentioned a few specific goals here  such as limiting immigration  he also talked about being more selective about who gets to enter the country  for example limiting immigration to people who can be financially self sufficient
