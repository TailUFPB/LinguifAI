washington  reuters    congressional republicans on tuesday accused hillary clinton s state department of failing to protect four americans killed in a  attack in libya  in a final report that contained no major new revelations but rekindled debate on the u s  presidential campaign trail  in an  page report that democrats derided as a political vendetta  republicans said clinton  who served as secretary of state from  to  and is now the presumptive democratic presidential nominee  and her staff showed a  shameful  lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attacks on a u s  diplomatic compound in benghazi  libya  the report  the culmination of a two year investigation by a special congressional committee led by republican representative trey gowdy  is likely to be the last official attempt to investigate the attack  seven other congressional panels have also investigated the attack on the u s  diplomatic and cia posts in benghazi  the latest investigation has been used by republicans to attack clinton s national security credentials  opinion polls have shown americans deeply split along partisan lines over the probe  donald trump  the presumptive republican presidential nominee  has repeatedly charged that clinton is personally responsible for the deaths of a u s  ambassador and three other americans killed by militia groups in the sept     incident  clinton s campaign dismissed the committee s report  saying it had not found anything that had not been discovered by previous congressional probes  white house press secretary josh earnest labeled the effort a  political exercise   clinton  speaking in denver  said it was crucial to  learn the right lessons  from the benghazi tragedy   no one has thought more about or lost more sleep over the lives that we lost   the four americans   which was devastating   said clinton  trump waited until hours after the report s release to comment   benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure   he said on twitter   it just never seems to work the way it s supposed to with clinton   republican national committee chairman reince priebus said clinton s actions as secretary of state were  disqualifying    hillary clinton was in charge  knew the risks  and did nothing  to protect personnel on the ground in libya  he said  professor julian zelizer  a political analyst at princeton university  called the report  old news  but said that would not stop trump from trying to exploit the issue going forward   a story like this  even though it seems familiar  can still serve to mobilize republicans  and certainly donald trump will do that  he ll certainly try   zelizer said   rodell mollineau  a democratic strategist  said he doubted the report would influence undecided voters   those who are willing to believe that there was wrongdoing on secretary clinton s part were unlikely willing to vote for her in the first place   he said  at a news conference on capitol hill  gowdy  chairman of the special congressional panel  said there was a disconnect between the violence unfolding in benghazi and the perception among top obama administration officials that  the fighting had subsided  at the u s  diplomatic compound  the committee s report faulted the state department for providing inadequate security for the u s  compound in benghazi  state department officials and the cia for failing to properly evaluate the threat to u s  personnel on the ground  and the pentagon for not being in position to aid the americans under siege  the report did not dispute assertions by the obama administration that such a mission would have come too late to help the four who were killed  none of those conclusions  however  came as revelations  all had been reached by previous probes  the report also accused the white house of stonewalling the investigation  something aides to obama have denied  democrats on the benghazi committee issued their own report a day before tuesday s release  accusing republicans of conducting an overzealous investigation  according to a website maintained by committee democrats  the investigation cost more than    million  a figure that excludes money spent on investigations by the seven other congressional committees that investigated the attacks  the gowdy committee investigation lasted  days  longer than congressional probes of pearl harbor  the kennedy assassination  the iran contra scandal and hurricane katrina  since it was established in may   the gowdy committee has held four public hearings  according to its website  which said that it interviewed  witnesses  mostly behind closed doors  including  who never appeared before the other committees that investigated the attacks  it reviewed about   pages of previously unexamined documents  last october  clinton  already a democratic presidential candidate  calmly deflected harsh republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy  hour hearing before the gowdy committee  in testimony that stretched deep into the night  clinton rejected republican accusations that she ignored requests for security upgrades in libya and misinformed the public about the cause of the attack  clinton s appearance before the panel followed months of controversy about her use of a private home email server for her state department work  a disclosure that emerged in part because of the panel s demand to see her official records  a  report by a government accountability review board faulted state department officials for providing  grossly  insufficient security in benghazi  despite upgrade requests from ambassador j  christopher stevens and others in libya
