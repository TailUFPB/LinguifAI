washington  reuters    president donald trump told congress on tuesday he was open to immigration reform  shifting from his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration in a speech that offered a more restrained tone than his election campaign and first month in the white house  trump  in a prime time address to a country that remains divided over his leadership  set aside disputes with democrats and the news media to deliver his most presidential performance to date  seeking to regain the confidence of americans rattled by his leadership thus far  the president s speech was long on promises but short on specifics on how to achieve a challenging legislative agenda that could add dramatically to budget deficits  he wants a healthcare overhaul  broad tax cuts and a   trillion public private initiative to rebuild degraded roads and bridges  trump built a base of support behind his presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration  in his speech  he took a more moderate tone  appealing to republicans and democrats to work together on immigration reform  he said it was possible if both republicans and democrats in congress were willing to compromise  although he also said u s  immigration should be based on a merit based system  rather than relying on lower skilled immigrants  comprehensive immigration reform eluded his two predecessors  democrat barack obama and republican george w  bush  because of deep divisions within congress and among americans over the issue  trump said reform would raise wages and help more struggling families enter the middle class   i believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible  as long as we focus on the following goals  to improve jobs and wages for americans  to strengthen our nation s security  and to restore respect for our laws   said the republican president  trump s first month in office was dominated by a fight over his temporary travel ban on people from seven muslim majority nations  repeated attacks on the news media and harsh personal criticism of judges who blocked his immigration order  in his speech on tuesday  he appeared to look for a reset  trying to move past a chaotic period that sowed doubts about his ability to govern effectively   the time for trivial fights is behind us   he said  financial markets showed a muted reaction as trump gave few specifics or new details  early signs showed trump s speech drew a positive response  a cnn orc poll found  percent of viewers thought trump s speech was very positive and  percent said they felt more optimistic about the future of the country   he s lost his foot and mouth disease   said tom beckwith    of seminole  florida   this was a tremendous speech  he s cured   still  there was plenty of evidence of ongoing partisan divisions  in the chamber of the house of representatives where trump spoke  democrats sometimes sat in silence and turned their thumbs down at his remarks  many women lawmakers wore white in a subtle show of protest  democratic senator christopher coons of delaware called trump s speech one of  the most coherent public addresses he s given in a month   but coons said he viewed trump s forthcoming budget proposals as  gravely concerning   citing the president s plan for paying for a defense buildup by cutting foreign aid and other programs  much of trump s speech focused on solving problems at home in line with his  america first  rhetoric  apart from criticizing obama for increasing the national debt  trump did not mention the federal budget deficit  which will severely limit any new spending programs  on immigration  trump again pledged to build a wall on the u s  mexico border  but he made no mention this time of mexico paying for it  he also said he would  shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe   referring to a new executive order he is to sign to replace one embroiled in the courts  trump focused part of the speech on foreign policy  stressing his support for nato but insisting allies pay more for their defense  in a possible nod to his bid to warm relations with russia  which he did not mention by name  trump said   america is willing to find new friends  and to forge new partnerships  where shared interests align   trump has been criticized for his praise of russian president vladimir putin  a u s  congressional committee is investigating contacts between trump s election campaign and russia to see if there were any inappropriate communications   we want harmony and stability  not war and conflict   said trump  who said  however  he would embark on a big defense buildup  trump said he wanted to provide  massive tax relief  to the middle class and cut corporate tax rates  but he did not offer specifics and failed to comment on the most pressing tax issue facing congress  a proposed border adjustment tax to boost exports over imports  lawmakers have been looking to trump for more leadership on an issue that has divided corporate america and republicans in congress  trump called on the republican led congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reforms that expand choice  increase access and lower costs   republicans remain divided on how to accomplish that goal and democrats vehemently oppose tampering with a system that provides health insurance for millions of low income americans  while trump s comments lacked detail  it was the first time he publicly supported tax credits to help americans purchase their own coverage  a nod to health insurers who say they are necessary to keep people in the market  former kentucky governor steve beshear said in the democratic response to trump s speech that  you and your republican allies in congress seem determined to rip affordable health insurance away from millions of americans who most need it   in the most emotional moment of the night  trump singled out carryn owens  the widow of u s navy seal william  ryan  owens  who was killed in a raid on al qaeda in yemen   owens  tears streaming down her face  clasped her hands and looked upward from her spot in the balcony as lawmakers and the president applauded her in the longest ovation of trump s hour long speech   trump said the mission that her husband participated in obtained vital intelligence that could be used against islamist militants  taking issue with news reports quoting u s  officials who said little was gained from the raid
