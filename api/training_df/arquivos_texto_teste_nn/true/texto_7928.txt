washington  reuters    u s  regulations  proposed by the treasury to crack down on companies that try to reduce taxes by rebasing abroad  have begun a white house review and could be finalized shortly  officials said on tuesday  the regulations  which would make it difficult for u s  business operations to avoid taxation while shifting profits overseas through a practice called  earnings stripping   were received by the white house office of management and budget  omb  last week  the agency has up to  days to decide whether the rules should be finalized or returned to treasury for further consideration   we are satisfied we have addressed stakeholder feedback and are close to issuing final earnings stripping regulations   a treasury spokesperson said  the obama administration has faced widespread criticism from the business community over its regulatory assault on tax inversions  which are tax driven mergers in which a u s  company acquires a smaller  foreign business in a low tax country and shifts its headquarters there  if only on paper  to avoid higher u s  taxes     business and industry groups have threatened lawsuits and called for the new rules to be withdrawn or heavily revised because of what critics say is the potential for unintended harm to business  members of congress have also accused the administration of overstepping its legal authority  earnings stripping occurs when an inverted company eludes u s  taxes on its domestic operation by shifting profits overseas in the form of tax deductible interest payments to its foreign parent  the new rules would change certain interest payments into equity dividends  which are not tax deductible in the united states   the regulations were proposed in april  along with a temporary rule to prevent serial inversion deals by foreign companies  that rule  which is already the target of a lawsuit  has not yet been forwarded to omb
