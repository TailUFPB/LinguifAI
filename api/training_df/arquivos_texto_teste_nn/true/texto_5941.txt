washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on friday he is only in the early stages of considering whether to lift u s  sanctions on russia  as british prime minister theresa may  other foreign officials and u s  lawmakers cautioned that such a move would be premature  with trump expected to speak by phone on saturday with russian president vladimir putin for the first time since taking power a week ago  speculation has been rife that he is close to lifting sanctions imposed by then president barack obama over moscow s annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula in   such a move would likely cause consternation among european allies as well as many in the u s  congress who are also troubled by russia s intervention in the syrian civil war and by u s  intelligence agencies  finding that moscow meddled in the u s  election campaign   as far as the sanctions   it is  very early to be talking about that   trump said  while insisting that he wanted to follow through on his campaign pledge to pursue better relations with russia  his caution on the russian sanctions came in response to a question at a joint news conference at the white house with may  the first foreign leader to visit the president since his inauguration  may made clear britain wants to continue sanctions until putin carries out the requirements in a ceasefire agreement arranged in minsk  belarus  in   this view is shared by european allies who fear putin could become more expansionist if he feels trump will not intervene   we believe the sanctions should continue until we see the minsk agreement fully implemented  and we ve been continuing to argue that inside the european union   may said  the boisterous trump and reserved may took pains to demonstrate a readiness to maintain the  special relationship  between the united states and britain  something that is particularly important for may as she steers britain out of the european union   they posed for photos before a bust of winston churchill in the oval office and trump accepted an invitation from queen elizabeth to visit britain later this year  the two leaders held hands briefly as they walked down the white house colonnade to their news conference in the east room  later  they lunched on beef shortribs in the state dining room  at the news conference  trump showed flashes of the pugnacious willingness to dispense with formality that helped him win the nov   election  registering his displeasure when a british reporter asked him what he had to say to those who are  worried about you becoming the leader of the free world    this was your choice of a question   trump said with a half smile  then  nodding toward may as laughter erupted  he added   there goes that relationship   on ties with moscow  trump has long bucked establishment washington thinking by voicing a belief that  as he said on friday  it would be a  tremendous asset  to have a positive relationship with russia  a long time putin critic  u s  senator john mccain  who like trump is a republican  urged trump not to lift the sanctions  saying that he should  reject such a reckless course    if he does not  i will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against russia into law   said mccain  a long time putin critic  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the top u s  elected republican  told politico of the sanctions that  i think they should stay   former nato chief anders fogh rasmussen  now an adviser to ukrainian president petro poroshenko  urged caution against reversing sanctions without winning concessions from moscow  saying that   easing sanctions will only embolden russia s aggression in the region  putting the security interests of ukraine and the united states in jeopardy   the white house encounter between trump and may was heavily scrutinized for signs on how the relationship would develop between the leaders of two key members of the nato alliance  who are markedly different in style but who both owe their rise to power to a tide of anti establishment feeling in their countries   i m not as brash as you might think   trump said at the news conference   i m a people person and i think you are too  theresa  i think we re going to have a fantastic relationship   trump  a wealthy real estate developer and former reality tv star  had never held public office when he was elected in november  may stepped in to lead britain after the june referendum brexit vote to leave the eu that prompted her conservative predecessor  david cameron  to resign  it was notable that trump did not give much in the way of vocal support for nato  which he has previously declared obsolete  it was left up to may to issue support for nato in her opening remarks at their news conference  and to encourage trump s backing  on defense and security cooperation  we are united in our recognition of nato as the bulwark of our collective defense   she said   today we ve reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance   mr  president i think you confirmed that you are  percent behind nato     this version of the story has been refiled to clarify in  and  paragraphs on mccain s remark on trump and lifting of sanction  clarifying to show that comment  if he does not  refers to rejection of  a reckless course
