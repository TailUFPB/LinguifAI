aboard the papal plane  reuters    pope francis on sunday advised u s  catholics who feel they are torn between two imperfect candidates for president to study and pray before they vote and to make sure to follow their conscience  during his traditional  freewheeling in flight news conference with reporters on the plane returning from azerbaijan  francis was asked how he would counsel american faithful and what wisdom they should keep in mind   you have asked me a question that describes a difficult choice because  according to you  there are difficulties with one and difficulties with the other   the pope said  without naming democrat hillary clinton or republican donald trump  in posing the question  the reporter made allusions to clinton s support of abortion and trump s statements vilifying migrants and religious minorities   during political campaigns  i never say a word   the pope said   the people are sovereign  i would only say  study the proposals well  pray and choose with your conscience    but in the rest of his response  while stressing that he wanted to talk about a  fictional situation   francis appeared to be saying that the united states was among the countries that had become so politicized that it had effectively lost what he called a culture of politics   when in any country there are two  three or four candidates who don t satisfy everyone  it means that perhaps the political life of that country has become too politicized and that it does not have much political culture   he said   people say  i m from this party  or  i m from that party   but effectively  they don t have clear thoughts about the basics  about proposals   he said  last february  while returning from mexico  the pope was asked if u s  catholics could vote for someone with trump s views on immigration  particularly on the candidate s promise to build a wall at the border with mexico  he said a person with such views was  not christian   trump struck back  calling the pope s comments  disgraceful
