washington  reuters    donald trump s pick for u n  ambassador echoed his condemnation of the world body and pledged to push for reforms at her confirmation hearing on wednesday  but broke from the president elect on some other policy issues  including russia and nato  south carolina governor nikki haley seconded criticism of the united nations by trump and many of their fellow republicans before the senate foreign relations committee  especially for what she termed its  bias  against israel  some republicans want to stop u s  funding for the united nations over a security council resolution last month demanding an end to settlement building that the united states declined to veto  instead of abstaining  haley pledged that she would not abstain on u n  votes  but she did not back  slashing  u n  funding  the united states provides  percent of the u n  budget  trump took to twitter in the wake of the israel vote to criticize the  member world body as  just a club for people to get together  talk and have a good time   he warned  things will be different  after he takes office  without offering details  haley said washington should always back israel   if we always stand with them  more countries will want to be our allies   she said  haley said she  absolutely  backs moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv  that shift  which would up end decades of u s  policy  is supported by trump and congressional republicans but seen by the palestinians and many arab states as an impediment to middle east peace  although some democrats questioned haley s lack of diplomatic experience  she is expected to be approved  at the end of the mostly non contentious hearing  senator bob corker  the committee s republican chairman  said he expected she would be confirmed  overwhelmingly   haley  a rising star in the republican party who turns  on friday when trump takes office  has only held office in south carolina  she has been governor since    haley praised u n  food programs  efforts to alleviate aids  its weapons monitoring and some peacekeeping missions  a departure from trump s criticisms  haley also broke from trump s praise for russian president vladimir putin  she agreed that russian actions in syria such as bombing hospitals are  war crimes   condemned russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea region and said she would oppose easing sanctions until moscow changes   i think that russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on russia   she said  haley said she had not had detailed conversations with trump about russia or china  the united states and its frequent rivals russia and china all hold permanent seats on the u n  security council  along with u s  allies britain and france  haley did not advocate backing out of the international nuclear agreement with iran  which is supported by the united nations  although she said it should be closely reviewed  she also praised the nato alliance  some other trump nominees  including his choice for secretary of state  rex tillerson  and his pentagon nominee  retired marine general james mattis  have also veered from trump s national security positions during their hearings  several senators  including republicans  have said they hope some appointees will rein in his more controversial positions   i would far rather have a strong willed  capable  elected leader with experience at the state level who says those things than someone who has been a diplomat for  years and says   oh  i ll do whatever donald trump says    democratic senator chris coons told reporters  some questioned whether the president elect would change  democratic senator chris murphy said the tillerson and haley hearings were in  an alternate universe   given two years of trump statements backing torture or suggesting nato is obsolete   that s all going to change after friday   murphy asked  haley said she expected trump s cabinet would try to influence him   i do anticipate that he will listen to all of us  and that hopefully we will get him to see it the way we see it   she said  haley did not endorse trump during last year s primaries and has warned that some of his most inflammatory statements promoted dangerous hate  she initially backed the presidential bid of senator marco rubio and later senator ted cruz  she acknowledged her lack of diplomatic experience but said her time as governor would stand her in good stead   i would suggest there is nothing more important to a governor s success than her ability to unite those with different backgrounds  viewpoints and objectives behind a common purpose   she said  senator ben cardin  the committee s top democrat  praised haley for being willing to disagree with trump  haley  the daughter of immigrants from india  rose to national prominent last year after she led a push to remove a confederate flag from south carolina s capitol grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in charleston  she already has fans at u n  headquarters    she s a very respected politician and a highly regarded and results driven professional   france s ambassador  francois delattre  told reporters on tuesday  delattre met haley in his previous role as french ambassador to the united states
