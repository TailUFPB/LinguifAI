washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court will decide three cases in coming months that could help or hinder president donald trump s efforts to ramp up border security and accelerate deportations of those in the country illegally  the three cases  which reached the court before democratic president barack obama left office  all deal broadly with the degree to which non citizens can assert rights under the u s  constitution  they come at a time when the court is one justice short and divided along ideological lines  with four conservatives and four liberals  the justices will issue rulings before the end of june against the backdrop of high profile litigation challenging the lawfulness of trump s controversial travel ban on people traveling from seven predominantly muslim countries  the most pertinent of the three cases in terms of republican trump administration priorities involves whether immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have the right to a hearing to request their release when their cases are not promptly adjudicated   the long running class action litigation  brought by the american civil liberties union  aclu  on behalf of thousands of immigrants detained for more than six months  includes both immigrants apprehended at the border when seeking illegal entry into the united states and legal permanent residents in deportation proceedings because they were convicted of crimes  the case also could affect long term u s  residents who entered the country illegally and have subsequently been detained  the trump administration has said it wants to end the release of immigrants facing deportation and speed up the process for ejecting them from the country  a decision in the case requiring additional court hearings could have very direct implications for the administration s plans  said aclu lawyer ahilan arulanantham  especially since immigration courts currently have a backlog of more than    the aclu estimates that up to   immigrants nationwide at any given time have been held for at least six months  a u s  immigration and customs enforcement official was unable to immediately confirm data on length of detention but said that in fiscal year   the average daily count of detainees was just under      if trump wants to put more people in deportation but does not increase the number of immigration judges  then people are going to have to wait longer and longer to get a hearing   said stephen yale loehr  an immigration law professor at cornell law school  the trump administration has pledged to sharply curtail illegal immigration  with initiatives such as building a wall along the u s mexican border and hiring thousands of federal agents to police the border and arrest and deport immigrants who live in the united states but entered the country illegally  trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding from so called  sanctuary cities  that offer protections to immigrants who could face deportation  cross border shooting the other cases to be decided concern whether u s  government officials can be sued over mistreatment of non citizens in two separate contexts   one will decide whether the family of  year old mexican teenager sergio hernandez  who was killed while on mexican soil by a u s  agent firing from across the border in texas  can sue under the u s  constitution  it is a scenario that the lawyers for hernandez s family say could become more frequent if the trump administration acts on its proposal to increase the number of border guards by    raising the prospect of similar confrontations  the court hears arguments in that case on feb    the second is a civil lawsuit brought by immigrants  mainly muslims  who were detained in new york after the sept     attacks and claim they were mistreated   the group of muslim  arab and south asian non u s  citizens say they were held as terrorism suspects based on race  religion  ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported  the long running case focuses on whether senior officials in the administration of republican president george w  bush can be sued for their role in directing the action  the obama administration argued that the court should be wary of extending liability to the actions of senior officials  especially when it implicates national security and immigration  based on the skepticism of the justices during the jan   oral argument  the court seems likely to rule against the detainees  chief justice john roberts expressed concern that permitting such lawsuits against senior u s  officials would become  a way of challenging national policy  through litigation seeking monetary damages against the individuals who implemented the policy  the three cases are separate from litigation over the legality of trump s travel ban  which could also ultimately be decided by the high court  the key case on that front is now pending before an appeals court in san francisco after a three judge panel upheld a lower court decision to put the ban on hold  language in the upcoming rulings that address the rights of non citizens and analyzes how courts should review govenrment action on immigration and national security could have relevance in that case  legal experts say  anil kalhan  an immigration law professor at drexel university s kline school of law  said the furor over the treatment of non u s  citizens affected by the travel ban could bleed over into how the court approaches the cases   it might be the atmospherics of what s going on now might lead to a closer look from the justices   he said   this story has been refiled to correct spelling of ahilan arulanantham in paragraph six
