new york  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump said on tuesday he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of a landmark international accord to fight climate change  in a softening of his stance toward global warming  trump told the new york times in an interview that he thinks there is  some connectivity  between human activity and global warming  despite previously describing climate change as a hoax  a source on trump s transition team told reuters earlier this month that the new york businessman was seeking quick ways to withdraw the united states from the  paris agreement to combat climate change   but asked on tuesday whether the united states would withdraw from the accord  the republican said   i m looking at it very closely  i have an open mind to it    a u s  withdrawal from the pact  agreed to by almost  countries  would set back international efforts to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to the extinctions of animals and plants  heat waves  floods and rising sea levels            trump  who takes office on jan    also said he was thinking about climate change and american competitiveness and  how much it will cost our companies   he said  according to a tweet by a times reporter in the interview  two people advising trump s transition team on energy and environment issues said they were caught off guard by his remarks   a shift on global warming is the latest sign trump might be backing away from some of his campaign rhetoric as life in the oval office approaches  trump has said he might have to build a fence  rather than a wall  in some areas of the u s  mexican border to stop illegal immigration  tweaking one of his signature campaign promises  also in tuesday s interview  he showed little appetite for pressing investigations of his democratic rival in the presidential campaign  hillary clinton   i don t want to hurt the clintons  i really don t  she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways   he told reporters  editors and other newspaper officials at the times headquarters in manhattan   but trump said  no  when asked if he would rule out investigating clinton over her family s charitable foundation or her use of a private email server while she was u s  secretary of state during president barack obama s first term  if trump does abandon his campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor for clinton  it will be a reversal of a position he mentioned almost daily on the campaign trail  when he dubbed his rival  crooked hillary   and crowds at his rallies often chanted   lock her up   his comments to the times about clinton angered some of his strongest conservative supporters  breitbart news  the outlet once led by trump s chief strategist  steve bannon  published a story on tuesday under the headline   broken promise  trump  doesn t wish to pursue  clinton email charges   the fbi investigated clinton s email practices  concluding in july that her actions were careless but that there were no grounds for bringing charges   the clinton foundation charity has also been scrutinized for donations it received  but there has been no evidence that foreign donors obtained favors from the state department while clinton headed it  trump  a real estate developer who has never held public office  brushed off fears over conflicts of interest between his job as president and his family s businesses   the law s totally on my side  the president can t have a conflict of interest   he told the new york times  my company s so unimportant to me relative to what i m doing   trump said  conflict of interest rules for executive branch employees do not apply to the president  but trump will be bound by bribery laws  disclosure requirements and a section of the u s  constitution that prohibits elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments  according to republican and democratic ethics lawyers   there may be specific laws that don t apply to the president  but the president is not above the law   said richard painter of the university of minnesota  a former associate counsel to republican president george w  bush   do we really want to run our government where you have the president  the leader of the united states and the free world  saying   i m going to do the bare minimum to squeak by    asked norman eisen  a former top ethics lawyer in obama s white house  trump s businesswoman daughter ivanka joined her father s telephone call with argentine president mauricio macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe  raising questions of possible conflicts of interest  when asked whether house of representatives speaker paul ryan and other republicans in congress would consider his  trillion dollar infrastructure plan  trump boasted he was popular with the party s leaders on capitol hill       right now  they re in love with me   he said      since his nov   election victory  trump has been meeting with prospective candidates for top positions in his administration  ben carson  a former republican presidential hopeful who dropped out of the  race and backed trump  has been offered the post of secretary of housing and urban development  carson spokesman armstrong williams said  carson  a retired surgeon who met with trump on tuesday  will think about it over the thanksgiving holiday  williams said  trump arrived in florida on tuesday evening to spend thursday s holiday at his mar a lago estate in palm beach
