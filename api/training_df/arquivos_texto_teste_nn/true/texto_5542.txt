washington jerusalem  reuters    during his  election campaign  donald trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians  the u s  embassy would move to jerusalem  he would name an ambassador who backs israeli settlements on land palestinians seek for a state and there would be no pressure for peace talks  but as trump prepares for his first white house meeting with prime minister benjamin netanyahu  his administration has not only toned down its pro israel bravado but also taken the first tentative steps toward a more cautious middle east diplomacy  including consultations with sunni arab allies and u s  lawmakers  according to people familiar with the matter  while any strategy is still far from complete  there is growing consensus in the white house that tackling the israeli palestinian conflict could require gentle nudging of israel together with assurances to the arab world that trump will be more even handed than his campaign rhetoric suggested   this is a case where campaign promises run head on into geopolitical reality and they have to be adjusted accordingly   said a u s  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  as a result  relocating the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem   a step world leaders including jordan s king abdullah warned against and which would probably inflame the muslim world   has been put on hold for now   at the same time  the white house has adopted a more measured stance on israeli settlement building in occupied territory than candidate trump appeared to advocate  even so  there is little doubt that when netanyahu meets trump on wednesday  he will find a republican president determined to show more warmth to israel than his democratic predecessor  barack obama  with whom he had an acrimonious relationship  social media exchanges have suggested a budding  bromance  between netanyahu and trump  who has pledged to be the  best friend  israel has ever had in the white house  as a result  palestinians fear their leaders will be frozen out and their statehood aspirations pushed aside  one white house aide cautioned that the administration is still in  listening mode  on the issue  since taking office on jan    trump has spoken by phone to egyptian  saudi and united arab emirates leaders and heard abdullah s concerns in person  all of these countries have growing contacts with israel  mostly behind the scenes and centered on a shared desire to counter iran  a point that netanyahu has often cited as among the grounds for his country s eventual thaw with the arab world  signaling an emerging view that u s  arab allies could be helpful on the israeli palestinian issue  trump s son in law  jared kushner  assigned to a senior role in middle east diplomacy  has met arab officials  including the uae s ambassador to washington  the new york times reported  in his talks with trump  netanyahu is expected to try to keep the focus on forging a common front against iran  israel s regional enemy and a target of trump s ire  the israeli palestinian dispute will nonetheless be on the agenda  especially after israel s parliament drew international condemnation for approving a law retroactively legalizing   settler homes built on privately owned palestinian land  barring a curve ball from the sometimes unpredictable u s  president  trump is unlikely to use the talks to press netanyahu for concessions toward the palestinians in the way obama did  but neither can trump afford to be seen to abandon the u s  commitment to a two state solution  the bedrock of washington s middle east policy since the  interim peace accords and a principle embraced internationally  a white house statement on feb   set forth a more nuanced position  backing away from a longstanding u s  view of settlements as an  impediment  to peace but instead saying new settlements or the expansion of existing ones beyond current boundaries  may not be helpful  to that goal  that shift transpired just hours after trump met briefly with king abdullah on the sidelines of an event in washington  even so  the emerging shape of trump policy remains more accommodating toward israel than at any time since republican george w  bush occupied the white house   it seems we are headed for a new policy with this administration that is different from its predecessor in how it deals with the palestinian leadership and the palestinian cause   said wasel abu youssef  a member of the palestine liberation organization s executive committee   there has been no contact between the palestinian leadership and the trump administration so far  palestinian officials said  moderate  western backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas was among the first world leaders obama called on his first full day in office in   a white house official insisted  however  that the administration intends to develop a relationship with the palestinian authority  all the same  many israeli officials do not read the white house s settlements statement as a warning to israel or a reining in of netanyahu  not only does it conclude that settlements do not block peace prospects  it also says construction within established settlements is acceptable to washington   bibi will be happy   said an israeli diplomat  using netanyahu s nickname   he can put new settlements on hold and hold off the right wing by pointing to trump  at the same time  he can build as much as he wants within existing settlements   in that regard  the lines drawn by the white house help netanyahu fend off demands from the far right in his coalition for sweeping steps  like annexing portions of the west bank  palestinians would be especially alarmed if trump decided to proceed with moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem  essentially recognizing the city as israel s capital despite international insistence that its status must be decided in negotiations  the palestinians want east jerusalem  captured by israel in the  middle east war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally  as the capital of their future state  trump and his aides have played down the prospects for a quick embassy move since he took office  some experts see a moderating influence in trump s national security team  it has members such as secretary of state rex tillerson  a former exxon mobil chief executive with extensive contacts among gulf arab governments  and defense secretary jim mattis  a retired marine general  they will have to deal with other  sometimes ideologically driven advisers with close personal ties to trump  david friedman  trump s former bankruptcy lawyer and now nominee as ambassador to israel  has raised funds for a west bank settlement and voiced doubt about palestinian statehood  kushner s family has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the same settlement  aides may be moving circumspectly also in hope of keeping the door open if trump   who has touted his skills as a master dealmaker   decides to seek what he has called the  ultimate deal   israeli palestinian peace   to pursue such an initiative  the united states needs to be seen as an even handed mediator  while also overcoming the rigid disputes that have scuppered so many peace efforts over the years  settlements  borders  the status of jerusalem  what to do with palestinian refugees  and palestinian political divisions  the last  u s  brokered round of peace talks collapsed in   it remains to be seen whether the trump administration will be inclined to devote much attention to the israeli palestinian issue at a time when it is distracted by other priorities  in the middle east alone  the fight against islamic state and countering iran are higher on the agenda   however  if trump at some point does opt to wade in where so many of his predecessors have failed  for netanyahu   who is looking for a reset of u s  israeli relations   it might be a case of  be careful what you wish for
