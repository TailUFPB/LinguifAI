beijing  reuters    there are many pressure points china can push to express its anger at donald trump s call with taiwan president tsai ing wen last week  including luring away more of taiwan s diplomatic allies and ramping up military deployments in the taiwan strait  china s irritation with the call  the first by a u s  president elect or president since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   has mostly been directed at the self ruled island china claims as its own  but it could also make life difficult for the united states and its allies in the region  shi yinhong  head of the centre for american studies at beijing s renmin university  who has advised the government on diplomatic issues  said china was still in a wait and see period when it came to trump  noting beijing s reaction to the call had been quite restrained  but that would change if trump continued like this in office  shi said   without a doubt  if the chinese government judges a president trump wants to challenge the  one china  principle followed since president carter  china will definitely make a very strong response   that could include policy toward north korea  where china has been working with washington to rein in pyongyang s nuclear program  or in the disputed south china sea   everything is possible   he said  beijing could  for example  ease up on united nations sanctions on north korea  providing economic succor to a country developing missiles that could target the united states  or take a more aggressive stance to u s  freedom of navigation patrols in the south china sea  where it has so far limited itself to verbal warnings  washington and beijing have also cooperated on the multilateral agreement to limit iran s nuclear program and on climate change  areas that trump has said he wants to revisit to get a better deal for the u s  the status of taiwan is an unresolved issue from china s civil war  when defeated nationalist forces fled there in   posing a pointed challenge to the communist party s claim to rule all of china  beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring what it calls a  renegade province  under its control  and taiwan estimates that china has hundreds of missiles targeting the island over the narrow straits that separate them  the global times  an outspoken and influential tabloid published by the ruling communist party s official people s daily  said punishing taiwan was the best way to convey a message to trump   the chinese mainland can let taiwan lose one or two diplomatic allies as a punishment as well as a warning  the mainland can also strengthen its military deployment   it said in editorials in its chinese and english editions  the number of countries maintaining formal ties with taiwan  which until  held china s seat at the united nations  has since been whittled away by china to just   mostly poor nations in latin america and the caribbean  an unofficial diplomatic truce between china and taiwan ended earlier this year after tsai was elected in january  when china established ties with former taiwan ally gambia  last week a large chinese business delegation visited panama  another taiwan friend  tsai says she wants peace and stability with china  but china fears she wants to push the island s formal independence  one of the core principles of her democratic progressive party  china could also step up its divide and rule policy favoring pro china politicians in taiwan with trade and access deals  while excluding those from the ruling party  the people s daily overseas edition said the trump tsai call set a  terrible precedent  for china u s  ties and put a big question mark over a smooth transition in the relationship  jia qingguo  dean of the school of international relations at peking university and a government advisor  said the incident would help chinese leaders get past initial uncertainty about trump and better understand what his administration could mean for china  but  in a negative way    donald trump is hurting the relationship  and that will also hurt u s  interests  if he continues this when he is in office  i assume we will have more frictions   over trade  over taiwan  this is bad for both countries   beijing also has to bear in mind the opinion of a chinese public brought up to insist on sovereignty over taiwan   taiwan is simply a province of our china   said one user on weibo  china s answer to twitter   anywhere  anytime we can bring things to a conclusion  have no worries about that   china and taiwan have nearly gone to war three times since   most recently ahead of the  taiwan presidential election  then  china carried out missile tests in waters close to the island  hoping to dissuade people voting for lee teng hui  whom it suspected of harbouring pro independence views  lee won by a landslide  in the intervening  years  chinese wealth and power have grown   china is much stronger now   said jia  the academic and advisor   presumably a u s  china confrontation over taiwan would have a much more negative impact on the international order and relations between the two countries
