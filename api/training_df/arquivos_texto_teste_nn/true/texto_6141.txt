washington  reuters    president donald trump invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to visit washington in early february during a phone call in which they discussed the importance of strengthening the u s  israeli relationship  the white house said on sunday  in his first call with netanyahu since taking office on friday  trump stressed his  unprecedented commitment to israel s security    the president and the prime minister agreed to continue to closely consult on a range of regional issues  including addressing the threats posed by iran   the white house said in a statement  trump also said peace between israel and the palestinians could only be negotiated between the two parties  but that the united states would work with israel to achieve that goal  relations between israel and the obama administration ended on a contentious note  when the united states declined to veto a u n  security council resolution calling for a halt to israeli settlement building  the readout from the white house did not include any mention of moving the u s  embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv  an action that would likely spark anger in the arab world  earlier on sunday  the white house said it was only in the early stages of talks to fulfill trump s campaign pledge to relocate the embassy   we are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject   white house spokesman sean spicer said in a statement  aides said no announcement of an embassy move was imminent  washington s embassy is in tel aviv  as are most foreign diplomatic posts  israel calls jerusalem its eternal capital  but palestinians also lay claim to the city as part of an eventual palestinian state  both sides cite biblical  historical and political claims  any decision to break with the status quo is likely to prompt protests from u s  allies in the middle east such as saudi arabia  jordan and egypt  washington relies on those countries for help in fighting the islamic state militant group  which the new u s  president has said is a priority  the u s  congress passed a law in  describing jerusalem as the capital of israel and saying it should not be divided  but successive republican and democratic presidents have used their foreign policy powers to maintain the embassy in tel aviv and to back negotiations between israel and the palestinians on the status of jerusalem  in early december  then president barack obama renewed the presidential waiver on an embassy move until the beginning of june  it is unclear whether trump would be able to legally override it and go ahead with relocation of the embassy  u s  diplomats say that  despite the u s  legislation  washington s foreign policy is in practice broadly aligned with that of the united nations and other major powers  which do not view jerusalem as israel s capital and do not recognize israel s annexation of arab east jerusalem after its capture in the  middle east war    israel approved building permits on sunday for hundreds of homes in three east jerusalem settlements in expectation that trump will row back on the previous administration s criticism of such projects
