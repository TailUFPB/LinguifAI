portsmouth  n h   reuters    democrat bernie sanders endorsed former rival hillary clinton for president in a display of party unity on tuesday  describing her as the best candidate to fix the united states  problems and beat republican donald trump in the nov   election  with clinton nodding in agreement beside him  sanders put aside their bitter campaign for the democratic nomination and said she would take up the fight to ease economic inequality  make college more affordable and expand healthcare coverage for all americans   this campaign is about the needs of the american people and addressing the very serious crises that we face  and there is no doubt in my mind that  as we head into november  hillary clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that   he told a raucous crowd in portsmouth  new hampshire  that included plenty of vocal sanders supporters   i intend to do everything i can to make certain she will be the next president of the united states   the u s  senator from vermont said  his endorsement  five weeks after clinton became the presumptive democratic presidential nominee  brought the most prominent holdout in the party s liberal wing into her camp  sanders threw clinton his support less than two weeks before the democratic national convention in philadelphia  where she is to be formally nominated   i can t help but reflect on how much more enjoyable this election will be now that we are on the same side   clinton said of sanders   thank you  bernie  for your endorsement  but more than that  thank you for your lifetime of fighting injustice   trump ridiculed the move in a series of twitter posts  saying sanders had abandoned the supporters who flocked to his insurgent campaign to rein in wall street and get big money out of politics   bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs   trump said on twitter   in a statement  the trump campaign said sanders was now officially part of the rigged system the senator had criticized during his long primary battle with clinton   bernie s endorsement becomes exhibit a in our rigged system   the democrat party is disenfranchising its voters to benefit the select and privileged few   said stephen miller  a senior policy adviser to trump  in a reuters ipsos opinion poll released on tuesday  clinton extended her lead over trump to  percentage points  up from  points at the end of last week  the former u s  secretary of state hopes the portsmouth appearance with sanders will help her win over his supporters  some of whom held sanders signs at the rally and chanted his name  in recent reuters ipsos polling  only about  percent of sanders backers said they would back clinton  and the crowd at tuesday s rally made it clear she still had work to do   i am absolutely certain i will not vote for hillary clinton   said gale bailey  a sanders supporter and an unemployed graphic designer from rochester  new hampshire  who attended the rally in a sanders t shirt   she s a crook  and i m not going to vote for a crook   bailey said  adding that she would write in sanders  name on the november ballot  the joint appearance concluded weeks of negotiations between the two camps as sanders pressed for concessions from clinton on his liberal policy agenda  it came after clinton last week adopted elements of sanders  plans for free in state college tuition and expanded affordable healthcare coverage  sanders also successfully pushed to include an array of liberal policy positions in the democratic platform  which a committee approved on saturday  sanders did not win all of his policy fights  most notably failing to win support for blocking a congressional vote on the trans pacific partnership trade deal  but he told the portsmouth rally that  our job now is to see that platform implemented by a democratically controlled senate  a democratically controlled house and a hillary clinton presidency   and i am going to do everything i can to make that happen   in an email to supporters after the rally  sanders said he would still push for changes to the party s nominating process to make it more inclusive  in the months ahead  he will campaign around the country for progressive congressional candidates  he said  also on tuesday  a source with knowledge of the process said the clinton campaign is vetting james stavridis  a retired four star navy admiral  as a potential vice presidential running mate  stavridis  who served as supreme allied commander at nato  is currently dean of the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university   top democrats  including president barack obama and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  a favorite of the party s liberal wing  have already announced their support for clinton  leaving sanders at risk of being left behind in the democratic battle against trump   i think all signs point to the fact that we re going to have a very united party going into philadelphia   clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon said on cnn earlier on tuesday   and when you compare it to the republicans  we re going to be miles ahead of them    trump has struggled to unify the republican party after alienating many establishment figures with his stances on immigration  muslims and women  a number of prominent republicans are skipping the party s convention in cleveland next week
