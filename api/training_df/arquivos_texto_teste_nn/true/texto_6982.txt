new york  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump vowed on wednesday to step back from running his global business empire to avoid conflicts of interest but gave few immediate details as concern over his dual role mounts ahead of his jan   inauguration  trump  a real estate magnate who owns hotels and golf resorts from panama to scotland  said he would spell out at a dec   news conference how he will separate himself  in total  from his worldwide business holdings  which include a winery  modeling agency and a range of other businesses  after trump won the nov   election  his company  the trump organization  had said it was looking at new business structures with the goal of transferring control to donald trump jr   ivanka trump and eric trump   three of his adult children who are involved with the company  trump gave few details in a series of early morning tweets but said that  legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations  and that his children would attend the news conference  he did not say what the planned change might mean for ownership of his businesses  although trump s fellow republicans generally take a more laissez faire stance toward business than democrats  the president elect will travel to indiana on thursday to formally announce a deal he reached with united technologies corp to keep close to   jobs at its carrier corp air conditioner plant in indianapolis rather than have them moved to mexico  trump and his running mate  mike pence  the governor of indiana  railed against carrier on the campaign trail  using the company s outsourcing move as an example of how trade agreements hurt american workers      critics have raised questions about the role of trump s children  who are on the executive committee of his white house transition team  his daughter ivanka joined a telephone call her father had with argentine president mauricio macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe  creating concerns about possible conflicts of interest  a brand name around the globe  trump previously argued he had no need to separate himself from the trump organization  which includes a hotel down the street from the white house  a manhattan tower where he lives and is running his transition to office  and a new jersey golf course where he interviewed cabinet candidates earlier this month  trump said on wednesday he was not required by law to alter his relationship with his business  but added   i feel it is visually important  as president  to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses   as the republican heads toward taking over the white house from democratic president barack obama  scrutiny of potential conflicts has grown  democratic lawmakers on capitol hill called for hearings on the issue  rules on conflict of interest for executive branch employees do not apply to the president  but trump will be bound by bribery laws  disclosure rules and the u s  constitution  which bars elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments  the nonpartisan office of government ethics  a government office that oversees ethics programs for the executive branch  issued a statement saying it applauded trump s aims and appearing to suggest that he completely shed his holdings   divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not   it said  richard painter  who served as the chief ethics lawyer to former republican president george w  bush  concurred    he needs to sell the businesses not just have someone else manage them for him   painter  a professor at the university of minnesota law school  said in an emailed comment  trump  a former reality tv star  has spent much of the past few weeks setting up his cabinet and interviewing candidates for top jobs in his administration  on wednesday  trump said he would nominate his chief campaign fundraiser  steven mnuchin  to lead the u s  treasury  mnuchin said the administration would make tax reform and trade pact overhauls top priorities as it seeks a sustained pace of  percent to  percent economic growth  mnuchin  a former goldman sachs banker  also signaled a desire to remove u s  mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac from government ownership  a move that could have wide ranging ramifications for how americans pay for their homes  and said banking regulations should be eased to spur lending  trump named wilbur ross  a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries  as his nominee for commerce secretary  both nominees will require confirmation by the u s  senate  trump is also considering goldman sachs president and chief operating officer gary cohn  a former commodities trader  to head his white house budget office or to fill another position  a trump transition official said  the economic picks were praised by the business roundtable  a group that represents america s largest corporations  but u s  senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren called mnuchin  just another wall street insider    that is not the type of change that donald trump promised to bring to washington   that is hypocrisy at its worst   sanders  a vermont independent who ran for the  democratic presidential nomination  and warren  a massachusetts democrat  said in a joint statement  trump pledged during his campaign to  drain the swamp  in washington  a spokesman said giving top economic jobs to wall street figures was not inconsistent with that vow   you want some people that are insiders and understand the system and some outsiders that are creative thinkers  out of the box thinkers and disruptors   said anthony scaramucci  an asset manager who is on trump s transition committee  trump is also working to fill out his foreign policy team  but no decision appeared imminent on who the next secretary of state would be
