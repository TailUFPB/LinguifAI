 reuters    democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump traded barbs and accusations on monday in the first debate ahead of the nov   u s  presidential election  following is a compilation of reaction to the debate from investors  economists and financial market analysts  factbox  swing states that may determine the election  reut rs  more coverage  cpurl   apps cp  cms  pageid us  james athey  investment manager at aberdeen asset management   what we re seeing in markets this morning is a small  collective sigh of relief because most commentators  and the few polls that have been released  suggest clinton won the debate  equities have undone much of yesterday s weakness and key trump indicators such as the mexican peso and canadian dollar have rallied  this supports the notion once again that trump is seen as protectionist and anti globalization   the reality is that these moves are all fairly insignificant  polls on voting intentions still show that the race is essentially neck and neck  it will be these polls which truly have the power to drive a genuine re pricing   michael metcalfe  head of global macro strategy at state street global markets  london    in a similar way that sterling became the market proxy for brexit risk  so moves in the mexican peso and expected volatility of the mexican peso appear to have become the main market proxy for expressing the probability of a trump presidency    while there are many weeks of the campaign to run  the market reaction to the first debate does not mean that volatility will dissipate  but it does suggest trump s recent momentum has been arrested    the recent narrowing in the polls means that markets have had to discount more uncertainty  and one debate will not settle that    the press verdict on the first u s  presidential debate is that hillary clinton  won   but donald trump didn t lose badly enough to really reduce the uncertainty  the market verdict is that the mexican peso  the south african rand and the korean won all won  while the japanese yen was the loser   jack ablin  chief investment officer at bmo private bank in chicago   investors celebrated that hillary didn t lose  market trading higher and the peso is strengthening    hillary came through the debate unscathed  trump spent more time on the defensive   brian jacobsen  chief portfolio strategist  wells fargo funds management  menomonee falls  wisconsin   i m not sure i learned anything new listening to the debate  neither candidate imploded  but based on the strengthening of the mexican peso     i think this round goes to clinton   randy frederick  managing director  trading and derivatives  charles schwab  austin  texas   the positive reaction in the  equities  futures markets probably implies that hillary clinton was perceived as the winner  the market is often said to dislike uncertainty  and most experts seem to consider donald trump as the more uncertain candidate   peter kenny  senior market strategist  global markets advisory group  new york   both futures and the mexican peso are accurate indicators of how markets interpreted the debates  both moved only modestly but both moved in tandem   higher  i believe that investors pricing in the odds of either candidate winning  modest positive moves suggest the clinton campaign both managed expectations and delivered on beating them  the fear for investors was that she would either have some physical issue  look weak or have an excuse for one or both  she looked sharp  on point and clearly delivered on a message and style that reassured markets   brian battle  director of trading  performance trust capital partners  chicago   debate really was not outside expectations  trump was trump and clinton kept calm and seemed bemused    it was underwhelming on policy and there were no gaffes or revelations  it was a personality debate  not a policy discussion   aaron jett  vice president  global equity research  bel air investment advisors  los angeles   the market wants hillary to win  the better she does  or the worse trump does  the better the market will do in the short term  she did well enough to sustain the market for now  she did fine and trump rambled on at times making her look better  we should gain back some of what we lost on monday    it is interesting that in a debate that was so full of negatives from both sides  the result in the stock index futures was very positive  i guess it does show that some positives can come from an absolute free for all  i don t know that we learned much about the candidates but the market definitely liked it  don t forget in the middle of this we also had some numbers showing slightly better growth than previously expected and that also helped the last  points or so in the futures rally   after a weak day some of this may just be people covering their risk overnight   mohamed el erian  chief economic adviser  allianz  newport beach  california    while both candidates spoke to the importance of higher economic growth whose benefits are shared more broadly  the debate highlighted their different approaches to tax policies and what ultimately delivers greater prosperity   hugh johnson  chairman and chief investment officer  hugh johnson advisors  albany  new york    both presented different views on reviving the economy  secretary clinton s tax and spending plans were well articulated and well thought out  trump s thoughts that included significant tax cuts and implicit promises of infrastructure spending were emotionally appealing but not nearly as well thought out or economically sensible  each will appeal to different sets of voters  a good example of trump s emotional  yet uninformed  thoughts were his comments  a  that the recovery was the  worst  ever   b  that janet yellen was political   c  the rise in stock prices has been a bubble that would  burst  if interest rates were increased    i would be inclined to give secretary clinton a modest edge although trump did a good job presenting himself as the candidate of change   her stamina answer was a real good   close to a clincher   jeffrey gundlach  chief executive  doubleline capital  los angeles   it s the establishment versus the anti establishment  no one  wins  a debate in september  trump did himself a little bit of good and set up the later debates to his advantage   dan ivascyn  group chief investment officer  pimco  newport beach  california   we continue to believe a clinton victory will be the most likely outcome  nothing tonight to change that view stocks  s p  emini futures gained ground over the course of the debate  with the contract price moving from down  points as the event began to up  points by early tuesday  a few hours after it finished  bonds    and  year treasury yields rose modestly forex  the mexican peso gained   percent against the dollar  the dollar index  meanwhile  was little changed as were exchange levels against the yen and euro
