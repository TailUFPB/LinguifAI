washington  reuters    as u s  secretary of state john kerry met with russian president vladimir putin in moscow on thursday to propose close military coordination in syria  the white house and pentagon offered lukewarm support for the plan and demanded that moscow show it was serious about fighting islamic state  not just propping up president bashar al assad kerry himself took a tough line after his meeting on thursday with putin  state department spokesman john kirby told reporters in moscow    secretary kerry emphasized that absent concrete  near term steps  diplomatic efforts could not continue indefinitely   kirby said  kerry s proposal would create a new center where u s  and russian militaries would share intelligence and coordinate air strikes against islamic state and the nusra front  an al qaeda affiliate  the move has angered u s  military and intelligence officers and diplomats who argue that russia has proved repeatedly that it cannot be trusted  pentagon spokesman peter cook said defense secretary ash carter supported kerry s efforts to encourage moscow to  do the right thing  in syria  but he added that carter has experience dealing with moscow and maintains a  healthy dose of skepticism  about russia s aims in the conflict       the secretary supports secretary kerry s effort     but he has also said that he s had questions about the russian activities up to this point   cook told reporters       if the russians are prepared to do the right thing in syria  then the secretary of defense would be open to that conversation   he said   but we re waiting to see what s going on      it s not clear that we ll ever reach an agreement   white house says it s up to russia at the white house  spokesman josh earnest s response was similarly cautious   it s time for russia to make serious decisions about how they want to use their influence inside of syria both when it comes to their diplomatic influence  but also when it comes to their military capabilities   earnest told a daily briefing on thursday at the white house    they have to decide if they re going to use the military to prop up the assad regime or if they re going to use their military to go after extremists   earnest said   our case is you can t do both   kerry has expressed growing frustration with the lack of progress in ending syria s five year civil war despite agreements with russia to secure a lasting nationwide cessation of hostilities and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches besieged communities  u n  led efforts to bring the warring sides together to negotiate a political transition also have failed  state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau acknowledged  a  very robust and very vigorous conversation  among government agencies over kerry s plan  asked whether kerry s visit had the full backing of the white house  she added   i m not going to characterize that for the white house  but i would say that the secretary is going to     have discussions in moscow that present the administration s views   anger within the administration    but u s  military and intelligence officers and diplomats involved in syria policy expressed anger about kerry s proposal  which several called naive      the russians  said one official  had known for weeks about kerry s upcoming visit to moscow  yet two days before he was due to arrive they bombed a remote camp near syria s border with jordan used by u s  backed rebels   that is consistent with what the russians have been doing all along   said a u s  military official  who like others spoke anonymously to criticize administration policy   more of it has been to us  not with us  and the message has been clear all along   when our interests differ from yours  ours win    they ve violated every cessation of hostilities agreement they ve ever agreed to  sometimes within hours   the official said      another american official  who has helped train members of the free syrian army rebel alliance  said the u s  backed opposition forces have been asking why the administration keeps seeking russian help and are growing increasingly bitter  their anger compounded by what they complain is a lack of american military support  former u s  ambassador to syria robert ford expressed deep skepticism with kerry s plan  saying russian air strikes have primarily targeted u s supported moderate opposition groups   how serious are they  russia  about defeating terrorism  as opposed to bolstering assad s position at the center  how are we to assume that they are going to do better if they work with the americans   ford told reuters  ford said that russia has been unable to get its  obstreperous client  assad to make any political concessions  allow significant humanitarian assistance into numerous rebel held enclaves or abide by a cessation of hostilities agreement   i don t think the russians can deliver   he said   i don t see how this american russian condominium on the islamic state can help bring about a negotiated solution to the broader syrian conflict  it will make it less likely that assad will make concessions that will bring the broader civil war to an end
