ankara  reuters    turkish president tayyip erdogan and u s  president donald trump agreed in an overnight phone call on joint action against islamic state in the syrian towns of raqqa and al bab  both held by the militants  turkish presidency sources said on wednesday  u s  turkish differences during former president barack obama s administration impeded the u s  led campaign against islamic state  and closer coordination could mean faster progress towards freeing swathes of northern syria from is  erdogan now hopes that relations with washington  strained by the presence in the united states of a cleric he blames for an attempted military coup last year and by u s  support for kurdish militia in syria  can be reset under trump  turkey has the second largest army in the nato alliance and is key to any success in rolling back and eventually neutralising is in syria and iraq where is declared a cross border caliphate after lightning advances in   turkey has presented a detailed plan to oust islamic state from its raqqa urban stronghold in northeastern syria and strategy discussions with the trump administration are under way  according to erdogan s spokesman  ibrahim kalin   the operational details were not discussed on this call     now detailed planning will be conducted in coordination   he told turkish broadcaster ntv in an interview  ankara believes recent is attacks in turkey  including a new year s day shooting in an istanbul nightclub that killed  people  have been steered from al bab and raqqa  and regards a clear out of the towns as a national security priority  turkish government and syrian rebel sources said on wednesday insurgents backed by turkey s military had taken the outskirts of al bab  northeast of aleppo  if al bab falls  ankara would strengthen its sway over an area of northern syria where it has created a de facto buffer zone  syrian government forces have also advanced on al bab from the south  bringing them into close proximity with their turkish and rebel enemies in one of the most complex battlefields of syria s six year old civil war  but turkey said international coordination was under way to prevent clashes with syrian forces  the white house said that in the phone call  trump spoke about the two countries   shared commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms  and welcomed turkish contributions to the fight against islamic state  but it gave few details  sources in erdogan s office said the two leaders had touched on issues including a  safe zone   as well as the regional migrant crisis and the fight against terrorism  turkey has long advocated a secure zone for displaced civilians in syria threatened by islamist militants or forces fighting for syrian president bashar al assad  they also said erdogan had urged the united states not to support the syrian kurdish ypg militia and that new cia director mike pompeo would be in turkey on thursday to discuss that and other issues with turkish counterparts  there was no immediate confirmation from washington of pompeo s visit  but the offices of both leaders said trump had reiterated u s  support for turkey  as a strategic partner and nato ally  during tuesday s phone call  turkey has long urged world powers to help create a safe zone  which it also sees as a way to purge its border of islamic state and kurdish militia fighters  and stem a wave of migration that has caused tensions with europe   obama and u s  allies balked at the idea  saying it would entail significant ground forces and planes to patrol a  no fly zone   a dicey commitment in such a crowded and messy conflict  the syrian democratic forces  sdf   an alliance of u s  backed militias  launched a new phase of its campaign against islamic state in raqqa on saturday  turkey has repeatedly said it wants to be part of the u s  led operation to retake raqqa from the ultra hardline sunni militant islamic state  but does not want the ypg  which is part of the sdf alliance  to be involved  relations between erdogan and obama soured over u s  support for the ypg  which ankara regards as a terrorist group and an extension of kurdish insurgents fighting inside turkey  the turkish army and syrian rebel groups it supports have been fighting is in a separate campaign around al bab  northeast of the city of aleppo  ankara has complained in the past about a lack of u s  support for that campaign  kalin said there had been better coordination with the u s  led coalition on air strikes in the last  days  he added that ankara s priority remained the creation of a safe zone between the syrian towns of azaz and jarablus  a strip of border territory to the north of al bab  the turkish sources said pompeo would discuss both the ypg and steps against the network of u s  based turkish cleric fethullah gulen  whom turkey accuses of orchestrating last july s coup attempt  gulen denies any involvement  turkey has been frustrated by what it considers to be  washington s reluctance to hand over gulen  who has lived in self imposed exile in pennsylvania since    as you know  we have two fundamental issues with the u s  administration inherited from obama s period  one is the support given to ypg and the other is the  gulen  problem   kalin said   our president spoke about these openly and clearly  trump was informed on these and  without going into too much detail  he said let s ask our teams to work on this and let s give the necessary instructions
