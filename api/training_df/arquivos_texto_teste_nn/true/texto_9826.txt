london  ifr    the prospect of donald trump becoming the next u s  president and ushering in a period of increased public spending and de globalisation has not been adequately priced into bond markets  market participants have warned   trump  currently a candidate for the republican nomination for u s  president  could prove disruptive for global markets if he comes into power and brings in policies that match the radical nature of his rhetoric   i think one big uncertainty that has so far been ignored by the market is donald trump  what happens if he is elected   patrick barbe  chief investment officer  european sovereign   aggregate  bnp paribas investment partners  told ifr   we don t have any specific policies from him yet  but the tone of what he is saying suggests increased wages  expansion of the public sector and rising government expenses  everything that bond markets tend not to like    while the u s  markets will be most affected  the repercussions could be felt throughout the world  as the us still accounts for the largest chunk of the world s gdp  over  percent in   according to the world bank   trump this week recorded a comprehensive victory in the new york primary  injecting renewed momentum into his campaign to become the republican nominee   the vote scheduled for november has had a limited effect on bond markets so far  us treasuries have tended to trade much more on rates expectations than on political risk so far this year  and  year ust yields have dropped as much as  since the start of the year to   percent  according to eikon prices   moreover  there has been very little research or analysis done on the subject up to this point  though that is likely to change as the nomination process continues    i don t think the market has fully thought through the implications of trump as u s  president  but it is definitely moving up the agenda   said david riley  head of credit strategy at bluebay asset management    in my view  populist politics typically is also associated with protectionist economic policies  certainly a concern would be a more isolationist  protectionist u s   which would reinforce a fear that  after an era of globalization  we would enter an era of de globalisation   issuers front run in the public sector market there has been record levels of us dollar bond issuance this month  partly because ssa issuers are looking to get their borrowing done ahead of any political risk associated with the u s  election   market conditions are primarily driving the issuance as it is looking very solid at the moment  but the u s  election will cause uncertainty the closer you get to it  a lot of people are getting in ahead of these events   said one syndicate official who covers public sector debt   there has been    billion of u s  dollar bond issuance month to date by public sector issuers  according to ifr data  led by the likes of washington based supras world bank and inter american development bank   with a week still to go  that is comfortably above the us  raised in january   traditionally the busiest month of the year for the ssa sector
