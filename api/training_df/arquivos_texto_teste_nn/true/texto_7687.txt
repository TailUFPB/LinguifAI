 reuters    u s  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and republican candidate donald trump are in a tight race ahead of the nov   u s  presidential election   following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts  views on the likely outcome of the u s  elections and the possible implications of a trump or clinton win on financial markets    more coverage  bit ly  see related factbox  reut rs  larry biegelsen  senior analyst  healthcare team  wells fargo  the probability of either a republican or a democratic sweep of both the executive and legislative branches is low  but certainly not negligible  we think these scenarios would be more volatile for stocks   republican sweep  positive for devices  pharma  biotech  tools and pharmacy benefit managers  pbms   negative for managed care  facilities and digital health stocks  democratic sweep  positive for managed care  facilities and digital health stocks  negative for devices  pharma  biotech  tools and pbms  with trump s chances fading  and clinton s lead growing  the  democratic sweep  now carries greater   albeit still small   odds  raising the prospects for increased infrastructure spending  a positive bias for risk assets  and for heavier regulation of the financial and pharma sectors  a negative bias for both                     we think short term risk for the broader u s  equity market has been reduced  but not eliminated  in many investors  minds  the perceived risks associated with a trump victory in the presidential race have been replaced with concerns about the implications of a democratic sweep of leadership in congress  for both the senate and house to flip    clinton win   near term  the increased chance of a clinton victory seems good for stocks with high international exposure and industrials  in the case of industrials  we see a fundamental underpinning of support from a clinton victory in the form of plans to increase infrastructure spending  the fundamental picture for consumer discretionary is a bit trickier  given clinton s support for an increase in the minimum wage and the likely increase in operating expenses that would result for many companies   trump win   the financials and health care sectors have been trading more in line with trump s prospects for victory this year  which we think is due to fears over increased regulatory pressures for both sectors under a clinton led white house  that being said  we think any future election driven weakness in these sectors could be short lived and note that the relationships between these sectors and trump s polling numbers may already be starting to break down a bit        a democratic sweep  though still unlikely  might be met with concern on wall street as the prospect of higher taxes enters the fray     republican control of the house would stymie legislation that raised taxes across a wide swath and thus democratic control of congress alongside the resident of the oval office could lead to laws that might not be well received and could be seen as divisive  similar to the affordable care act   notably  moves to broaden entitlements including free college education could be passed with single party control but most likely would be blocked by a republican speaker of the house    one would expect secretary clinton to want to be a successful president and thus a more forceful economic agenda will be necessary to achieve that aim  while attempts at bipartisanship are likely specifically where there is some meeting of the minds  including areas like infrastructure spending and some tax reforms  there are several areas that may be controversial such as some of the planned tax increases  nonetheless  most political observers think clinton would be far more willing to reach out for compromise than obama did    a brexit style surprise in the u s  presidential election is very unlikely    comparisons between the surprise outcome in the uk referendum vote earlier this year and the upcoming u s  presidential election are hard to avoid  but we think the differences outweigh the similarities  most importantly  polling in the uk was much closer  and much less consistent  than it has been in the us presidential campaign this year      jaret seiberg  cowen washington research group  cowen and company banks  housing policy   sec  hillary clinton and donald trump have now faced off in three presidential debates without a material discussion of banks or housing  this tells us that congress will likely shape banking policy with either sen  elizabeth warren or rep  jeb hensarling taking  the  lead  depending on the winner  for housing  we see both candidates as a positive  though trump may be better for fannie and freddie   justin wolfers  university of michigan and nber  and eric zitzewitz  dartmouth college and nber market outlook   the s p  futures rose by   percent during the debate window in response to a  percent increase in clinton s victory probability  this implies that market participants believe that the s p  will be worth  percent more under a president clinton  movements in other u s  stock indices tell a similar story  a  percent difference is large both in absolute terms  and relative to how previous political shocks have moved the market    market volatility   during the debate  futures tracking expected future u s  stock market volatility fell sharply  suggesting that markets are more uncertain about outcomes under a trump presidency  oil prices rose  gold prices fell and treasury prices declined slightly  roughly speaking  these movements suggest that a clinton presidency is expected to lead to stock market volatility that is   percent lower  treasury yields that are  basis points higher  and oil that is   per barrel more expensive    global markets   movements in overseas markets suggest that the u s  election is expected to have significant global implications  the debate led the british ftse  to rise by as much as u s  stocks did  the same is true of many asian markets  too    the currencies of mexico and canada   both of which are partners in nafta  which trump has threatened to end or renegotiate   rose sharply  as did those of other nations with which the u s  has free trade agreements    all told  these movements suggest that financial markets expect a generally healthier domestic and international economy under a president clinton than under a president trump
