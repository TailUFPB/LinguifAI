according to u s  customs and border protection  economists estimate trade supports nearly one in three jobs here  ranging from workers who inspect the goods to forklift operators who unload them in distribution centers     in many ways  nogales represents the flip side of free trade deals that have battered industrial cities in the midwest  where jobs have been outsourced and manufacturing plants shut down  the cities where donald trump s promise to throttle what he calls unfair competition resonated most profoundly during the presidential campaign  it also represents potential risks that new trade barriers could pose for businesses and residents along the border  only a tall  rusted fence separates nogales  arizona  from nogales  mexico  the cities are so intertwined that locals

imports from mexico  they described a chain of events that would harm the economy  threaten local jobs and lead to higher prices for u s  consumers   president trump should take a good look at the

for more than  percent of jobs  according to a  report by economists at the university of arizona  trade and support for factories across the border account for another  percent of the workforce       the report s lead author  vera pavlakovich kochi  said a  percent border tax would create the strictest barriers to trade in five decades  in addition to trump s proposal of a  percent tax on imports from mexico  republican lawmakers have put forth a plan that would cut corporate income tax to  percent from  percent  exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a  percent tax on imports  the proposals have split corporate america   a group of major exporters including boeing co  general electric co and pfizer inc have formed a coalition to support the import tax  at the same time

nestled in the rolling hills on the outskirts of town  produce trader jaime chamberlain said business with mexico is the lifeblood of nogales  which brings in more pounds of mexican produce than any other u s  border town  it s  one of the largest industries here with the most employment and the most to lose   said chamberlain  a board member of the fresh produce association of the americas  he voted for trump and his pro business  socially conservative agendas  but is lobbying state leaders to oppose the tax  chamberlain s parents began the family business with a    loan in   he and his sister now own j c distributing inc  which employs about  people who handle   pounds of mexican tomatoes each week for taco bell in addition to orders for major companies such as kroger co and sysco

cruz board of supervisors chairman manuel ruiz   there are domino effects all over        many local business people expect mexico to fight back       a  percent tax could start a trade war with mexico  i don t see how we can impose that unilaterally   said ricardo crisantes  vice president of marketing and sales at wholesum harvest  which is part of a mexico based company that has offices in nogales and organic farms on both sides of the border      company representatives said a border tax could drive the company to shift more farming to the united states  but it also could send import demand to other parts of latin america that would bypass nogales       restaurant and store owners say the tax would make already tough times even worse          it would be huge   said karla galindo
