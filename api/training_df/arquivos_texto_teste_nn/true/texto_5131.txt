washington  reuters    women and children crossing together illegally into the united states could be separated by u s  authorities under a proposal being considered by the department of homeland security  according to three government officials  part of the reason for the proposal is to deter mothers from migrating to the united states with their children  said the officials  who have been briefed on the proposal  the policy shift would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they contest deportation or wait for asylum hearings  children would be put into protective custody with the department of health and human services  in the  least restrictive setting  until they can be taken into the care of a u s  relative or state sponsored guardian  currently  families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the united states until their cases are resolved  a federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention  president donald trump has called for ending  catch and release   in which migrants who cross illegally are freed to live in the united states while awaiting legal proceedings  two of the officials were briefed on the proposal at a feb   town hall for asylum officers by u s  citizenship and immigration services asylum chief john lafferty   a third dhs official said the department is actively considering separating women from their children but has not made a decision  hhs and the white house did not respond to requests for comment  in a statement to reuters  dhs said   the journey north is a dangerous one with too many situations where children   brought by parents  relatives or smugglers   are often exploited  abused or may even lose their lives   with safety in mind  the department of homeland security continually explores options that may discourage those from even beginning the journey   the statement said  u s  representative henry cuellar  a texas democrat whose district includes about  miles   km  of the border with mexico  slammed the proposal   bottom line  separating mothers and children is wrong   he said in a statement   that type of thing is where we depart from border security and get into violating human rights   he said  about   children and their guardians were apprehended between oct      and jan      more than double the number caught over the same time period a year earlier   republicans in congress have argued women are willing to risk the dangerous journey with their children because they are assured they will be quickly released from detention and given court dates set years into the future  immigrant rights advocates have argued that central america s violent and impoverished conditions force mothers to immigrate to the united states and that they should be given asylum status   graphic  tmsnrt rs   implementing the new policy proposal  could create lifelong psychological trauma   said marielena hincapie  executive director at the national immigration law center   especially for children that have just completed a perilous journey from central america   hincapie said the u s  government is likely to face legal challenges based on immigration and family law if they decide to implement the policy  the policy would allow dhs to detain parents while complying with a  u s  circuit court of appeals order from july  that immigrant children should be released from detention as quickly as possible  that order said their parents were not required to be freed  to comply with that order  the obama administration implemented a policy of holding women and children at family detention centers for no more than  days before releasing them  holding mothers in prolonged detention could also strain government resources  said randy capps of the migration policy institute  a washington based non profit   you are talking about a pretty rapid increase in the detention population if you are going to do this   capps said   the question is really how much detention can they afford   department of homeland security secretary john kelly last week ordered immigration agents to deport or criminally prosecute parents who facilitate the illegal smuggling of their children  many parents who arrive on the u s  mexico border with their children have paid smugglers to guide them across the dangerous terrain
