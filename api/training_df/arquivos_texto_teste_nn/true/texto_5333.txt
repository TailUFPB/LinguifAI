detroit  reuters    for david green  head of the detroit chapter of the democratic socialists of america  dsa   donald trump s victory in november was both distressing and cause for optimism in his quest to pull the democratic party to the left       we need a party that s open to progressive forces  and that s why we have to elect progressive leadership within the party   green said  while attending the michigan democratic party s spring convention in detroit earlier this month      membership in the dsa  founded in   has surged since trump s election on nov    putting the movement in a position to make inroads on the democratic party s energized left  the membership gains are fueled by supporters of bernie sanders  the u s  senator from vermont who sought the democratic presidential nomination last year   the dsa is not a political party  but it supports many of the same short term policy positions as the sanders wing of the democratic party  a   minimum wage  single payer healthcare  free college  and opposition to free trade deals      but unlike most mainstream democrats  the dsa also has a long term vision of a democratic socialist society in the vein of countries like sweden and denmark  where workers have a more direct say in how their jobs and the economy are run  alongside a more robust public sector  since november  national membership has almost tripled to about    its leaders have said meetings are packed and new chapters are cropping up nationwide  including in rust belt states such as michigan  wisconsin and ohio  where trump scored upset wins over democratic candidate hillary clinton to take the white house      the dsa s membership is tiny in the grand picture  in the  states plus the district of columbia where party registrations are tallied  the democratic party alone has about  million members      hans noel  a political scientist at georgetown university   said while the dsa s numbers remain small  its growth reflects a trend of the democratic party s left wing gaining clout after clinton s loss  many analysts said her defeat was at least partly due to her inability to win over sanders  supporters      noel notes the election this coming weekend of a new chair for the democratic national committee  seen as a dead heat between sanders supporter keith ellison  whom dsa supports  and clinton supporter tom perez  noel said it is not only a key inflection point but also a demonstration of the progressive bloc s newfound power       they re doing more mobilization and organization within the party     all of the candidates now feel this is a wing of the party they feel they have to take seriously   noel said in an interview   that kind of action is probably going to play out in internal party conflict over the next two to three years       the surge has buoyed the spirits of dsa officials including national director maria svart  who says the surge in new members began immediately after trump s victory       the day after the election  our membership coordinator turned to me when she looked at her computer in the morning and said  i can see the moment when donald trump announced that he d won    svart said   people started joining online in massive numbers       trump s election has galvanized not only the dsa but other left leaning political groups  since the jan   inauguration  protests against his policies and pronouncements have drawn tens of thousands of people nearly every weekend  providing new opportunities for the dsa and other groups to attract supporters   we re not going to work within the democratic party  but we re not going to work totally outside it either   svart said in an interview  adding that the dsa would eventually like to run its own candidates for office      at the michigan democratic convention  green and his dsa chapter were successful in getting several members elected to the michigan democratic party s state central committee for the first time in over two decades  in january  sanders supporters in california managed to elect a majority of delegates to that state s party leadership       state politics is where a lot of policy is done so it matters who s running for these offices   georgetown s noel said   control over who gets to be candidates is huge and these people have control over that in these positions
