washington  reuters    secretary of state nominee rex tillerson expressed views on wednesday at odds with president elect donald trump s positions on key foreign policy issues like nuclear proliferation  trade deals  climate change and relations with mexico  in a nine hour senate confirmation hearing  the former chief executive of oil company exxon mobil said he favored maintaining u s  sanctions against russia for now and that nato allies were right to be alarmed by moscow s growing aggression  russia dominated much of the hearing because of concerns by democrats and republicans over moscow s interference in the u s  presidential election and its  annexation of crimea from ukraine and involvement in the syrian civil war  questions soon moved to the threat posed by islamic state  china s behavior in the south china sea  human rights and tillerson s ability to make a clean break from a career at exxon mobil to become america s top diplomat  tillerson said his differences with trump on some major  issues would not necessarily put him at loggerheads with the white house   he said everyone in trump s cabinet would have the chance to discuss issues  and the president will decide   he described himself as open and transparent  in a stark departure from trump  tillerson said it would not be acceptable for some u s  allies to acquire nuclear weapons  he also did not see the need for a muslim registry  saying he did not support targeting any particular group  asked by democratic senator edward markey about trump s comments in interviews he would not oppose u s  allies including japan obtaining nuclear weapons  tillerson replied   i do not agree   tillerson said he did not oppose the trans pacific partnership trade deal  which trump has criticized  but acknowledged the negotiated deal may not serve all u s  interests  tillerson  however  left room for broad reversals or changes to obama administration policies  in line with trump s positions  including trade with cuba and the iran nuclear deal  which he said ought to undergo a full review  the hearing before the senate foreign relations committee was interrupted sporadically by protesters  tillerson    is expected to be confirmed by the republican controlled senate  senators have expressed concern about tillerson s ties to russia while at exxon mobil and trump s desire to improve relations with moscow  tillerson refused to call russian president vladimir putin a war criminal and kept the door open to a possible change in u s  sanctions policy against russia  saying he had not seen classified information on russian meddling   i would leave things in the status quo so we are able to convey this can go either way   tillerson said  suggesting  open and frank  dialogue with moscow to better understand its intentions  he blamed russia s aggression toward ukraine since  on an  absence of american leadership  and said the united states should have taken stronger actions to deter russia   i m advocating for responses that will deter and prevent further expansion of a bad actor s behavior   he said  tillerson said it was a  fair assumption  putin was aware of russian efforts to interfere in the u s  election  he said he had not discussed russia policy with trump  which democratic senator robert menendez said was  pretty amazing   in a tense exchange  republican senator marco rubio pushed tillerson on whether he believed putin was a war criminal  in reference to russia s military actions in support of syria s government   i would not use that term   tillerson said  adding   those are very  very serious charges to make and i would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion   rubio  who ran against trump for the republican presidential nomination  shot back   there s so much information out there  it should not be hard to say that vladimir putin s military has conducted war crimes in aleppo   referring to the syrian city recently retaken by government forces backed by russia   he added   i find it discouraging  your inability to cite that which i think is globally accepted   tillerson sidestepped questions on human rights  declining to condemn countries like saudi arabia and the philippines for rights abuses  saying he wanted to see the facts first  rubio told reporters later that he was unsure he could vote for tillerson  as one of  republicans on the  member panel  his support is key to tillerson winning the committee s backing   tillerson said he would recommend a  full review  of the nuclear deal with iran reached with the united states and world powers  he did not call for an outright rejection of the  accord in which tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions  trump has made contradictory statements about the deal and has threatened to dismantle it  tillerson said china should be denied access to islands it had built in the contested south china sea  he added his approach to dealing with north korea  which recently said it was close to carrying out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  would be  a long term plan  based on sanctions and their proper implementation  asked if he could make unbiased decisions after his time at exxon mobil  the world s largest publicly traded oil producer  he said he would act in america s interests  tillerson dodged a direct question on whether he believed climate change was caused by human activity   the risk of climate change does exist and the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken   he said  adding the ability to predict the effect of greenhouse gas was  very limited    trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated by china and has threatened to quit the paris climate accord  a global agreement to curb emissions  tillerson called mexico  a long standing neighbor and friend of this country   trump has said he will build a wall on the mexican border  and in his  presidential announcement speech described mexican migrants to the united states as drug runners and rapists  tillerson s responses were calm and measured  without any obvious reliance on notes   he opposed u s  sanctions against russia in  over its annexation of crimea from ukraine because he said he thought they would be ineffective  on wednesday  he said he never personally lobbied against sanctions and emphasized that he was not aware of exxon mobil directly doing so  tillerson later acknowledged he spoke to u s  treasury secretary jack lew regarding gaps between american and european sanctions on russia  democratic senator chris murphy vigorously challenged tillerson on the issue  saying he called a u s  senator to express concerns over the measures  which  likely constitutes lobbying   exxon lobbied congress regarding sanctions against russia following the annexation of crimea  the lobbying directly related to energy matters  according to regulatory filings
