 reuters    u s  president elect donald trump has upset china by speaking to the president of self ruled taiwan and saying the united states did not necessarily have to be bound by its long standing position that taiwan is part of china  taiwan is arguably the most sensitive part of the china u s  relationship  and china has never renounced the use of force to bring the island it regards as a renegade province under its control  here are  things china could do to retaliate against the trump administration if he continues to push the taiwan issue    cutting ties with washington if trump offers any type of formal diplomatic recognition to taiwan  china would likely severe its own diplomatic ties with the united states  in what would be an extreme and highly disruptive move  china refuses to have diplomatic ties with any nation that also has diplomatic relations with taiwan  cutting ties with washington would likely be a final resort by beijing    war games near taiwan  china could signal its resolve over taiwan by holding war games close to the island  for example by effectively closing off air and shipping routes by lobbing missiles into waters close to taiwan s densely populated western coast  a move that would deeply unsettle the region  chinese state media have even suggested military means may now be needed to settle the taiwan issue once and for all    south china sea face off  china has been angered by u s  freedom of navigation patrols in the disputed south china sea  where china has been reclaiming land on the islands and reefs it occupies and building airfields and other facilities   so far  china has responded to u s  patrols by shadowing them and issuing verbal warnings  china may take more forceful measures to future u s  patrols  in   a u s  spy plane was forced to land in china after colliding with a chinese fighter over the south china sea      beijing would be reluctant to see a military clash as china needs a peaceful south china sea to keep its trade lanes open    sanctioning u s  companies involved in arms sales to taiwan in   beijing reacted with fury to the obama administration plans for a new round of weapons sales to taiwan  threatening to sanction the u s  companies involved  the threats ultimately did not come to fruition    cut its holdings of u s  treasuries china is america s biggest creditor  holding    trillion dollars worth of u s  treasuries as of september  if beijing decided to suddenly liquidate a big chunk of its holdings  it could do severe damage to u s  debt markets  forcing the united states to scramble for funds  a big retaliatory sell off of u s  government debt by china would not be a precision strike  though  such a move would roil global markets and likely even rebound on china s own  making this  in some analysts  minds  a worst case scenario short of war    ease up pressure on north korea the united states has repeatedly urged china to  get tough  on nuclear armed north korea  and while china is pyongyang s most important economic and diplomatic backer  it has also been infuriated by its nuclear and missile tests  while china could ease up on united nations sanctions on north korea to express displeasure with the united states  it could boomerang and end up giving succor to pyongyang and its missile and nuclear programs  something beijing does not want    pressure on u s  companies indirect levers exist for hitting companies via state run media and consumer organizations  or just stoking popular sentiment   after china lost an international ruling earlier this year over its claims in the south china sea  several u s  brands became targets for short lived anti u s  protests and boycott calls  including apple inc  aapl o  and kfc parent yum brands inc  yum n    u s  companies could also face higher tariffs as well as outright substitution of their products  such as aircraft  in favor of chinese or other foreign competitors  china might throw bureaucratic obstacles in the way of u s  firms in the country  a senior executive in china at a large american consumer goods firm told reuters any strike back against u s  firms would likely involve local authorities clogging up approval processes or slowing down paperwork  rather than a loud and brash response    alternative agricultural supplies china  the world s top consumer of commodities from copper  to corn to crude oil  could hit the united states if it sought alternative supplies of agricultural products    volumes of u s  agricultural imports from corn to soybeans into china hit a record   million tonnes in      kill momentum for market access  a trump departure from a one china policy would almost certainly undermine bilateral investment treaty talks  trump may not be a fan of those to begin with  but greater market access under a bilateral investment treaty tops the u s  business community s wish list for china  the u s  china bit had long been viewed within the broader foreign business community to be the vanguard of liberalizing investment deals with china  if those talks stall  it s possible china will promote investment treaty talks with europe     undermining the consensus on cyber issues if trump goes back on one china  it s possible there could be a chinese reversal on cyber security commitments made between xi and obama in   which u s  government advisers and security experts have credited with reducing china led cyber espionage
