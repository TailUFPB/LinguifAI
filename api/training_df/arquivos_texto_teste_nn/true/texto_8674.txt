washington  reuters    the pentagon on friday updated its law of war manual after a previous version came under fire for appearing to allow commanders to treat journalists as belligerents or spies  the u s  department of defense manual  the first and most comprehensive of its kind  was first released last june  it compared some of the tasks of journalism to spying or other hostile actions by an enemy  the manual said some journalists may be considered  unprivileged belligerents    a legal category with fewer protections than combatants  such as prisoner of war status   reporting on military operations can be very similar to collecting intelligence or even spying   one passage of the manual said  press freedom advocates said the manual s wording blurred the line between journalists and combatants and gave commanders the authority to detain reporters without charge  they also warned that it would erode u s  credibility abroad at a time when journalists are being targeted by governments and militant groups  sixty nine journalists were killed for their work in   according to the committee to protect journalists  up from  in   in    journalists were being detained worldwide  compared to  in   after the manual s release last year  news organizations including reuters met with pentagon officials to protest the language and ask for changes   the revised manual provides greater detail on the legitimate purposes that journalists serve and makes clear that journalists have all the rights of civilians  press freedom groups  including cpj and reporters without borders  praised the revisions  advocates said the new manual acknowledged journalists  right to interview enemy combatants and placed the onus on commanders to discern between the actions of reporters and combatants   these are major changes   said frank smyth of the cpj   this affirms the rights and the practice of open and independent reporting on the battlefield   the pentagon eliminated the passages comparing reporting to spying or hostile acts  but gives specific examples of how an act of reporting could result in the loss of civilian status  journalists could still be considered unprivileged belligerents  the manual states  if they were a member of a non state armed group and were carrying out propaganda  or other media activities   journalists could also lose their civilian status in certain cases  such as relaying target coordinates for an artillery strike against opposing forces  the manual said   the new manual also eliminates language that called for journalists to seek permission from  relevant authorities  for their work  to avoid being mistaken for spies   that passage drew criticism for setting an unrealistic standard for war reporting  in which frontlines can shift quickly  to cover conflicts in libya or syria  for instance  reporters often have to cross borders illegally  pentagon officials also said they would be willing to revise the manual again if needed   the department s mission is to defend the very freedoms that journalists exercise   the pentagon s top lawyer  jennifer o connor  said in a statement   we have learned a lot during this process  and the department and the manual are better off for the experience
