los angeles  reuters    u s  wind and solar companies for the first time gave more money to republicans than democrats during the  election cycle  according to federal campaign disclosures  part of a years long effort to expand renewable energy s appeal beyond liberal environmentalists  the industry is now hoping its strategy of reaching across the political divide will pay off in the form of congressional support as republican donald trump  a climate change skeptic who has expressed doubts about the role of clean energy  takes the white house in january   we re not starting from ground zero   said isaac brown  a principal at  north solutions  which lobbies on behalf of clean energy clients  the u s  wind and solar industries employ over   people  making clean energy an important political constituency that is about five times bigger than the coal sector for jobs  thanks to years of rapid growth fueled by government incentives and declines in the cost of their technologies   they have also fought to win over a new breed of backer  conservatives skeptical of climate change but interested in supporting homegrown energy alternatives that increase national security  boost competition  and create well paying blue collar jobs  but trump s upset victory over democrat hillary clinton in the nov   presidential election has cast doubt on the future of a federal tax break for renewable energy seen critical to the industry s continued growth   trump has never specifically called for those credits to end  but has expressed skepticism about the role of solar and wind in the u s  energy landscape  calling both  so expensive  and blaming wind turbines for killing birds and ruining picturesque landscapes  during his campaign  trump also called global warming a hoax and promised to quit a global accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions  though he has since softened his stance and said he is keeping an  open mind  about the deal  the renewable energy industry got a boost last year when congress approved a five year extension of tax credits for new power projects fueled by solar panels and wind turbines  and the industry s main concern in washington is to ensure they are not withdrawn in trump s first term  or allowed to expire should he win a second   a trump official did not respond to a request for comment about how he will approach renewables as president  but one of trump s potential picks for energy secretary  oklahoma oil and gas drilling mogul harold hamm  has been a vocal opponent of subsidies for renewable energy   renewable stocks took a beating immediately after trump s election but have since mostly recovered  during the  cycle  the wind and solar industry s political action committees contributed more than    to republican candidates for office  compared with    for democrats  the numbers are not large by the standards of political donations but they mark the first time the industry has tilted its contributions toward republicans  according to federal records   in   democrats got about two thirds of the industry s contributions  recipients this year included  house republicans and  senate republicans  u s  senator dean heller from nevada  new york representative tom reed and north carolina u s  senator richard burr   all vocal proponents of renewables   together accounted for more than  percent of the solar energy industries association pac s total federal campaign donations   it is reassuring that we have those relationships already developed  and we have a really strong business case for the policies that have been implemented   said brown of  north solutions  industry executives like sunpower chief executive tom werner and first solar inc ceo mark widmar have acknowledged the uncertainty around federal support for renewables  but they have sought to assuage investors  saying current policies are likely to remain due to the cost competitiveness of their technologies and the number of jobs they represent  the industry has also tried to get its message out to trump  the solar energy industries association  before the election  provided trump staffers with information about the investment tax credit and its impact on jobs and the economy   the american wind energy association would not say what interactions it has had with trump s team  but twice during the campaign it published posts on its blog to counter his statements on the cost of wind energy and its impact on birds   the hope is to partner with and educate new appointees  in trump s administration  and point out the facts  and then we ll see   said sunpower s werner   though democrats have historically been viewed as the strongest supporters of renewable energy  utility scale wind farms and solar installations are found throughout the nation   including in republican leaning states like arizona  north carolina  oklahoma and north dakota   and enjoy bipartisan support among americans  a pew research center poll from october found  percent of conservative republicans favor more solar installations  and  percent favor more wind farms  those figures were  percent and  percent for liberal democrats   the expansion of solar beyond liberal strongholds like california and the northeast has been critical to garnering republican support over the last few years  the wind industry has been established in red states for far longer than solar and has a longer track record of support from republican lawmakers in those states
