 reuters    florida residents were given six extra days to register to vote in the nov   election by a u s  judge on wednesday following the disruption triggered by powerful hurricane matthew in the state last week  u s  district judge mark walker in tallahassee extended the registration deadline to oct   after the florida democratic party sued to seek more time  the original deadline to register had been tuesday  before walker ordered a one day reprieve to allow for a hearing on wednesday  florida democrats had argued that voters were forced to decide between their safety and their right to vote when republican governor rick scott ordered evacuations along a stretch of the state s atlantic coast as matthew approached    no right is more precious than having a voice in our democracy   walker wrote in a three page court ruling on the lawsuit  florida is a battleground state in the nov   presidential election pitting democrat hillary clinton against republican donald trump  with opinion polls showing a close race there  it is the largest of the hotly contested states whose populations can swing either to republicans or democrats and thus play a decisive role  the powerful hurricane  which killed around   people in haiti as it churned through the caribbean  is blamed for at least  deaths in florida  georgia  south carolina and north carolina  north carolina now faces flooding from swollen rivers    in its complaint  the florida democratic party alleged that the state s refusal to extend the voter registration deadline would have a  decidedly partisan effect   noting that populations that lean democratic  including minorities and younger voters  register in greater numbers just before the deadline   it also noted that areas affected by matthew have substantial populations of black and latino voters who would be disproportionately likely to register to vote at the last minute  in past presidential years  up to  percent of all new registrations in florida were filed during the week before the deadline  according to the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law  which helped bring the lawsuit   while we wish it had not taken a lawsuit to get the scott administration to do the right thing  today s ruling is a major victory for all floridians and for the democratic process in the sunshine state   the state democratic party said in a statement  the judge earlier ruled that florida law did not give scott authority to extend voter registration and that he was not a proper party to the case  florida secretary of state ken detzner  a scott appointee also named in the lawsuit  was empowered to do so  walker noted   the state will follow the court s decision and discuss with the legislature possible amendments to current law   scott s office said in a statement earlier in the week   south carolina extended its registration deadline due to matthew from oct   to oct    while georgia declined to do so   north carolina will not extend the regular deadline to register to vote  which ends on friday  although allowances will be made for delayed mail delivery of registration forms  state officials said on wednesday  however  those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from oct   through nov
