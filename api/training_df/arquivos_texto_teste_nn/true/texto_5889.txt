washington cairo  reuters    five iraqi passengers and one yemeni were barred from boarding an egyptair flight from cairo to new york on saturday after president donald trump halted the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries  sources at cairo airport said  the passengers  arriving in transit to cairo airport  were stopped and re directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas  the sources said   trump on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other muslim majority countries  saying the moves would help protect americans from terrorist attacks  he said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago  barring travelers from the seven nations for at least  days  would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees  immigrants and visitors   i m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states of america  don t want them here   trump said earlier on friday at the pentagon   we only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people   he said  the bans  though temporary  took effect immediately  causing havoc and confusion for would be travelers with passports from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  besides cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by trump had swiftly implemented the ban  arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter  the order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution  a move trump separately said was aimed at helping christians in syria  that led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional  one group said it would announce a court challenge on monday  the council on american islamic relations said the order targets muslims because of their faith  contravening the u s  constitutional right to freedom of religion   president trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of muslim countries under the banner of national security   said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association   trump has long pledged to take this kind of action  making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the nov   election  but people who work with muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order  even legal permanent residents   people with  green cards  allowing them to live and work in the united states   were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country  or trying to return  according to muslim advocates  a civil rights group in washington   on friday evening  abed ayoub of the american arab anti discrimination committee said he had fielded about  queries from people anxious about the order  which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders  students  people coming to the united states for medical care and others   it s chaos   ayoub said  during his campaign  trump tapped into american fears about islamic state militants and the flood of migrants into europe from syria s civil war  saying refugees could be a  trojan horse  that allowed attackers to enter the united states  in december   he called for a ban on all muslims entering the united states  drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the u s  constitution  his idea later evolved into a proposal for  extreme vetting    trump s order also suspends the syrian refugee program until further notice  and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution   trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network that the exception would help syrian christians fleeing the civil war there  legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional   if they are thinking about an exception for christians  in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution   said stephen legomsky  a former chief counsel at u s  citizenship and immigration services in the obama administration  but peter spiro  a professor at temple university beasley school of law  said trump s action would likely be constitutional because the president and congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions   it s a completely plausible prioritization  to the extent this group is actually being persecuted   spiro said  the order may also affect special refugee programs for iraqis who worked for the u s  government as translators after the  invasion of iraq  it is already affecting refugees and their families  said jen smyers of the church world service  a protestant faith based group that works with migrants  smyers said she spoke to an iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in iraq due to processing delays   those two  year old daughters won t be able to join their mother in the u s    she said  democrats on friday were quick to condemn trump s order as un american  saying it would tarnish the reputation of the united states as a land that welcomes immigrants   today s executive order from president trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting   said democratic senator edward markey in a statement  some republicans praised the move  representative bob goodlatte  chairman of the house of representatives judiciary committee  said islamic state has threatened to use the u s  immigration system  making it important to do more screening   i am pleased that president trump is using the tools granted to him by congress and the power granted by the constitution to help keep america safe and ensure we know who is entering the united states   goodlatte said in a statement  without naming trump  iranian president hassan rouhani said on saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements  trump on wednesday ordered the construction of a u s  mexican border wall  a major promise during his election campaign  as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration   today is not the time to erect walls between nations  they have forgotten that the berlin wall fell years ago   rouhani said in a speech carried live on iranian state television  he made no direct reference to trump s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly muslim states  rouhani  a pragmatist elected in   thawed iran s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its  deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions  rouhani said earlier this month that trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was  meaningless   france and germany voiced disquiet on saturday over trump s new restrictions on immigration   welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty   french foreign minister jean marc ayrault said at a joint news conference with german counterpart sigmar gabriel   the united states is a country where christian traditions have an important meaning  loving your neighbor is a major christian value  and that includes helping people   said  gabriel   i think that is what unites us in the west  and i think that is what we want to make clear to the americans
