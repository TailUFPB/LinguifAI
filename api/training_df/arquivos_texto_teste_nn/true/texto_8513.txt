washington  reuters    fifty prominent republican national security officials  including a former cia director  on monday called party nominee donald trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be  the most reckless president in american history   the statement was the latest repudiation of trump s candidacy by veteran republican national security specialists  and was remarkable for the harshness of its language   mr  trump lacks the character  values  and experience to be president  he weakens u s  moral authority as the leader of the free world  he appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the u s  constitution  u s  laws and u s  institutions  including religious tolerance  freedom of the press  and an independent judiciary   the statement said   none of us will vote for donald trump   said the statement  which noted that some signatories also have doubts about democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton   from a foreign policy perspective  donald trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief   said the statement  which was first reported in the new york times   indeed  we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country s national security and well being   the signatories  some of whom worked for more than one republican president  included former central intelligence agency director michael hayden  who also headed the national security agency  former homeland security secretary michael chertoff  former director of national intelligence john negroponte  and two former u s  trade representatives  carla hills and robert zoelick  other signatories included former senior state department  pentagon and national security council officials who helped plan and oversee the  u s  invasion of iraq  trump has harshly criticized the iraq operation  although when radio host howard stern asked him in  if he favored invading iraq  trump said he guessed he did  the statement was organized by philip zelikow  who served as a top adviser to former secretary of state condoleezza rice  trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of  the failed washington elite  who  deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place    these insiders   along with hillary clinton   are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade iraq  allow americans to die in benghazi  and they are the ones who allowed the rise of isis   he continued  using an acronym for the islamic state militant group  the statement did not cite specific comments by trump  but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for nato  expressing admiration for russian president vladimir putin  calling for a temporary ban on immigration by muslims  and inviting russia to hack clinton s private email server   which he later said was a joke  many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing trump s national security qualifications that was published in march  the statement said many americans are frustrated with the federal government s failure to solve domestic and international problems   but donald trump is not the answer to america s daunting challenges and to this crucial election   the statement said   we are convinced that in the oval office  he would be the most reckless president in american history  some democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the new york real estate developer s nomination has sown within the republican party   this letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party   many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to trump   said brian katulis  a fellow at the center for american progress and a clinton campaign adviser   calling trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough  but also asserting that he s lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing   said tommy vietor  a former national security council spokesman in democratic president barack obama s administration   that said  i think it s unlikely to influence many voters  but it could give cover to republican members of congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from trump    for the complete statement go to  here
