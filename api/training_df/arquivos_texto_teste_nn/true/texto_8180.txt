washington  reuters    u s  house speaker paul ryan is expected to cruise to re election in his wisconsin congressional district on nov    the day before his real political problems are likely to start  that is when ryan will know the shape of the new house of representatives  if  as some analysts foresee  it becomes even more conservative than it is now  ryan s difficulties in managing the lower chamber of congress could worsen  for the highest ranking elected u s  republican  that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in   some staunch house conservatives  questioning ryan s commitment to them and their agenda  are looking less kindly on the idea of re electing him as speaker early next year  but his real test  assuming he retains the speaker s gavel  would be getting legislative results with a more conservative house  compounding that could be the u s  senate switching to democratic from republican control and possibly a democratic president  hillary clinton  if she beats republican donald trump in the november election   next year  almost no matter what  is going to be a very tough one for paul ryan   said political scientist norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute think tank  the  election results could cast a shadow over ryan s presidential ambitions in  and   assuming he harbors them   it may well be that he decides it s just not worth it  partly given what he sees within his own party   ornstein said  ryan s aides were reluctant on monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next congress   the focus over the next  days is defending and strengthening our house majority  we are in a good position    said ryan s political spokesman  zack roday  republicans hold  of the  house seats  their biggest majority in decades  but analysts expect the party will lose seats in november  especially if trump hurts fellow republicans  house members serve two year terms and most are easily re elected  the political prediction newsletter  sabato s crystal ball  has tagged only  races as too close to call  ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by republican leaders including ryan  five of the  are retiring from the house  if trump s performance damages candidates down the ticket  moderates may bear the brunt  the result could be a smaller house republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied ryan on some legislation   a shrinking gop conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new congress  raising the challenge for speaker ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file   said sarah binder  professor of political science at george washington university  if a number of moderates lose their seats  while most conservatives hold theirs   then the house freedom caucus becomes more powerful   said kyle kondik  managing editor of  sabato s crystal ball   the freedom caucus is the house s most conservative bloc  with about  members  it helped eject ryan s predecessor  john boehner  a year ago  leading to ryan s election as speaker  the freedom caucus initially welcomed ryan  a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda  but some freedom caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members  representative tim huelskamp of kansas  lost a primary election last month  ryan could have done more to help huelskamp  some critics said   there was huge disappointment in that   said representative john fleming  a freedom caucus member from louisiana who is running for the u s  senate in november  the huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed ryan will oppose him when the house elects a new speaker in january  although none of them has said so publicly   i don t think most members feel yet that ryan is undeserving of more time  as speaker   but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing   said dan holler of heritage action  the political wing of the heritage foundation conservative think tank
