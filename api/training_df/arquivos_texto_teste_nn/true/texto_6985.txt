wilmington  del   reuters    u s  president elect donald trump has several options for disentangling himself from his business empire when he takes office next year  but legal experts say the only way fully to avoid conflicts of interest would be to sell his global holdings  trump tweeted on wednesday that he would unveil on dec   his plans for taking himself  completely out of business operations  before taking office on jan     trump did not spell out his plans  but several ideas have started to gain prominence  u s  senator ben cardin  a maryland democrat  is pushing for a resolution requiring trump to establish a blind trust under independent control to manage his holdings  however  a blind trust only works if the office holder does not know how the trustee has invested the money  legal experts said  much of trump s money is tied up in highly visible  illiquid investments such as luxury hotels and properties branded with his name  so he will still be aware of these holdings even if he puts someone else in charge of daily operations  richard painter  the chief ethics counsel to president george w  bush  said a blind trust would not protect against some of the most dangerous conflicts from the trump organization holdings  painter has urged electoral college members to refuse to make trump the next president unless he sells his business interests  he said the organization s overseas real estate raises questions about the cost of security and whether that would be paid by u s  taxpayers  foreign governments or the trump organization  the properties could also become a target for violence  potentially ensnaring the united states in a foreign conflict   a blind trust is a fairy tale in this context   said stephen gillers  a professor who specializes in ethics at new york university school of law  new york times columnist andrew ross sorkin has touted the idea of appointing a corporate monitor  and suggested kenneth feinberg  who oversaw compensation funds for victims of the sept     attacks   judges often appoint monitors to oversee court settlements  if a party violates the deal  the monitor can bring them back to court where they would face potential penalties imposed by the judge   however  any corporate monitor overseeing trump s business would not have a judge s backing  only the threat of public embarrassment if trump refused to cooperate   that s bad for trump  but it s not the same as having a judge instruct a party in court that unless you buckle up and do what i say you re back in court and i ll impose more dramatic sanctions   said gillers  painter and gillers said the best way to reduce potential conflicts would be a sale of the entire trump organization  painter said trump s children should also end their association with the business   what he needs to do is get to the place where trump s interest in profit of any trump entity is the same as my interest or your interest or the interest of the person on the street   said gillers  that presents a new set of complications  a portfolio of real estate developments would usually consist of a large number of separate legal entities   so  each one has to be sold individually  that s a pain   said brian quinn  a professor at the boston college law school  he said the sale would likely take a long time  making matters worse  real estate developments often involve a building owner who contracts with someone like trump to brand and manage the property  quinn said those contracts derive their value from the trump name   it won t be easy to do  he ll probably take a bath on the transactions   quinn said   but it s really the only way for him to go forward  simply handing over day to day management of the businesses to his kids will not be enough
