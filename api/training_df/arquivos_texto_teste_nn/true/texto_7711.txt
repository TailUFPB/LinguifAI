 reuters    forget the accusations of groping  bigotry and email mismanagement  if the american voter had to choose between republican nominee donald trump and his democratic rival hillary clinton based on their energy policies alone  the presidential election would still be a remarkable drama  amounting to the biggest referendum on global climate change since the term was coined  how the country decides on nov   will have far reaching implications for the price of electricity and gas at the pump  as well as the future of the u s  energy industry  which employs about  million people  trump s vision is an america where oil derricks pump furiously again  coal miners get back to work  and the country puts its own economy ahead of foreign nations worried about the effects of fossil fuels on sea levels  droughts  and storms  clinton sees an america where half a billion solar panels power homes  cars run on electricity  oil use is cut by a third  and the clean energy sector provides a deep well of new jobs supported by government mandates and subsidies    at a very basic level  it would be a climate vote   said sarah emerson  the head of energy security analysis inc in boston   do you want fossil fuels  or renewables   trump has said he wants to unleash a u s   energy revolution  by streamlining environmental regulation  easing infrastructure permitting and pulling the country out of a global pact to combat climate change   moves he says would promote increased oil and gas drilling and revive the dying coal mining industry without compromising air and water quality  the proposals align neatly with both the republican party s opposition to government overreach  and trump s own campaign theme of making  america great again  by restoring traditional industries  including many that have been hurt by international trade agreements  while the plan has earned him some support within an oil and gas industry naturally opposed to regulation  it has also given rise to skepticism among even his closest allies over whether he can deliver   obama hasn t shut down drilling   what has shut down drilling is price   texas oil billionaire t  boone pickens  a trump supporter  told reuters   i don t know what trump can do to help the industry   a technology driven drilling boom has pushed u s  oil and gas production up  percent since president barack obama took office in   making america the top producer in the world  but it has also triggered a slump in prices as demand has failed to keep up  oil prices are running at four month highs around   a barrel after the opec cartel signaled in september it may make its first production cut in eight years  but prices remain less than half their levels from mid    while the price crash has been a boon for consumers and energy intensive businesses  dozens of energy companies have gone bankrupt  putting blue collar workers in the coal mines  shale fields and oil rigs out of work   critics have said trump s plan to revive natural gas drilling would finish off the very coal industry he promises to restore  because the two fuels compete  it would  seem to defy basic market laws of supply and demand   said jason bordoff  a former energy adviser to obama  the coal industry  once a large employer in parts of america  now employs less than   miners  it has become a symbol of trump s vow to revive dying industries  clinton suffered political damage when she said  we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business   trump s energy plan would also force the united states to make an abrupt turnabout on the environment  he wants to withdraw from the global climate change pact agreed in paris last year   he has called climate change a hoax and has argued the paris deal would cost the u s  economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage   trump wants to rescind the clean power plan to limit carbon output and downgrade the environmental protection agency to a commission  not a cabinet level agency  and refocus it on its  core mission  clean air and clean water for all americans  regardless of race or income   an oil industry lobbyist in washington d c   who asked not to be named  said that even if trump s policies were unlikely to solve the root problem facing the industry right now   the low price of oil and gas   his ideas were still mainly welcomed   regulation is a killer  and if it can be streamlined  it helps   he said  trump s campaign has drawn about    from employees of the oil and gas industry since july  when he was formally nominated  while clinton has received about    from the industry over the same period  according to the latest federal campaign finance disclosures  environmental advocates argue that a failure to agree on strong measures like the paris accord would doom the world to ever hotter average temperatures  bringing with them deadlier storms  more frequent droughts and rising sea levels as polar ice caps melt  clinton says she wants to address that by making america a  clean energy superpower   her plan calls for phasing out fossil fuels  embracing clean energy sources like solar and wind  strengthening environmental protections and leading the world in curbing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change   we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels  we can have enough clean energy to power every home  we can build a new modern electric grid  that s a lot of jobs  that s a lot of new economic activity   clinton said in the first presidential debate in september  solar development is aided by a federal tax credit worth  percent of the cost of a system  that credit was set to expire at the end of this year  but received a five year extension from congress in late   even so  the cost of electricity from large scale solar installations has dropped to a level that is now comparable to natural gas fired power  even without incentives  clinton has also signaled increased regulation of fracking to prevent water and air pollution  continued support for the obama administration s efforts to curb carbon output that would pressure fuels like coal  and a tougher approach to infrastructure permitting  her approach appears much more likely than trump s to lift consumer prices for gasoline  heating oil  and electricity  given that increased regulation typically increases costs of production  many analysts said   still  clinton will likely face stiff resistance from u s  congress   if republicans retain control of one or both houses  she could follow in obama s footsteps by relying on executive orders to implement her agenda  but opponents would almost certainly challenge her in the courts  jay faison  a north carolina entrepreneur who calls himself a conservative advocate for clean energy  agrees with the need for more lower carbon sources of energy  but says trump s plans to cut regulation could provide a more effective way to get there  they could potentially make it easier to build nuclear power plants and hydro electric dams  which produce no carbon dioxide  for example  environmentalists  who have helped mobilize mass protests against energy infrastructure projects during obama s presidency  hate trump s proposals  but they are also suspicious of clinton  she promoted fracking technology to european allies while america s top diplomat to help them reduce their dependence on russia  according to leaked diplomatic cables  and was slow to oppose the keystone xl pipeline proposal that would have piped in more oil sands from alberta to u s  refineries   it s a shame that were going to have to spend four or eight years pressuring her at every turn but we will   said bill mckibben  founder of  org  which advocates a complete halt to fossil fuels development   this version of the story was refiled to change  powers  to  power  in the headline
