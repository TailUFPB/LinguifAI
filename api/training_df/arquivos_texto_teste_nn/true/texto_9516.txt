sacramento  reuters    two of the most powerful politicians in california are advancing the same basic gun control agenda   yet they are at loggerheads in a political duel that could preview an ugly race to replace the state s popular democratic governor  jerry brown  the spat among ambitious democrats took a serious turn this week  as senate leader kevin de leon aggressively moved to push a package of gun control bills through the legislature that  if passed  would largely render irrelevant a firearms referendum by lieutenant governor gavin newsom aimed at the november ballot   they both want tougher gun laws in california and they both want credit for it   said dan schnur  a former republican strategist who now heads the jesse unruh institute of politics at the university of southern california  both efforts would prohibit possession of large capacity ammunition magazines  require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons  the legislative package  which passed the senate appropriations committee on monday and will go before the full body on thursday  also seeks to eliminate a loophole in an existing law prohibiting weapons with detachable ammunition magazines  newsom  who is running to replace brown in the  gubernatorial election  is expected to make the gun control measure a centerpiece of his campaign  along with a proposed ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana    but de leon has not endorsed him  last year  shortly after newsom announced his gun control referendum  de leon reduced the number of legislative staff working in the lieutenant governor s office  de leon  who represents los angeles  is close to possible newsom rivals in the governor s race  including former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa   he has asked newsom to agree to withdraw his ballot measure if the senate package passes  but newsom has refused   the initiative process is a blunt instrument and should always be the last resort   not the first   de leon said in an email on monday   it would be preferable to achieve policymaking on such a complex issue as gun control through the legislative process   de leon is also concerned that the ballot campaign would be expensive  drawing political contributions from pro gun groups like the national rifle association and potentially causing democrats in moderate and conservative districts to lose elections  a source close to him said  but newsom said in a letter to de leon shared with reuters that his initiative was more comprehensive than the senate package  tackling topics that had stalled repeatedly in the legislature  dan newman  newsom s campaign strategist  said concerns about gun violence  not politics  motivated the lieutenant governor   he will get plenty of exposure this fall via his support for the marijuana initiative and hillary for president   newman said   being relentlessly attacked by the nra isn t something he needs for his personal ambition   backing a ballot initiative on a controversial topic like gun control will likely raise newsom s profile with voters  schnur said  but it could also backfire and alienate de leon   it doesn t do his campaign for governor a lot of good to be going up against the most powerful democrat in the legislature   schnur said  gun rights supporters say both men are being opportunistic   lieutenant governor gavin newsom is no stranger to trying to hijack high profile issues in order to get his name out there   said craig deluz  a lobbyist for the calgun foundation   and senate pro tem de leon doesn t want the lieutenant governor to steal his thunder
