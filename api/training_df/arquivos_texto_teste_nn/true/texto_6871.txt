washington new york  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump urged the government on tuesday to cancel an order with boeing co for a revamped air force one   one of the most prominent symbols of the u s  presidency   saying costs were out of control  it was the latest example of trump using his podium  often via twitter messages  to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in washington  trump  who takes office on jan    took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages   boeing is building a brand new  air force one for future presidents  but costs are out of control  more than   billion  cancel order   trump said on twitter  it was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint  trump  who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit american taxpayers  then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of trump tower in new york  where he amplified his comments   the plane is totally out of control  i think it s ridiculous  i think boeing is doing a little bit of a number  we want boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money   he told reporters  boeing  which has built planes for u s  presidents since   has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current air force one planes  which are scheduled to be in service by   boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the  proposed replacements    we are currently under contract for   million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the united states   the company said in a statement  boeing chief executive dennis muilenburg called trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue  sources familiar with the conversation told reuters  muilenburg told trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the u s  air force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute  the sources said  the air force  which operates the presidential planes  announced in january  that boeing s   would be used to replace the two current presidential planes  the planes can fly direct from washington to hong kong    miles    km  farther than the current air force one  they are designed to be an airborne white house able to fly in worst case security scenarios  such as nuclear war  president barack obama  who flew on the aging air force one to tampa  florida  on tuesday  has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency  his spokesman  josh earnest  told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were  rather complicated  and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts  the budgeted costs for the replacement program are    billion for the fiscal years  through   just on research and development  testing and evaluation  according to budget documents seen by reuters  the current air force plan envisions extensive modifications to a boeing   plane  adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self defense system   of course it s not like buying a vanilla boeing jumbo jet   said defense consultant loren thompson  who has close ties to boeing and other companies  a march  report from the government accountability office  the investigative arm of congress  estimated the cost of the overall program at    billion  including the purchase of two aircraft  but the gao estimated the costs for research and development would be lower  at just under   billion  if the gao report used the same air force estimate for research and development  then its estimate would be around   billion   boeing shares dipped after trump s tweet but closed up   percent at     trump s broadside against boeing comes as washington s business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride   a new york real estate developer  trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign  saying that they often harmed ordinary americans by sending jobs abroad  since winning the nov   election  he has taken credit for pushing united technologies corp and ford motor co to backtrack on outsourcing plans  trump s attack on boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the aerospace industries association  where the group s chief executive  dave melcher  urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high paying manufacturing jobs that the   billion a year sector offers   industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of u s  weapons   but in the short term  his tweets and comments on boeing put defense contractors on notice   the chilling effect on industry is huge  if you are a contractor   said franklin turner  a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm mccarter   english  boeing relies on the u s  military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense  space and security business which is worth   billion a year  the company clashed during the past year with republicans in congress over the export import bank  a federal program boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers  boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the trans pacific partnership trade deal with asia  which trump opposed
