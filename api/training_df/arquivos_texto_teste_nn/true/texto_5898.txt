beirut  reuters    mixed messages from washington have left syrian christians confused about the effect of u s  restrictions on refugees and travelers from several muslim majority countries  with some seeing hope fading away  u s  president donald trump signed an executive order on friday that put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other countries  the order also seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution  a move trump separately said was aimed at helping christians in syria to leave  but hopes were dashed for at least one syrian christian orthodox family  who were turned away at philadelphia international airport and had to return to lebanon  christians in damascus  where syria s conflict is still felt as fighting rages through much of the country  said pledges to prioritize minorities made little difference to them   getting u s  visas has been the dream of all citizens in developing countries  no matter their religion   said youssef touma    attending a church service in damascus on sunday   syrians of all faiths were used to queueing at the u s  embassy s gates  to try to get visas   but it was almost impossible to get them  and has been harder since the war started   what i heard is that there will be exceptions for christians from the ban  but not the easing of christians  travel   so that means there are still the same difficulties getting a visa   touma said  norma  a  year old it worker at the same church who declined to give her surname  said travel to the united states was a distant and impracticable dream   i don t know or have anyone in the u s  if there was someone i knew  an aunt or uncle  then i d think about going myself  of course  and it would be better to undertake a safe journey to america instead of a risky one by boat to get to germany   she said  syrians in neighboring countries like lebanon and turkey have said they will primarily seek refuge in europe  where some countries like germany have taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees  many have made dangerous crossings by boat from turkey  christians wishing to leave syria said the u s  preference for religious minorities could play into the hands of islamist extremists  at the very least  it would have no real impact   i think  islamist  extremists here would love for us to leave  to be rid of us   said damascus resident joseph memari  reached by phone  trump wrote on his twitter account on sunday   christians in the middle east have been executed in large numbers  we cannot allow this horror to continue   touma said statements made no difference   minorities are always targeted by extremists and trump s statements will not increase or decrease that   he said   they have been targeted since before trump became president  the christians of maaloula  near damascus  left the country before trump was even considering the presidency   christians of the damascus countryside  like harasta and douma  were forced to leave their homes five years ago   he said
