washington  reuters    a co author of u s  president elect donald trump s tax plan called on congress wednesday to pursue corporate tax reform as a bipartisan  jobs  bill that could finance a massive new infrastructure program while slashing business tax rates  stephen moore  a heritage foundation fellow who advised the trump campaign  said he would recommend that trump pursue tax reform along two tracks  by focusing on business taxes in his first  days and leaving the politically more challenging task of reforming individual taxes for later  trump and republicans in congress are trying to hammer out a legislative agenda on tax reform  moore  at a forum hosted by politico  called for a plan that would attract democratic support  suggesting an outcome that could deviate markedly from the house of representatives blueprint promoted by speaker paul ryan  a republican  trump s proposal would reduce the official corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  allow corporations to repatriate overseas profits at a  percent rate and reduce the top individual tax rate to  percent from   percent    moore estimated that the cuts would lead to a revenue loss of about   trillion over  years  for which trump would compensate with spending cuts  but he said it would broaden the tax base by adding  percent of growth to the u s  economy     that s the plan  try to pass a tax cut     and then make up the difference by cutting government spending   he said  but some analysts warn of a bigger toll  the nonpartisan tax policy center forecasts that the trump plan would cause the federal debt to soar by   trillion over its first decade  including added interest costs and macroeconomic effects  trump and congress would be able to sell the legislation as a job creation bill by linking corporate tax reform to infrastructure spending  moore said  the combination would also increase the chances of gaining support from democrats  who have favored such a link   i would label this a jobs bill   moore said  moore estimated that taxing repatriated overseas corporate profits could raise   billion to   billion for infrastructure spending  u s  corporations are estimated to have    trillion in profits stashed overseas  he spoke to house republican whip steve scalise and other lawmakers on tuesday about using reform to fund infrastructure    the disagreements  i think  on the republican side of the aisle  are very easily reconcilable   he said
