washington  reuters    president barack obama seemed to inch a little closer on tuesday to endorsing former secretary of state hillary clinton s presidential bid  during remarks at a museum dedicated to highlighting the fight for women s equality  the president  who has made clear his admiration for his one time rival but has not officially endorsed her  said he hoped one day people would be amazed that the united states had not had a female commander in chief   i want young girls and boys to come here       years from now to know that women fought for equality  it was not just given to them   obama said of the museum   i want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the board room or in congress  that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the oval office   clinton is running against u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont to be the democratic party s  presidential candidate  she lost the  race to obama  who was then a u s  senator and who later made her the nation s top diplomat in his administration  obama  perhaps realizing that people would read his remarks as a hint of support for clinton  tempered them by saying he did not know when a woman would win the white house   i don t know how long it ll take to get there  but i know we re getting closer to that day because of the work of generations of active  committed citizens   he said  white house spokesman josh earnest said obama s remarks indicated the country was ready for a woman president  but he stressed the candidates would be judged on their values and policy agenda  obama remains hugely popular with the base of democratic supporters who helped propel him to the white house and re elect him in   an endorsement of clinton could help her vanquish sanders  who is behind the former first lady in amassing the number of delegates needed to become the nominee but has remained a strong challenger with wins in a number of state nominating contests
