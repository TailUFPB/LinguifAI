munich  reuters    u s  vice president mike pence on saturday brought a message of support for europe from donald trump  but failed to wholly reassure allies worried about the new president s stance on russia and the european union  in pence s first major foreign policy address for the trump administration  he told european leaders that he spoke for trump when he promised  unwavering  commitment to the nato alliance    today  on behalf of president trump  i bring you this assurance  the united states of america strongly supports nato and will be unwavering in our commitment to this transatlantic alliance   pence told the munich security conference  offering  greetings  from the president  but he also repeated u s  calls for more defense spending in return   as you keep faith with us  under president trump we will always keep faith with you   while poland s defense minister praised pence  many others  including france s foreign minister and u s  lawmakers in munich  remained skeptical that he had convinced his allies that trump would stand by europe    trump s contradictory remarks on the value of the north atlantic treaty organisation  scepticism over the  deal to curb iran s nuclear ambitions and an apparent disregard for the future of the european union have left europe fearful for the seven decade old u s  guardianship of the west  after pence spoke  former nato deputy secretary general alexander vershbow  who is american  summed up the mood  telling reuters   many in this hall are still asking if this is the real policy   pence  whose meeting with german chancellor angela merkel was described by german aides as  very friendly   also marked out a divide on iran  which the european union sees as a business opportunity following the nuclear deal   pence called tehran  the leading state sponsor of terrorism   language never used by european officials  pence s strident vow to consign islamist militants  to the ash heap of history  also raised eyebrows  european officials said  u s  homeland security secretary john kelly defended trump s directive suspending travel to the united states by citizens of seven mostly muslim countries  since blocked by u s judges  which was condemned by eu governments  kelly said he would produce a  tighter  more streamlined version  soon  saying   we need to find ways to vet in a more reliable way to satisfy us that people coming to the united states are coming for the right reasons    french foreign minister jean marc ayrault expressed  disappointment that pence s speech did not mention the european union  although the vice president will take his message to eu headquarters in brussels on monday   i hope that we will have a clear response  in brussels      because donald trump has said he was overjoyed by the brexit and that there would be others   ayrault said  referring to britain s decision to leave the european union  u s  senator chris murphy  a member of the opposition democrats  said he welcomed pence s address but saw two rival governments emerging from the trump administration   pence  trump s defense secretary jim mattis and his foreign minister rex tillerson all delivered messages of reassurance on their debut trip to europe  but events in washington  including a news conference in which trump branded accredited white house reporters  dishonest people   sowed more confusion   i like a lot of what i heard from vice president pence   murphy told reuters   it s just hard to square that speech with everything donald trump is doing and saying   citing an assault on the free press  the resignation of trump s security adviser michael flynn over his contacts with russia on the eve of the u s  charm offensive in europe also tarnished the message pence  mattis and tillerson were seeking to send  officials told reuters  u s  republican senator john mccain  a trump critic  told the conference on friday that the new president s team was  in disarray   the united states is europe s biggest trading partner  the biggest foreign investor in the continent and the european union s partner in almost all foreign policy  as well as the main promoter of european unity for more than  years  pence  citing a trip to cold war era west berlin in his youth  said trump would uphold the post world war two order   this is president trump s promise  we will stand with europe today and every day  because we are bound together by the same noble ideals   freedom  democracy  justice and the rule of law   pence said  pence received little applause beyond the warm reception he got when he declared his support for nato  his warning that the  time has come to do more  on military spending was met with an awkward silence   the united states provides around  percent of the nato alliance s funds  european governments sharply cut defense spending after the fall of the soviet union but russia s resurgence as a military power and its seizure of ukraine s crimean peninsula has started to change that  baltic states and poland fear russia might try a repeat of crimea elsewhere  europe believes moscow is seeking to destabilize governments and influence elections with cyber attacks and fake news  an accusation denied at the conference by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov   pence s tough line on russia  calling on moscow to honor the international peace accords that seek to end the conflict in eastern ukraine  were welcomed by polish defence minister antoni macierewicz  lavrov said after a meeting with his french  german and ukrainian counterparts that there would be a new ceasefire from feb     know this  the united states will continue to hold russia accountable  even as we search for new common ground  which as you know  president trump believes can be found   pence said
