washington  reuters    a proposal by a u s  senate committee to cancel the defense department position of acquisition chief could lead to an increase in costs  u s  defense secretary ash carter said on tuesday  the senate armed services committee s version of the national defense authorization act aims to cancel the position of under secretary of defense for acquisition  technology and logistics because it slows innovation   the committee is proposing to divide the responsibilities between a new office in the pentagon that deals with research and another which would address business management  if the acquisition chief position  currently held by frank kendall  was cut  it would separate research and engineering from manufacturing and could derail progress made on lowering growth in contract costs over the last three decades  carter said at the sea air space conference   separating these functions makes no sense  as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development   carter said  the proposal still has to take a number of steps before it becomes law  the senate version of the defense bill must be reconciled with the house s version before being voted on in both chambers  if passed  that version would be sent to the white house for president barack obama s signature  or veto      on monday  the white house said it would veto the house s version of the bill because it would shift   billion of wartime overseas contingency operations  or oco  funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs
