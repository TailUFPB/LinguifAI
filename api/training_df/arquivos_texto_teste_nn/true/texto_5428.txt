washington  reuters    israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu asked u s  president donald trump on wednesday to recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights  territory israel seized from syria in the  middle east war  most of the world considers the golan  a high plateau  between northeastern israel and southwestern syria  to be occupied by israel  which annexed the territory in  in a move not recognized internationally  during a briefing with israeli and foreign media after meeting trump at the white house  netanyahu was asked whether he had raised the golan issue   yes   he replied   asked how the u s  president had responded  he said   i wouldn t say that he was surprised by my request   netanyahu did not elaborate  israel made a similar request to the obama administration in   but it was rejected  diplomats said at the time  while israel has long coveted sovereignty in the golan  it is unclear whether the white house would take such a step now  given that it could further complicate the syrian conflict  if the united states were to recognize israel s claim  it would likely anger syrian president bashar al assad  who is backed by russia and iran in his war with islamist militants and rebel groups  the trump administration has talked about working more closely with russia to end the syrian conflict  recognizing israel s sovereignty in the golan could undermine those efforts  it could also spur iran and its proxies in syria  particularly the lebanese shi ite militia hezbollah  to turn more of their focus against israel  targeting its forces stationed across the golan heights  israel has warned hezbollah  with which it fought a six week war in   against attacking its territory  it has carried out occasional air strikes in the syrian portion of the golan to target hezbollah fighters  including units smuggling arms   israel s argument for sovereignty over the territory is based partly on the fact that syria has splintered over the past five years of fighting  to the extent that israel says there is no one to whom it could hand back the golan  but with the united states and israel looking to forge an ever tighter relationship  it is also possible that trump  who has shown himself to be unpredictable at times  could decide to recognize israel s sovereignty  as well as around   israeli settlers in the territory  many of them working in agriculture  there are about   druze of syrian citizenship  many of whom have relatives living in just across the valley in syria
