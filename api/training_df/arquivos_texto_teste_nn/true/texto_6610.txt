raleigh  n c   reuters    north carolina s republican controlled legislature on wednesday rejected a bid to repeal a state law restricting bathroom access for transgender people  which has drawn months of protests and boycotts by opponents decrying the measure as discriminatory  a one day special legislative session ended abruptly after the state senate voted against abolishing a law that has made north carolina the latest u s  battleground over lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  rights  the repeal legislation was rejected    leaving the bathroom restrictions in place statewide  the rejection followed republican led political maneuvering that tied repeal to a second provision that would have temporarily banned cities from affirming transgender bathroom rights  democratic senator jeff jackson said the repeal effort failed because republicans reneged on their deal to bring the measure to a floor vote with no strings attached  the moratorium on municipal bathroom regulations  described by jackson as a  poison pill   withered democratic support  and in the end all  senate democrats joined  republicans in voting against repeal  another  republicans voted for it  the senate then adjourned without acting on the temporary municipal ban  the state s house of representatives had already called it quits  democratic governor elect roy cooper accused republican leaders of back peddling on an agreement ironed out in lengthy negotiations  he said both chambers had the votes for a full repeal  but divisions within the republican party killed it   the republican legislative leaders have broken their word to me  and they have broken their trust with the people of north carolina   he said  senate republican leader phil berger earlier defended the proposal to link repeal with temporary municipal restrictions as a genuine attempt at compromise  citing  the passion and disagreement surrounding this issue   after the vote  outgoing republican governor pat mccrory blamed  well funded left wing interest groups  that he said  sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes   earlier in the week  mccrory had called the special session to consider scrapping the law  which passed in march and made north carolina the first state to bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity  supporters of the statute  known as house bill   hb    have cited traditional values and a need for public safety  while opponents called it mean spirited  unnecessary and a violation of civil liberties  the national backlash was swift and fierce  leading to boycotts that have been blamed for millions of dollars in economic losses for the state as events  such as business conferences and the national basketball association s  all star game  were moved out of north carolina  the pushback contributed to mccrory s razor thin defeat in a fall re election bid against cooper  an opponent of the law   hb  was enacted largely in response to a local measure in charlotte that protected the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms of their choice  the charlotte city council on monday repealed its ordinance as a prelude to the state repealing hb   civil liberties and lgbt rights groups condemned the outcome  accusing the legislature of breaking its promise to do away with hb    it is a shame that north carolina s general assembly is refusing to clean up the mess they made   said james esseks  an american civil liberties union executive   the north carolina values coalition hailed the legislature for upholding the law and refusing to give in to  demands of greedy businesses  immoral sports organizations or angry mobs
