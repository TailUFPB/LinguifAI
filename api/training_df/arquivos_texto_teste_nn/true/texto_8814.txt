warsaw  reuters    president barack obama pledged on saturday to seek ways to calm racial tensions and reduce divisions between police and minorities during his final months in office  but he warned that easy access to guns nationwide exacerbated the problem  obama spoke at the end of a week in which five policemen were killed by a sniper in dallas and two black men were killed by police in minnesota and louisiana  he said he would bring together civil rights and law enforcement leaders for talks at the white house next week after returning from a trip to europe  obama  the first black u s  president  has spoken out on racial issues throughout his time in the white house  he has also tried but failed to reform american gun laws  stymied by republicans in congress who have opposed any measures that they seen as impinging on the constitutional right to bear arms  despite a series of mass shootings in recent years  obama said the dallas police force reduced murder rates and community complaints by taking the issue of race and police conduct seriously  and said he hoped that would inspire  constructive actions  in the coming weeks   that s the spirit that we all need to embrace  that s the spirit that i want to build on   he said during a press conference in poland  but the divisive issue of gun control could not be separated from the tension between police and local citizens  he said    obama noted that dallas police on thursday had to protect themselves and citizens from sniper fire while deciphering who had guns among those taking part in a protest decrying police shootings of black men  the presence of a gun in the car where philando castile    was killed by police in minnesota on wednesday contributed to that event  he said   in minneapolis  we don t know yet what happened  but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed  but it caused  in some fashion  those tragic events   obama told reporters    we can t just ignore that and pretend that that s somehow political     it is a contributing factor   not the sole factor   but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve   obama is very unlikely to succeed in reviving major gun control reform before he leaves office in january  lawmakers in congress have fought over three rival gun measures since the june  mass shootings at a gay nightclub in orlando  democrats promised to put pressure on republicans next week to win votes for measures to expand background checks and allow the justice department to block gun sales to people on government watch lists  obama said on saturday he hoped his legacy on the issue of race would be one of urging americans to listen to each other and understand the country s difficult relationship with race   the legacy of slavery and jim crow and discrimination didn t suddenly vanish with the passage of the civil rights act or the voting rights act or the election of barack obama   he said  he said he hoped his words as president had conveyed  that things have gotten better  substantially better  but that we ve still got a lot more work to do
