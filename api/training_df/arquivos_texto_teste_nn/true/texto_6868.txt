tampa  fla   reuters    president barack obama on tuesday warned that the united states would not be able to wipe out terrorism with military might as he offered a sweeping defense of his administration s national security record  in his final major speech on counterterrorism as president  obama argued that his administration had been able to make al qaeda  a shadow of its former self  and had put islamic state on its heels  but said terrorism would remain a threat to the united states   rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat and we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained   obama said during a speech at macdill air force base in tampa  florida  obama will turn over the white house on jan   to republican president elect donald trump who has been sharply critical of his administration s approach to fighting terrorism   trump referred to obama and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton as the  co founders  of islamic state during the presidential campaign  blaming them for the initial spread of the militant group  the white house said obama s national security speech had been planned long before the nov   election and was not aimed specifically at the incoming trump administration  but during his speech  obama spoke of the importance of adhering to american laws and values and against reinstating the use of waterboarding or imposing a religious test on immigrants  two positions that trump has supported in the past   the whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing who we are and our democracy   obama said  obama signed an executive order after taking office in january  that banned waterboarding and other  enhanced interrogation techniques  or eits  such executive orders can be rescinded by a president s successors  many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding  an interrogation technique that simulates drowning  as torture  while trump is now calling for  extreme vetting  of certain refugees admitted to the united states  during the campaign he proposed banning foreign born muslims from entering the country  obama came into office planning to unwind u s  wars in iraq and afghanistan and promising to focus on fighting militant groups that threatened the united states wherever they were  instead  he has been forced to return some u s  troops to iraq and keep thousands in place in afghanistan after more than    years of war  obama said his administration s approach of providing support to local partners and not undertaking massive ground invasions has been effective and is making progress in the fight to take mosul in iraq from islamic state  some counterterrorism experts have pointed to the rise of islamic state as an example of obama being too slow to respond to an emerging threat   while the united states has been successful in killing some key militant leaders  obama s  legacy has been tarnished by the way terrorist groups have regenerated and strengthened in the latter parts of his presidency   said robin simcox  a fellow at the heritage foundation
