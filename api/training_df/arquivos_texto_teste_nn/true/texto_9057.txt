washington  reuters    the u s  senate on monday rejected four measures restricting gun sales after last week s massacre in an orlando nightclub  dealing a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through congress despite repeated mass shootings  a group of senators was still hoping to forge a compromise for later in the week aimed at keeping firearms away from people on terrorism watch lists  although that effort faced an uphill battle with critics in both parties skeptical about its chances  last week s massacre  the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history  had intensified pressure on lawmakers  who moved swiftly to take the issue to the senate floor  but the gun control measures lost in largely party line votes that showed the lingering political power in congress of gun rights defenders and the national rifle association  republicans and their allies in the nra gun lobby said the democratic bills were too restrictive and trampled on the constitutional right to bear arms  democrats attacked the republicans  two proposals as too weak and accused them of being in the thrall of the nra   what am i going to tell the community of orlando   asked democratic senator bill nelson of florida after the votes   sadly  what i m going to tell them is the nra won again   chris cox  executive director of the national rifle association institute for legislative action  attacked the democrats  amendments and thanked republicans for rejecting them   today  the american people witnessed an embarrassing display in the united states   he said  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a kentucky republican  said the democratic measures were ineffective and republican senators  are pursuing real solutions that can help keep americans safer from the threat of terrorism   as the parties remain largely locked in their positions   polls show americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than  million weapons  about one for every citizen   the issue is already a prominent one for voters in november elections  presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton supports new gun restrictions  while republican donald trump expressed a willingness to talk to the nra about the issue  after the votes  clinton issued a one word statement   enough   it was followed by the names and ages of the dead in orlando  gun control efforts failed after mass shootings at an elementary school in newtown  connecticut  in  and a conference center in san bernardino  california  in   but some senators see resistance to gun restrictions softening as national security looms larger in the debate  the orlando gunman  omar mateen  pledged allegiance to the militant group islamic state as he killed  people in a gay nightclub    this country is under attack     it s not a plane or an explosive device  it s an assault weapon   said connecticut senator chris murphy  a democrat who led a  hour filibuster last week to draw attention to the effort to restrict guns  murphy walked off the floor after the senate votes and embraced erica smegielski  the daughter of dawn hochsprung  a sandy hook principal killed during the newtown shooting   he said  the good thing about me and you is we re young  we ll be at this a long time   said smegielski    a reuters ipsos poll conducted last week found that  percent of americans favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on gun sales  that compared with  percent in late  and late   senior senate aides left open the possibility of other votes later in the week on unspecified gun control proposals  some republicans pinned hopes on a proposal by senator susan collins  a maine republican  which was not one of the four bills being considered on monday  collins  plan would restrict gun purchases to a narrow group of suspects  including those on a  no fly  list or a  selectee  list of people who require additional screening at airports   but democratic aides said people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban under collins  bill  and a republican aide indicated it would not do enough to protect the constitutional rights of gun buyers  even if the senate approved a gun compromise  it would also have to be passed by the more conservative  republican majority house of representatives  house republican leadership aides did not comment on the possibility that any bills proposing gun restrictions would be considered on the house floor this week  on monday  all four of the measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists   two put forth by democrats and two by republicans   fell short of the  votes needed for passage in the  member chamber  gun control advocates expressed disappointment after the vote and vowed to take revenge on lawmakers at the ballot box in november   shame on every single senator who voted against these life saving amendments and protected the rights of terrorists and other dangerous people to buy guns   said dan gross  president of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence   the brady campaign will expose these politicians for who they really are and call out their failure to disarm hate in america
