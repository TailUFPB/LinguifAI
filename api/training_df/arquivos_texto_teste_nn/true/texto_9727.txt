washington  reuters    as donald trump moves closer to clinching the republican presidential nomination  he has offered lavish praise for bernie sanders  who faces increasingly slim chances in his battle with hillary clinton in the democratic race  trump has begun calling for sanders to run as an independent if he does not win the democratic nomination and said he may borrow talking points from sanders  speeches criticizing clinton to use in a possible matchup with the former secretary of state in the nov   general election   he said some things about her that were so incredible   incredible   and so incredibly bad   trump said on tuesday after sweeping five northeastern primaries  adding sanders had  been telling the truth   yet data and interviews with sanders supporters suggest that winning over large numbers of them may be difficult for the new york billionaire businessman   even though trump    and sanders    a u s  senator from vermont  emphasize some common themes such as criticism of wall street and international trade agreements  there is only limited crossover appeal between the two candidates  according to reuters ipsos data   among voters who back trump  just  percent said sanders would be their second choice if trump were not in the race  only slightly higher than the  percent who said clinton would be their next pick  sanders supporters were even less willing than trump backers to consider crossing over  just  percent of sanders supporters said they would vote for trump as their second choice  roughly the same as the portion of voters who listed trump s republican rivals ted cruz and john kasich as their second choice   sanders supporter joseph hayes    of oregon  still has hope for his candidate  but if it comes down to trump or clinton  hayes said it was an easy  if unpleasant  choice   i would have to vote for hillary  reluctantly so  but i would   he said  people who outwardly back both sanders and trump are even more of a rarity  donor rolls show just over two dozen voters willing to support both trump and sanders financially   i think bernie sanders is too poor to be bought  and i think donald trump is too rich to be bought by special interests   said royce gourley  a real estate investor  who gave    to sanders and    to trump  federal election commission filings show   but trump could find an opening as both he and sanders have gained strong followings among voters looking for an outsider candidate who will shake up the washington establishment   both have made significant inroads among laborers and union members who support their opposition to u s  trade agreements  including the trans pacific partnership  which critics say threaten u s  jobs   but the two are far apart on many issues  especially immigration  trump has proposed building a wall on the u s  border with mexico and has proposed a temporary ban on muslims seeking to enter the country   sanders has called such proposals  crap  and often criticizes what he calls  inhumane  deportation programs   for sanders supporters like dave berry    of tacoma  washington  the wooing may pay off as voters weigh the decision to stick with their party or stir things up in washington    i will probably put a check in trump s column  in the general election    berry said of a possible trump clinton general election contest  he said he did not think the former reality tv star could win  but felt good about making clinton uneasy about her prospects of securing an easy win   one risk for clinton is sanders voters who may sit out the election or choose a third party candidate if their favorite is not on the ballot   valerie benson    of cleveland  said that if it came down to trump against clinton   i don t know that i would vote for anybody then
