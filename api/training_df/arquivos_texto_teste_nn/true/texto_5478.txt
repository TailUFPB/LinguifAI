new york  reuters    washington state s attorney general has promised to uncover  what truly motivated  president donald trump s executive order on immigration  an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a u s  president makes national security decisions   the presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries  but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by washington state   on thursday  the u s  court of appeals for the  circuit left the judge s ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either side s arguments  in its decision  the  circuit cited a previous case establishing that  circumstantial evidence of intent  including   statements by decisionmakers  may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose    the trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion   washington attorney general bob ferguson signaled on sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against muslims or islam  he also said he would also move to depose administration officials  legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters    the idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president   said john yoo  a former justice department lawyer in the george w  bush administration        it would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does   said yoo  now a professor at the university of california at berkeley school of law   trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in washington for his decision and a top white house aide on sunday accused the  circuit of a  judicial usurpation of power     the president s powers here are beyond question   senior policy adviser stephen miller told fox news sunday  u s  courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws  in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government  but on questions of racial or religious discrimination  they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined   in   for instance  the supreme court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in hialeah  florida  though neutral on its face  was actually intended to discriminate against a santeria church  which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite  stephen griffin  a professor of constitutional law at tulane university  said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of trump s executive order   motive is relevant   he said   one question in the current case is likely to be which  if any  of trump s statements should be admissible in examining the administration s motives in issuing the order    if you re allowed to use evidence from the campaign  the state s case is very strong   said  griffin  in december    days after a mass attack by an islamic state sympathizers in san bernardino  california  trump called for  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our representatives can figure out what is going on   he later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism  stanford university law school professor michael mcconnell  a former federal appeals judge  said the court should not consider campaign statements  because trump only swore an oath to uphold the constitution after he became president   in its complaint  washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the christian broadcasting network  saying he would prioritize christians in the middle east for admission as refugees    legal experts are divided on whether the state s lawyers should be allowed to question the president s advisers   and possibly even the president   in depositions  the white house could potentially claim executive privilege  which protects the president and other officials from subpoena  said thomas lee  an expert in constitutional law at fordham university   anna rose mathieson a partner with the california appellate law group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani  who told fox news the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal  david pressman  a partner at boies schiller flexner and former assistant secretary of homeland security in the obama administration  said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice   you don t want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy   said pressman  though in this case  pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear  opening the door to further questioning  the next steps in the case are not certain   the trump administration has said it is considering appealing the  circuit ruling to the supreme court  and the  circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges  the president has also said he might replace the order with  a brand new  one  which could end the current legal action
