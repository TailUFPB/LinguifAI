new york  reuters    democratic front runner hillary clinton on wednesday will propose the creation of a new national office of immigrant affairs should she win the white house in november  as she seeks to woo minority and immigrant voters in new york less than a week before the state s primary  the office would coordinate policies and programs among federal agencies and with state and local governments  clinton said at an event in new york city where she met with immigrant rights activists   it s an issue that cuts across all levels of government   she said  she added that it would expand the efforts of president barack obama s task force on new americans  which was created in  to help immigrants and refugees integrate better into the united states  in contrast  republican candidates have largely proposed tougher immigration rules  republican front runner donald trump has called for building a wall along the border with mexico and a temporary ban on muslims entering the country  the new york primary on tuesday could either help former secretary of state clinton consolidate her status as the democratic front runner or hand a significant victory to rival bernie sanders  the vermont senator seeking to defy expectations and win the party s nomination for the nov   election  both candidates are campaigning across the state  looking to win over new york s diverse population  including voters from immigrant families  around  percent of the state s population is hispanic or latino  according to the u s  census  with  pledged delegates at stake  the state is among the most significant nominating contests left on the calendar before the democrats  july   convention in philadelphia  clinton holds a double digit lead in opinion polls over sanders in new york  the state where he was born and which she served for eight years as a u s  senator  she also holds a commanding lead in pledged delegates overall so far  leaving sanders only a narrow path if he is to win the nomination out from under her  a task some pundits say is already beyond him  a democratic candidate needs   delegates to clinch the nomination  those can come from any combination of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses  as well as so called superdelegates  who can vote as they choose
