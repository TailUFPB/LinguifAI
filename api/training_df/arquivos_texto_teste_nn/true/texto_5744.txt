 washington san francisco  reuters    the trump administration wants to revamp and rename a u s  government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on islamist extremism  five people briefed on the matter told reuters   the program   countering violent extremism   or cve  would be changed to  countering islamic extremism  or  countering radical islamic extremism   the sources said  and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the united states   more for hardline west bank settlers  jared kushner s their man iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as trump talks tough republicans wrestle with effort to cut obamacare such a change would reflect trump s election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former president barack obama for being weak in the fight against islamic state and for refusing to use the phrase  radical islam  in describing it  islamic state has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries   the cve program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as google  googl o  and facebook  fb o    some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration  particularly after trump issued an executive order last friday temporarily blocking travel to the united states from seven predominantly muslim countries   watch uber ceo quits trump advisory board still  the cve program  which focuses on u s  residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online  has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective   a source who has worked closely with the department of homeland security  dhs  on the program said trump transition team members first met with a cve task force in december and floated the idea of changing the name and focus    in a meeting last thursday attended by senior staff for dhs secretary john kelly  government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of cve program grants  said the source  who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions   although cve funding has been appropriated by congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the obama administration  the money still may not go out the door  the source said  adding that kelly is reviewing the matter   the department declined comment  the white house did not respond to a request for comment   some republicans in congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective  asserting that singling out and using the term  radical islam  as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts   others counter that branding the problem as  radical islam  would only serve to alienate more than three million americans who practice islam peacefully   many community groups  meanwhile  had already been cautious about the program  partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement   hoda hawa  director of policy for the muslim public affairs council  said she was told last week by people within dhs that there was a push to refocus the cve effort from tackling all violent ideology to only islamist extremism    that is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion   she said   another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a dhs official that a name change would take place  three other sources  speaking on condition of anonymity  said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized   the obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort  in   congress appropriated   million in grants for cve efforts and dhs awarded the first round of grants on jan    a week before trump was inaugurated   among those approved were local governments  city police departments  universities and non profit organizations  in addition to organizations dedicated to combating islamic state s recruitment in the united states  grants also went to life after hate  which rehabilitates former neo nazis and other domestic extremists   just in the past two years  authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacist s shooting rampage inside a historic african american church in charleston  south carolina and islamist militants for shootings and bombings in california  florida and new york   one grant recipient  leaders advancing   helping communities  a michigan based group led by lebanese americans  has declined a    dhs grant it had sought  according to an email the group sent that was seen by reuters  a representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment     given the current political climate and cause for concern  lahc has chosen to decline the award   said the email  which was sent last thursday  a day before trump issued his immigration order  which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against muslims while the white house said it was to  to protect the american people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals
