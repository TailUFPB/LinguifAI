los angeles washington reuters    the  states challenging obama s clean power plan in court say the lower emissions levels it would impose are an undue burden  but most are likely to hit them anyway  already  arkansas  north carolina  oklahoma and south dakota appear to be meeting the cpp s early targets  and changes in the power market  along with policies favoring clean generation  are propelling most of the rest toward timely compliance  according to researchers  power producers and officials  as well as government filings reviewed by reuters   we are seeing reductions earlier than we ever expected   u s  environmental protection agency administrator gina mccarthy said in an interview   it s a great sign that the market has already shifted and people are invested in the newer technologies  even while we are in litigation   states engaged in the legal battle that is set for an appellate court hearing later this month say their concerns go beyond whether they can meet the mandate  the states  most of them led by republican governors  say they object to what they view as federal overreach by obama and the democrats and want to maintain flexibility to make energy decisions at the state level that reflect changing market conditions  cynthia coffman  attorney general of colorado  said her state s likely ability to comply with the cpp s mandate  truly is not the issue    we don t have anything against clean air   coffman said   that really doesn t factor into my decision to say the federal government has gone beyond its legal authority   oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt said that he sees the clean power plan as a form of federal  coercion and commandeering  of energy policy and that the state should have  sovereignty to make decisions for its own markets   the obama administration finalized the clean power plan in  as a central part of meeting u s  obligations under the paris climate agreement  in february  the u s  supreme court stayed implementation of the rule pending resolution of the states  litigation  later this month  a panel of the d c  circuit court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case  the cpp sets carbon reduction goals for each state  but allows states to decide how to meet them  during the early years of implementation  the goals are guidelines intended to put states on track to meet the final deadline of   if a state fails to submit a plan to the epa by interim deadlines  the agency can impose its own plan on that state s power producers  failure to comply by  could open a state up to administrative penalties and lawsuits  to be sure  some states fighting the mandate would have to drastically change course to meet it  west virginia  which is leading the legal challenge with texas  still relies largely on carbon spewing  coal fired power  and wisconsin  north dakota  montana and wyoming have large gaps between their current emissions and the plan s mandates  but  in a reflection of how rapidly the power market is shifting  the u s  government s energy information administration earlier this year reduced its forecast for  power plant carbon emissions by nearly  percent  without factoring in reductions that may be generated by the clean power plan  the projection for the nation as a whole would be nearly two thirds of the cpp s target by   even if the law never takes effect  a  analysis by consulting firm m j  bradley   associates for the environmental defense fund found that  of the  states suing to block the clean power plan are on track to meet its  targets with existing plants and planned investments  eighteen states are on track to hit the  targets with no changes to current plans  according to the bradley analysis  which was filed with the court as part of an amicus brief from the environmental defense fund in support of the government  and the outlook has improved for some states since the bradley forecast  it didn t expect arkansas  for example  to meet the  target  but in   after shifting significant energy generation from coal to natural gas  the state reported power plant emissions for the year that were below the  requirement  some of the states contesting the rules say they object to strict timelines   the cpp is very dramatic in the speed at which it would require things to happen   said chris nelson  chairman of the south dakota public utilities commission   if you let the market play out  those things take care of themselves   texas also has protested the cpp s timetable  saying it would require the construction of transmission lines that could raise costs for consumers  but the state already has moved heavily into wind and solar in recent years  and is nearing its  goals  john hall  texas director for edf and a former environmental regulator for the state  said texas could profit from the rule  noting the state ranks at the top of the list of wind energy producers and is making big moves into solar   the cpp would enable texas to make money by exporting wind and solar electricity   he said  states that export coal or gas fired power  on the other hand  are concerned about their ability to keep doing so   it is very important that we don t get caught in the fray of an epa energy policy that dictates what we do as an exporting state   said stuart spencer  arkansas department of environmental quality associate director  whatever happens in court  energy policy will remain a highly charged political issue  republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to the administration s attempts to curb carbon emissions   when i ran for office  i promised i would do everything in my power to protect coal miners  jobs   said west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey in a statement to reuters   i have followed through on that promise
