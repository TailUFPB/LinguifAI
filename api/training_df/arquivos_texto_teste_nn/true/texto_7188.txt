 reuters    u s  president elect donald trump has often boasted about the strict confidentiality pledges he exacts from his employees   now a legal challenge to one of those agreements is pending before a u s  agency over which he will soon have influence  potentially posing an early test of concerns about conflicts of interest between trump s public role and his business empire  in september  a worker advocacy group filed a charge with the national labor relations board  nlrb  claiming a nondisclosure contract used by trump is unlawfully broad  the contract prohibits employees  independent contractors and even volunteers from ever disclosing any information that trump deems confidential about his personal  business or political life  the nlrb has said that sweeping or unclear contracts inhibit workers from discussing working conditions or speaking to union organizers   the five member nlrb currently has two vacancies that trump is slated to fill early in his term  likely tipping what has been a liberal leaning agency under president barack obama to a more business friendly posture  if the nlrb rules against trump  it could free up workers to be more vocal about their concerns and strengthen their bargaining power  in addition to the confidentiality case  there are about  other trump related cases pending at the nlrb  the cases involve alleged labor violations at the trump international hotel las vegas  where management has refused to bargain with the culinary workers union  it was not clear if the confidentiality contract was intended for workers on trump s election campaign or employees in his businesses  and reuters could not independently verify its authenticity  representatives of the trump organization did not respond to requests for comment  the case is at a very early stage and could be settled or dismissed before reaching a full hearing before the five member nlrb  the board s decisions may be appealed in a federal court  the nlrb is comprised of three members from the sitting president s party and two from the opposing party  a system that typically results in wide policy shifts between administrations  in addition to the current two vacancies  another will arise when a current member s term expires next december   under the obama administration  the nlrb has struck down  confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from organizing at t mobile usa inc  quicken loans  directtv and a number of other companies   government ethics experts and labor lawyers said that if trump s handpicked nlrb members uphold the contract  it could suggest favoritism    there is an appearance of bias and political pressure that could undermine the legitimacy of the agency   said richard painter  a professor at the university of minnesota law school who was the chief white house ethics lawyer under republican president george w  bush  the nlrb cases represent one of several areas where concerns may arise over potential conflicts of interest raised by trump s new role and his sprawling business interests  trump last week said he would allow his children to run his businesses while maintaining his ownership interest via a  blind trust   if the current cases are ruled upon by the nlrb  one possible solution to the potential conflict could be for trump appointees to recuse themselves from cases involving his business organization  said a former nlrb chairman  william gould   gould said that during his tenure at the agency  in the mid   members recused themselves from cases that raised any chance of a conflict  gould  who is now a professor at stanford law school  said he disqualified himself from cases involving a union of which his son was a member  several experts  however  said recusal would not be legally required unless trump s appointees represented him or his companies in the past or were otherwise involved in his business  the challenge to trump s confidentiality agreement was filed by david rosenfeld  a california labor lawyer  on behalf of the committee to preserve the religious right to organize  a worker advocacy group that he created   reuters reviewed a copy of the employment agreement that rosenfeld filed with his complaint  which targeted both the trump organization and the trump campaign  rosenfeld said he copied it from the campaign website  but that the agreement was no longer posted there   it was not clear how many employees signed this version of the agreement  and reuters was unable to find a copy on the website  the agreement prohibits disclosure of details about trump s  personal life  political affairs and or business affairs   as well as anything  mr  trump insists remain private or confidential   it forbids employees from publicly disparaging trump and his wife  children  grandchildren  siblings and other relatives  confidentiality agreements are common  but labor law experts said they can be unlawful if they are too broad or don t specify what types of information will be deemed confidential   trump defended a similar confidentiality agreement in a case earlier this year involving a former campaign aide  whom trump accused of giving information about other staffers to reporters  in a statement  the trump campaign said confidentiality agreements were  standard practice  for entities that need to safeguard sensitive information  the case settled for undisclosed terms
