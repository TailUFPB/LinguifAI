phoenix  reuters    sensing a potential turning point  republican presidential nominee donald trump mounted a furious effort on saturday to portray democrat hillary clinton as unfit to lead the country after the latest chapter in her email controversy unfolded as he tries to mount a comeback  with the nov   election only  days away  trump devoted much of his stump speech to try to take the maximum advantage of the fbi s disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clinton s use of a private email server  little is known about the extent and focus of the new fbi review  but trump was quick to declare his rival  guilty  at rallies in phoenix and in golden  colorado  declaring that she is symbolic of a type of public corruption that is a  grave threat to our democracy   trump charged that the justice department  populated by appointees of democratic president barack obama  is trying to help clinton  given news reports that top department officials did not want fbi director james comey to reveal his new review   when the outcome is fixed  when the system is rigged  people lose hope  they stop dreaming  they stop trying   trump said in phoenix   hillary clinton s corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped   clinton herself has repeatedly attacked trump as not fit to be president  the new uproar could not have come at a more opportune time for trump  who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a  audio tape in which he boasted about groping women and the emergence of a host of women who said he did just that to them  trump has narrowed the gap in public opinion polls between him and clinton nationally and in some battleground states where the election is likely to be decided  but most analyses of the polls show him facing a defeat  perhaps a landslide  if the election were to be held today   that made it essential for trump to try to change the subject from his own setbacks and focus on those of clinton  and give establishment republicans who have been reluctant to support him a reason to get behind him  and perhaps sway some undecided voters as well  still  the phoenix rally provided a reminder why some republicans cannot bring themselves to support trump  as a man there taunted reporters with a chant of  jew s  a   when the rest of the crowd was chanting  usa   trump s next couple of days on the campaign trail reflect a change in strategy with uncertain rewards  he is to campaign in albuquerque  new mexico  on sunday and in michigan on monday   two states that have voted democratic in recent presidential elections and appeared poised to do so again
