washington  reuters    personnel from the u s  justice department s civil rights division will be deployed to polling sites in  states to monitor tuesday s election  five more than it monitored in the  election  the department said on monday  most of those states will receive justice department staff who have no statutory authority to access polling sites as a result of a  supreme court decision that struck down parts of the voting rights act  curtailing the department s ability to deploy election observers with unfettered access to the polls  more than  justice department personnel will be deployed on tuesday  compared to more than  personnel the department dispatched during the  general election  a justice department spokesman declined to say how many of tuesday s personnel will be full access observers        tuesday s hotly contested election  including the presidential race pitting republican donald trump against democrat hillary clinton  will be the first in decades in which the justice department can only send full access observers to states where a federal court ruling has authorized it  on the campaign trail  trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities  numerous studies have found that u s  voter fraud is exceedingly rare    as always  our personnel will perform these duties impartially  with one goal in mind  to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides   said attorney general loretta lynch in a statement      courts have granted the justice department permission to deploy full access observers in five states  alaska  california  louisiana  new york  and alabama  but the court order for alabama only pertains to municipal elections and it is not on the list of states where the justice department is deploying poll watchers this year   the justice department staff who are deployed to the other  states on tuesday will be election  monitors   who must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations   in most cases  voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers   said vanita gupta  the head of the department s civil rights division  in a statement
