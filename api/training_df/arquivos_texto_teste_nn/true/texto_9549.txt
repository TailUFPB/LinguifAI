washington  reuters    the chairman of the republican national committee sought on friday to tamp down talk among some republicans about the possibility of running a third party candidate who would give party supporters a choice beyond donald trump  in an interview  rnc chairman reince priebus said a third party candidate would have no hope of actually winning the nov   presidential election but would instead ensure victory for the democratic nominee   they may as well jump off the top floor of a building because that s what we d be doing by having a third party   priebus said  priebus has been a vocal advocate for party loyalists to get over their concerns about trump and support him since he is on track to become the presidential nominee and stands as the only real option for republicans to win the white house  he brought trump together with house of representatives speaker paul ryan for a meeting in washington on thursday to try to ease ryan s concerns about backing the billionaire   ryan stopped short of endorsing trump but said the session was productive  priebus said the two men have opened a dialogue   my guess is they may even be talking today and through the weekend  on the phone    he said  priebus said a democratic victory would allow democrats to reshape the conservative majority on the supreme court  if republican donors sit on the sidelines  democrats could also take over control of the u s  senate  he said   if you don t participate in the presidential election you might as well kiss away the senate as well   priebus said in a message directed at republican donors unenthusiastic about trump   the senate goes as the presidential race goes  they re inextricably intertwined   some republicans continue to hold out hope that a leading figure in the party could be persuaded to run for president as a third party candidate to give party voters uncomfortable with trump a candidate to rally around  some speculation has centered around  nominee mitt romney  who has been a frequent critic of trump  just this week romney said trump should release his tax records  a public disclosure move that romney made in  but which trump has been resisting  some republicans have been urging romney to launch an independent bid for the presidency  he discussed the issue last week with william kristol  editor of the conservative leaning weekly standard magazine  a source close to romney said
