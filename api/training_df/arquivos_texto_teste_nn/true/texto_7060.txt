 reuters    david betras could see trouble coming  the democratic party chairman in youngstown  ohio  wrote to hillary clinton s advisers in may warning she needed to put a jobs focused message at the heart of her white house campaign or else watch blue collar voters in states like ohio  michigan and pennsylvania slip away to republican donald trump  clinton never responded to betras  and in the final weeks of her campaign she spent much of her time portraying trump as unfit  rather than highlighting her economic plans  on nov    election day  betras  warning proved prescient   she lost ohio and pennsylvania and  on wednesday  michigan  too  based on the latest unofficial ballot counts  the surprising upset by trump  a wealthy businessman who made his promises to renegotiate trade deals and restore jobs a centerpiece of his agenda  was fueled in part by support from white working class voters in those vital rust belt states and elsewhere  after the disastrous election losses at the state and national level  betras and other rust belt democrats who have found success in blue collar districts have some advice for their anxious party  the key to recapturing those voters is not a broad change in policy  but a new commitment to listen and act on their economic concerns  and to show democrats care   you can have all the great ideas on earth  but if they don t think you are on their side they aren t going to listen to you   said u s  representative dan kildee  of flint  michigan  one of a small cadre of democrats in congress who have learned how to win in working class districts by emphasizing economic solutions  democratic u s  representative matt cartwright  whose district around scranton  pennsylvania  was one of the presidential campaign s prime battlegrounds  also won re election to a third term with about  percent of the vote  about   trump voters crossed over to back him  he said in an interview   why would they pick me and not also hillary clinton  it comes down to credibility   he said   i know the pain out there  when i talk to voters  jobs is always my no   message  and i tell them exactly what i m doing to get more jobs back to the district   recalling the  presidential campaign theme of clinton s husband  bill clinton  cartwright added   it s the economy  stupid  these folks are working harder and harder to try and stay in the same place   the party s efforts to regain lost ground with blue collar voters could be a factor in next week s election for democratic leader in the house of representatives  tim ryan  whose northeast ohio district encompasses blue collar youngstown  is challenging veteran leader nancy pelosi of san francisco  ryan has emphasized his ability to talk to working class voters and said in announcing his leadership run that people  need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all   kildee  who was re elected to a third term with  percent of the vote  said democrats seeking lessons in the election rubble should not overreact and begin moderating their positions on social issues or shifting their stances to target elements of the party s base of support  from decimated industrial towns to inner cities or the rural plains  voters share a similar anxiety about an economic system that seems to have left them behind  he said     everybody is talking about the same thing  and it s economic uncertainty   it s the fear of not having a job  or their kids not getting a job  or not having a retirement   kildee said   if we aren t talking about jobs and the economy first  no one is listening when you talk about other issues    gold plated toilets  by tapping into those economic worries  trump captured about two thirds of whites with no college degree  exit polls showed  that helped him gain the razor thin margin of victory he needed in ohio  pennsylvania  wisconsin and michigan   all picked up by president barack obama in    to win the electoral college  despite losing the popular vote  in contrast to trump  whose rallies were a call to arms against an economic system rigged against everyday americans  clinton mentioned but rarely highlighted the many aspects of her economic agenda during the final weeks of the campaign   we were so off message that a billionaire with gold plated toilets was the guy who was breaking through and talking to blue collar families   said betras  party chairman in ohio s heavily democratic mahoning county  where trump captured  percent of the vote   percentage points better than republican mitt romney in   betras said many blue collar workers increasingly felt forgotten by the national party  which at times seemed more focused on social and cultural issues than on bread and butter economic concerns  the democratic national committee did not respond to questions about the party s efforts to win working class voters  betras had urged clinton in his memo to spend more time talking about ways to entice companies to repatriate manufacturing jobs  or her plans to create jobs through boosting infrastructure programs   both key elements of trump s stump speech  both candidates made frequent visits to pennsylvania and ohio  but after the party conventions in july clinton only traveled to michigan four times  twice in the last week of the campaign  and never visited wisconsin  trump hit both a half dozen times  david murray  a registered independent who lives just outside flint  michigan  said he voted to re elect kildee and backed obama in  and   but cast his presidential ballot for trump this time   i didn t feel like clinton really cared about us   said murray  a personal service industry worker   we are still hurting here  i feel as if we haven t recovered from the economic free fall  clinton seemed like just another four years of what obama has done for my area  which is four years of nothing   obama appeared to echo the concerns of betras and the two lawmakers in recent comments on the democratic post election hand wringing    the key for us   when i say  us   i mean americans  but i think particularly for progressives   is to say your concerns are real  your anxieties are real  here s how we fix them   obama said  trump consistently outperformed romney s  totals in areas with heavy concentrations of working class whites  in luzerne county  pennsylvania  partially in cartwright s district  trump won  percent of the vote compared to romney s  percent  in neighboring lackawana county  trump won  percent of the vote compared to romney s  percent  sharon taboada  a juvenile probation officer in houghton lake  michigan  with two sons in college  said she voted for trump in part because of his economic message   clinton talked very little about our economy and i feel she was way out of touch with the working force   she said
