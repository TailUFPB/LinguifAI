policy figures ahead of a possible senate fight over the oilman s ties to russia  the exxon chief executive potentially faces difficulties getting confirmed in the republican controlled senate  some lawmakers worry about his links to moscow and opposition to u s  sanctions on russia  which awarded him a friendship medal in       but several republican establishment figures  including former

have a slim majority when trump takes office on jan        the fact that condi rice  james baker and bob gates are recommending tillerson carries considerable weight   said republican senator jeff flake  a member of the senate foreign relations committee  by choosing tillerson  trump adds another person to his cabinet and circle of advisers who may favor a soft line toward moscow  which is under u s  sanctions for its  annexation of crimea and at the center of allegations that it launched cyber attacks to disrupt the u s  presidential election   republican foreign policy hawks in the senate like john mccain and lindsey graham are likely to give tillerson a rough time at a confirmation hearing in early january   it s very well known that he has a very close relationship with  russian president  vladimir putin   said mccain  the republican party s  nominee for president    republicans will have a majority of just   in the senate  and only a few defections from their ranks

the united states   exxon mobil said its board would meet soon regarding its transition  trump was also poised to add another figure with close ties to the oil industry to his cabinet  a source close
