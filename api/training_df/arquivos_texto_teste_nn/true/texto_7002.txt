new york  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump chose a former goldman sachs banker and a billionaire investor on tuesday to steer economic policy in his administration and a fierce obamacare critic to dismantle president barack obama s signature healthcare program   republican trump is expected to name steven mnuchin  a former goldman sachs partner and hollywood financier  as his nominee for treasury secretary  a source said  putting a wall street veteran in the top u s  economic cabinet post  mnuchin  who spent  years at goldman sachs before leaving in  to launch a hedge fund  served as trump s campaign finance chairman  billionaire investor wilbur ross  known for his investments in distressed industries  is expected to be named commerce secretary  a source said  the announcements could come as early as wednesday  the flurry of picks showed trump  a real estate tycoon with no governing experience  rewarding loyalists and established washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers  republican u s  representative tom price  an orthopedic surgeon from georgia  will be trump s health and human services   secretary  seema verma  the founder of a health policy consulting company  will lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services  which is part of health and human services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards  trump also announced his choice of elaine chao  labor secretary under president george w  bush  to serve as secretary of transportation  saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset  in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure   while trump made decisions on his economic team  he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat  he dined with former republican presidential candidate mitt romney  a one time critic and the  republican presidential nominee  at a french restaurant in new york on tuesday night  romney sharply criticized trump during the presidential campaign but he offered praise after their dinner   he continues with a message of inclusion  of bringing people together   romney told reporters  he said trump s cabinet choices so far and speech on election night were encouraging      trump cast price and verma as a  dream team  to help him once he takes office on jan   with his campaign pledge to repeal obamacare  the health law formally known as the affordable care act  it has been a target of republican attacks since its enactment in   price has characterized obamacare as  doing real harm to american families  and has co sponsored legislation to replace it  verma helped pence  the indiana governor  add conservative pieces to medicaid coverage for the state s poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts  she also worked on medicaid programs in iowa  ohio  kentucky and tennessee  chuck schumer  the incoming senate democratic leader  was among the defenders of obamacare who criticized price s selection   nominating congressman price to be the hhs secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house   schumer said   the  healthcare overhaul  aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more americans  triggered a long  bitter fight between the white house and congressional republicans  who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry  trump has said he will replace obamacare with a plan to give states more control over medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally  price and verma will both need senate confirmation  congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law  white house spokesman josh earnest defended obamacare on tuesday  saying it had expanded coverage to millions of americans  boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the medicare program for the elderly   we ll see if trump care measures up   he said  trump said after meeting obama following his nov   election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age  on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions  price  an early trump supporter in the u s  house of representatives who leads the budget committee  has proposed a plan that would create age based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own  house majority leader kevin mccarthy said on tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace obamacare would likely have much in common with price s ideas  price s plan would also roll back the  law s expansion of medicaid for low income people  a change that helped obamacare cut the number of uninsured americans to  million in  from  million in    trump vowed on the campaign trail to  save  medicare  but democrats said price s plans could amount to privatizing the government program for the elderly  price has endorsed converting medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher style program to help people buy coverage   we say to republicans who want to privatize medicare  go try it  make our day   schumer said on tuesday  saying the change would be unpopular with the public  democrats also criticized the pick because price has supported barring federal funds for planned parenthood  which provides some abortions in addition to birth control  health exams and other services  trump has met about  people as he looks to shape his white house and cabinet team  chao  his pick for transportation secretary  was the first asian american woman to hold a cabinet position  as labor secretary  she is married to republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell
