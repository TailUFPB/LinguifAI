badly    i will never drop out of the race  will never let my supporters down   trump wrote on saturday afternoon on the social media website twitter    the video was the latest calamity for trump  who had hoped to revive his flagging campaign in the face of a recent drop in polls with less than a month until election day   trump is due to appear alongside democrat hillary clinton on sunday in their second debate in the run up to the general election  clinton is not expected to address trump s video before then       the  video of trump talking on an open microphone showed the then reality tv star speaking about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman  the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife  melania  in a statement  melania trump called her husband s words  unacceptable and offensive to me    this does not represent the man that i know   she said   he has the heart and mind of a leader  i hope people will accept his apology  as i have  and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world   the backlash over the video was swift and widespread   more than  prominent republican current and former officeholders issued statements condemning trump s remarks about women  including house speaker paul ryan and john mccain  the party s standard bearer in   more than  called for trump to end his presidential bid   in an unusual move

actions described by donald trump   said pence  who is governor of indiana  pence indicated he would continue to support trump  despite calls from several republicans for trump to step aside and let pence be the nominee      there is no precedent for a major party to replace its nominee this late in the campaign and it was unclear if there was an avenue to force him out  voting has begun in several states  including swing states virginia and north carolina  a recorded apology by trump early on saturday did not stymie an avalanche of calls from members of his party to quit   trump huddled on saturday in trump tower with senior advisers  including new jersey governor chris christie and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani  despite previous scheduling  giuliani will appear on five major sunday morning news programs  a rare round robin reserved for major news events   replacing republican chairman reince priebus on cbs s  face the nation  and campaign manager kellyanne conway on  fox news sunday   a last minute switch  no reason was given for the bump of conway  a cbs news release said the rnc asked to replace priebus because trump s operation wanted  a campaign person  to appear on the program  trump left the building briefly to greet a small crowd of supporters  saying   percent  he would remain in the race  before returning to a bank of elevators  he told reporters   tremendous support   he quickly moved to do damage control in saturday s video in which he declared himself a changed man and attempted to shift the focus to his opponent clinton and her husband  former president bill clinton  on twitter  trump posted critical statements from juanita broaddrick  a woman who has accused bill clinton of sexually assaulting her   anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who i am  i said it  i was wrong  and i apologize   trump said in his video statement  posted on his facebook page      trump has struggled to win over women voters  and the video was expected to further feed democratic criticism about his past behavior toward women  trump s support has suffered among suburban women and white  college educated women  groups that republicans have traditionally won  in the recording that triggered the firestorm  trump said of one woman   i did try and fuck her  she was married   he went on to discuss his attraction to others   i just start kissing them   he said   and when you re a star they let you do it    grab them by the pussy  you can do anything   trump said  on saturday afternoon  cnn published a separate report detailing remarks trump made over the course of several years while appearing on howard stern s radio program  the remarks included discussing the size of his daughter s breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time  trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded   it depends on what your definition of black is    the remarks were the last straw for some republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks  including calling mexican immigrants  rapists  and  criminals   calling for a ban on muslim immigrants  attacking a judge of mexican descent  attacking the gold star family of a muslim soldier killed at war and saying senator john mccain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war  house speaker paul ryan disinvited trump to a scheduled appearance on saturday in wisconsin  pence declined to speak in his place  the list of republicans announcing they would not vote for trump or calling on him to step aside grew on saturday  senators kelly ayotte  lisa murkowsi  dan sullivan  mark kirk  jeff flake  john thune  mike crapo  shelley moore capito and mike lee  house members jason chaffetz  mia love  joe heck

secretary of state condoleezza rice called on trump to quit   donald trump s behavior this week  concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults  make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy   mccain said in a statement   while democrats largely remained silent  opting to let republicans attack one of their own  vice president joe biden wrote on twitter   the words are demeaning  such behavior is an abuse of power  it s not lewd  it s sexual assault    some prominent republicans indicated they would stick with trump  ralph reed  head of the faith and freedom coalition  and tony perkins  head of the conservative family research council  said they would continue to support him   i think  years ago he was a different man   said representative jack kingston  a republican from georgia   i am very glad that he quickly apologized
