miami washington  reuters    democrat tim kaine made his first appearance on the campaign trail as hillary clinton s vice presidential running mate on saturday  touting an optimistic view of america and leaping to attack republican presidential nominee donald trump s record  joining clinton at a rally in the battleground state of florida  the bilingual kaine peppered spanish language phrases into a speech focused on introducing himself to voters unfamiliar with the low key u s  senator from virginia  kaine criticized trump s recent suggestion he might not honor u s  security commitments to nato in europe  and the real estate mogul s history of casino bankruptcies and founding the failed trump university   when donald trump says he has your back  you better watch out   kaine said  with clinton sitting at his side nodding   he leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes  we can t afford to let him do the same thing to our country   in contrast  he said  clinton  doesn t insult people  she listens to them  what a novel concept   he said they shared a common creed   do all the good you can   clinton unveiled her choice of kaine late on friday  grabbing the political spotlight from trump  who accepted the republican presidential nomination on thursday night after a chaotic four day convention  the former secretary of state will formally be nominated as her party s presidential candidate in the nov   election at the democratic convention in philadelphia  which opens on monday  in choosing the soft spoken kaine  a former richmond mayor and virginia governor with a long establishment resume  clinton opted for a steady and experienced hand who she hopes will offer a clear alternative to trump s volatile campaign and his republican vice presidential choice mike pence   senator tim kaine is everything donald trump and mike pence are not  he is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one   clinton told the miami crowd  trump was unimpressed  saying on twitter he had watched the joint appearance and  isis and our other enemies are drooling  they don t look presidential to me   in his speech  kaine said he was an optimist and described his childhood in kansas city helping his father in his metal working shop and his catholic mission to honduras  where he helped teenagers with carpentry and welding and they taught him spanish  he said in honduras he learned the values  fe  familia  y trabajo    faith  family  and work  kaine became emotional when he recalled the  shooting deaths of  people at virginia tech university during his stint as governor  calling it the worst day of his life  he promised to take on the national rifle association and fight for  common sense  gun control  judith sweeney    from west park  florida  said she knew little about kaine before attending the speech but was impressed by his resume and liked his civil rights work and school reform efforts   wonderful  very experienced  an innovator   she said  peter daou  a former adviser to clinton who now owns a media company  said kaine s speech would turn around some of the doubters about the choice   the combination of his tone  his demeanor  his life story  it just said a lot about her capacity to choose the right person and not listen to pressure from the outside   he said  clinton is hoping kaine will help her appeal to independents and moderates  but some supporters of clinton s democratic primary rival  u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  were dismayed by the choice because of kaine s past advocacy for an asian free trade pact  but in a nod to party liberals  the clinton campaign said kaine will not support the final version of the  nation trans pacific partnership  which is pending in the senate  a spokeswoman for kaine confirmed his opposition to the pact  the decision drew cheers from liberal groups and labor leaders   we re glad to see the clinton kaine ticket taking steps to campaign on big  bold  populist ideas that voters want to hear from democrats   said stephanie taylor  co founder of the progessive change campaign committee  richard trumka  president of the afl cio labor federation  said kaine s decision to join clinton in opposing the trade pact  sets an irretrievable  progressive path forward for america   in picking kaine  clinton passed over liberal candidates who would have generated more grassroots enthusiasm like u s  senators elizabeth warren of massachusetts and cory booker of new jersey  and hispanic cabinet members julian castro and thomas perez  clinton tried to reassure party liberals  offering an extended list of kaine s efforts on behalf of low income workers  education and civil rights  and for expanded gun control laws and immigration reform   he fights for the people he represents  and he delivers real results   clinton said  applying one of her favorite self descriptions to him   when i say he s a progressive who likes to get things done  i mean it   sanders supporters lost their bid to eliminate or reduce the influence of superdelegates  party leaders who are not bound to any candidate  during a meeting of the convention rules committee in philadelphia  sanders had complained about the superdelegates  which overwhelmingly backed clinton  but enough committee members backed the effort to let them take the fight to the convention floor during next week s convention  participants said
