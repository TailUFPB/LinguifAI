washington  reuters    hillary clinton s presidential campaign looked for ways to avoid damaging its relationship with the white house as she considered how to publicly announce her position on the controversial keystone xl pipeline  according to emails published this week by wikileaks  clinton aides weighed having the democratic candidate say she opposed the pipeline in a closed door union meeting  leaking it to news media outlets or including it without fanfare in a policy fact sheet  the emails show  clinton eventually announced that she opposed the pipeline on sept      at a town hall event in des moines  iowa  early in the contest to win the democratic presidential nomination  president barack obama  also a democrat  announced that he too opposed the project on nov      the wikileaks group released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of clinton campaign chair john podesta on wednesday  just weeks before the nov   presidential election in which clinton is facing republican donald trump  whether clinton would oppose transcanada corp s pipeline to bring canadian crude tar sands oil to refineries on the gulf of mexico was a major issue in her democratic primary race against chief rival u s  senator bernie sanders  who opposed the project  clinton was walking a fine line on supporting or opposing the pipeline  the keystone xl controversy put at odds labor unions  which thought the project would spur job creation  and environmentalists  who advocated moving away from tar sands derived oil to cleaner forms of energy  clinton s decision was further complicated by the fact that the pipeline approval process began when she was obama s secretary of state from    she said repeatedly that she would wait to announce her position until after the state department had repeated its review of the project  in deference to her former boss  privately  aides were figuring out the best way to announce her opposition to the project   we are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second guessing the president in public   speechwriter dan schwerin wrote on aug      in one of the apparently hacked emails  schwerin was responding to a suggestion by clinton campaign manager robby mook that they could use the keystone announcement to draw news media attention away from clinton s use of a private email system while she headed the state department  the clinton campaign has declined to verify the authenticity of the podesta emails released by wikileaks  podesta told reporters on tuesday that the federal bureau of investigation had notified him it was investigating the  criminal  hack of his emails as part of a broader probe  the white house last week formally accused russia of hacking democratic party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election  a charge russia has denied  as a result  clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails  there was no evidence to indicate that the keystone emails   which provided insight into the campaign s struggle to announce clinton s position on a major democratic issue that could put her at odds with the white house   were not genuine  clinton s campaign considered having the former secretary of state address the keystone issue in a private meeting with a building trades union  then immediately roll out a fact sheet on her infrastructure proposals and publish an opinion article on the topic  the leaked emails show  but clinton spokesman brian fallon thought it might be easier to forgo including keystone in the policy rollout  skip the opinion piece and have clinton state her opposition in the union meeting   i think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of potus on keystone if her position merely leaked out of the meeting   fallon wrote in a sept      email  using an acronym for the president   that would seem like a private comment that she didn t intend to become public    perhaps we could just issue an infrastructure fact sheet  without mention of keystone   and rely on the  clinton  keystone  position  to leak  either organically or with an assist from us   fallon added  after clinton warned at a new hampshire campaign event on sept      that she could not  wait too much longer  and was  putting the white house on notice  that she would soon tell voters her position  podesta checked in with white house chief of staff denis mcdonough   trying to calibrate whether we are threading the needle ok with you guys after valerie getting her nose out of joint on keystone   podesta wrote in a sept      email  in an apparent reference to valerie jarrett  a senior adviser to obama  podesta said that clinton s  comments on being frustrated with the delay  were not a  frontal attack  on the president
