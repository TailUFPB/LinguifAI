 reuters    the obama administration on tuesday unveiled the final version of a long awaited and controversial rule to extend overtime pay to   million u s  workers  which marks one of the administration s most significant moves to address stagnant wages   the rule  which has drawn intense criticism from business groups and republicans  doubles the maximum annual income a salaried worker can earn and still be automatically eligible for overtime pay from    to    and requires that threshold to be updated every three years  it takes effect dec    officials said many workers will earn more money  an estimated total of   billion over the next decade  while others will work fewer hours for the same pay   more than  million workers are either going to be paid more or get time back to raise their family  go to school   or retrain to get a better job   vice president joe biden said during a phone call with reporters on tuesday  the rule will likely touch nearly every sector of the u s  economy but is expected to have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups  retail companies  hotels and restaurants  which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold  business groups  which lobbied heavily against the changes  say companies will be forced to cut wages and hours and may slow hiring  the obama administration and supporters of the new rule say the    threshold allowed companies to hold down labor costs by requiring workers with relatively low incomes to work well over  hours per week without additional pay  the rule will likely face legal challenges  including claims that the u s  labor department flouted legal requirements for creating new regulations  republicans in congress have said they will move to block the rule  but they would need to overcome a veto from president barack obama   the new threshold was lower than the    standard proposed by the obama administration last year  but the last minute change to lower it  which was widely expected  did little to appease critics   any federal standard above the    overtime threshold in new york  which has a high cost of living  will inhibit economic growth in more rural states in the south and midwest  tammy mccutchen  a washington d c  lawyer who works with the u s  chamber of commerce  said on tuesday before the final rule was announced  the threshold also disappointed proponents of the new rule  including ross eisenbrey of the left leaning economic policy institute  who first pitched an overhaul to the white house in    it means a million fewer employees will be helped   he said before the rule was released
