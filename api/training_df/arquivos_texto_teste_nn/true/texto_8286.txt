new york  reuters    republican presidential nominee donald trump has run an unusually cheap campaign in part by not paying at least  top staffers  consultants and advisers  some of whom are no longer with the campaign  according to a review of federal campaign finance filings     those who have so far not been paid  the filings show  include recently departed campaign manager paul manafort  california state director tim clark  communications director michael caputo and a pair of senior aides who left the campaign in june to immediately go to work for a trump super pac   the new york real estate magnate and his allies have touted his campaign s frugality  saying it is evidence of his management skills  his campaign s spending has totaled    million so far  about a third of what democratic rival hillary clinton s campaign has spent  but not compensating top people in a presidential campaign is a departure from campaign finance norms  many of the positions involved might typically come with six figure annual paychecks in other campaigns   it s unprecedented for a presidential campaign to rely so heavily on volunteers for top management positions   said paul ryan  an election lawyer with the campaign finance reform advocacy group campaign legal center  the trump campaign said the reuters  reporting was  sloppy at best  but declined to elaborate  one of the  who were unpaid  michael caputo  told a buffalo radio station in june after he resigned from the campaign  that he was not volunteering  rather  he said he just had not gotten paid  caputo confirmed to reuters on thursday that the trump campaign has still not paid his invoices   in another instance  two high level former trump campaign advisers  former chris christie campaign manager ken mckay and manafort lobbying associate laurance gay  departed the trump campaign in june and went to work for the trump backed super pac  rebuilding america now  in june  the super pac paid each of them     the filings show    federal campaign law stipulates that people working for campaigns  who may possess strategic knowledge of a campaign or work as a campaign s agents  must wait for  days before going to work for a super pac  a political spending group that can accept unlimited sums of money from wealthy donors so long as it does not coordinate with a campaign   through a spokesperson  mckay and gay said they were volunteering for trump and did not possess strategic information so the rule did not apply to them   another example of free labor is rick gates  who was manafort s deputy  according to two former high level trump staffers  gates essentially functioned as the trump campaign manager for more than two months  all while not collecting a paycheck   by contrast  democratic nominee hillary clinton s campaign manager robby mook earned roughly    in july  the same amount as president barack obama s campaign manager jim messina did in   that same year  republican nominee mitt romney s campaign manager  matt rhoades  was making nearly    bi monthly  others who  according to the fec filings  have not been paid include finance chairman steven mnuchin  national political director rick wiley and senior adviser barry bennett  who were not available for comment  nor were manafort  gates and clark  many campaigns have volunteers who work as low level ground troops  knocking on voters  doors and passing out campaign buttons  there are instances in other campaigns of senior staff opting not to draw a paycheck  for example  john podesta  a longtime adviser to clinton who is now her campaign chairman  considers his role honorary and does not draw a salary  what is unusual  however  is for a campaign to have such a large group of people in top positions who are unpaid   after manafort resigned in august  trump promoted his senior adviser and top pollster  kellyanne conway  to become his new campaign manager   before then  conway ran a super pac affiliated with texas senator and republican presidential candidate ted cruz  for work from june  to june   the super pac paid the firm she owns more than     she officially joined the trump campaign july   but so far  according to campaign finance reports that detail spending through july   conway has not been paid by the trump campaign  she did not respond to a request for comment
