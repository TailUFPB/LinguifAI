new york  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump s hardline rhetoric on immigration might not trigger the surge in latino voter turnout for which many activists are hoping  according to a pew research center survey released on tuesday  about  percent of latino registered voters who were surveyed said they planned to vote in the nov   election  down from  percent who said in october  that they were planning to vote in that year s election  the decrease was within the survey s plus or minus   percent margin of error  the pew report was based on a bilingual telephone survey of   latino adults  including  registered voters  from aug   through sept     in july   four months before the presidential election that year   percent of respondents said they planned to vote  according to previous pew research  about   percent of hispanic registered voters cast ballots in   the year  democratic president barack obama ran successfully against republican mitt romney  that turnout was down from  percent in   when obama ran against republican john mccain and won  the latest pew survey found that democrats continued to maintain an edge as the party  more concerned  for latinos   hillary clinton is relying on a coalition of minority voters to help her against trump  who launched his presidential bid last year by calling some mexican immigrants rapists and promising to build a wall to stop them entering the united states  latinos  a growing segment of the u s  electorate with rising influence in closely fought states like florida and nevada  tend to lean democratic and favor clinton heavily over trump  according to the survey  some  percent support clinton compared to  percent for trump  another  percent favor libertarian candidate gary johnson and  percent prefer green candidate jill stein   turnout among latinos tends to run well below that of whites and african americans  blunting their impact in political races   a number of civic groups opposed to trump have been working to ensure latinos get to the polls   pew said that   million latinos were eligible to vote  however  knowing how many of those people are registered is harder to measure because many states do not capture information such as race or ethnicity along with voter registration information   in  an estimated   million latinos voted in the presidential election  according to pew  in  that figure was   million latino voters  while one must be a u s  citizen to cast a ballot in u s   elections  requirements for voter registration can vary by state   immigrants  rights group america s voice  for example  launched a new spanish language radio ad in miami and orlando for the next two weeks bashing trump s hardline immigration proposals  which include deporting all undocumented foreigners and making it harder for would be immigrants to get visas  in nevada  the culinary union  which is heavily latino  is working to ensure its members get to the polls  helping them with logistics like finding their polling stations and arranging transport   it could make the difference between a one point loss and a one point win   said yvanna cancela  the union s political director  sergio garcia rios  a professor of latino studies at cornell university  said clinton could be missing an opportunity to drive voter turnout further by not engaging latino voters enough on policy   we can t just rely on an anger reaction to donald trump   he said  the challenge is  to create enthusiasm for latinos to get out and vote
