washington  reuters    homeland security chief john kelly told a congressional panel on tuesday he should have delayed u s  president donald trump s travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries and on all refugees so he could brief congress on the executive order       the temporary ban ignited international protests as the united states revoked   visas and detained some travelers who landed in the united states unaware the order had been signed while they were in flight   the desire was to get it out quick so that potentially people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane and get here   kelly told the house of representatives committee on homeland security   kelly took the blame for not briefing congress on the order before it was announced late on jan       this is all on me by the way  i should have delayed it just a bit so that i could talk to members of congress   he said   kelly said the confusion at u s  airports was caused by court orders challenging the ban that went out the day after it went into effect  adding that his team at the department of homeland security acted swiftly to tweak their operations as necessary  the order was signed also with little or no briefing of u s  government agents responsible for implementing it  contributing to the confusion  there was also no agreement within the administration for several days over whether green card holders   foreign nationals from the seven targeted countries with permanent u s  residency   should be admitted  the white house reversed itself later and said those with green cards would be granted waivers to enter the country   the ban was suspended by a federal judge last friday  opening a window for refugees and citizens from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen to enter the united states  pending an appeal by the u s government  trump s executive order temporarily barred travelers from the seven muslim majority countries and all refugees  except refugees from syria whom he would ban indefinitely  the ban  which trump says is needed to protect the united states against islamist militants  sparked condemnation from critics who said it was discriminatory against muslims and questioned its value as a security measure  all the people who carried out fatal attacks inspired by islamist militancy in the united states since the sept      attacks were u s  citizens or legal residents  the new america think tank says  none came to the united states or were from a family that emigrated from one of the countries listed in the travel ban  it said   bit ly   the  u s  circuit court of appeals in san francisco was due to hear arguments about whether to restore the ban at  p m  pst   gmt   kelly defended the order  at the hearing  asserting that the seven countries on the list were known to have inadequate systems for sharing information with the united states on their potentially dangerous citizens  he said reports circulated last week that  countries could be added to the travel ban were false  adding that no additional countries were being considered   kelly also said that funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration agents would only be cut on a case by case basis      trump had threatened to cut large amounts of federal funding to about  so called  sanctuary cities  in order to pressure them to cooperate in the apprehension and deportation of illegal immigrants     kelly said he did not expect to meet trump s hiring goals of   additional u s  customs and border protection agents and   immigration and customs enforcement agents within two years  trump did not specify a timeline when he called for the hiring in his executive action
