washington  reuters    u s  lawmakers this week will consider three republican backed measures targeting the obama administration s nuclear agreement with iran  which bitterly divides washington a year after it was announced and could play a role in november s elections  one bill would impose new sanctions on iran over any sponsorship of terrorism or human rights violations  another would bar the purchase from iran of  heavy water   a non radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy  the third would block iran s access to the u s  financial system  including the use of the dollar  republican lawmakers  who control the house of representatives and senate and unanimously opposed the nuclear deal announced last july   have said the measures are necessary to send iran a strong message that it will face consequences if it violates international agreements  many  joined by several democrats  have been especially concerned by iran s actions since the deal was officially implemented in january  including its test firing of ballistic missiles in march   it makes sense to do all we can to check this very dangerous iranian activity   republican representative ed royce  the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  told the rules committee  which sets up rules for debate of bills headed to the house floor  thanks in part to the nuclear agreement  iran has begun to rejoin global politics and economics after more than three decades of isolation  business and political leaders are visiting the country  which is also hosting trade conferences  in his first report on the deal  united nations secretary general ban ki moon said iran s ballistic missile launches  are not consistent with the constructive spirit  of the nuclear deal  he said it was up to the u n  security council to decide if the launches violated the resolution backing the agreement  however  he also said he was  encouraged by iran s implementation of its nuclear commitments   republicans worry that president barack obama is so eager to preserve the pact as a legacy that his administration will give tehran too much leeway before he leaves office in january  election year politics  former secretary of state hillary clinton  the presumptive democratic presidential nominee  backs the nuclear deal  republican candidate donald trump has promised to tear it up if he is elected on nov    most of obama s fellow democrats in congress backed the agreement  they say the new legislation is intended to undermine or even derail it  the white house issued a threat on monday to veto all three bills  saying they would affect the continued viability of the nuclear agreement  the deal  is critical to ensuring that iran s nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful  which is profoundly in the national security interest of the united states and the international community   it said in a statement  the bills are not expected to win enough votes to advance in the senate  even if they pass the house  and if they did pass the senate  they would lack enough support to override a veto  backers of the iran deal said republicans were trying to appeal to voters just days before the convention where trump is due to become the party s presidential nominee  polls show an overwhelming majority of americans have an unfavorable view of iran  dylan williams  vice president for government affairs at j street  a pro israel group that supported the nuclear deal  said such legislation plays into voters  frustration with what they see as a do nothing congress   this kind of grandstanding not only endangers our security by endangering the deal  it s exactly the type of politics that people are sick of   he said
