washington  reuters    donald trump won the u s  presidency with less support from black and hispanic voters than any president in at least  years  a reuters review of polling data shows  highlighting deep national divisions that have fueled incidents of racial and political confrontation  trump was elected with  percent of the black vote   percent of the hispanic vote and  percent of the asian american vote  according to the reuters ipsos election day poll  among black voters  his showing was comparable to the  percent captured by george w  bush in  and ronald reagan in   but bush and reagan both did far better with hispanic voters  capturing  percent and  percent  respectively  according to exit polling data compiled by the non partisan roper center for public opinion research   and trump s performance among asian americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in   the racial polarization behind trump s victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election  in white supremacist victory celebrations  in anti trump protests and civil rights rallies  and in hundreds of racist  xenophobic and anti semitic hate crimes documented by the southern poverty law center  splc   which tracks extremist movements  the splc reports there were  incidents of  hateful harassment and intimidation  between the day following the nov   election and nov    with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote      signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation      the loyal white knights of the ku klux klan  a white separatist group that vilifies african americans  jews and other minorities  plans an unusual dec   rally in north carolina to celebrate trump s victory  left wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president elect s jan   inauguration  and a  women s march on washington   scheduled for the following day  is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest trump s presidency      american politics became increasingly racialized through president barack obama s two terms   but there was an attempt across the board  across the parties  to keep those tensions under the surface   says jamila michener  an assistant professor of government at cornell university   trump s anti immigrant  anti muslim rhetoric  brought those divisions to the fore  it activated people on the right  who felt empowered  and it activated people on the left  who saw it as a threat   she added      that dynamic was evident last week      when vice president elect mike pence attended the broadway musical  hamilton  in new york on friday  the multi ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a trump presidency  a far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about  people cheered trump s election at a washington conference of the national policy institute  a white nationalist group with a strong anti semitic beliefs        we willed donald trump into office  we made this dream our reality   npi president richard spencer said  after outlining a vision of america as  a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity   he closed with   hail trump  hail our people  hail victory   though trump s election victory was driven by white voters  his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors  reagan and george h w  bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the  percent that trump achieved       the historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in american politics  but the division surrounding trump appears more profound  says cas mudde  an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the university of georgia  these days  he adds   people say they don t want their children even to date someone from the other party       indeed  voters  opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows  surveys by the pew research center showed this year that majorities of both parties held  very unfavorable  views of the other party   a first since the center first measured such sentiment in   and the lion s share of those people believe the opposing party s policies  are so misguided that they threaten the nation s well being   the center found      that level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction      in the wake of trump s victory  protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country  in some cases causing property damage   much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that trump s administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters  says james anderson  editor of itsgoingdown org  an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against trump s presidency  including a call to disrupt his inauguration      many on the left have come to distrust government institutions  embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces  anderson says   the answer now is to organize  build power and autonomy and fight back       on the opposite end of the political spectrum  trump s election is bringing new hope for right wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties       john roberts  a top officer in the ku klux klan affiliate planning the december rally to celebrate trump s election  says the group is committed to non violent demonstrations  but he sees trump s election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict  and much of the strife  he says  will be centered around racial divisions       once trump officially takes office  there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time   roberts says   who knows when that s going to be  but it s not going to be pretty
