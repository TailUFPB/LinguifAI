washington  reuters    u s  senators signaled on wednesday a new willingness to consider restrictions on the sale of guns after the orlando nightclub massacre  with presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and others in his party ready to discuss limited gun control measures   with republicans and the national rifle association gun lobby under pressure to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern u s  history  trump said he would meet with the nra to discuss ways to block people on terrorism watch or no fly lists from buying guns   emotions have run high in congress since sunday s mass shooting with democrats stalling senate proceedings on wednesday in a bid to push for tougher gun control legislation  democratic senators planned to speak on the senate floor well into wednesday night   the senate began discussions on legislation to ban firearm sales to the hundreds of thousands of people on u s  terrorism watch lists after a gunman who had been on such a list killed  people at a gay nightclub on sunday  but following a full day of wrangling  senate democratic leader harry reid said that negotiations  were little more than a smokescreen by republicans trying to give themselves political cover while they continue to march in lock step with the nra s extreme positions   reid said there were no republican proposals  that come close to attracting democratic support   earlier on wednesday  republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell urged senators to offer ideas on how to prevent another attack like the one in orlando    i do not believe this was some random act of violence   mcconnell said   it seems clear this was cold blooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with deliberate malice   on tuesday  mcconnell said that  nobody wants terrorists to have firearms    earlier in the week  some democrats in the house of representatives interrupted a moment of silence for the victims  with shouts of  where s the bill   to protest the republican led chamber s refusal to consider tougher gun laws    if congress was to pass a gun control measure  it would mark the first time in more than  years that lawmakers agreed on how to address the hot button issue  a ban on semi automatic assault weapons  such as the one used in orlando  had gone into effect in  and expired  years later  republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on americans  right to bear arms as guaranteed under the u s  constitution   senator john cornyn  the no   senate republican  confirmed that he and democratic senator dianne feinstein were holding private talks on a possible compromise bill stopping weapons sales to those on watch lists       another republican  senator pat toomey of pennsylvania  also is working on a bill that would keep guns from people on watch lists  a gun control group said  toomey  who is in a possibly difficult re election bid this year  took to the senate floor urging compromise   so there s an obvious opportunity here guys  to work together and find a solution   he said  adding   this is not rocket science to figure this out   a spokeswoman for toomey  e r  anderson  said the senator was seeking bipartisan support for an approach that he had tentatively agreed on with gun control group everytown for gun safety  which is backed by ex new york mayor michael bloomberg  everytown spokeswoman erika lamb said the group was encouraged by the discussions but added   we are not there yet and our support for any compromise legislation is contingent on support from both republicans and democrats   toomey s bill would allow the u s  attorney general to create a new list of  likely terrorists  and block any person on the list from buying or selling a gun  if someone was denied a gun  he or she would be entitled to a swift court hearing where the attorney general would have to turn over the evidence against the person  democrats were dubious  one problem  a democratic aide said  was that under the proposal officials would just have three days to try to block sales to anyone not already on the new list  congressional republicans and the nra have thwarted previous gun control measures backed by president barack obama and other democrats after other mass shootings  and supporters of new restrictions remained cautious about the moves   the cornyn bill is outlandish and is worse than nothing  from what i m told all of the compromises proposed by cornyn and toomey are not at all acceptable   said senator chuck schumer  a democrat of new york      feinstein  speaking to reporters following a closed briefing from the obama administration on the orlando massacre  held out little hope her talks with cornyn would bear fruit   i don t think it s going to work out   she said  but added she was still engaged in talks  trump said on twitter he would meet with the nra  about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list  or the no fly list  to buy guns   his campaign did not specify what he might support legislatively  and a spokeswoman declined to give details about the timing or nature of the meeting  the nra  a politically influential lobbying group that claims more than  million members  said in a statement it was  happy to meet  with trump  whom it endorsed for president on may   the group said in a statement that anyone on a terrorism watch list who tries to buy a gun  should be thoroughly investigated  by the federal bureau of investigation and any sale to that person delayed  a position the lobby group has long held  presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  who has supported gun control efforts  on monday said she was  bewildered  that republicans in congress in december had blocked a democratic effort to restrict gun sales to people on the watch lists  the u s  government maintains two terrorism watch lists  a no fly list barring people from flying to and from the united states and a larger one that subjects travelers to greater scrutiny at airports and border crossings  an fbi official said in  there were   people on the no fly list and   on the broader list  the orlando gunman  omar mateen  the u s  born son of afghan immigrants  was on the broader list at one time  nra executive director chris cox also voiced backing for legislation offered in december by cornyn  who proposed to put gun sales on hold for  hours for people on watch lists  critics have said such background checks could take longer to complete  white house spokesman josh earnest said it was too soon to tell if republicans would support  common sense  steps like blocking firearm sales to people on the no fly lists
