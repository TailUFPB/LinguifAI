washington  reuters    president donald trump signed a revised executive order on monday banning citizens from six muslim majority nations from traveling to the united states but removing iraq from the list  after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts  the new order  which takes effect on march   keeps a  day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen  it applies only to new visa applicants  meaning some   people whose visas were revoked under the previous order will now be permitted to enter  immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous order  legal experts said it would  however  be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the united states and allows more exemptions to protect them  trump  who first proposed a temporary travel ban on muslims during his presidential campaign last year  had said his original jan   executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by islamist militants   it sparked chaos and protests at airports  where visa holders were detained and later deported back to their home countries  it also drew criticism from targeted countries  western allies and some of america s leading corporations before a u s  judge suspended it on feb      as threats to our security continue to evolve and change  common sense dictates that we continually re evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country   secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters after trump signed the new order   democrats  a minority in congress  quickly signaled fierce opposition to what they called a discriminatory ban   the trump administration s repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral  unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their muslim and refugee ban   house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement  farhana khera  executive director of muslim advocates  a civil rights group in washington  said the trump administration had  doubled down on anti muslim bigotry   she told reporters on a conference call   it s crystal clear this is a muslim ban    but some republicans who had been critical of trump s original order were more positive on the new one  bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  said he was  very encouraged  by the approach and pleased that iraq was removed from the list  iraq was taken off the banned list because the iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures  such as heightened visa screening and data sharing  and because of its work with the united states in countering islamic state militants  a senior white house official said  trump s original ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in u s  courts  the justice department estimated   people had their visas revoked by the first order but senior administration officials said on monday those visas were now valid again for entry into the united states   by rescinding his earlier executive order  president trump makes one thing perfectly clear  his original travel ban was indefensible   legally  constitutionally and morally   said    attorney general bob ferguson of washington state  which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended  his office will likely decide this week on whether to proceed with litigation over the new order  he said  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version   a watered down ban is still a ban   he said in a statement   despite the administration s changes  this dangerous executive order makes us less safe  not more  it is mean spirited  and un american  it must be repealed   the fact the ban affects fewer people already in the united states means it will be more difficult for opponents to find plaintiffs who have been harmed by the order and thus have legal standing to challenge it  legal experts said   the revised order expressly makes waivers possible for a foreign national seeking to enter the united states to visit a spouse  child or parent who is a u s  citizen  or for  significant business or professional obligations      they dotted their i s and crossed their t s in trying to anticipate what litigation might result   said stephen yale loehr  a cornell law school professor  the revised order means that tens of thousands of legal permanent u s  residents   or green card holders   from the listed countries will no longer be affected  the original order barred travelers from the seven nations from entering for  days and all refugees for  days  refugees from syria were to be banned indefinitely but under the new order they are not given separate treatment  refugees  in transit  and already approved would be able to travel to the united states under the new order  defense secretary jim mattis  who along with several other senior cabinet members had lobbied for iraq s removal from the list of banned countries  was consulted on the new order and the updated version  does reflect his inputs   pentagon spokesman captain jeff davis said   thousands of iraqis have fought alongside u s  troops for years or worked as translators since the u s  led invasion in   many have resettled in the united states after being threatened for working with u s  troops
