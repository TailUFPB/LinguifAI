washington  san francisco  reuters    after a rampage that left  people dead in san bernardino  key u s  lawmakers pledged to seek a law requiring technology companies to give law enforcement agencies a  back door  to encrypted communications and electronic devices  such as the iphone used by one of the shooters  now  only months later  much of the support is gone  and the push for legislation dead  according to sources in congressional offices  the administration and the tech sector   draft legislation that senators richard burr and dianne feinstein  the republican and democratic leaders of the intelligence committee  had circulated weeks ago likely will not be introduced this year and  even if it were  would stand no chance of advancing  the sources said  key among the problems was the lack of white house support for legislation in spite of a high profile court showdown between the justice department and apple inc over the suspect iphone  according to congressional and obama administration officials and outside observers   they ve dropped anchor and taken down the sail   former nsa and cia director michael hayden said  for years  the justice department lobbied unsuccessfully for a way to unmask suspects who  go dark   or evade detection through coded communications in locked devices  when the federal bureau of investigation took apple to court in february to try to open the iphone in its investigation of the san bernardino slayings  the cause gained traction in washington  the political landscape had shifted   or so it seemed  the short life of the push for legislation illustrates the intractable nature of the debate over digital surveillance and encryption  which has been raging in one form or another since the   tech companies  backed by civil liberties groups  insist that building law enforcement access into phones and other devices would undermine security for everyone including the u s  government itself  law enforcement agencies maintain they need a way to monitor  phone calls  emails and text messages  along with access to encrypted data  polls show the public is split on whether the government should have access to all digital data  the legal battle between the fbi and apple briefly united many around the idea that congress   not the courts   should decide the issue  but the consensus was fleeting  feinstein s democratic colleagues on the intelligence committee   along with some key republicans   backed away  the house never got on board  the cia and nsa were ambivalent  according to several current and former intelligence officials  in part because officials in the agencies feared any new law would interfere with their own encryption efforts  even supporters worried that if a bill were introduced but failed  it would give apple and other tech companies another weapon to use in future court battles  burr had said repeatedly that legislation was imminent      but last week  he and feinstein told reuters there was no timeline for the bill  feinstein said she planned to talk to more tech stakeholders  and burr said   be patient   in the meantime  tech companies have accelerated encryption efforts in the wake of the apple case  the court showdown ended with a whimper when the fbi said it had found a way to get into the phone  and subsequently conceded privately it had found nothing of value  a week after the san bernardino attack  burr told reuters passing encryption legislation was urgent because  if we don t  we will be reading about terrorist attacks on a more frequent basis   fbi director james comey told the senate intelligence committee soon after that encryption was  overwhelmingly affecting  the investigation of murders  drug trafficking and child pornography  a week later  the justice department persuaded a judge to issue a sweeping order demanding apple write software to open an iphone used by san bernardino suspect sayeed farook  who died in a shootout with law enforcement  apple fought back  arguing  among other things  that only congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding  many saw the justice department s move as a way to bring pressure on congress to act  president obama appeared to tacitly support comey s court fight and the idea that there should be limits on criminal suspects  ability to hide behind encryption  but even as the drive for legislation seemed to be gaining momentum  consensus was dissipating  senator lindsey graham  an influential republican  withdrew  support in a sudden about face   i was all with you until i actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community   graham told attorney general loretta lynch during a hearing in march   i m a person that s been moved by the arguments of the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security   on the democratic side  senator ron wyden vowed to filibuster what he called a  dangerous proposal   that  would leave americans more vulnerable to stalkers  identity thieves  foreign hackers and criminals    senator mark warner advanced a competing bill to form a commission to study the issue   a half dozen people familiar with the white house deliberations said they were hamstrung by a long standing split within the obama administration  pitting comey and the doj against technology advisors and other agencies including the commerce and state departments  they also said there was reluctance to take on the tech industry in an election year
