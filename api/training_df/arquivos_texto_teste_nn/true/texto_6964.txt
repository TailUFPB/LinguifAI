washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama  keen to preserve his legacy on domestic health care and the iran nuclear deal  is not expected to make major moves on israeli palestinian peace before leaving office  u s  officials said on thursday  one official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said the last word on the president s failed peace effort might come from secretary of state john kerry at an appearance on sunday at an annual middle east conference in washington  obama s aides are wary of being seen picking a fight with donald trump at a time when he hopes to persuade the republican president elect to preserve parts of his legacy  including the iran nuclear deal  obamacare and the opening to cuba  while obama has yet to present his final decision  several officials said he had given no sign that he intended to go against the consensus of his top advisers  who have mostly urged him not to take dramatic steps  a second official said    there is no evidence that there is any muscle behind  doing  anything   said a third official  putting new pressure on israel could be seen as a vindictive parting shot by obama at israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  the first official said  noting they have had a testy relationship  there is concern that trump  in response  might over react in trying to demonstrate his own pro israel credentials  for example by moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv  a step that would enrage palestinians and create an international furor  officials said obama has weighed enshrining his own outline for a deal in a u n  security council resolution that would live on after he gives way to trump on jan    another idea was to give a speech laying out such parameters  these options appear to have lost steam  kerry  who led the last round of peace talks that collapsed in   appears on sunday at the saban forum conference of u s   israeli and arab officials  officials could not rule out that obama might also talk about israeli palestinian diplomacy before he leaves office  the white house and the israeli embassy declined comment  the central issues to be resolved in the conflict include borders between israel and a future palestinian state  the fate of jewish settlements in the west bank  which most nations regard as illegal  the fate of palestinian refugees and the status of jerusalem  israeli officials remain concerned that obama and his aides have not explicitly ruled out some kind of last ditch u s  action  either at the united nations or in another public forum      u s  officials said obama could also have his hand forced  notably if another nation like france put forward a u n  security council resolution condemning israeli settlement activity as illegal or illegitimate  daring washington to veto it as it did a similar french proposed resolution in   u s  ambassador to israel dan shapiro  asked if washington would again veto a french proposal  told israel s army radio   we will always oppose unilateral proposals   he added   if there is something more balanced  i cannot guess what the response will be
