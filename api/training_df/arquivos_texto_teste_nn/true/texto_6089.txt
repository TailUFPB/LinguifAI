new york  thomson reuters foundation    u s  president donald trump on monday reinstated a global gag rule that bans u s  funded groups around the world from discussing abortion  a move that was widely expected but nonetheless dismayed women s rights advocates  the rule  which affects american non governmental organizations working abroad  is one that incoming presidents have used to signal their positions on abortion rights  it was created under u s  president ronald reagan in   trump  an abortion opponent  signed the reinstatement directive at a ceremony in the white house on his fourth day in office  former president barack obama had lifted the gag rule in  when he took office   women s health and rights are now one of the first casualties of the trump administration   said serra sippel  president of the center for health and gender equity in washington   the global gag rule has been associated with an increase in unsafe abortions and we expect that trump s global gag rule will cost women their lives   she said  reinstatement of the gag rule  formally the mexico city policy  comes just two days after crowds of people marched in cities around the world in a show of unity for women s rights  among them abortion access  while no official estimates were available  organizers said nearly five million people participated  the far reaching gag rule affects groups getting funding from the u s  agency for international development  even if they use separate money for abortion services  counseling or referrals  advocates note   it is appalling to dictate to civil society groups and health care providers how they can spend their own money and force them to withhold from women critical information about and access to the full range of reproductive health care   said nancy northup  president of the u s  based center for reproductive rights  the policy puts groups that provide women s health care in an  untenable position   said brian dixon of population connection action fund  they can either accept the restriction to keep their funding or they can reject the restriction and lose their funding  dixon said   either choice hurts the women that rely on them    following the rule s inception in   former president bill clinton revoked it when he took office in  and former president george w  bush reinstated it in    life saving global health funding should not be a political football   said ann starrs  head of the guttmacher institute  a leading reproductive rights group   there is no evidence the rule reduces abortion  she said   in fact  by targeting funding for overseas family planning programs  it may well have the opposite effect by making it harder for many women to avoid unintended pregnancy  which in turn would increase recourse to unsafe procedures by women who cannot access safe abortion care   she said
