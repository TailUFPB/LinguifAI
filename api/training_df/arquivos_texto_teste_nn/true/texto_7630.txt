oslo  reuters    backers of a global accord to fight climate change that formally comes into force on friday say they are confident the deal can survive any legal challenges by u s  republican candidate donald trump if he wins next week s presidential election  trump has threatened to reject the accord negotiated by nearly  governments  including that of u s  president barack obama  trump once tweeted that global warming was a concept invented by the chinese to harm u s  industry  by contrast  his democratic rival hillary clinton has strongly supported the plan  which enters into force after major greenhouse gas emitters the united states  china and india ratified it  the paris agreement aims to phase out man made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century to avert floods  heatwaves  droughts and rising sea levels    delegates from signatory nations meet in the moroccan city of marrakesh on nov    to start turning their many promises on tackling climate change into action and draw up a  rule book  for the sometimes fuzzily worded accord reached last december  adding urgency   is set to be the hottest year since records began in the  century  the u s  election  on nov    injects a large dose of political uncertainty into the gathering of environment ministers and senior officials in marrakesh  the relatively speedy ratification of the climate pact  a year before many predictions  was partly driven by trump s threats to reject the accord  some delegates played down the risk of a president trump reneging on the deal   the momentum is such that it would take a heck of a climate skeptic to back pedal   said tosi mpanu mpanu of the democratic republic of congo  who heads the group of  least developed countries at the morocco negotiations   that s really why we have had this strong mobilization  to ratify   if trump wins i don t think it will change anything    moroccan environment minister hakima el haite  who will host the marrakesh meeting  said he did not expect trump  if elected   would challenge the agreement  saying the american people were generally supportive of climate action  and  as a businessman    trump  will understand that climate change is an opportunity to create jobs and new technologies   she told reuters recently in new york  its entry into force gives some protection for the paris agreement under international law  its article  says any government wanting to quit has to wait through four years of formalities   the length of a u s  presidential term  if he wins  trump is likely to focus his efforts domestically on undoing obama s plans to cut u s  emissions  such as from coal fired power plants  the paris agreement also helped to unlock u n  accords this year to limit emissions from airlines and from powerful greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigerators   there has been astonishing progress  on climate change after years of deadlock  said andrew steer  head of the world resources institute think tank  the global pacts contrast with more nationalist forces that helped trump to win the u s  republican nomination for president and  on the other side of the atlantic  britain s vote in june to leave the european union  the paris agreement enters into force after passing a threshold last month of ratification by  nations representing  percent of greenhouse gas emissions  the tally is now  nations representing about  percent of emissions  the united states alone accounts for  percent of global emissions  under a vienna convention on the law of treaties  trump could not renounce the u s  share and then argue that the entire entry into force was invalid   entry into force only goes one way  it can t be reversed   said elliot diringer  executive vice president of the non partisan center for climate and energy solutions in washington   but there could be legal challenges  the u s  republican party platform says obama  a democrat who used his executive powers to ratify the agreement  should have submitted it to the senate  where it would almost certainly have been rejected  governments in marrakesh will try to bolster the pact  which sets many goals for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by  or   governments are under pressure to spell out what they will do now rather than leave it to their successors  at its core  the paris agreement promises to limit global warming to  well below   degrees celsius    fahrenheit  above pre industrial times  but current pledges for limiting emissions are too weak and will allow temperatures to rise by perhaps      or more by   diplomats expect it will take two years or more to write a rule book for the accord  among difficulties  the agreement lets all countries set their own targets for emissions  that free for all design helped ensure wide support but is at odds with a need for a central set of rules to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions from factories  cars  farms and power plants  irrespective of the rules  the prices of renewable energies are falling sharply  prompting a shift from fossil fuels   u s  climate envoy jonathan pershing said wind and solar energy accounted for two thirds of all new electricity generating capacity installed in the united states in    the u s  solar industry now employs more people than coal   he said  still  trump says he will promote the u s  coal and oil industries to safeguard domestic jobs and national security  he says a shift from fossil fuels would force the united states to be  begging for oil again  from middle east suppliers
