washington  reuters    donald trump plans to visit cia headquarters on saturday on his first full day as u s  president  as he takes command of an agency that he has harshly criticized  a transition official said on thursday  the visit to central intelligence agency headquarters in langley  virginia  in the washington suburbs  has a symbolic element  since trump had questioned the cia s conclusion that russia was involved in cyber hacking that interfered with the u s  election  a senior u s  intelligence official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the purpose of trump s visit to the cia s sprawling campus was to swear in u s  representative mike pompeo  a kansas republican  as the spy agency s new chief  however  that plan  will depend on whether pompeo receives senate confirmation by then  and it was uncertain whether the senate would act in time  the senate s democratic leader  chuck schumer of new york  said that  there are a good number of members  who want to make statements about pompeo or ask him questions  and he predicted a vote on monday if it did not take place friday  trump has since accepted the verdict of russia s involvement  but he raised hackles among intelligence professionals earlier this month when he accused them of leaks that led some u s  media outlets to report unsubstantiated claims that russia had collected compromising information about him  trump had accused u s  intelligence agencies of engaging in tactics reminiscent of nazi germany  after that blast  outgoing cia director john brennan fired back on  fox news sunday   saying trump  has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road
