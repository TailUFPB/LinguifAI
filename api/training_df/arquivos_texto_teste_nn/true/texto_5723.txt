 reuters    when gay former law clerk joshua goodbaum married his partner in   he got effusive and emotional reassurance from his former boss  president donald trump s conservative u s  supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  goodbaum  now an attorney in connecticut  recalled fondly their conversation on the week of the wedding   he said   this is a wonderful thing  you ll see how your relationship grows    goodbaum  who in  served as a clerk for the colorado federal appeals court judge  added   i have never felt the least whiff from him of homophobia or intolerance toward gay people   as the u s  senate weighs whether to confirm the republican president s nomination of gorsuch for a lifetime seat on the nation s highest court  his views on social issues  such as gay rights  are under scrutiny by democrats and republicans alike  the supreme court periodically makes landmark civil rights decisions such as the  ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide  in their current term  for instance  the justices will tackle a major transgender rights case  for a year  the court has had eight justices  not the requisite nine  because republicans refused to consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of merrick garland  democrats remain furious with the republicans for that  and are scouring gorsuch s record to build their case against his senate confirmation  when he was named as a nominee by trump on tuesday  gorsuch    immediately came under attack from liberal groups that pounced on his social issues record  which is thin but offers clues on how he might behave as a justice  if confirmed  like goodbaum  friends and acquaintances of gorsuch  many of them democrats  said he is genial  tolerant and respectful  in some ways  he differs in style from the justice he was named to replace  the late antonin scalia  who was known for being combative and blunt on the bench  gorsuch would not put politics before the law  these people said  but his conservative legal philosophy indicates he would likely vote with like minded conservative justices on the closely divided court  he rejects the idea that liberals can press their social agenda in the courts  that could signaled he may be less likely to side with justice anthony kennedy  a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases  kennedy has joined with liberal justices in backing gay marriage  abortion rights and  most recently  a limited form of racial preferences in college admissions  it remains an open question whether gorsuch would vote for conservative agenda items such as expanding religious liberties in a way some critics say allows for discrimination against gays and others  restricting voting rights and lifting campaign finance restrictions  in a  article for conservative magazine national review  gorsuch said liberals  have become addicted to the courtroom  relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box  as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private school education    some liberal politicians and advocacy groups have labeled gorsuch a conservative hardliner in part over his role in deciding a  case involving the christian owners of the arts and crafts retailer hobby lobby  the ruling allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a federal requirement that they provide insurance to employees that pays for women s birth control  it was affirmed by the supreme court    we absolutely must not confirm a supreme court nominee who has ruled that the religious beliefs of employers can trump the law   said rachel tiven  chief executive of lambda legal  an advocacy group for the lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender community   on another issue  gorsuch last october said his colleagues on the denver based  u s  circuit court of appeals should have reconsidered a ruling that prevented utah governor gary herbert from suspending funding to women s healthcare and abortion provider planned parenthood over videos purported to show its officials negotiating the sale of fetal tissue   in   gorsuch wrote a book arguing against legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia  after trump nominated him  many social conservatives and religious groups  perhaps looking back at his book  said they hoped gorsuch would vote on the court to roll back abortion rights  in the book  gorsuch cited the  inviolability of human life   calling it a  basic good   the knights of columbus  a roman catholic fraternal organization  said gorsuch would uphold religious freedoms  and the right to life of every person   former clerks said they do not know how gorsuch  a member of the episcopal church  would vote on gay marriage or abortion  but they said he never brought his religion into his work    he s not the kind of person to use his post to push an agenda   said jason murray  a gorsuch clerk in  who is a democrat    you could certainly say judge gorsuch is a conservative  but i don t see how his personality or record bears out that he is an extremist   murray said   some who know gorsuch personally said his respect for legal precedent could prevent radical attempts to change the law   he s very sensitive to the importance of societal stability  so if he were to change roe v  wade significantly i would be surprised   added tracy ashmore  a democratic lawyer from denver  referring to the landmark  supreme court ruling legalizing abortion
