washington  reuters    despite his campaign vows to take a tougher line with north korea  president donald trump s restrained public reaction to pyongyang s first ballistic missile launch on his watch underscores that he has few good options to curb its missile and nuclear programs  the responses under consideration   which range from additional sanctions to u s  shows of force to beefed up missile defense  according to one administration official   do not seem to differ significantly so far from the north korea playbook followed by trump s predecessor  barack obama  even the idea of stepping up pressure on china to rein in a defiant north korea has been tried   to little avail   by successive administrations  but beijing is showing no signs of softening its resistance under a new u s  president who has bashed them on trade  currency and the contested south china sea  more dramatic responses to north korea s missile tests would be direct military action or negotiations  but neither appears to be on the table   the first because it would risk regional war  the latter because it would be seen as rewarding pyongyang for bad behavior  and neither would offer certain success   trump s options are limited   said bonnie glaser  an asia expert at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington  trump s initial public comments on saturday on the test launch of what was believed to be an intermediate range musudan class missile were unexpectedly measured   and brief   compared to earlier bluster about another u s  adversary  iran  since he took office on january    i just want everybody to understand  and fully know  that the united states of america is behind japan  our great ally   percent   trump told reporters in palm beach  florida  speaking in a solemn tone alongside visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe  the u s  president did not mention north korea or signal any retaliatory plans for what was widely seen as an early effort to test the new administration  by contrast  trump tweeted  it won t happen   in january after north korean leader kim jong un said the north was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile  white house adviser stephen miller insisted on abc s  this week  that trump s one sentence statement was an  important show of solidarity  with japan  he told  fox news sunday  the administration was going to bolster its allies in the region against the  increasing hostility  of north korea  while no one can rule out that trump might still take to twitter with harsh rhetoric as he often does  some analysts said his relatively subdued initial statement could show that aides have convinced him not to be baited by pyongyang into issuing threats that would be hard to carry out  especially while his north korea strategy is still being formulated  trump s aides have said that they will take a more assertive approach than the obama policy dubbed  strategic patience   which involved gradually scaling up sanctions and diplomatic pressure and essentially waiting out the north korean leadership  but the new administration has been vague about how it would do this  the trump administration had been expecting a north korean  provocation  and will consider a full range of options in response  but they would be calibrated to show u s  resolve while avoiding escalation  the u s  official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  the stakes would be higher  however  if nuclear capable north korea makes good on its threat to test an icbm of a kind that could someday hit the united states  analysts said  trump and his aides are likely to weigh new u s  sanctions to tighten financial controls  an increase in naval and air assets and joint military exercises in and around the korean peninsula and accelerated installation of new missile defense  systems in south korea  the official said  trump has also made clear that he believes china has not done enough to use its influence to help rein in pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic programs  the u s  official told reuters that trump would now step up pressure on beijing  but acknowledged that there were limits to how far china would go  especially in enforcing sanctions  because of its own interests in avoiding destabilization of north korea  it remains to be seen  however  whether the new administration might go a step beyond obama s approach and focus on imposing  secondary sanctions  on firms and entities that help north korea s weapons programs  many of which are in china  also unclear is whether trump s phone call last week with chinese president xi jinping  in which the u s  president backed  away from his threat to break from america s long standing  one china  policy  would engender greater cooperation from beijing on north korea   beijing has enormous leverage over pyongyang thanks to being one of its only trading partners and in fact could not survive without chinese economic assistance   said harry kazianis  director of defense studies at the conservative   center for the national interest  riki ellison  who heads the missile defense advocacy alliance  an industry group  said trump should also move quickly to beef up missile defense in both south korea and japan   for which the obama administration has already laid much of the groundwork   he cannot ignore this   he said   it has to be swift   north korea s repeated missile launches prompted washington and seoul to agree to deploy a terminal high altitude area defense  thaad  anti missile battery in south korea later this year  a system strongly opposed by beijing  which worries that its powerful radar undermines its own security
