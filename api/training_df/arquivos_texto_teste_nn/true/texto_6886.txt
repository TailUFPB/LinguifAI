washington  reuters    the obama administration is unlikely to release a massive report on the cia s use of waterboarding and other  enhanced interrogation techniques  widely considered torture  a top democrat on the congressional intelligence committee said on tuesday  representative adam schiff told reporters it was more likely  before president barack obama leaves office next month  that the white house might take action so the report could be released someday via a freedom of information act  foia  request    the most that we might expect this administration to do    is to designate it as some kind of a record that would ultimately lead to its availability through foia  subject to redaction   schiff said at a breakfast meeting with reporters sponsored by the christian science monitor  he said he supported  as much information being shared as possible   senator dianne feinstein and other congressional democrats have urged obama to declassify and release the   page senate intelligence committee report before republican president elect donald trump is inaugurated on jan    feinstein chaired the panel as it researched and wrote the report  and she spearheaded the effort to expose the cia s actions  the committee  then led by democrats  released a  page executive summary of its findings in december   but the full report has been seen as too sensitive to release   i don t think the incoming administration will have any interest in publishing the greater part of the document   schiff said  however  he added that he did not expect that waterboarding would resume   within the ic  intelligence community  there would be such massive resistance to this  it just isn t going to happen   schiff said  trump promised during his campaign that he would not only revive waterboarding  but bring back  a hell of a lot worse  if elected  however  he said more recently that retired marine corps general james mattis  his nominee as secretary of defense  had persuasively argued against it  a white house spokesman said he had nothing to announce about the report  but reiterated obama s opposition to torture  obama ended the use of  enhanced interrogation techniques  via executive order just after he took office in january   led by republican senator john mccain and feinstein  congress has since passed legislation outlawing their use
