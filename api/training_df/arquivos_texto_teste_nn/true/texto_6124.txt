washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday declined to hear an appeal by texas seeking to revive the state s strict republican backed voter identification requirements that a lower court found had a discriminatory effect on black and hispanic people  the justices let stand a july  decision by a lower court that found that the  texas statute ran afoul of a federal law that bars racial discrimination in elections and directed a lower court to find a way to fix the law s discriminatory effects against minorities  there were no noted dissents from the high court s decision not to hear the case from any of the eight justices  but chief justice john roberts took the unusual step of issuing a statement explaining why the case was not taken up  noting that litigation on the matter is continuing in lower courts  roberts said that although there was  no barrier to our review   all the legal issues can be raised on appeal at a later time   the law  passed by a republican led legislature and signed by a republican governor  had been considered one of the strictest of its type in the united states  it was challenged in court by the u s  justice department under former president barack obama  civil rights groups and individual voters  critics including the obama administration had said the texas law and similar statutes enacted in other republican governed states were tailored to make it harder for minorities including black and hispanic voters  who tend to support democrats  to cast ballots  backers of these laws have said they are necessary to prevent voter fraud  despite little evidence of such fraud  the seven types of government issued identification permitted under the law as proof of identity included a driver s license  a concealed handgun license  a military id card and a u s  passport but not state university id cards or identification issued to obtain welfare benefits  a special  judge panel of the new orleans based  u s  circuit court of appeals ruled   that the texas law had a discriminatory effect and violated the u s  voting rights act  the judges were divided differently on other parts of the ruling  the appeals court directed a federal district court to examine claims by the plaintiffs that the law was actually intended to be discriminatory  rather than merely having a discriminatory effect  a hearing on that part of the case was scheduled for tuesday but has now been delayed following a request from president donald trump s administration  while obama s administration had backed the challenge to the texas requirements  the trump administration could change course  republican texas attorney general ken paxton  whose office launched the appeal  said he was disappointed by the court s action   texas enacted a common sense voter id law to safeguard the integrity of our elections  and we will continue to fight for the law in the district court  the fifth circuit  and if necessary  the supreme court again   paxton said in a statement  challengers of the texas law have said that up to   people would be unable to vote if the law were fully in effect because of the large number of voters who lack the limited types of permissible identification  after the appeals court ruling  texas and the plaintiffs struck a deal for a short term remedy to be used for the november  election  the texas law is one of several passed by republican legislatures since   a similar law in north carolina was struck down by a federal appeals court in july
