washington  reuters    the u s  senate s senior democratic tax law writer says he will rip up a root of corporate tax avoidance if his party wins senate control in november  targeting trillions of dollars in tax deferred profits being held abroad by u s  companies  in an interview with reuters  oregon senator ron wyden   said he wants to put an end to a kennedy era law that lets u s  corporations indefinitely hold profits from active business operations offshore without paying u s  tax on them   corporate tax avoidance is under trans atlantic assault  the eu has slapped a    billion back taxes bill on apple inc  ten days ago  the obama administration imposed another in a series of recent clamp downs on tax avoidance  the idea of ending tax deferral of foreign profits has been kicked around for years  wyden    is a long time proponent and might finally be able to do something about it  if voters support enough senate democrats in the nov   elections   this is going to be front and center at the beginning of january   said wyden  who is the top democrat on the tax law writing senate finance committee  the panel and the full senate are presently controlled by republicans  wyden said his first action  if he becomes chairman  will be to propose a funding package to upgrade u s  infrastructure  it would require u s  companies to bring home more than   trillion in foreign profits held offshore as part of an international tax reform package  a previous tax  holiday  for profits held offshore was tried in  but was voluntary  not mandatory  under that program    billion in foreign profits was  repatriated  at a discounted tax rate of   percent  far below the statutory corporate income tax rate of  percent  wyden has not specified a rate for his proposal  six years later  with corporations pushing for another such holiday  a congressional committee said the  program had little economic impact and cost the u s  treasury about    billion in lost revenue   the tax reforms wyden envisions would also lower corporate tax rates and simplify the convoluted u s  tax code to prevent tax planners from  gaming  the system  the code has not been thoroughly overhauled in  years   the first bill out of the gate would be roads and bridges and transportation   wyden told reuters on friday   my sense is that there will be an interest among members in using a portion of the money derived from international reform for the roads and bridges and transportation systems   most multinationals and many lawmakers  both republicans and some democrats  favor a foreign profit repatriation program  but not like the one wyden wants   the united states has a  worldwide  corporate income tax system that taxes profits of u s  companies no matter where they are made  with some exceptions  one is that earnings from active business operations  as opposed to passive income such as rent or royalties  can be left offshore on a tax free basis under the kennedy era deferral rule  passive income is taxed  in contrast  most large countries have  territorial  systems in which companies pay income tax only to the government of the country where the profits were made  corporate america has been lobbying for many years for a territorial system that would make deferral obsolete  wyden and other democrats want to keep a worldwide system and eliminate deferral  a position singled out for criticism last week by house speaker paul ryan    the fear i have is the progressives who kind of control the democratic party don t think anything close to what looks like tax reform is a good thing   ryan told the economic club of new york   i hope that view changes   but wyden says the public is unlikely to accept a system under which u s  corporations do not pay taxes on foreign profits   at a time when americans are so angry about jobs being shipped overseas    i don t think it s going to go over very well   he said   a competitive rate  no deferral and no gaming  i m going to argue gets you the benefit of territorial   some republicans also oppose tying tax reform to infrastructure  wyden says failing to reform the tax code could strain u s  relations with the european union  if eu state aid probes continue to penalize u s  companies  possibly resulting in u s  action before the world trade organization   to democrats and republicans  this feels more like the european commission declaring open season on the american tax base than  them  joining us to fight tax dodgers   he said   i could see members saying the united states should respond with a wto case   wyden added   there s that kind of anger
