new york  reuters    it has proven one of donald trump s greatest strengths in building a worldwide luxury brand  an obsessive attention to detail  down to the curtains hanging in hotel rooms and the marble lining the lobby floor  as president  it may prove one of his major liabilities  presidential historians warn  interviews with a dozen people familiar with how trump conducts business reveal the president elect as a micromanager who regularly spars over details about decor in projects across his real estate and branding empire    i m very much involved in the details   trump said during a june deposition in a lawsuit stemming from his development of a washington hotel   i was involved in the design of the building and the room sizes and the entrances and the lobby and the marble and the bathrooms and the fixtures and the bars and a lot of things   trump announced on wednesday that he would leave his businesses  in total  so that he could focus on the presidency  but those who have worked with him say a lifetime habit of micromanaging may be difficult to break  providing ammunition for critics who say his decisions as president will be driven by his private interests  a former employee of the trump organization who has worked closely with trump was skeptical that he could leave behind his beloved company after spending decades building it up   i can t picture him stepping aside for the presidency   the ex employee said  even if he does make a clean break  trump will have to guard against getting bogged down in the bureaucratic minutiae inherent in the office  he should avoid the example of president jimmy carter  another famous micromanager  who spent his first months in office poring over the white house tennis court schedule  said ross baker  a professor of political science at rutgers university  micromanagers rarely make successful presidents  said rick ghere  an associate professor of political science at the university of dayton in ohio  to be effective  presidents must delegate authority to members of their cabinet and rely on a range of expertise  he said   being a decisionmaker in a high level public position is a lot different than being a ceo   ghere said  trump has said he will turn the trump organization over to his three adult children  who are already deeply involved in real estate projects around the world   his daughter ivanka  for instance  was charged with overseeing the renovation of washington s old post office pavilion  a   million project to turn the historic building into a luxury hotel  in cases where trump has delegated authority  he still demonstrates a deep reluctance to let go  even when it comes to seemingly trivial details   two people who participated in an inspection of the washington hotel with trump shortly before he announced his candidacy in june  remember the businessman growing incensed over a detail  the restoration of exterior windows   trump said the windows looked terrible  though one of the sources recounting the story said there didn t seem to be anything obviously wrong with them  he demanded the contractor not be paid but was told the work had been done for free in the hopes of getting more business from the trumps  according to the source   that source and two others on the project also recalled hearing ivanka say she needed her father s approval before signing off on some decisions she wanted to make on the project  the sources said it was not uncommon for her to say she would  run this by my father  or  check with new york    trump spokeswoman hope hicks said trump is  incredibly detail oriented as any great developer is  something he shares with his adult children including ivanka   trump s reluctance to step aside from his company was apparent in a new york times interview last week in which he said   in theory i could run my business perfectly  and then run the country perfectly   trump s reputation as a micromanager dates back to some of his earliest building projects  in her  book  all alone on the  floor   barbara res  who oversaw construction of trump tower in manhattan  described her boss in  agonizing over the height and thickness of decorative trees in the building s atrium  three decades later  trump would bring his management style to the presidential campaign trail  three sources who worked on the campaign said trump made almost all the decisions on spending  strategy  and messaging  according to the sources  senior campaign officials were desperate to get aboard the candidate s plane early on in the presidential race  fearful if they were left behind he would change course on strategy and they would be shut out   when paul manafort  who was helping run trump s campaign  secured the candidate s authorization to spend   million hiring field operatives  he was triumphant  according to a republican national committee member  recounting an rnc meeting with manafort in april   the committee member though was perplexed   why had manafort needed trump s approval for an expenditure on such an essential part of his campaign  and why was the amount so small  at that point in an election year  past candidates had already begun spending upwards of   million on the same thing  manafort told reuters that while it was true most candidates simply signed off on a budget rather than reviewing each expenditure  trump was different because he was partly funding his campaign   i understood it and totally agreed with that approach   manafort said  later in the campaign  trump was still agonizing over details  in october  he insisted on reviewing the script of a radio ad that was to be broadcast on stations with predominantly black audiences  according to a source inside the campaign   micromanaging is not necessarily a recipe for disaster   presidents like abraham lincoln  carter and barack obama gained reputations as micromanagers  said nancy koehn  a professor at harvard business school who studies the history of leadership in the united states  but koehn said a micromanager with a lack of any government experience was a potentially toxic combination    i think it is highly likely that diving into areas in which he has very little experience without an extraordinary cast of experts around him will result in poor policy decisions which will have large unintended consequences   she said  only two of trump s nominees so far have u s  federal executive branch experience  although the lineup does include a state governor  several u s  lawmakers  and a former goldman sachs executive
