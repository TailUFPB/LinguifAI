 reuters    several states said on thursday they would move forward with legal challenges to a revised executive order signed by president donald trump this week that temporarily bars the admission of refugees and some travelers from a group of muslim majority countries  the new travel order  which is set to take effect on march   changed and replaced a more sweeping ban issued on jan   that caused chaos and protests at airports  the first order was hit by more than two dozen lawsuits  including a challenge brought by washington state and joined by minnesota  in response to washington s suit  u s  district judge james robart in seattle ordered an emergency halt to the policy last month  that ruling was upheld by an appeals court in san francisco  washington state attorney general robert ferguson said on thursday he planned to ask robart to confirm that his ruling would also apply to trump s revised order  which would halt it from being implemented  ferguson told a news conference the new order harmed a  smaller group  of individuals but that would not affect the state s ability to challenge it in court   he said the burden was on the trump administration to show that the court ruling from last month did not apply to its new policy   a u s  department of justice spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation  the government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks  new york s attorney general  eric schneiderman  said on thursday he would be joining washington s lawsuit against the new ban and the state of oregon said it would join too   the opposition comes on top of a separate legal challenge to the new ban brought by hawaii on wednesday  hawaii had also sued over the previous order and is seeking to amend its complaint to include the new ban  a hearing in that case is set for next wednesday  a day before the clock starts on the new order      the states and immigration advocates argue the new ban  like the original one  discriminates against muslims  trump s new executive order was designed with the intention of avoiding the legal hurdles   while the new order keeps a  day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen  it excludes iraq   refugees are still halted from entering the country for  days  but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria  the revisions include explicit exemptions for legal permanent residents or existing visa holders and waivers are allowed on a case by case basis for some business  diplomatic and other travelers       the first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving  standing   which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy  with so many exemptions  legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals a court would rule have a right to sue
