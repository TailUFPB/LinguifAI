new york   presumptive republican nominee donald trump told reuters in a wide ranging interview on tuesday that he would be willing to talk to north korean leader kim jong un to try to stop pyongyang s nuclear program  he also called for a renegotiation of the paris climate accord and said he would dismantle most of the dodd frank financial regulations if he is elected president  here are excerpts of the interview  on speaking to kim jong un   i would speak to him  i would have no problem speaking to him  at the same time  i would put a lot of pressure on china because economically we have tremendous power over china  people don t realize that  they are extracting vast billions of dollars out of our country  billions  and we have tremendous power over china  china can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call   on breaking up big banks    the big banks aren t big banks compared to other big banks  in other words if you look at the big banks in germany or if you look at the big banks in china  i have the biggest bank in the world right downstairs four or five floors below us      if we make our big banks too much not big  they won t be able to compete with the banks from china and the banks from germany and other big banks   on repealing dodd frank    i m going to be making a statement about this in approximately two weeks having to do with dodd frank  much of it is very bad  much of it gives so much power to the regulators that the bankers are unable to function    dodd frank has made it impossible for bankers to function      it makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs  for people with businesses to create jobs  and that has to stop  and will there be bad loans made  yes  but there are bad loans made now with dodd frank  ok  i mean all you have to do is take a look    the rules and regulations of dodd frank have made it so impossible to carry out business and to  especially with respect to lending to businesses who are going to employ a lot of people  so i m going to make a statement about it  but dodd frank   i mean there are some things in dodd frank that can stay but overall dodd frank has been very bad   on tech stocks   you have a stock market that is very strange  could be a little bit similar to  would you say it s nine years ago now  i guess it s sort of nine years ago  but you know  you look at some of these tech stocks that are so  so weak as a concept and a company and they re selling for so much money  and i would have said can that ever happen again  i think that could happen again    i m talking about companies that have never made any money  that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars  so here we go again   on auditing the fed    i think number one  the federal reserve should be audited  you know  they re not auditing it  and so far not too many people have been able to tell me why  i m not one that says we should get rid of the federal reserve because i think the federal reserve has an important function  but it should certainly be audited and     we should at least watch what they re doing from the dollar standpoint   on timing for audit the fed legislation    it s not my highest priority  i have other priorities like rebuild our military      it s not my number one priority  but certainly it s one of the things that we ll be doing   on replacing fed chair janet yellen    i m not a person that thinks janet yellen is doing a bad job  i happen to be a low interest rate person  unless inflation rears its ugly head  which could happen at some point  it doesn t seem like it s happening any time soon  i don t think i want to at this point   i mean  number one  she s got time left    i would rather have a republican in the position  but i am not the enemy of janet yellen      look  if interest rates were raised and if the dollar went up more  we d be doing no business  we re being killed by other countries devaluing their currencies   on the paris accords   not a big fan  no  not a big fan because other countries don t adhere to it and china doesn t adhere to it  and china s spewing into the atmosphere    take a look at china with certain agreements where they have to do it within  years  and we have to do it almost immediately  you understand what i mean by that  the agreements are not fair agreements  number one  and i would say that i will be looking at that very  very seriously  and at a minimum  i will be renegotiating those agreements  at a minimum  ok  and at a maximum  i may do something else  but those agreements are one sided agreements  and they re bad for the united states   on devaluation of the yuan   china was in big trouble a year ago  now all of a sudden they cut their currency  they re taking more business out of the united states      china  whenever they have a problem  they devalue their currency  and they take more money out of the united states  jobs  money  product   trade   we cannot allow china and other countries to rip the soul out of our country  and they will understand that   south china sea   they re building a massive fortress in the south china sea  they re not supposed to be doing that    on russian presence in ukraine   i don t like it  i don t like it at all   on russian president vladimir putin   putin made very nice statements about me  very strong  very nice statements  i think that s not a bad thing  that s a good thing   i think i ll have a good relationship with russia  and i may not  and the fact that he s said good things about me doesn t mean that  you know  it s going to help him in a negotiation  it won t help him at all  and i ll know pretty soon in whether or not i ll have a good relationship with russia  but wouldn t it be wonderful if we actually did have a good relationship with foreign countries as opposed to the way they re treating us now    everyone knows  you know on nov    they re going to announce new   the numbers are going to come out for obamacare  they are going to be catastrophic    it s beyond terrible healthcare  and obamacare in   collapses  don t forget  obama pushed everything to   because he ll be out on the golf course  he ll be playing a nice round of golf someplace  obamacare is part of the bubble problem  now  we re going to terminate obamacare  and we re going to replace it with something much better and much less expensive    well  the lines are very important  the lines meaning the state borders  these people are protected from competition  and you go to these states and they have   it s almost like a monopoly in many of the states  you have to get rid of the lines  and they almost did it with obamacare  it almost worked out     i think that medicaid should be sent to the states  ok  let them work it    it s very important that we protect social security and our medicare without cuts  and i m the only republican that says that      i think he was inappropriate  i think he was totally inappropriate  he s got plenty of problems  and i think he was inappropriate  so that s fine    i m sure i ll have a good relationship with him
