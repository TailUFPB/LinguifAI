washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on tuesday wrestled with the question of under what circumstances judges can recall jurors to duty after they have rendered a verdict  in a case involving a man seeking damages after suffering injuries in a montana car accident  the justices  during an hour of arguments  indicated that a gap of just a few minutes in which there is no opportunity for jurors to be exposed to any information that could prejudice their views of the case may be permissible  that would mean north dakota man rocky dietz  who sued a man named hillary bouldin for negligence after the  accident in the city of bozeman  would lose his bid for a new trial  bouldin ran a red light and his vehicle hit the passenger side of dietz s vehicle  bouldin admitted he was responsible for the collision  the jury initially awarded dietz nothing  but the judge recalled the jurors within minutes after they had been discharged from duty  reminding them that bouldin s lawyers had earlier stipulated dietz was due at least    to cover medical expenses already incurred  the jury subsequently awarded    to dietz  dietz s lawyers objected to the judge s action to recall the jury  contending that the fact that the jurors initially had awarded him no money indicated they were not fair and impartial toward him  the justices sought clarity on the outer boundaries of what could be permissible in recalling a jury  such as the amount of time the jury was discharged or whether jurors had a chance to leave the courthouse before being recalled  questions from justices including chief justice john roberts indicated their greatest concern was to ensure jurors would not be exposed to prejudicial information after being discharged    why doesn t it make sense to say  well  if they re right out in the hall     bring them back in and ask  just as the judge did here   have you talked to anybody about the case    roberts asked  justice stephen breyer said if there are no signs of prejudice  it would be more efficient to recall the jurors rather than conduct a new trial with a different jury    now  if it saves a lot of money  and that s the only difference  why don t we say the efficiency argument is what counts   breyer asked  justice sonia sotomayor  a former trial judge  noted that immediately after some trials juries can be exposed to prejudicial remarks  including expressions of emotion from family members and comments from court staff  a ruling is due by the end of june
