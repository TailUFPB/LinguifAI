geneva  reuters    u s  president donald trump is  closing the door  on people fleeing islamic state  and may try to re open secret detention centers where torture can be used  human rights watch  hrw  said on wednesday  calling on congress to intervene  a temporary ban on refugees that trump is expected to sign this week is a  particularly ugly  policy among a range of populist initiatives that could also breach the u s  constitution  the rights group said  trump looks set to  stop refugee admissions to the united states  ostensibly on security grounds   hrw head kenneth roth told a news briefing in geneva    but in order to score a political point at home  trump is closing the door on them  that is one particularly ugly aspect of what he is doing    it s as if trump is indifferent to the extraordinary suffering that many of these refugees have been through  many of these people are fleeing isis  islamic state   or the isis equivalents around the world   he said  hrw  one of the biggest international human rights groups  based in the united states  said it feared trump would  start refilling guantanamo  and possibly use  dark sites  on foreign soil for detainees   one thing we expect either today or later this week is an order from trump to begin exploring     the resumption of cia dark sites   said roth  an american   the washington post published on wednesday a draft executive order   detention and interrogation of enemy combatants   that could open the way for terrorism suspects to be interrogated in secret prisons abroad   last time  these black sites were often in democracies   they were in poland  latvia  romania  if you look around the world  they were in places like morocco  egypt  jordan  thailand  afghanistan   roth said   i hope all these governments and the other prospective governments say  no  this time around  that they don t want to be complicit in any new u s  torture scheme   obama closed black sites and ordered a halt to waterboarding  a form of simulated drowning  which experts say constitutes torture banned under international law  trump promised during his campaign to bring back waterboarding and  a hell of a lot worse    if trump is going to start toying with the army field manual and weakening its preclusion of torture or other forms of inhumane and cruel interrogation  that would be very problematic   roth said  he called on congress to exercise oversight over the new administration and  stand up for the constitution and international human rights law    obviously people are afraid of trump at this stage because he does have the bully pulpit  but that s when an independent congress standing up for principles is particularly important
