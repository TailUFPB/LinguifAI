washington  reuters    winning over bernie sanders supporters who flocked to his insurgent presidential campaign will be the first and possibly toughest order of business for hillary clinton after she became the presumptive democratic presidential nominee this week  every time the vermont senator mentioned clinton s name at a rally in california on thursday night  his supporters booed as if she was donald trump  the republican businessman who will face off against clinton in the nov   election  but clinton is wasting no time in launching her charm offensive  she called sanders on tuesday night  and during a celebratory rally in brooklyn she praised his candidacy  saying their  vigorous debate  during the nominating contest had been good for the democratic party   democrats in both camps said they expect to see more specific olive branches offered to sanders in the weeks ahead  including compromises on the issues platform to be adopted at the party s july nominating convention and reforms in a democratic primary process that sanders criticized as rigged to favor the establishment  it may not be an easy sell for all of sander s supporters  who have helped catapult him from political obscurity into the national spotlight  cheering his message on income inequality  campaign finance reform and wall street excesses  given little chance a year ago  sanders earned nearly  million votes and won more than  states during the nominating process  a reuters ipsos poll in may found sanders supporters have become increasingly resistant to clinton in the past few months  with less than half saying they will vote for her if she becomes the party s nominee  last month   percent of sanders  supporters said they would vote for clinton over trump in the general election  but that was down from  percent in april  and  percent in march  and some groups supporting sanders plan to ramp up the pressure on superdelegates  prominent party officials who can vote for any candidate  in the last few weeks before clinton s nomination becomes official at the party convention in philadelphia   the people behind the occupy dnc convention facebook group  with around   members  are creating their own web based app to contact superdelegates  planning daily emails to urge them to switch to sanders  clinton moved to the left to fend off sanders during the primary battle  opposing the trans pacific partnership  an asian trade pact  and the keystone oil pipeline from canada  voicing support for a higher minimum wage and backing sanders  general goals of reining in wall street and reducing income inequality  her best move now to win over progressive voters who backed sanders would be showing she will stand behind those positions   one of the biggest points of skepticism that we hear from sanders supporters and even lukewarm clinton supporters is the question of whether she really meant the stuff she said in the primary   said adam green  co founder of the progressive change campaign committee   the next two weeks are a golden opportunity to make the answer apparent   he said  citing her pledges to seek criminal sentences for financial fraud  break up banks that pose economic risks and expand social security benefits  several democrats said trump may prove to be the chief motivator for sanders supporters to switch to clinton   trump has done more than anyone to push the sanders people toward clinton for the general election   said brad anderson  an iowa based democratic strategist who supported clinton in the primary and said he has seen signs of a shift in the last few weeks  clinton could make specific concessions or overtures to assuage sanders  particularly by eliminating the superdelegates from the primary process  sanders has complained about the involvement of superdelegates  who have heavily backed clinton  another easy way to get sanders  most passionate supporters on board is to simply hire them  says democratic strategist steve schale  that s what schale  a florida based staffer for president barack obama s  presidential campaign  did once the bitter primary fight between obama and clinton ended that year  florida was crucial to obama s prospects   and his campaign need a large operation to work on voter registration  persuasion  and turnout  clinton could offer sanders diehards a similar opportunity to stay involved   for a lot of these folks  the campaign is as much as social calling as it is a movement   he said  while there were concerns in  that clinton s supporters would be too disaffected to support obama  clinton endorsed him less than a month after the primary ended and unified the party  democratic party leaders may also help ease tensions  sanders will meet on thursday with obama and senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada
