isle of lewis  scotland  reuters    donald trump has played up his family roots from lewis  an island off the northwestern tip of scotland  but his success in the u s  republican presidential battle has not drawn the kind of rapture the billionaire might like from his home crowd  trump s mother  mary anne macleod  emigrated to the united states from the lewis village of tong in the early   and a visit from her property mogul son would certainly interest the friendly inhabitants of this weather beaten isle   but the kind of fiery oratory that has catapulted him to unexpected victories in the u s  primaries might be taken with a pinch of salt  according to tim durbin  manager of the post office in the capital stornoway   people here like proof and anything less than that is suspect   said durbin  a  year old american originally from kentucky who has lived here for a decade   there would certainly be lots of talk about him after he left  but the talk would be subdued and the laughter would be gentle    the islanders  wariness is apparent when the new yorker s name is mentioned  many smile politely and refuse to talk about him at all  making it difficult to gauge sentiment among the   strong population   but even such silence is significant in a place of strong community ties  according to critically acclaimed lewis novelist kevin macneil   if people from lewis were genuinely supportive of trump they would be more vocal in their views   he said   the lack of support for a grandson of the island speaks volumes   an exception is a facebook page called  isle of lewis supports trump for president  which has   likes   the businessman has become the presumptive republican nominee with a headline grabbing campaign in which he has traded insults with rivals  a suggestion muslims should be banned from entering the united states drew criticism from europe and led to the withdrawal of scottish business and academic accolades  trump argued last month  in a column in aberdeen s press and journal newspaper  that he had won over the skeptical people of scotland through tenaciousness after he built his golf course despite environmental hurdles  local opposition and lawsuits   scotland has already been won   and so will the united states   he wrote   trump called his scottish business project a  labor of love  and his trump international golf links website has a section dedicated to his scots  family genealogy    it would be funny if trump won  it might boost tourism   said donald  a lewis pensioner living near the macleod family seat   but only for a while   interjected his wife anne  with the caution habitual of the island  the couple recalled that trump s mother would visit from the united states in the summer  and trump s millionaire father fred would ship over a cadillac to carry her around the marshy island during her stay   you d end up in the ditch if you were trying to drive past them  i remember that   said donald with a laugh  lewis  in the outer hebrides island chain  is a picturesque place  dotted with lakes  hills and open tracts of moor and almost devoid of trees  a freezing gust can whip your breath away or a warm breeze can surprise you with its gentleness   trump stopped for a brief visit in   jetting in on his private plane when he was trying to launch a golf business near aberdeen in mainland scotland and holding a news conference   he has not returned since  although he has visited scotland several times and runs two golf courses on the mainland  one in ayrshire and another in aberdeenshire   he was then offered the possibility of an investment in lews  sic  castle  a run down victorian country house in stornoway built by another millionaire  sir james matheson  when he bought the island in the mid  century   he just didn t think he was going to make any money out of it  he knows his roots are here but he s more interested in his golf investments elsewhere   said council official nigel scott      people are not easily swayed in lewis  where strong bonds between neighbors and family are necessary to withstand the harshness of rural life  said calum iain macleod a presbyterian minister from the parish where mary anne macleod was born   when the atlantic is throwing a force  and you can barely stand and your windows are caked with salt  it is extreme and it is tough   he said   being on this island where the minch separates you from the center of gravity  you feel more vulnerable   he said  referring to a strait that separates the outer hebrides from the mainland  the influence of the church itself  which is well attended  also makes for a tranquil place  sundays are still almost entirely commerce free and pubs and hotels which serve alcohol are very few  in contrast to the rest of britain  trump s desire to recall his historic scottish roots may have another purpose  suggests novelist macneil   perhaps he simply wants a scotland shaped mirror to reflect back his own perceived glory
