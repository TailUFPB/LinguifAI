youngstown  ohio  reuters    in a new twist to his immigration proposals  u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump held out the possibility of legal status for millions of illegal immigrants  but only after many other border enforcement steps are taken  trump  in remarks to a small group of reporters whom he invited on his plane for the first time since accepting his party s nomination  said parts of his hardline immigration speech last week in phoenix had been misinterpreted and that he had in fact softened his position to some extent  the new york businessman said that before considering how to deal with millions of illegal immigrants who are obeying u s  laws and contributing to american society  he first wants to evict criminal elements like drug smugglers and build a border wall  any illegal immigrants who want to gain citizenship will have to first return to their home countries first and get in line behind legal applicants  he said  but for those who stay behind  trump said their cases would be considered at some undefined point  asked about a potential legal status for this group  trump did not rule it out   we re going to make that decision into the future  that decision will be made   he said   the first thing will be to get the bad elements out  the gang members  get  em all out  we secure the border  we stop the drugs from coming in  because the drugs are pouring in     we re going to build the wall  we need the wall to stop the drugs   such a piecemeal approach has been pushed by republican congressional leaders over the years because it is extremely hard to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the u s  congress  trump has struggled to strike the right tone on how he would take on illegal immigration if elected on nov    after flirting with a softer tone  he stuck to his hardline position in phoenix last week  saying that anyone in the united states illegally would be subject to deportation  trump  seated with vice presidential running mate mike pence in tan leather seats aboard his private jet  was relaxed for a session with reporters of more than a half hour  clearly feeling better about his campaign after polls showed him closing the gap with democratic rival hillary clinton  talking about his recent effort to appeal to african american voters  trump was asked if it was difficult to attract black voters since he has raised doubts about whether democratic president barack obama was born in the united states  trump waved off the question  saying it was an issue he did not want to get into anymore because reporters would seize on it  in  while under fire from trump  obama produced his long form birth certificate to prove that he was  indeed  born in hawaii   i don t talk about it because if i talk about that  your whole thing will be about that   trump said   so i don t talk about it   he said his focus for the final two months of the campaign will be mostly about how to create jobs for struggling middle class americans  i m all about the jobs now   he said  trump also pledged to participate in all three presidential debates  saying he considered it an important part of being a candidate  he also said he was fine with the moderators announced last week
