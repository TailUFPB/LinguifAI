washington  reuters    some u s  intelligence officials suspect that russian hackers who broke into democratic party computers may have deliberately left digital fingerprints to show moscow is a  cyberpower  that washington should respect   three officials  all speaking on condition of anonymity  said the breaches of the democratic national committee  dnc  were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to russian intelligence agencies or criminals  for example  said one official  the hackers used some cyrillic characters  worked during russian government business hours but not on russian religious or political holidays  either these guys were incredibly sloppy  in which case it s not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected  or they wanted us to know they were russian   said the official  private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities  these experts   who said they have examined the breach in detail   said the cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message  other giveaways  such as a tainted internet protocol address  also were difficult to find  russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than china s but not impossible to decipher  private sector experts said  but the russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years  security experts said  especially when they are trying to move quickly  false flags have grown more common  but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the dnc case  the two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions  said laura galante  head of global threat intelligence at fireeye  whose mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company  crowdstrike  russian officials have dismissed the allegations of moscow s involvement as absurd  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov  in his only response to reporters  said   i don t want to use four letter words    while private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political party s hacking months ago  embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the wikileaks anti secrecy group just as the democratic party prepared to anoint hillary clinton as its presidential candidate for the nov   election  dnc chairwoman  debbie wasserman schultz  resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination  u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  the committee is supposed to be neutral  the u s  intelligence officials conceded that they had  based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence  but suggested russia s aim probably was much broader than simply undermining clinton s campaign  they said the hack fit a pattern of russian president vladimir putin pushing back on what he sees as the united states and its european allies trying to weaken russia   call it the cyber equivalent of buzzing nato ships and planes using fighters with russian flags on their tails   said one official  two sources familiar with democratic party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of democratic party officials were targeted as well as servers   they said that the fbi had advised the dnc that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials  private accounts  they also said the fbi also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials  the dnc hired crowdstrike to investigate the hack  it spent  about six weeks  from late april to about june  or    monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers   who they believed were russian   operated inside the systems  one of the sources said  what actions  if any  the obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved  a former white house cyber security official said  in past cases  administration officials have decided to publicly blame north korea and indict members of china s military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming   and increased awareness brought to cyber security   outweighed potential risks  the former official said  but  the russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious   the former official said   russia is a much more aggressive  capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm  and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely  the former official  and a source familiar with the democratic party investigations  said that they also were unaware of any u s  intelligence clearly demonstrating that wikileaks had received the hacked materials directly from russians or that wikileaks  release of the materials was in any way directed by russians
