jackson  miss   reuters    nigel farage  a key figure in the successful campaign to get britain out of the european union  lent his support to republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday  saying trump represented the same type of anti establishment movement that he masterminded in his own country  farage appeared with trump before a cheering crowd of thousands at a rally in jackson  mississippi  farage partly based his brexit drive on opposition to mass immigration to britain that he said was leading to rapid change in his country   his appearance came as trump sought to moderate his own hardline stance against illegal immigration  in remarks broadcast on wednesday  trump backed further away from his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants  saying he would be willing to work with those who have abided by u s  laws while living in the country  trump summoned farage on stage in the middle of his appearance  shook his hand and surrendered the microphone to him  farage said he would not actually endorse trump because he did not want to repeat what he called president barack obama s meddling in british affairs when obama urged britons to vote to stay in the eu   i cannot possibly tell you how you should vote in this election  but you know i get it  i get it  i m hearing you  but i will say this  if i was an american citizen i wouldn t vote for hillary clinton if you paid me   farage said   in fact  i wouldn t vote for hillary clinton if she paid me   he added  trump has sought to align himself with the brexit movement  noting he had said before the june  referendum that britons should vote to leave  he visited one of his golf courses in scotland the day after the vote and boasted that he had predicted the outcome and called it a sign his own campaign would be successful  trump has since tumbled in national opinion polls and is fighting to remain competitive with democratic rival clinton with little more than two months to go until the nov   election   november  is our chance to redeclare american independence   trump said  borrowing a phrase farage used during the brexit campaign  farage drew parallels between the brexit movement and the support trump has received from many americans who feel left behind by washington   they feel people aren t standing up for them and they have in many cases given up on the whole electoral process and i think you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign   he said  trump s comments on immigration came in the second part of an interview conducted on tuesday with fox news anchor sean hannity  they signaled a further softening in his immigration position as he tries to bolster support among moderate voters and minority groups  trump  who defeated  rivals for the republican presidential nomination in part based on his opposition to illegal immigrants  said he would not permit american citizenship for the undocumented population and would expel lawbreakers  to qualify to remain in the united states  trump said  illegal immigrants would have to pay back taxes   no citizenship  let me go a step further   they ll pay back taxes  they have to pay taxes  there s no amnesty  as such  there s no amnesty  but we work with them   trump said   but when i go through and i meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject  and i ve had very strong people come up to me     and they ve said   mr  trump  i love you  but to take a person who s been here for  or  years and throw them and their family out  it s so tough  mr  trump    trump said   it s a very hard thing   trump said he would outline his position soon   well  i m going to announce something over the next two weeks  but it s going to be a very firm policy   trump told wpec  a cbs affiliate in west palm beach  florida  trump s new position seemed to resemble in some respects the failed  reform push by former republican president george w  bush  that effort offered a way to bring millions  out of the shadows  without amnesty and would have required illegal immigrants to pay a fine and take other steps to gain legal status
