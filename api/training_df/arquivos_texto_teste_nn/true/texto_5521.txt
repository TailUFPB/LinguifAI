washington chicago  reuters     this february  story has been refiled to show hsn inc has dropped trump home products  but sells trump presidential memorabilia in paragraph   it did not sell ivanka trump products   president donald trump blasted department store chain nordstrom inc on wednesday for dropping his daughter ivanka s clothing line  prompting critics to accuse him of misusing  public office to benefit his family s sprawling business empire  after trump s highly unusual move to use a white house platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his daughter  nordstrom reiterated that its action last week was based on declining sales of the ivanka trump products  but white house spokesman sean spicer characterized the move as a  direct attack  on the president s policies   my daughter ivanka has been treated so unfairly by  nordstrom  she is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing  terrible   trump wrote on wednesday on both his personal and official presidential twitter accounts  ethics officials who served past republican and democratic administrations said trump s tweet was both unprecedented for a president and troublesome   this is misuse of public office for private gains   richard painter  who served as republican president george w  bush s chief ethics lawyer  said in an email to reuters   and it is abuse of power because the official message is clear   nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration   norman eisen  an ethics adviser to democratic president barack obama  noted that several states have unfair competition laws  including california where nordstrom operates many stores  the tweet  he said  could spark lawsuits if the company s brand was being injured by an unfair attack  the wealthy new york real estate developer who became president on jan   has declined to sell off his businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid thorny conflicts of interest  trump on jan   said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons during his presidency  trump s web of international companies remains a bit opaque since he has refused to release his tax returns  which experts have said would provide a clearer view of his business interests  ethics experts have said trump s arrangement does little to address potential conflicts because he would still know what assets he owned  such as trump branded golf courses and hotels  and his family would continue to profit from them  ivanka trump ran a clothing and jewelry business bearing her name  in addition to other work for the trump organization   before saying she would resign when her father was sworn in as president  her father s various contentious actions and comments have prompted boycott efforts by critics and have driven some consumers away from trump family businesses  during a white house press briefing  spicer painted nordstrom s action as an attack on the president s daughter   for someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just not acceptable  and the president has every right as a father to stand up to them   spicer said  a spokeswoman for the ivanka trump brand declined to comment  on tuesday  first lady melania trump filed a   million defamation lawsuit accusing the daily mail british tabloid of damaging her brand by falsely reporting she had worked as an escort  the lawsuit said the article ruined a  unique  once in a lifetime opportunity  for the first lady but her lawyer said she  has no intention of using her position for profit   democrats pounced on trump for the tweet   i think it s inappropriate  but he s a totally inappropriate president   said nancy pelosi  the top u s  house of representatives democrat  senator bob casey  a democrat  in a tweet indicated the matter should be referred to the federal office of government ethics  nordstrom said it informed ivanka trump about its decision in early january   over the past year  and particularly in the last half of   sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now   the retailer told reuters  nordstrom shares initially fell after the president s criticism  but closed up  percent on the new york stock exchange  retailers still selling ivanka trump products include macy s inc  tjx cos  hudson s bay co  which runs high end chains like lord   taylor  and dillard s inc  retailers that have dropped ivanka trump include neiman marcus   hsn inc has stopped selling trump home products  but still sells trump presidential memorabilia  the move by some retailers to drop her products comes amid an ongoing campaign called  grabyourwallet  which encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to president trump  his family and his donors  usage of the hashtag on twitter rose dramatically on wednesday    president trump said he is going to have nothing to do with his family businesses   said robert weissman  president of liberal watchdog group public citizen   his reaction to developments with his daughter s business line suggests that claim is untrue   trump s tweet left fellow republicans in an uncomfortable position  republican senator david perdue of georgia told reuters of trump s tweet   that sounds like a personal matter to me   perdue added   he is a citizen and he is a citizen who is now president of the united states   republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin  asked whether the president should be criticizing a publicly traded company over its business dealings with trump s daughter  said   i don t know the answer to that question  let me think about what the answer is   since winning the presidential election on nov    trump has castigated specific companies on twitter but this was his first tweet involving a business tied to his family since the victory   a group including former white house ethics attorneys filed a lawsuit after trump took office accusing him of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments  in violation of the u s  constitution
