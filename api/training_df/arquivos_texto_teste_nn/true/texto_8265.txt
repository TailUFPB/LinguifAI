canfield  ohio cleveland  reuters    donald trump and hillary clinton opened a final two month sprint to the nov   election on monday with the republican presidential nominee suddenly looking stronger as he and his democratic rival took their bitter fight to ohio  both trump and clinton made overtures to a news media that each candidate sees as often hostile to them  talking to reporters on their private planes  clinton s session with reporters was her first news conference since last december  after eating a gyro at a diner in the cleveland area  trump rallied thousands of cheering supporters at a county fair in canfield  and clinton visited a brewery in cleveland  for a time  their planes were parked about  yards apart at the cleveland airport  a sign of ohio s importance in the election  ohio is considered one of four swing states   those that are not clearly in the democratic or republican camp   that could prove decisive in the electoral college vote that will ultimately determine the winner  the other swing states are florida  pennsylvania and virginia  trump was buoyed by more polls showing him in a competitive position  the latest reuters ipsos poll showed trump with  percent support vs  percent for clinton  effectively ending clinton s bump up in the polls after the democratic nominating convention  other polls showed clinton s lead had shrunk   i think we ve had a great month   trump said  clinton remained in a strong position to win the white house race  but trump and his team cited his growing strength in opinion polls nationally and in several states where the election is likely to be decided to argue that his message is breaking through to voters  clinton  who emerged into the public eye after days of raising money from wealthy donors behind closed doors  said she always knew the race would be close   we re just going as hard and fast as we possibly can to be organized for turning out the vote  because we ve always thought this was going to be hard  and that s why  you know  i m not worried  i m just working   she said  trump  shaking his fist triumphantly  plunged into a crowd at the mahoning county fair where supporters had built a replica of the wall that the republican nominee has pledged to build along the u s  mexico border    this has been an unbelievable reception   trump said after maneuvering through a crowd of people who shouted his name  against a backdrop of food stands offering fare ranging from chicken on a stick to italian sausages  fudge and fresh corn  inviting reporters onto his plane for the first time since accepting the republican presidential nomination  trump said his focus going forward will be on how to create jobs for middle class americans  he has spent most of the past two weeks trying to clarify his position on illegal immigration  first flirting with a softening  then reinforcing his hardline approach  and then  on his plane  saying undocumented people might ultimately get on a path to a legal status once border enforcement steps are taken   i m all about the jobs now   he said  saying his position on the immigration issue was now well known  he also pledged to participate in all three televised presidential debates  ending speculation that he might sit out one or more if he was not happy with the format  his first face off with clinton is at hofstra university in new york state on sept    clinton made her stop at a brewery in cleveland before heading to a nearby labor day parade and rally  where she tested a new jab at her opponent   friends don t let friends vote for trump    the labor day holiday traditionally kicks off the last stretch of campaigning ahead of the november election  speaking to reporters on her new campaign plane  she took credit for trump s overture to the news media  clinton  buffeted by controversy over her use of a private email server as u s  secretary of state  has been criticized by republicans and the news media for months for failing to hold a news conference   i heard now that we ve got this great plane  that donald trump actually invited his press on his plane where i m told he even answered a few questions   said clinton  trump s rebound from a series of self inflicted wounds follows the hiring of a new campaign management team  and the republican nominee is showing more discipline on the stump  trump has been helped by what his campaign said was a positive week last week  highlighted by a quick trip to mexico  appearing side by side with mexican president enrique pena nieto  and a visit to a black church in detroit  but an immigration speech that trump gave following his trip to mexico drew criticism from some of his hispanic supporters  and several backers advising him on the issue decided to part ways with his campaign  trump aide jason miller said rising poll numbers showed that the campaign was moving in the right direction   the trend lines are the important thing to point to   miller told reuters   the problem that clinton has is there is no positive information flow for her campaign   clinton  who was president barack obama s first term secretary of state  appeared at few public campaign events during the latter half of august  instead raising funds at high dollar events in the east coast vacation spots of martha s vineyard and the hamptons  and with celebrities in los angeles and high tech leaders in silicon valley  clinton s campaign announced that it had raised   million in august for her presidential bid and the democratic party  clinton is again on the defensive over her use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest with her family foundation while secretary of state  which have caused unease for some voters  but experts still see the democratic nominee as the odds on favorite to win the presidency
