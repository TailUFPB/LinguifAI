washington  reuters    president barack obama has approved giving the u s  military greater ability to accompany and enable afghan forces battling a resilient taliban insurgency  in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield  a u s  official told reuters   the senior u s  defense official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said the decision would also allow greater use of u s  air power  particularly close air support  however  the official cautioned   this is not a blanket order to target the taliban   obama s decision again redefines america s support role in  afghanistan s grinding conflict  more than a year after international forces wrapped up their combat mission and shifted the burden to afghan troops  it also comes ahead of obama s eagerly anticipated decision on whether to forge ahead with a scheduled reduction in the numbers of u s  troops from about   currently to   by the start of   a group of retired generals and senior diplomats urged obama last week to forgo those plans  warning they could undermine the fight against the afghan taliban  whose leader was killed in a u s  drone strike in pakistan last month  under the new policy  the u s  commander in afghanistan  general john nicholson  will be able to decide when it is appropriate for american troops to accompany conventional afghan forces into the field   something they have so far only been doing with afghan special forces  the official said  the expanded powers are only meant to be employed  in those select instances in which their engagement can enable strategic effects on the battlefield   the official said  that means that u s  forces should not be expected to accompany afghan soldiers on day to day missions   this added flexibility     is fully supported by the afghan government and will help the afghans at an important moment for the country   the official said  the decision is a departure from current u s  rules of engagement in afghanistan  which impose limits on u s  forces  ability to strike at insurgents  for example  the u s  military was previously allowed to take action against the taliban  in extremis    moments when their assistance was needed to prevent a significant afghan military setback  that definition  however  left the u s  military postured to assist them in more defensive instances  the new policy would allow u s  forces to accompany afghans at key moments in their  offensive campaign against the taliban   the u s  forces will more proactively support afghan conventional forces   the official said  the taliban control or contest more territory in afghanistan than at any time since they were ousted by a u s  backed intervention in late   and u s  officials have acknowledged the uneven performance of afghan security forces  large portions of afghanistan  including the provincial capital of northern kunduz and multiple districts of southern helmand province  have fallen  at times briefly  to the taliban over the past year and a half  many other districts and provinces are also under varying degrees of taliban control  the new authorities that obama has given the u s  military could give it greater leeway in addressing the shortcomings of afghan security forces  still  experts warn that its hard to predict when afghanistan will be able to stand on its own against the taliban  not to mention the country s enormous economic difficulties and fractious political system  the u s government s top watchdog on afghanistan told reuters that the united states had wasted billions of dollars in reconstruction aid to afghanistan over the past decade  and now a renewed taliban insurgency was threatening the gains that had been made
