new york  reuters    the chair of the house financial services committee has proposed getting rid of much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis  unveiling a plan on tuesday that ignited fierce debate in the presidential election but is expected to flame out in washington  in a sweeping speech at the economic club of new york  republican representative jeb hensarling  from texas  laid out his ideas on weakening the  dodd frank wall street reform law just as polls opened in six states holding presidential primaries  hensarling also met on tuesday with donald trump  the presumptive republican nominee who has called for dismantling the massive reform law  trump s campaign declined to comment on hensarling s plan  the lawmaker told fox business network on tuesday he would not describe the  blow by blow  of his meeting with trump but said they had common ground on dodd frank   meanwhile  the democrats  likely nominee  hillary clinton  sought to tie the real estate tycoon to hensarling s proposal   clinton  strongly opposes chairman hensarling and donald trump s efforts to gut critical reforms put in place to protect the public after the financial crisis   said her adviser gary gensler  who headed the commodity futures trading commission when dodd frank was passed   while republicans attempt to roll back measures that protect consumers and curb excessive risk taking on wall street  hillary clinton will fight to defend dodd frank and go beyond it  with tough new rules  stronger enforcement and more accountability    hensarling s plan would allow banks to choose between complying with dodd frank or meeting much tougher capital requirements  it would also throw out the volcker rule that restricts banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the financial stability oversight council consisting of regulatory agencies  heads to designate firms as  systemically important   also known as  too big to fail   that label triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by stricter regulations  in essence  hensarling said his plan involved  far more loss absorbing capital and far less federal control   it would also maintain the law s section on derivatives and keep the consumer financial protection bureau created by dodd frank  albeit with a changed structure   i m only replacing   percent of dodd frank   hensarling joked  few expect the plan  previewed in a video last week  to become law soon  while it could pass the republican controlled congress  it would then have to be signed by president barack obama  who also signed dodd frank into law   on tuesday white house spokesman josh earnest said reforms enacted after the crisis  essentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south   but obama leaves office in january and those vying to replace him  including senator bernie sanders running as a democrat  have distinct views on regulation and wall street   those on the left who gave us dodd frank believe in the principle that human nature is self destructive and that people    except themselves  of course   are fundamentally ignorant   hensarling said  demonstrating the political charge of his ideas   senator sherrod brown of ohio  a democrat mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick  shot back that republicans seek  to make life easier for mega bankers and tougher for ordinary americans    senator elizabeth warren  the massachusetts democrat who is a firebrand for stronger regulation  said  while most republicans in congress are debating not whether to run away from trump   but how far and how fast   congressman hensarling is sprinting toward trump tower    trump has given few clues to how he would take apart dodd frank and what he might put in its place    here s something we both agree with  and that is dodd frank is impeding economic growth   hensarling told fox business   i think he well received the message  i think he was interested in the policy   clinton has proposed breaking up large banks that take excessive risk  charging institutions a  risk fee   taxing high frequency trading  and creating more oversight of  shadow banking   the most liberal candidate  sanders has gone further and suggested reinstating the glass steagall law that once separated commercial and investment banking  james ballentine  head of congressional relations at  american bankers association  the industry s lead trade group  said both parties  agree that parts of dodd frank just aren t working    any law that generates more than   pages of proposed and final rules will inevitably include problems that should be fixed   he said in a statement
