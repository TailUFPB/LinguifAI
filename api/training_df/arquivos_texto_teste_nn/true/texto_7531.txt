new york  reuters    the raucous  passionate and unpredictable  u s  presidential election is on track to notch another distinction  the most wagered upon political event ever  with many opinion polls showing a tight race just one day before tuesday s election  record numbers of bettors are pouring millions into online platforms from ireland to iowa in the hope of capturing a financial windfall from a victory by democrat hillary clinton or republican donald trump   uk based internet betting exchange betfair said on sunday its  next president  market was set to become the most traded it had ever seen and expected to surpass even brexit  the contentious uk referendum to leave the european union  by sunday  roughly   million had been traded on who will become the next u s  president  compared with   million on the brexit referendum  betfair spokeswoman naomi totten said  the amount bet so far on the  contest dwarfs the roughly   million laid on the  race   we think it is because  of  how raw the brexit  vote  is in people s minds   they re not convinced yet that it s a done deal   totten said  most polls leading into britain s june  referendum predicted britons would choose to remain in the eu  instead  they voted to leave by a  percent to  percent margin  betfair s  next president  market was by far the largest of more than  markets on the site related to the u s  election  as of friday  some   million has been put into play on markets ranging from who will win the popular vote to how many states each party will carry  on ireland s paddy power  which merged with betfair earlier this year  the u s  presidential election  is definitely on course to be the biggest political event   said spokesman f√©ilim mac an iomaire  the site has had about    million bet on the race so far  for paddy power  sporting events remain the site s  bread and butter   with politics more of a  niche market   mac an iomaire said  nonetheless  he expects the  race to be among the top  most traded events on the site  even people with no knowledge of politics know who trump is  said mac an iomaire said  explaining the runaway popularity of the u s  election in betting markets   trump is such a huge celebrity   ladbrokes  a uk based gambling company  said about  million pounds  or a little over   million  had been bet on the  presidential election since its markets on the race opened four years ago  a ladbrokes spokesman said that amount was  at least double  the amount wagered on the  election  the three sites all reported an  percent probability of a clinton victory on tuesday  her probability shot up a few percentage points on sunday after the fbi stood by its earlier recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted against clinton in her use of a private email server   the vast majority of big dollar political betting occurs outside america  wagering on elections in the united states is limited by law to relatively small trading platforms connected to universities  which use data from the markets for academic research  still  the sites are abuzz with activity as the election nears  albeit in small amounts   on predictit  launched in  and jointly run by victoria university in wellington  new zealand  and washington  d c  based political consulting firm aristotle international inc  the five most active markets all related to the presidential election  predictit is not legally permitted to disclose the amount of money traded  but its top three markets have all reached the maximum number of participants  trading on the older iowa electronic markets  launched by the university of iowa in   has also been brisk  although a spokeswoman said she could not say if  was seeing substantially more volume than in   when president barack obama won re election against republican mitt romney  the latest reuters ipsos poll showed clinton with a  percentage point lead over trump in the national survey    percent to  percent   while races in the swing states of florida  north carolina had shifted from clinton s control to being too close to call  the predictit market gave clinton an  percent probability of winning the white house  iem s  winner takes all  market showed her with a  percent chance   betfair said on friday that trump was emerging as the clear favorite among one group of players in particular   brexit backers  two thirds of its customers who had supported a brexit outcome were also backing trump on betfair  paul krishnamurty  a professional gambler for  years who works as an analyst at betfair and a columnist at politico  is not one of them  he told reuters he stood to lose    if trump wins on tuesday  krishnamurty  who said he had earned roughly half a million dollars during his betting career  has laid money on several election related markets this year  he took a winning position on trump s selection of indiana governor mike pence as his running mate and bet against jeb bush during the republican nominating contests   he said he believed clinton would likely to win both north carolina and florida and that a trump victory was unlikely   i personally believe she will win in a landslide   krishnamurty said
