 reuters    below are the highlights from reuters  oct   exclusive interview with republican presidential nominee donald trump     hillary clinton  has no plan for syria  look  with her you ll end up in world war three  she doesn t know what she s doing  just like with libya  just like with everything else she s done  so syria now is no longer syria  syria is russia and the new iran that we built through the iran deal  which is one of the worst negotiated deals i ve ever seen  so you re not fighting syria anymore  you re fighting syria  russia and iran  alright  russia is a nuclear country  but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk    i say the first thing we have to do is get rid of isis before we start thinking about syria      syrian president bashar al  assad is secondary  to me  to isis    if hillary clinton ended the war and left troops behind  we wouldn t even be fighting for mosul right now  ok  she gave them mosul  she didn t know what she was doing  the woman is incompetent    one of the reasons we were going in was to get the isis leaders  but if that s the case  why didn t we go in as a surprise attack instead of   you know  with the element of surprise   instead of announcing three months ago that we re going into mosul    i would hope to have a good relationship with russia  and i would hope to have a good relationship with putin   i m not friends or enemies with the russians  i have nothing to do russia     clinton  always casts putin as a bad guy and a bad light  if she won  how is she going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil  he s not going to want to negotiate with her  number one  number two  i don t believe he has any respect for hillary clinton whatsoever   on philippine president rodrigo duterte saying he was against the presence of any foreign troops in his country   he probably made a deal with china    he s dealing with china and russia so he probably made a deal with china and russia    the philippines are a very important strategic location  he has no respect or liking of obama       i think it s a horrible thing that the united states is reduced to being thrown out of a country    there s a big group of people that are in that category  of world leaders who dislike obama  because obama wants to focus on his golf game  he doesn t want to take the time necessary to get along with people  it s too bad   wikileaks on tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of clinton s campaign manager  john podesta  that shows her democratic presidential campaign reacting after president barack obama said in a television interview that he learned of her private email server through news reports  trump s response   well  i now see why the president stuck up for hillary  because he didn t want to be dragged into it    because he knew all about her private server    this is a big thing  this means that he has to be investigated    thousands of people are standing there to vote  i think those people are very  very disappointed that the leaders  of the republican party  aren t helping us win    i know this  if the leaders were helping me  we couldn t lose this election  it would be an impossibility    the media s rigging the system  it s never been a pile on like this     i mean  they re rigging the polls  the polls are ridiculous  look at that one poll that came out  abc washington post  that was a democratic poll  they re rigging the system   an abc news washington post poll released on sunday showed clinton leading trump by  percentage points among likely voters
