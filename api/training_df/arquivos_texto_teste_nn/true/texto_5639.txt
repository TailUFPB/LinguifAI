washington palm beach  fla  reuters    u s  president donald trump said the justice department will win an appeal filed late saturday of a judge s order lifting a travel ban he had imposed on citizens of seven mainly muslim countries   we ll win  for the safety of the country  we ll win   he told reporters at his private mar a lago resort in palm beach  florida  shortly after the justice department filed a notice that it intends to appeal the order  trump s personal attack on u s  district judge james robart in seattle went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the white house and congress   the opinion of this so called judge  which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country  is ridiculous and will be overturned   trump said on twitter early on saturday  trump has said  extreme vetting  of refugees and immigrants is needed to prevent terrorist attacks  throughout the day  trump continued to criticize the decision in tweets  late saturday  trump showed no signs of backing down   the judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart  bad people are very happy   he tweeted  as the ban lifted  refugees and thousands of travelers from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by trump s executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the united states  the justice department did not say when it would file its appeal with the ninth circuit u s  court of appeals of the ruling made by robart late on friday that also lifted trump s temporary ban imposed on refugee admissions  the judge appointed by former republican president george w  bush questioned the constitutionality of trump s order   the three judge panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes appointees of george w  bush and two former democratic presidents  jimmy carter and barack obama  trump s tweets criticizing the judge s decision could make it tougher for justice department attorneys as they seek to defend the executive order in washington state and other courts  said jonathan turley  a law professor at george washington university  adding that presidents are usually circumspect about commenting on government litigation   it s hard for the president to demand that courts respect his inherent authority when he is disrespecting the inherent authority of the judiciary  that certainly tends to poison the well for litigation   turley said  u s  immigration advocacy groups including the american civil liberties union and international refugee assistance project on saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations  to consider rebooking travel to the united states immediately  because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold  a u s  state department email reviewed by reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including syrians as soon as monday  it is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary  which the u s  constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and congress  reached by email saturday  robart declined comment on trump s tweets  democratic u s  senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement saturday that trump s  hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing  it is dangerous  he seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis    read the  so called  constitution   tweeted representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  in an interview with abc scheduled to air on sunday  vice president mike pence said he did not think that trump s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers   i think the american people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them   pence said  according to an excerpt of the interview  the court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to trump s push to clamp down on immigration  his order set off chaos last week at airports across the united states where travelers were stranded and thousands of people gathered to protest  americans are divided over trump s order  a reuters ipsos poll this week showed  percent favored it while  percent did not  wes parker  a retiree from long beach  california  held a sign saying  trump is love  at the los angeles international airport  and said he supported the tighter measures   we just have to support the travel pause   said parker     if you were a new president coming in  wouldn t you want what you feel safe with   rights groups  democrats and u s  allies have condemned the travel ban as discriminatory  on saturday  there were protests against the immigrant curb in washington  new york  los angeles and other cities  at the white house  hundreds of protesters chanted  donald  donald can t you see  you re not welcome in d c   the sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would be immigrants back to airports  with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the united states will remain open  in erbil  the capital of the kurdish region of northern iraq  fuad sharef and his family prepared to fly on saturday to istanbul and then new york before starting a new life in nashville  tennessee   i am very happy that we are going to travel today  finally  we made it   said sharef  who was stopped from boarding a new york bound flight last week  the department of homeland security said on saturday it would return to its normal procedures for screening travelers  but that the justice department would file for an emergency stay of the order  at the earliest possible time   some travelers told reuters they were cautious about the sudden change   i will not say if i have hope or not  i wait  watch and then i build my hopes   said josephine abu assaleh    who was stopped from entering the united states after landing in philadelphia last week with five members of her family   we left the matter with the lawyers  when they tell us the decision has been canceled  we will decide whether to go back or not   she told reuters in damascus  speaking by telephone  virtually all refugees also were barred by trump s order  upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the united states  friday night s court decision sent refugee advocacy and resettlement agencies scrambling to help people in the pipeline  iraqi refugee nizar al qassab    told reuters in lebanon that his family had been due to travel to the united states for resettlement on jan    the trip was canceled two days before that and he was now waiting for a phone call from u n  officials overseeing their case    it s in god s hands   he said
