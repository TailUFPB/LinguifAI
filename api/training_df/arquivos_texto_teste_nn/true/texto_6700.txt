new york washington  reuters    president elect donald trump and some of silicon valley s most powerful executives met at his manhattan tower on wednesday  a summit convened to smooth over frictions after both sides made no secret of their disdain for each other during the election campaign  the meeting focused chiefly on economic issues  including job creation  lowering taxes and trade dynamics with china  while largely skirting the many disagreements the tech industry has with trump on matters ranging from immigration to digital privacy  according to a trump transition team statement       trump proposed reconvening with the tech leaders as often as every quarter  the statement said  three of trump s adult children  donald jr   eric and ivanka  sat at the head of a large rectangular table as the meeting began in a conference room on the  floor of trump tower  their attendance may fuel further concern about potential conflicts of interests for trump  who has said he would hand over control of his business empire to his children while he occupies the white house  vice president elect mike pence was also there  guests sat in front of paper name plates and bottles of water sporting the trump brand logo   the meeting between tech luminaries  including apple inc s tim cook  facebook inc s sheryl sandberg and tesla motors inc s elon musk  took place as trump has alarmed some u s  corporations with his rhetoric challenging long established policy toward china  a main market for silicon valley  a senior chinese state planning official told the china daily newspaper wednesday that beijing could slap a penalty on a u s  automaker for monopolistic behavior  a warning delivered  days after trump questioned acknowledging taiwan as part of  one china    the official did not identify the automaker   there s nobody like the people in this room  and anything we can do to help this go along we re going to do that for you   trump told the executives in the presence of reporters   you call my people  you call me  it doesn t make any difference  we have no formal chain of command   trump added   we re going to make fair trade deals  we re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders   other participants included alphabet inc s larry page and eric schmidt  amazon com s jeff bezos  microsoft corp s satya nadella  and ginni rometty from ibm       twitter was not invited to the meeting because it was too small  a transition spokesman told reuters  cook and musk joined trump for separate meetings after the other technology executives leave  according to a spokesman for trump s transition team  bezos said in a statement the meeting was  very productive  and that he  shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars  which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country  in all sectors  not just tech   agriculture  infrastructure  manufacturing  everywhere   trump clashed with silicon valley on several issues during the election campaign  including immigration  government surveillance and encryption  and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges  he has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors   you look at some of these tech stocks that are so  so weak as a concept and a company and they re selling for so much money   he told reuters in an interview in may  those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with china and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs     for some of the companies  there was some hesitation about whether to attend  because of sharp political and personal differences with trump  one tech industry source said  more than  employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on tuesday to refuse to help trump s administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations  silicon valley enjoyed a warm rapport with president barack obama and heavily supported democrat hillary clinton during the presidential campaign   alphabet s schmidt was photographed on election night at clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge  and musk said in interviews before the election that trump s character reflected poorly on the united states  despite those tensions  trump named musk to a business advisory council that will give private sector input to trump after he takes office on jan    the ceos of airbnb and uber were invited but did not attend wednesday s gathering  uber s travis kalanick  traveling in india all week according to a person familiar with his plans  was also appointed to the council  from the employees of the  largest fortune  tech companies  trump raised just    from  campaign donors who contributed more than    clinton raised    million from the employees of the same companies  with more than   donations  a reuters review of contribution data found   trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign  he urged his supporters to boycott apple products over the company s refusal to help the fbi unlock an iphone associated with last year s san bernardino  california  shootings  threatened antitrust action against amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the united states  trump has also been an opponent of the obama administration s  net neutrality  rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content  two advisers to his federal communications commission transition team are opponents of the rules  as are the two republicans on the fcc   last week  the two republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many obama policies and one  commissioner ajit pai  said he believed that net neutrality s  days are numbered
