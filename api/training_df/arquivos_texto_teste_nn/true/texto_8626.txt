 reuters    the u s  food and drug administration opened the door on tuesday to a change in its blood donor deferral recommendations  which currently prohibit donations from gay men for a year following their last sexual encounter in order to reduce the risk of transmitting hiv  the virus that causes aids  in december the fda overturned a  year ban on all blood donations from men who have sex with men  saying the change was based on science showing an indefinite ban was not necessary to prevent transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus  the fda is now signaling it may go further  gay rights advocates say the latest update did not go far enough and that the agency s recommendations should move closer to individual risk assessments  which could  for example  look at whether an individual has been in a monogamous relationship  their criticism intensified in the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando  florida  in june  which saw many gay men unable to donate blood even as blood banks put out calls for donors  in a notice posted to the federal register  the fda said it was establishing a public docket for comment about its current recommendations and that interested people should submit comments  backed by scientific evidence  supporting alternative potential policies to reduce the risk of hiv transmission   such suggestions  could include the feasibility of moving from the existing time based deferrals related to risk behaviors to alternate deferral options  such as the use of individual risk assessments   the agency said it would take the comments into account  as it continues to reevaluate and update blood donor deferral policies as new scientific information becomes available   the fda s action comes after  members of the u s  house of representatives  led by democrat mike quigley  vice chair of the congressional lgbt equality caucus  wrote to fda commissioner robert califf calling on him to end the current policy  saying it discriminated against men who have sex with men  a similar letter was signed by  senators  in a statement on tuesday  quigley said he was  encouraged  by the fda s announcement   the tragedy at pulse nightclub in orlando highlighted the discrimination gay and bisexual men face when attempting to donate blood to those in need   he said   moving towards an individual risk assessment would provide for a fair  equitable  nondiscriminatory blood donation policy  one based in science that allows all healthy americans to safely donate blood
