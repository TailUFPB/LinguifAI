washington  reuters    president donald trump declared china the  grand champions  of currency manipulation on thursday  just hours after his new treasury secretary pledged a more methodical approach to analyzing beijing s foreign exchange practices    in an exclusive interview with reuters  trump said he has not  held back  in his assessment that china manipulates its yuan currency  despite not acting on a campaign promise to declare it a currency manipulator on his first day in office   well they  i think they re grand champions at manipulation of currency  so i haven t held back   trump said   we ll see what happens   during his presidential campaign trump frequently accused china of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make chinese exports cheaper   stealing  american manufacturing jobs  but treasury secretary stephen mnuchin told cnbc on thursday he was not ready to pass judgment on china s currency practices  asked if the u s  treasury was planning to name china a currency manipulator any time soon  mnuchin said he would follow its normal process of analyzing the currency practices of major u s  trading partners  the treasury is required to publish a report on these practices on april  and oct   each year     we have a process within treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board  we ll go through that process  we ll do that as we have in the past   mnuchin said in his first televised interview since formally taking over the department last week   we re not making any judgments until we go continue that process   a formal declaration that china or any other country manipulates its currency requires the u s  treasury to seek negotiations to resolve the situation  a process that could end in punitive tariffs on the offender s goods  the u s  treasury designated taiwan and south korea as currency manipulators in   the year that congress enacted the currency review law  china was the last country to get the designation  in    the current situation is complicated because china s central bank has spent billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves in the past year to prop up the yuan to counter capital outflows  the international monetary fund said last year that the yuan s value was broadly in line with its economic fundamentals  the u s  treasury also said in its last currency report in october that its view of china s external imbalances had improved somewhat  trump s pronouncements about the yuan could also complicate matters for mnuchin as he prepares for his first meeting next month with his group of  finance minister counterparts in baden baden  germany
