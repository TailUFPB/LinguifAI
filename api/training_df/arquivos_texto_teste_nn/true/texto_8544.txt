washington san francisco  reuters    democratic u s  presidential candidate hillary clinton s campaign has solicited advice from california regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn based ethanol be blended into the nation s gasoline supply  according to campaign and state officials      the move is the clearest sign yet that  if elected  clinton would seek to adjust the regulation  called the renewable fuel standard  possibly hurting her chances in corn growing states like iowa where she faces a tough battle against republican rival donald trump in the nov   election  the renewable fuel standard  created by congress in   mandates that transportation fuel sold in the united states contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels  it was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the u s  renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil  it is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers   clinton advisers have contacted the california air resources board  carb  to discuss whether a policy like california s low carbon fuel standard  a market based system rather than a mandate  could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the renewable fuel standard  and other issues  carb officials said  mary nichols  head of the carb  said she discussed the state s regulations with clinton advisers  while a backer of the low carbon fuel standard  nichols said she told clinton s advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon reduction strategies instead  such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal fired electricity  nichols did not provide further details on the discussions  a clinton campaign official  who asked not to be named  confirmed the discussions with carb but gave no further details   a campaign spokesman  tyrone gayle  said the campaign has been seeking advice from  a diverse set of stakeholders   he added that the clinton campaign  does not support replacing the rfs with a national low carbon fuel standard  but did not elaborate  former obama administration climate and energy adviser heather zichal said on the sidelines of the democratic national convention in philadelphia last week that the renewable fuel standard was broken  but that a clinton administration could make  modifications  to fix it   mandates aren t necessarily a perfect way to regulate   zichal said at the event  the u s  corn lobby hopes to convince both clinton and trump to uphold the regulation  which requires a doubling of u s  biofuels use to  billion gallons per year by   when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire  the program is designed to last indefinitely after that  environmentalists  anti hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve  market based system the california regulation  a key part of the state s effort to combat climate change  requires a  percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by   but leaves it up to companies to decide how to reach that target      california enacted the low carbon fuel standard in  targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the state s market  it angered midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending  effectively blocking many of those imports  oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly  clinton in may expressed support for the federal renewable fuel standard in an opinion piece published in an iowa newspaper  but said it could be improved  clinton s openness to overhauling the renewable fuel standard appears to contrast with trump s position  during the state by state battle for the republican presidential nomination  trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the renewable fuel standard  corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the clinton and trump campaigns to argue in favor of the renewable fuel standard
