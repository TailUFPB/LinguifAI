beijing washington  reuters    china lodged a diplomatic protest on saturday after u s  president elect donald trump spoke by phone with president tsai ing wen of taiwan  but blamed the self ruled island beijing claims as its own for the  petty  move  the  minute telephone call with taiwan s leadership was the first by a u s  president elect or president since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   acknowledging taiwan as part of  one china   china s foreign ministry said it had lodged  stern representations  with what it called the  relevant u s  side   urging the careful handling of the taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties   the one china principle is the political basis of the china u s  relationship   it said  the wording implied the protest had gone to the trump camp  but the ministry provided no explanation  speaking earlier  hours after friday s telephone call  chinese foreign minister wang yi pointedly blamed taiwan for the exchange  rather than trump  a billionaire businessman with little foreign policy experience    this is just the taiwan side engaging in a petty action  and cannot change the  one china  structure already formed by the international community   wang said at an academic forum in beijing  china s foreign ministry quoted him as saying   i believe that it won t change the longstanding  one china  policy of the united states government   in comments at the same forum  wang noted how quickly president xi jinping and trump had spoken by telephone after trump s victory  and that trump had praised china as a great country   wang said that exchange had sent  a very positive signal about the future development of sino u s  relations   according to the ministry s website  taiwan was not mentioned in that call  according to an official chinese transcript  china s taiwan affairs office also called the conversation a  petty  move by taiwan that does not change the island s status as part of china  beijing is resolute in opposing independence for taiwan  it added  trump said on twitter that tsai had initiated the call he had with the taiwan president   the president of taiwan called me today to wish me congratulations on winning the presidency  thank you   he said  alex huang  a spokesman for tsai  said   of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact   trump and tsai noted that  close economic  political and security ties exist between taiwan and the united states   the trump transition team said in a statement  taiwan s presidential office said the two discussed strengthening bilateral interactions and establishing closer cooperation  china considers taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control  relations between the two sides have worsened since tsai  who heads the pro independence democratic progressive party  was elected president in january  chinese state media downplayed the possibility of a major blow up in beijing s relations with washington as trump prepares to assume office  influential state run tabloid the global times said in an online editorial that if trump really overturned the  one china  principle upon assuming office it would create such a crisis with china he d have little time to do anything else   we believe this is not something the shrewd trump wants to do   china s official xinhua news agency said trump needed to know beijing can be a  cooperative partner  as long as washington respects china s core interests  including the issue of taiwan   china and the united states are not destined rivals   it said in an english language commentary  washington remains taiwan s most important political ally and sole arms supplier  despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties  the irony of which was not lost on trump   interesting how the u s  sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call   trump said in another tweet  trump has eschewed tradition in other calls with foreign leaders since he won the u s  election  prompting the white house to encourage him to make use of the diplomatic expertise and counsel of the state department   trump adviser kellyanne conway said on cnn that trump was  well aware of what u s  policy has been  on taiwan  administration officials said trump s team did not alert the white house about the call ahead of time  the white house also said after trump s call that  longstanding policy  on china and taiwan had not changed  advisers to the republican president elect have indicated that he is likely to take a more robust policy toward china than obama  a democrat  and that trump plans to boost the u s  military in part in response to china s increasing power in asia  however  details of his plans remain scant  trump lambasted china throughout the u s  election campaign  drumming up headlines with pledges to slap  percent tariffs on imported chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office  earlier this week  trump spoke to pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif and praised him  according to the pakistani leader s office  as a  terrific guy   islamabad and washington have seen relations sour in recent years over u s  accusations that pakistan shelters islamist militants who kill u s  soldiers in afghanistan  a charge denied by the south asian nation  trump also invited philippine leader rodrigo duterte to the white house next year during what a duterte aide said was a  very engaging  animated  phone conversation  duterte has openly insulted obama  who canceled a planned meeting with him in september  a statement issued by trump s transition team made no mention of the invitation
