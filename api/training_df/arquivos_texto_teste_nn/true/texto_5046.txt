san francisco  reuters    wikileaks documents showing the u s  central intelligence agency considered a  mission  against connected car technology underscores auto industry concern that the science behind the next generation of vehicles could be turned against them  cyber security is considered key to the rollout of tomorrow s self driving and today s connected cars  which resemble computers on wheels with a host of communications routes that hackers could target   if consumers are to trust smart vehicles  they must deem them safe from attack  security experts cite the terrifying hypothetical example of a remote attack on a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel or brakes  in which the passenger would have no recourse to regain manual control of the car   you have a lot of car companies trying to design cars to be better suited to automation  which means they re more attractive to hackers   said auto consultant roger lanctot of strategy analytics  a major strategy for automakers is to reduce the number of communications gateways to crucial systems and to require services offered by third parties to go through a single secure path  wikileaks documents show the cia citing  vehicle systems  and a car operating system from qnx  owned by blackberry ltd  as  potential mission areas  for the cia s  embedded devices branch  to consider  the qnx operating system  which is used by most global automakers  provides a  a comprehensive  multi level  policy driven security model     to mitigate attacks   the company said in a statement to reuters  but given the collection of software  hardware and network components that make up a connected car   security is only as strong as its weakest link   it said  while the cia s interest in cars brought widespread attention  the industry has already received wakeup calls about cars  potential to be hacked  researchers in  used a wireless connection to turn off a jeep cherokee s engine  prompting a recall of   million vehicles by fiat chrysler automobiles  in september last year  chinese cyber security researchers hacked a tesla inc model s sedan  remotely tapping the brakes and popping the trunk  the electric carmaker subsequently patched the bugs using an over the air fix  tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its cyber security protocol   the hacking of the jeep and the tesla  brought it home to the industry that even if its improbable it s technically possible   said mark wakefield  global co head of the automotive practice at alixpartners   if a car was seen as vulnerable  it  could be a big brand problem   wakefield said  hacks could also expose private information shared between car and third parties   credit card numbers  account numbers or passwords   to theft  a january survey by the university of michigan s transportation research institute found that  percent of respondents said they were  extremely concerned  over hacking of full self driving cars to cause crashes  the number of ways into cars has proliferated  from cell phone signals to dongles  one such gateway is the standard obd ii port found under the steering wheel historically used for onboard diagnostics  today  hundreds of after market devices use the port  whether to monitor driving for insurance needs or provide conveniences like safety alerts   the security of these devices is important  as it can provide an attacker with a means of accessing vehicle systems and driver data remotely   warned the fbi in a march  bulletin on cyber security risks to motor vehicles  carmakers are also building walls between non crucial infotainment systems and driving controls so that any breach is blocked before it could compromise key functions like brakes  the first step the industry is tackling is intrusion detection  said lanctot  but what to do when a breach is detected is complicated  because shutting off parts of a car could be unsafe  he said   tesla was first to champion  over the air  technology in which wireless software updates are sent remotely to cars  although some have argued such updates are a way in for hackers  tesla and others see them a key protection to upgrade security and repair vulnerabilities quickly   in january  u s  lawmakers introduced a bill calling for cyber security standards for new cars but so far u s  regulators have issued recommendations  not rules  on how carmakers should shield their computer systems from hackers  the industry is  years away  from solving the cyber security problem  lanctot said  noting that the first generation of cars built after the jeep hack that include some kind of detection capabilities will not be seen until early in
