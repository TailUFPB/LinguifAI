washington  reuters    hillary clinton  under questioning by federal investigators over whether she had been briefed on how to preserve government records as she was about to leave the state department  said she had suffered a concussion  was working part time and could not recall every briefing she received  clinton  the democratic party s presidential candidate  raised the health scare during her    hour interview with the federal bureau of investigation and justice department prosecutors on july   according to an fbi summary released on friday  besides the  page interview summary  the fbi also released other details of its investigation into her use of an unauthorized private email system while running the state department  in which it concluded she mishandled classified information but not in a way that warranted a criminal prosecution  clinton told investigators she could not recall getting any briefings on how to handle classified information or comply with laws governing the preservation of federal records  the summary of her interview shows   however  in december of   clinton suffered a concussion and then around the new year had a blood clot   the fbi s summary said   based on her doctor s advice  she could only work at state for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received    a clinton campaign aide said clinton only referenced her concussion to explain she was not at work but for a few hours a day at that time  not that she did not remember things from that period   the concussion was widely reported then  and republicans have since used it to attack the  year old candidate s health in a way her staff have said is unfounded  the fbi report  which does not quote clinton directly  is ambiguous about whether it was her concussion that affected her ability to recall briefings  the fbi declined to provide further comment on the report    clinton  who is challenging republican donald trump for the white house in the nov   election  has been dogged for more than a year by the fallout from her decision to use an unauthorized private email account run from the basement of her chappaqua  new york  home  republicans have repeatedly attacked clinton over the issue  helping drive opinion polls that show many u s  voters doubt her trustworthiness   trump s campaign issued a statement immediately following the fbi report s release saying the notes from the interview  reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty    clinton has said that in hindsight she regretted using a private email system while secretary of state  according to the report  clinton told the fbi that she did not set up a private email server to sidestep the law requiring her to keep her business communications a matter of public record   at least one federal judge is examining whether this was the case as part of a lawsuit against the state department concerning public access to clinton s government records  which the u s  government said it had no access to in response to requests from members of the public  the documents also show that clinton contacted former secretary of state colin powell in  to ask about his use of a personal blackberry phone   in his reply to clinton via email  powell told clinton to  be very careful  because the work related emails she sent on her blackberry could become public record   i got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data   powell said  according to the summary  after her use of a private email system became public knowledge in march   clinton repeatedly said she did not use it to send or receive classified information  the government forbids handling such information outside secure channels  the fbi has since concluded clinton was wrong to say that  at least  email threads contained information that was classified at the time  although the final number may be more than    the report said  some of the emails appear to include discussion of planned future attacks by unmanned u s  military drones  the fbi report showed   clinton believed the classification level of future drone strikes depended on the context   the fbi s interview summary said  the u s  government requires that military plans be classified  the fbi released its report on friday afternoon before the labor day holiday weekend  a time many americans are preparing to travel   state department spokesman john kirby said he would not comment on the fbi s findings because the department  does not have full insight into the fbi s investigation   he declined to say whether state department officials still discussed the planning of future attacks using drones in unclassified emails    i m not going to speak to past email practices   he said   we trust state department employees to use their best judgment when conveying sensitive information  taking into account a range of factors   the clinton campaign released a statement welcoming the report s release    while her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it  these materials make clear why the justice department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case   brian fallon  a campaign spokesman  said in a statement  some republicans saw the files as confirming their belief that the department of justice should have prosecuted clinton   these documents demonstrate hillary clinton s reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state   paul ryan  the republican speaker of the u s  house of representatives  said in a statement   this is exactly why i have called for her to be denied access to classified information
