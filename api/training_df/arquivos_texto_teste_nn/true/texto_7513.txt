washington  reuters    senior democrats said on monday their chances of winning control of the u s  house of representatives had been hurt by the fbi s surprise announcement last month that hillary clinton s email practices were again figuring in a federal investigation  voters will go to the polls on tuesday to choose democrat clinton or republican donald trump for president  but also to fill  u s  senate seats in the  chamber body and all  house seats  both the house and senate are currently controlled by republicans  fbi director james comey s letter to congress in late october that the agency would examine newly found emails that might pertain to clinton s use of a private server while she was secretary of state   had a tremendous adverse impact with our standing with independents   said representative james clyburn  a member of the house democratic leadership  referring to independent voters  house democratic leader nancy pelosi  while calling comey s action  out of line   said it resulted in a spike in small campaign donations  but she added   we would be in a better place  without the letter  and in the manner he did it   clyburn s and pelosi s remarks  seen by reuters  were delivered during a phone call house democratic leaders had with rank and file members   continued republican control of congress could stymie the legislative agenda put forth by clinton if she wins the presidency  a trump win along with a republican congress could spell doom for democratic president barack obama s landmark healthcare law known as obamacare  which has been the target of a sustained attack by republican lawmakers  if voters hand power to democrats in either chamber   will likely bring a more moderate bent to bills that lawmakers send to the new president for signing into law  a senior democratic aide said the october controversy  which consumed u s  political campaigns for over a week  could reduce by at least  the number of house seats democrats may be able to capture from republicans on election day  comey informed congress on sunday that he was standing by his july decision that no criminal charges were warranted against the democratic presidential candidate in the emails investigation  but coming only two days before national elections  comey s latest decision may have come too late for democrats who were hoping for big wins on tuesday to help them regain control of the house for the first time since  and the senate for the first time since    it s terribly damaging to us   the aide said  adding that clinton s support in battleground states could be depressed  which in turn would hurt the party s house candidates  with that in mind  the aide said democrats could end up gaining only  to  house seats on tuesday  instead of the  or so needed to win back the chamber  representative tom cole  a senior house republican  said in a telephone interview he found it  mystifying in how he  comey  has interjected himself in the election on three different occasions in ways that were probably inappropriate   cole was referring to the initial announcement in july that clinton would not be prosecuted  the late october letter to congress that fbi agents were again reviewing the issue and sunday s information that the agency would not change its july findings  of sunday s good news for clinton  the oklahoma lawmaker said   i think it certainly takes a little steam out of the republicans   to win control of the senate outright  democrats would have to score a net gain of five seats  republicans currently hold  senate seats to  democratic seats and two independents who align themselves with democrats  for much of the autumn campaign  political analysts were projecting democrats would pick up anywhere from four to seven senate seats  the outcome of the presidential race is expected to have a major impact on the outcome of the congressional campaigns  in recent decades  the party that wins the white house has usually fared better in congressional races too  for most of the  campaign season  the senate races have been center stage  as democrats fielded some strong challengers to republican incumbents  among them are missouri secretary of state jason kander  who is giving republican senator roy blunt an unexpectedly stiff challenge  and former environmental official katie mcginty  who could unseat republican senator pat toomey in pennsylvania    john mccain  the vietnam war hero and  republican presidential nominee who has served in the senate for  years  appears headed to re election in a race that has been unusually competitive for him  a possible   tie following tuesday s elections would mean that the next vice president would cast the tie breaking vote and determine which party controls the senate  the senate that will be sworn in on jan    whether it is held by republicans or democrats  will face a weighty decision early on  voting on a u s  supreme court justice to replace the conservative justice antonin scalia  who died last february  since that time  senate republicans have refused to consider obama s nomination of federal judge merrick garland  arguing the next president should pick a nominee for senate review  other issues confronting congress next year include illegal immigration and border security  the need to raise u s  borrowing authority  something some conservative republicans oppose without substantial budget cuts  and possible approval of free trade deals with pacific rim countries and europe if negotiations on the latter conclude successfully
