new york  reuters    a new york appeals court issued a ruling on tuesday that apparently made it highly unlikely that a state fraud case against trump university  republican presidential candidate donald trump s venture  will be heard before the nov   general election  the mid level appeals court ruled that trump s lawyers can argue to the state s highest court that the fraud claims against trump university brought by the state attorney general should be dismissed   trump suffered a legal setback in the case in march when the appeals court allowed multimillion dollar fraud claims against the now defunct venture to proceed   the claims are part of a state lawsuit filed in  that accuses trump university of misleading thousands of people who paid up to    for seminars to learn the billionaire businessman s real estate investment strategies  the trial judge in the case had been waiting to hear whether the mid level appeals court  the appellate division  first department  in manhattan  would give trump permission to go to the state s highest court  the court of appeals   it s no surprise that donald trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for operating a sham for profit university   new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in a statement responding to the ruling    as our lawsuit makes clear  mr  trump s phony university defrauded thousands of students through an illicit scheme that cost them millions of dollars   schneiderman continued   i am confident that the court of appeals will agree with the lower court s unanimous decision to reject virtually all of mr  trump s claims   alan garten  general counsel for the trump organization  said   we are pleased with the court s decision and look forward to going to the court of appeals   garten has said the claims are  without merit and baseless  and that almost all those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the seminars high ratings  class actions are pending in california on similar claims by trump university students  one of those cases is scheduled for trial on nov    the fraud claims against trump university were an issue early in the republican primary campaign   with trump allowed to appeal the pretrial rulings to the state s highest court  it is very unlikely the new york case will be resolved before november s election  it takes an average of  months from the time an appeal is allowed for the court of appeals to hear oral arguments in a case  according to court spokesman gary spencer  a decision on whether or not the fraud claims can proceed would normally take another month and  if not dismissed  the case would then go back to the trial court   in the march decision  schneiderman was allowed to proceed on fraud claims that require proof of intent to defraud and those that do not  the court also ruled that the statute of limitations for the claims stretches back to  instead of   the program stopped taking students in
