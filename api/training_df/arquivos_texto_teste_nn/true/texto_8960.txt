washington new york  reuters    after months of waiting for the u s  congress to act as puerto rico s economic crisis progressively worsened  the caribbean island is on the verge of securing a relief plan from washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling   billion debt  the senate is set to launch a debate on wednesday for legislation establishing a federal oversight board that would be in charge of restructuring the u s  territory s debt where one out of every three dollars it earns in revenue is used to pay creditors  according to the u s  treasury   we re not going to let puerto rico go off the cliff here  it s too important   said republican senator marco rubio of florida  the measure is identical to the plan passed by the house of representatives earlier this month  as congress tries to send it to president barack obama to sign into law by july   that is when puerto rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make a    billion payment   as early as wednesday  the senate could cast a procedural vote on the bill that  if successful  would clear the measure for passage this week  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell also took steps to limit amendments that can be offered to the bill  some democrats have complained about the makeup and operation of the oversight board that would be appointed by washington as well as provisions demanded by house republicans that potentially could lower minimum wages for some younger workers   something needs to be done  we would really love some amendments on key issues like the composition of the board  the procedures for taking puerto rico into the bankruptcy court  and then especially  the labor provisions on overtime and minimum wage   democratic senator tim kaine of virginia told reporters  but any amendments would delay congress  work on the bill and make it impossible to get to obama before july   as the house of representatives would have to sign off and it is in recess until july   after the independence day holiday weekend  u s  treasury secretary jack lew reiterated his call for the senate to pass the bill on monday  saying if nothing is done by the friday deadline  the debt crisis will only ratchet higher  puerto rico is reeling from a  percent poverty rate  a steady flow of outward migration to the u s  mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services  if congress does not pass the  puerto rico oversight  management and economic stability act   or promesa  before july   the island could default on all or part of the debt payment  including general obligation bonds that are senior to all credits   the senate should take up the matter immediately   lew said in a letter to mcconnell   delay will only jeopardize the ability of congress to conclude its work before july   a critical deadline puerto rico s leadership has publicly highlighted for months   while puerto ricans want some sort of relief from the debt their government is saddled with  many of the   million residents  who are u s  citizens  nonetheless worry that the proposed seven member oversight board will trample on san juan s self governing rights   the bill is not perfect  i do not like the board  i do not like that it doesn t add a mechanism to make our economy grow  but what is the alternative right now  that is why i call on the senate to vote for this bill   puerto rican governor alejandro garcia padilla said during a panel discussion last week in washington  without promesa  an existing trickle of lawsuits could turn into a flood  in april when there was little sign of congressional action  puerto rico s legislature passed a local debt moratorium law giving garcia padilla the authority to withhold debt payments  investors on june  filed a lawsuit in u s  federal court calling the puerto rico emergency moratorium and rehabilitation act illegal   we are at the mercy of the judge   garcia padilla said during the panel discussion  promesa  if signed into law  puts an immediate stay  or hold  on any future lawsuits and is retroactive to december   the stay remains in effect until the debt has been restructured to a sustainable level with the goal being an orderly restructuring an sustainable amount of debt
