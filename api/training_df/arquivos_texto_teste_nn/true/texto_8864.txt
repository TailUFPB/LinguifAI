washington  reuters    the fbi report scolding democrat hillary clinton over her email practices as secretary of state plays into a chief vulnerability that her rival  republican donald trump  hopes to exploit   wariness among u s  voters about her trustworthiness  clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon said the federal bureau of investigation s recommendation against criminal charges for clinton means the email matter  is now resolved   yet even as he removed the threat of charges against the democratic candidate  fbi director james comey described clinton s handling of classified information as  extremely careless   trump  the presumptive republican nominee  seized on that comment   we re talking about serious stuff   he told a rally in raleigh  north carolina   the laws are very explicit   the new york businessman has been struggling to unify the party around his candidacy  and republicans say trump could use the issue to heal some of the rifts within his party while motivating conservatives to go to the polls in the nov   election  indeed  a main element of trump s strategy for winning over republicans who are lukewarm on his candidacy is to emphasize the importance of keeping clinton out of the white house   clinton won the  comey primary  but trump has the opportunity to drive home the lack of trust theme   said republican strategist scott reed  a reuters ipsos poll from may   found that a majority of american adults do not think clinton is an honest person  this included  percent of republicans   percent of independents and  percent of democrats  more than a quarter   percent  of clinton s own supporters did not think she is an honest person  according to the poll  democratic strategist steve elmendorf said clinton needs to move quickly to get past the email episode and talk about issues central to her campaign  he predicted the issue will be short lived as voters focus on the candidates  vice presidential running mates  the nominating conventions and fall debates   she made a mistake here  there s no question about it   said bob shrum  a democratic strategist who was chief strategist for  nominee john kerry  the current secretary of state    but there s also justice in what she says  that for  years the republicans have relentlessly gone after bill and hillary clinton  that has its impact and that impact you can see in her trust numbers  but this decision  despite how anybody spins  it not only helps her but in my view was indispensable to her   shrum said  hours after comey s announcement  trump s campaign sent an email soliciting money based on the clinton email controversy   the big question for republicans is whether their presumptive presidential nominee will be able to prosecute the case effectively against clinton since he is still at war with fellow republicans and has little in the way of campaign funds to pay for tv ads against her   i don t think there s a way that clinton can use this to raise anger at republicans   said andy smith  director of the university of new hampshire survey center   but the republicans can certainly use this to raise anger at clinton and the democrats  anger is a great motivator to get people out to vote   trump s initial response showed why republicans continue to have concerns about him  interviewed by fox news  bill o reilly  trump spent as much time criticizing comey as he did clinton  comey is respected by republicans and democrats alike   i have such respect for the fbi that i just don t understand what happened here   trump said   everybody knows she s extremely guilty  and they really said she was guilty today and then they said we re not going to prosecute   ryan williams  a republican strategist and former spokesman for  nominee mitt romney  called the fbi report a  disqualifying event  for clinton   trump s singular focus should be that she acted inappropriately  but trump has a knack for distracting from hillary clinton s scandals with his gaffes and missteps   he said  trump has been fighting allegations of anti semitism in recent days over his campaign s use of a jewish star in a tweet attacking clinton as corrupt
