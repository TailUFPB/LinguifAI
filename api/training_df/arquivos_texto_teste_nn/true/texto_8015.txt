hempstead  new york  reuters    running as an anti establishment candidate  donald trump took the presidential debate stage on monday night to hammer home his call for sweeping political change and try to win over millions of undecided voters   but the republican nominee seemed unable to capitalize on his opportunity in front of a television audience that by some estimates may have been  million strong  instead of presenting himself as a change agent  he spent most of the evening trading personal insults with his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  it illustrated the paradox that has plagued trump s campaign  polls show an electorate hungry for change  with a majority believing the country is on the wrong track  yet trump s brash personality and his tendency to stir up controversy have made him  at times  a poor messenger   trump started strongly on monday  sticking to the bread and butter theme of his campaign   the erosion of u s  manufacturing jobs  but he soon lost his composure  especially when clinton questioned his success in business and his refusal to release his tax returns and accused him of racism and sexism   when on message trump paints a bleak picture of a united states that is victimized by china in trade  hemorrhaging jobs to mexico and blighted by gangs of illegal immigrants roaming the streets of  warzone  inner cities committing crimes   robert adams    an undecided voter from boise  idaho  said he thought trump s dystopian view of america was correct   i think it s hell in the big cities   adams said  but after watching the debate  he viewed both the real estate magnate and clinton as a  sad  choice for american voters and was leaning toward libertarian candidate gary johnson  reuters ipsos polling shows an electorate in a downcast mood  with  percent of americans believing the country is on the wrong track  that number includes  percent of republicans and  percent of democrats  when reuters asked voters to pick the first word that comes to mind when thinking about the country  the most popular choice was  frustration   followed by  fear  and  anger    some of trump s strongest moments at monday s debate were when he categorized clinton  a former secretary of state and u s  senator as a  typical politician   accusing her of achieving nothing in her years in congress and government  with an electorate yearning for change  clinton is hamstrung by her long record and her close association with the obama administration   rather than proposing wholesale political overhaul  clinton  offers up a vision of a country headed in the right direction but one that needs some changes to address income inequality and create jobs   her more optimistic view impressed another undecided voter  nancy willhite    of portland  oregon   she seems more in touch with reality to me   she said   a reuters ipsos poll published on monday found that about half of all likely voters in the united states were looking to the debate to help them make a final decision   ron bonjean  a republican strategist in washington  said trump s performance on monday would have left many undecided voters with questions about his ability to lead the country   donald trump has to convince them that he is going to be a safe alternative and i think it s open to debate whether he pulled that off   bonjean said   christopher devine  a political science professor at the university of dayton in ohio said trump s message on monday sometimes got lost in a welter of hyperbole that invited mocking responses from clinton    he ll identify a problem people are concerned about  but in that excitement over making that point  he goes overboard and makes claims that don t hold up  it loses its effectiveness at that point
