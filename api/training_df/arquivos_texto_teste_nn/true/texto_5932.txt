on the news  mexico s government statement said trump and pena nieto agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall  the white house did not immediately clarify whether trump had agreed not to publicly discuss how the wall would be paid for  during a joint news conference at the white house with visiting british prime minister theresa may after the call  trump did not mention the wall even as he spoke expansively about u s  relations with mexico   as you know  mexico   with the united states   has out negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders  they ve made us look foolish   trump told the news conference   we have a trade deficit of   billion with mexico  on top of that  the border is soft and weak  drugs are pouring in   added trump  who during the u s  presidential campaign accused mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the united states  the united states had a    billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor in the  months ending last november  trump called his hour long talk with pena nieto  very  very friendly   said he has a  very good relationship  with him and expressed  great respect for mexico   mexico and the

and canada and slap high tariffs on american companies that have moved jobs south of the border  mexico sends  percent of its exports to the united states  and about half of mexico s foreign direct investment over the past two decades has come from its northern neighbor   we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship  with mexico  trump told the news conference with may   but the united states cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business  vast amounts of companies and millions and millions of people losing their jobs  that won t happen with me   trump said

insisted it will not heed trump s demands to pay for the construction project   on thursday  white house spokesman sean spicer sent the mexican peso falling when he told reporters that trump wanted a  percent tax on mexican imports to pay for the wall  spicer gave few details  but his comments resembled an existing idea  known as a border adjustment tax  that the republican led u s  house of representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul  trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network on friday that there were options besides an import tax that could be  much more positive  for both countries  the white house said friday s call also covered  the importance of the friendship between the two nations  and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels  drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales   mexico s government said the u s  trade deficit also came up  in mexico city  billionaire mexican businessman carlos slim  said a

be conducted
