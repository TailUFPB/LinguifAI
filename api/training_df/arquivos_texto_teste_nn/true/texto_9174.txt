washington  reuters    president barack obama on sunday said americans would stand united and  not give in to fear or turn against each other  in the wake of a nightclub shooting in orlando  florida  that killed  people  following is the full text of remarks  obama delivered at the white house  today  as americans  we grieve the brutal murder   a horrific massacre   of dozens of innocent people  we pray for their families  who are grasping for answers with broken hearts  we stand with the people of orlando  who have endured a terrible attack on their city  although it s still early in the investigation  we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate  and as americans  we are united in grief  in outrage  and in resolve to defend our people  i just finished a meeting with fbi director comey and my homeland security and national security advisers  the fbi is on the scene and leading the investigation  in partnership with local law enforcement  i ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation  we are still learning all the facts  this is an open investigation  we ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer  the fbi is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism  and i ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what   if any   inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups  what is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred  over the coming days  we ll uncover why and how this happened  and we will go wherever the facts lead us  this morning i spoke with my good friend  orlando mayor buddy dyer  and i conveyed the condolences of the entire american people  this could have been any one of our communities  so i told mayor dyer that whatever help he and the people of orlando need   they are going to get it  as a country  we will be there for the people of orlando today  tomorrow and for all the days to come  we also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm s way  their courage and professionalism saved lives  and kept the carnage from being even worse  it s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us  and we can never thank them enough  this is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends   our fellow americans   who are lesbian  gay  bisexual or transgender  the shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends  to dance and to sing  and to live  the place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub   it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness  to speak their minds  and to advocate for their civil rights  so this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any american   regardless of race  ethnicity  religion or sexual orientation   is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country  and no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us americans  today marks the most deadly shooting in american history  the shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle  this massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school  or in a house of worship  or a movie theater  or in a nightclub  and we have to decide if that s the kind of country we want to be  and to actively do nothing is a decision as well  in the coming hours and days  we ll learn about the victims of this tragedy  their names  their faces  who they were  the joy that they brought to families and to friends  and the difference that they made in this world  say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families   that god give them the strength to bear the unbearable  and that he give us all the strength to be there for them  and the strength and courage to change  we need to demonstrate that we are defined more   as a country   by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us  as we go together  we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts   friends who helped friends  took care of each other and saved lives  in the face of hate and violence  we will love one another  we will not give in to fear or turn against each other  instead  we will stand united  as americans  to protect our people  and defend our nation  and to take action against those who threaten us  may god bless the americans we lost this morning  may he comfort their families  may god continue to watch over this country that we love  thank you
