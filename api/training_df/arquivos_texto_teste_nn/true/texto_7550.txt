gathering  after being introduced by billionaire investor mark cuban   when the middle class thrives  america thrives   trump disputed clinton s rosy view  telling a crowd in new hampshire that the jobs report was  an absolute disaster  and was skewed by the large number of people who have stopped looking for jobs and are no longer in the labor market   nobody believes the numbers anyway  the numbers they put out are phony   he said  referring to the figures released by the u s  labor department  the economy and the candidates  competing visions for the future could be critical in swaying

in michigan  each of those states is key in the state by state quest for the  electoral votes needed to win the white house  the race has tightened significantly in the past week  as several swing
