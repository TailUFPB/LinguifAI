seattle washington  reuters    when washington state attorney general bob ferguson arrived in seattle last saturday after a trip to florida  public outrage over the immigration order issued the previous day by president donald trump was quickly growing  he went home  greeted his family and then went to work   by late monday afternoon  just minutes before the court closed for the day  ferguson  a democrat  and his team of lawyers were ready to file the first state lawsuit seeking to block the order  on friday  they won a dramatic courtroom victory when u s  district judge james robart put on hold the travel ban for refugees and citizens of seven mainly muslim countries  the lawsuit emerged out of a chaotic  hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought out strategizing that usually leads up to a major legal complaint being filed  according to ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order   we knew we had one shot   ferguson said in an interview  in reference to the bid for a temporary restraining that would immediately overturn trump s executive order  the lawsuit is one of several now filed against the executive order around the united states  but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide   the fight over the immigration order is just the first of what is likely to be a series of court battles between democratic attorneys general  the top legal officers in liberal leaning states  and the administration  several attorneys general have already said they expect to sue trump on various issues if he oversteps his authority  including on the environment and consumer protection  president trump on saturday ridiculed judge robart  a george w  bush appointee  and his decision  the justice department filed a formal appeal  the washington state lawyers worked around the clock last saturday and sunday against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at u s  airports  where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president s directive  there was little time to coordinate with other states  though ultimately one other state  minnesota  joined the effort  additional states  including virginia  new york and hawaii  have filed their own lawsuits or sought to intervene in cases brought by individuals affected by the ban  state attorneys general did not collectively decide to let washington file first for any strategic advantage  ferguson said  rather  washington was able most quickly to marshal evidence of the harm trump s order caused to the state  which is crucial to establish legal standing   ferguson called the general counsels at major washington employers amazon com inc  and expedia inc  for their support  the companies eventually filed sworn statements in court saying the ban hurt their businesses      the state lawyers also gathered information on the harm to state residents and institutions such as the university system  which the judge appeared to find persuasive  the legal assault on the order has involved ferguson and other democratic lawyers taking a leaf from the play book followed by republican states that successfully challenged actions taken by trump s predecessor  former president barack obama  washington state s claims rely in part on the same legal arguments that texas and  other republican led states made when they challenged obama s november  plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation  in that case  the republican states argued that obama overstepped his constitutional powers by infringing upon the authority of congress   washington and other states say trump has violated the constitution too  albeit on different grounds  they say he has violated protections against discrimination on the basis of religion by targeting muslims  the state has a responsibility to protect the  health  safety  and well being  of all its residents  the lawsuit said  in the  case  texas  like washington state in the trump case  asked for a nationwide injunction   where the fight against trump s order differs from the texas challenge to obama is that various lawsuits have been filed around the country by states and civil rights groups  the texas case was a single lawsuit that the other states joined  aclu lawyer lee gelernt said there was little time to talk strategy among the many states and advocacy groups opposing the order  as would normally happen   it s moving too quickly   he said  that sense of urgency was all too clear to washington state lawyers on monday as they feverishly gathered the required documents to file with the lawsuit  including the motion for a temporary restraining order  unlike other court papers filed electronically  a paper copy of that motion had to be delivered to the clerk s office in person  so noah purcell  the solicitor general  led a race to the seattle courthouse with others from the office just as the building was about to close  they pulled up to the courthouse  jumped out of the car and ran up the steps to the doors before they were locked  they arrived just in time
