administration  the white house said on friday  if confirmed by the senate  gottlieb would be in charge of implementing trump s plan to dramatically cut regulations governing food  drugs  cosmetics  dietary supplements and tobacco  gottlieb is well known on capitol hill  where he has testified multiple times on hot button health issues  including complex drug pricing matters  and is viewed favorably by drug companies and pharmaceutical investors  he sits on the boards of several small drug and biotech companies and is an adviser to glaxosmithkline plc  gsk l    thank god it s gottlieb   brian skorney  an investment analyst at robert w  baird  wrote in a research note   we view this as a favorable development for the sector   gottlieb was chosen over jim o neill  a libertarian investor close to silicon valley billionaire peter thiel  a paypal co founder who now advises trump on technology and science matters  o neill s stated view that drugs should be approved before being proven effective generated widespread alarm  gottlieb    is a resident fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute think tank and a partner at a large venture capital fund  he is a former fda deputy commissioner who has advocated a loosening of requirements needed for approval of new medical products   scott knows how the agency works and he will move it forwards  though maybe not always in ways the agency is comfortable with   said john taylor  a lawyer and president of compliance and regulatory affairs with the consulting firm greenleaf health and a former acting fda deputy commissioner  in addition to his public health and health policy roles  gottlieb has for the past decade been a partner at new enterprise associates  a large venture fund with investments in the life sciences  medical technology and healthcare services  critics of the nomination say gottlieb s financial background present an array of potential conflicts of interest  dr  michael carome  director of

have to be recused from key decisions time and time again   stephen ubl  a spokesman for the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america  said it  looks forward to working with dr  gottlieb in his new role and engaging with him and the agency as they seek to modernize the drug discovery and review process   gottlieb  who declined to comment on the nomination  is unlikely to up end the fda in the way o neill might have  but he is nonetheless expected to bring significant change  including moving the agency to increase flexibility in the clinical trial development process  in this he will be supported by the recently passed  century cures act which instructs the fda among other things to consider the use of  real world evidence  to support new drug applications  this could include anecdotal data  observational studies and patient reports   people don t want to take chances with safety  but there s increasingly some clamor to be more flexible on the efficacy side   said kathleen sanzo  who leads the fda practice at the law firm morgan  lewis   bockius   you need to have some signal of efficacy  the question is  how much   the fda has attempted to push back against moves to sideline randomized clinical trials  long considered the gold standard  in january it issued a report documenting  cases in which drugs that appeared to show promise in early trials turned out to be either ineffective or unsafe or both in larger trials  one of gottlieb s priorities will likely be to streamline the process for approving generic versions of complex  difficult to copy therapeutics  he has stated publicly that he does not believe the fda has good tools or policies to move such products and has advocated the creation of different approval standards   he s a thoughtful and nuanced kind of guy  and not solely an industry shill   said jim shehan  head of lowenstein sandler s fda regulatory practice   a survey conducted by mizuho securities usa inc of  pharmaceutical executives found that  percent favored gottlieb over other potential candidates  many described him as knowledgeable  experienced and balanced   gottlieb is someone who the industry and investors view as an incremental positive   said rbc capital markets analyst michael yee   the industry and investors need rational scientific logic and an understanding of risks and benefits   patient advocates welcomed the news  gottlieb  has firsthand experience at the fda and as a physician that has treated patients understands the breadth of work that needs to be achieved on their behalf   said ellen sigal  founder of friends of cancer research
