 reuters    a group holding more than   billion of puerto rican debt wants the island s federally appointed financial oversight board to postpone a wednesday deadline to approve a fiscal turnaround plan for puerto rico  saying the u s  territory s creditors should have input on the plan   a bondholder group led by oppenheimerfunds and franklin advisers  which hold debt across a wide swath of puerto rican credits  made the request to the board in a letter made public on monday morning  ahead of the board s scheduled public meeting in new york   an extension would     allow puerto rico and the oversight board to work with puerto rico s key stakeholders to develop a fiscal plan that makes sense to all the parties   the group said   the turnaround plan  a requirement of the puerto rico rescue law known as promesa  must be submitted by governor ricardo rossello and approved by the seven member board in charge of managing the island s finances  the plan is meant to serve as the basis for looming restructuring talks with holders of puerto rico s   billion in debt   so far  rossello and the board have disagreed about what the blueprint should look like  with the board saying an initial draft by rossello relied on overly optimistic revenue and growth projections  the draft increased  year cash flows by    billion  through spending cuts and new revenues  and contemplated    billion a year in debt service   only  percent of what it owes next fiscal year  the board on monday is expected to take up a revised version of the plan from rossello  and has said it wants to approve a final version by wednesday  but the lingering disagreements between the board and rossello call for an extension  the oppenheimer group said in monday s letter  adding that more time might give the island s creditors a seat at the table  oppenheimer said rossello s draft plan was unfeasible  saying it ignored payment priorities  offered too weak an analysis on debt sustainability  and did not go far enough on tax reform measures   puerto rico is trying to stem rampant out migration  reduce a  percent poverty rate  and fix near insolvent public healthcare and pension systems  oppenheimer said it supported extending through dec   a stay on litigation arising from debt defaults  so sides can negotiate a debt restructuring without worrying about lawsuits
