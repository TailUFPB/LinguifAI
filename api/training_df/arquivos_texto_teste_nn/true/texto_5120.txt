 reuters    when paul ryan  speaker of the u s  house of representatives  talks of social mobility  about helping struggling americans move out of impoverished areas to give them greater opportunity  shiva daniels is the kind of person he has in mind  a federal housing voucher allowed daniels to escape her crime plagued neighborhood in dallas  texas  and move her four children to the suburb of garland  that move helped daniels find a good job  working for a property management company  today  she cherishes the small  two bedroom house she rents  with a yard where her children can safely play  away from drugs and gang violence in dallas  but if daniels    were to lose the    monthly stipend she receives  she has no doubt what would happen   i would have to move back   she said   i wouldn t be able to afford it   pulling americans out of poverty is a subject close to ryan s heart  and president donald trump has frequently talked about aiding the inner cities  but the housing assistance provided by the u s  department of housing and urban development  or hud  could fall victim to fiscal policies under consideration by the white house and congress  which include a massive tax cut and increased military spending  according to a dozen congressional aides who spoke to reuters  while the white house has not been specific about its plans for hud   the budget process remains in flux   it has called for a   billion cut in non military discretionary domestic programs in the next fiscal year  which likely will dramatically impact safety net programs that are not entitlements such as medicare and social security  budget experts said       altogether  housing advocates paint a bleak picture of the landscape for low income housing under the trump administration  they warn that deep cuts to housing funds would force some people out of their homes and hollow out grant programs meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods   there is also a ripple effect  they warn  rental prices would likely rise alongside declines in affordable housing projects and vouchers available to renters  that would make it tougher for renters to save enough to eventually buy homes   it s a bad cycle   said carol galante  a former top hud official during the obama administration   it puts pressure on the rental market  the rents are higher and higher so people can save less and less    hud provides about  million americans with some form of housing assistance  either through vouchers to renters  subsidies to landlords or public housing projects  which comprises about  percent of its budget  it also sends about   billion annually directly to communities through grants  even so  only about one quarter of those eligible for assistance in the country receive it  housing advocates say changes to its budget or mandate would be directly felt in low income communities  they point out that in   when the legislatively mandated budget cuts known as sequestration hit hud  more than   renters nationwide lost their housing support  douglas rice  an expert at the center for budget and policy priorities  a nonpartisan think tank in washington  estimates that for every  percent cut in hud s budget    renters would lose their assistance but critics of the agency  including some republican lawmakers  say its anti poverty and community development programs are inefficient and wasteful  and that it has failed to live up to its mission  today  the proportion of americans who live below the poverty line     percent   is about the same as it was  years ago  hud has also at times had difficulty shaking the image of a bureaucratic agency that is vulnerable to corruption  it was at the center of a bid rigging scandal during the reagan administration  and alphonso jackson  the hud secretary under president george w  bush  resigned in  amid allegations that he steered contracts to friends  charges were never brought against jackson    there are some sports teams that never seem to gel  i think we re a little like that at hud   said bud albright  a washington lobbyist who worked at the agency when republican jack kemp was secretary in the early   trump  who has not been specific on his plans for the agency  selected ben carson to lead hud  the former neurosurgeon and republican presidential candidate won senate confirmation last week   although carson s views hew closely to republican orthodoxy on how too much government can discourage people from working hard  his upbringing in inner city detroit gives him a unique perspective  his mother received food stamps to provide for her family and he was raised around housing assistance programs similar to those he will now manage  carson  who declined requests for interviews by reuters  has pledged to fight to protect hud s housing assistance budget and preserve the agency s community development initiatives  he also said he would push to include funding to rehabilitate public housing facilities in trump s proposed   trillion infrastructure plan  but given the white house s determination to cut domestic spending  carson will have to fight for every dollar  a hud spokesman declined to comment on which programs could be hurt by any possible budget cuts  the white house s office of management and budget did not respond to a request for comment    congress  too  is looking to narrow hud s reach   ryan has called for work requirements and time limits on those who receive housing assistance  similar to how child support  food assistance and other welfare benefits function  tax reform spearheaded by ryan and kevin brady  the house ways and means chairman  could ultimately do away with a key tax credit used by developers to build affordable housing  or could drastically curtail the credit s use  one vocal critic of hud is jeb hensarling  republican chair of the house financial services committee  which oversees the housing agency  hensarling plans to introduce legislation this year to narrow the   trillion portfolio of the federal housing administration  which helps low income and first time homebuyers purchase homes  his office said  hensarling has said he fears that if home values drop the fha would require another federal bailout as it did in   when it received a taxpayer funded infusion of    billion to cover its losses  if the cuts to hud s budget are as severe as some expect  those who are on waiting lists now for vouchers will be staying on them for a very long time  and recipients such as shiva daniels  who has been receiving assistance for six years  will be at risk of seeing that support end  that would mean losing her small house  with the yard she sees as a safe haven for her children   it might not feel like it s a big deal  but it is   daniels said   when you feel good  it allows you to do better  and do better for them
