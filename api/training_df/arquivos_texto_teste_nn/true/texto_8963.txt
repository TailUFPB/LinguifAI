washington ottawa  reuters    president barack obama will meet with the leaders of canada and mexico on wednesday for his final  three amigos  summit  a meeting that may signal how keen the north american partners are to tout trade at a time of rising protectionist sentiment  the ottawa summit comes on the heels of britain voting to leave the european union after more than  years  it also falls ahead of a u s  presidential election on nov   where presumptive republican nominee donald trump has made stagnant wages and u s  manufacturing job losses focal points of his insurgent campaign  the so called brexit vote is bound to be an important theme for obama s meetings with mexican president enrique pena nieto and canada s prime minister justin trudeau  canada had negotiated a trade deal with the eu that is slated to take effect next year  the brexit may delay its ratification and hurt canada s commodity driven economy  the referendum results are also seen as a setback to talks on a u s  eu trade deal  mexico  which already has a trade deal with the eu  has prepared a draft proposal for a pact with the united kingdom  at the summit  leaders will also look at how best to foster trade with each other  said mexico s finance minister luis videgaray   one of the important issues  without doubt  is how to give a fresh impulse and greater value to north american integration   videgaray said  all three are part of the trans pacific partnership  the  nation trade deal that obama had cast as an update of the north american free trade agreement  he wants to finalize the tpp as part of his economic legacy in asia  the tpp has become a target of both the left and the right in the u s  election  and congress has so far been unenthusiastic about ratifying the deal  the united states is the top export market for both canada and mexico  in   u s  trade with canada and mexico totaled   billion and   billion  respectively  but in canada  only one in four people say the  year old north american free trade agreement  nafta  is good for the country  a poll released on monday showed  the long running canada u s  battle over softwood lumber seems more likely than not to resume as early as october  given all the controversy over trade  the leaders may decide to try to focus their summit talking points on other topics   i expect them to try and stay away from it   said carlo dade  director of the canada west foundation s center for trade and investment policy  ahead of the summit  the white house revealed that the leaders would commit to a new regional goal of  percent of power coming from clean energy by   up from about  percent in   the three countries also plan to unveil a plan to fight heroin production  at a joint press conference  the leaders are likely to field questions about the upcoming u s  election and its implications for both canada and mexico  it will also be obama s first chance on an international stage to promote his recent endorsement of presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  his former secretary of state  in march  pena nieto roundly condemned trump  who has promised to build a wall on the u s  border with mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs  and has complained about what he calls unfair trade  mexico also named a new ambassador to aggressively promote its contributions to the u s  economy  on canada  trump has so far been mostly silent    that doesn t mean canadians don t feel the sting  of his protectionist ideas  said chris sands  director of the center for canadian studies at johns hopkins university s school of advanced international studies  trudeau is likely to tread carefully so as to not endanger relations with a potential president   it s unlikely there will be any formal discussion of trump  who of course is the elephant in the room  in some ways  it s better if there isn t   said one official involved in the summit   the message the leaders will be sending is eloquent enough   the three nations are closely integrated and cooperate well and that s how the relationship should work   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  on trade  pena nieto and trudeau are also cognizant that talk is cheap on the campaign trail   i have to tell my canadian friends this often   it doesn t mean it will be the agenda once you get to the white house   said david wilkins  the u s  ambassador to canada from   during the george w  bush administration  obama provides a good case in point   in his  presidential campaign  he demonized nafta  but once in office  he began working on the tpp  a deal he has said would fix his concerns about nafta   there s very much a  keep calm and carry on  approach and we re going to ignore some of the domestic politicking and see what happens when it happens   said a canadian source familiar with the summit talks
