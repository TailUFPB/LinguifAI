detroit washington  reuters    republican donald trump sought to regain momentum for his white house campaign on monday by proposing sweeping tax breaks  cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled keystone xl oil pipeline project  the new york businessman used a speech on the economy in detroit to try to turn the page after a week of missteps in which he came under heavy criticism  including from some in his own party  and rival democrat hillary clinton surged ahead in opinion polls three months ahead of the nov   election   i want to jump start america   trump said   and it won t even be that hard   trump stuck to prepared remarks rather than the freewheeling style that often produces controversial comments at rallies  he kept his cool as some  protesters jumped to their feet and shouted at coordinated intervals as he spoke at the detroit economic club   trump s remarks  which were repeatedly cheered by the crowd  appeared targeted at both an affluent business community and working people  in particular those who have suffered from a decline in u s  manufacturing in cities such as detroit  he dismissed clinton as representing  the tired voices of the past     we now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for america   trump said   it s a conversation about how to make america great again for everyone     especially for those who have the very least   much of the speech reflected republican talking points and critics said his proposals lacked detail  but republican operatives and others who saw the speech praised trump for turning his focus to policy and contrasting his ideas with clinton s  the question for trump now is whether he will be able to keep his campaign on message as republicans want him to do  trump pitched a tax plan that mirrored traditional republican thinking that lowering taxes and slashing regulation generates economic growth and jobs  he proposed lowering individual and corporate rates and a discounted  percent levy for businesses that bring back profits held overseas  trump s plan to create new tax deductions for childcare costs raised questions from economists about whether lower income families would benefit  many republicans remain frustrated with his trade vision  which bucks party orthodoxy by calling for a rewrite of major agreements   my response is good  bad and ugly   said lanhee chen  who was policy director for the  presidential campaign of republican mitt romney   i think the trade position remains pretty ugly   he said   but i understand why they did it  i think it s a strong effort  at least  to meld elements of conservative economic policy with trump s more populist thinking   trump s effort to shift focus came after what was widely seen as the worst week of his campaign  in which he sparred with party leaders and got entangled in a dispute with the parents of a muslim u s  soldier who was killed in the iraq war  republican senator susan collins added her name on monday to a growing list of republican lawmakers who say they will not vote for trump  some frustrated republicans plan to back a conservative alternative  former cia officer evan mcmullin  on monday  trump waited for the frequent disruptions by protesters to end  smiling and refraining from his practice at campaign rallies of asking security to  get them out of here   a group called the michigan people s campaign took credit for the protests  which they said were aimed at trump s recent comments about sexual harassment  clinton will outline her economic vision in michigan on thursday  in a statement issued before trump s speech  her campaign said his plan would give tax breaks to the wealthy and big companies and would hurt working families   at a rally on monday in st  petersburg  florida  she derided a list of economic advisers trump released last week as  six guys named steve    now  they tried to make his old  tired ideas sound new   clinton said   he wants to basically just repackage trickle down economics   trump s rough week took its toll in opinion polls  a washington post abc news poll released on sunday gave clinton an eight point lead   percent to  percent   trump  a real estate developer who has never held elected public office  touts his practical experience and potential to create jobs  blaming president barack obama for what he calls a weak recovery from the economic recession  on monday  he said clinton would rely on policies that have not worked   she is the candidate of the past   trump said   ours is the campaign of the future   reaction from the crowd in detroit was mixed    i think he laid out a good bullet point on how he s going to solve the economic problems with his trade policies   said insurance executive sal giammursta  others wanted more details   people were looking for more substance   said lawyer al rogalski  trump called for a temporary moratorium on new regulations and repeated his pledges to rewrite the landmark north american trade deal that president bill clinton  hillary clinton s husband  signed in   and to withdraw from the  nation trans pacific partnership deal backed by obama  but much of the reaction was to trump s tax plan  he again proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to  percent from the current  percent  and he proposed lowering income based individual tax brackets to  percent   percent and  percent  in   trump proposed a lower top rate of  percent  after criticism from budget experts who said such low rates would balloon deficits  he tweaked his proposal to be more in line with policies supported by republicans in congress   it s encouraging that donald trump appears to be modifying his tax plan   said maya macguineas  president of the anti debt committee for a responsible federal budget  the research group tax policy center estimated in december that trump s original plan would reduce federal tax revenues by    trillion in the first decade   steve moore  an adviser to trump  said the campaign believes it has made changes to bring the plan s cost down to   trillion to   trillion  a campaign aide said trump would give more detail in a later speech
