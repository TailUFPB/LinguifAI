gettsyburg  pa   reuters    u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump promised on saturday to foil a proposed deal for at t to buy time warner if he wins the nov   election  arguing it was an example of a  power structure  rigged against both him and voters   trump  whose candidacy has caused ruptures in his party  listed his policy plans for the first  days of his presidency in a campaign speech in gettysburg  pennsylvania  near the site of a civil war battlefield and a celebrated address by president abraham lincoln  but he also defiantly raised personal grievances  describing how  if elected  he would address them from the white house in a way he said would benefit americans  the speech was billed by his campaign as a major outlining of his policies and principles  many of the policy ideas trump listed on saturday were familiar  not least his promise to build a wall on the border with mexico to deter illegal immigration and to renegotiate trade deals and to scrap the obamacare health policy   moments after promising americans that he represented a hopeful break from the status quo  he promised to sue nearly a dozen women who have come forward in the last two weeks to accuse him of sexual assault  calling them liars   and he added a new threat to his repeated castigation of u s  media corporations  which he says cover his campaign unfairly to help democratic candidate hillary clinton   they re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the american people   trump  who often rails against media outlets and journalists covering his events  told supporters in his speech  trump has not provided evidence for his assertion that the election would be rigged    as an example of the power structure i m fighting  at t is buying time warner and thus cnn  a deal we will not approve in my administration because it s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few   trump said   telecommunications company at t inc  t n  has agreed in principle to buy time warner inc  twx n   one of the country s largest film and television companies  for about   billion and an announcement could be made as early as saturday   trump also said he would look at  breaking  up the acquisition by comcast corp  cmcsa o  of the media company nbc universal in    deals like this destroy democracy   he said in explaining his apparent deviation from the traditional republican position that seeks to minimize the taxation and regulation of american companies  amazon com inc  amzn o   the online retailer  should also be paying  massive taxes   trump said  reminding voters that amazon chief executive jeff bezos also owns the washington post  a newspaper whose coverage trump dislikes  trump  a wealthy new york building developer and television star  acknowledged in a debate with clinton on oct   that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes  the new york times reported on oct   that trump s declared loss of   million in  was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to  years  at a campaign event later on saturday in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  clinton criticized trump s stance on news outlets  noting that she receives negative coverage too   when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on   you know  i get criticized by the press   she said   i believe that s part of our democratic system   in a statement  clinton spokeswoman christina reynolds described the speech as  rambling  unfocused  full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media  and lacking in any real answers for american families   although trump on saturday described his plans at least in part as a response to his belief media organizations had treated him unfairly  he argued that less wealthy voters had even greater cause to worry   when a simple phone call placed with the biggest newspapers or television networks gets them wall to wall coverage with virtually no fact checking whatsoever  here is why this is relevant to you   he said   if they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back  just look at what they could do to you  your jobs  your security  your education  your health care   trump  who has said he may not accept the election s outcome if he loses  is trailing clinton in most polls   although he has narrowed the gap according to a reuters ipsos poll released on friday  clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the electoral college  however  and claim the u s  presidency  a reuters ipsos states of the nation project poll released on saturday showed      trump has bluntly said that mexico will pay for the wall  an idea the mexican government has scoffed at  he tweaked his language on saturday  saying the united states would fully fund the wall with the understanding that mexico would reimburse the cost  trump s campaign was thrown into crisis two weeks ago when  a  video was released showing him bragging about groping and kissing women  prompting several prominent republicans to announce they would not vote for him  since then  at least  women have said trump made unwanted sexual advances  including groping or kissing  in incidents from the early  to   all of which trump has denied  on saturday  jessica drake  an adult film actor  accused trump of pressuring her to have sex with him  years ago when they met at a golf tournament  after that  she said a man  possibly trump  called her to offer her    if she would have sex with him  which she declined  trump s campaign said the accusations were false  trump    said he was being attacked because he was an outsider who had never previously run for office  which he argues is a virtue   the fact that washington and the washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime   he said
