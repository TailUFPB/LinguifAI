women look   my opponent insulted miss universe   clinton said  resurrecting her republican rival s comments last week about former beauty queen alicia machado s weight gain after she won the miss universe contest in    i mean  how do you get more acclaimed than that  but it wasn t good enough   clinton said   we can t take any of this seriously anymore  we need to laugh at it  we need to refute it   clinton  the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major u s  party  has rushed to capitalize on trump s public feud with machado  whom he once called  miss piggy  because of

avoid paying federal income taxes for up to  years  while democrats have slammed him over the report  trump  who made much of his business acumen on the campaign trail  has said he  brilliantly used  u s  tax rules to his advantage to limit his tax bills  clinton disagreed  telling reporters on tuesday it showed  unequivocally  that trump was a failure at business for losing   billion to begin with  a reuters ipsos opinion poll released on tuesday said  percent of americans believed it was  selfish  for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes  although  percent thought a candidate who paid

his campaign said his words were taken out of context   when people come back from war and combat  and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over   and you re strong and you can handle it   but a lot of people can t handle it   trump told a veterans group on monday  clinton said troops deserved a commander in chief who understood their sacrifice   donald
