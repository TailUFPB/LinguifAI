belcourt  north dakota  reuters    elvis norquay  a member of the chippewa indian tribe  has lived most of his  years on north dakota s remote turtle mountain reservation and says he s never had a problem voting  that was before   when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away  embarrassed  he asked why he couldn t vote  he was told he lacked proper id under new state requirements  he has no phone  no current driver s license and his tribal id lacks a street address   when we left  my friend said   that s not right    said norquay  who has lived on disability since  in a rural county near the canadian border  norquay is among a growing number of native americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the november  presidential and congressional elections  while the native american population is small nationally  lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the supreme court struck down parts of the voting rights act in   a signature legislative achievement of the  civil rights movement  north dakota is one of  states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest  according to the brennan center for justice at the new york university school of law  many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black  hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised  five federal lawsuits involving native americans have been filed since the supreme court decision  including three this year alone  suits in north dakota  utah  south dakota and arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members  who tend to back democrats  a suit in alaska  for example  claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters  the tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect native americans  an allegation the states and counties deny  the native american vote is not big enough to flip a safe republican state such as north dakota into the democrat column in this year s presidential election  but native americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races  in many states  the number of native americans is growing faster than the population as a whole  between  and   the native american population rose by   percent to   million  compared to   percent growth in america s overall population  census data showed  recent changes to voting laws  such as north dakota s new voter id law  are part of  a much broader  deliberate  and concerted effort by republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day   said pratt wiley  head of voter protection issues at the democratic party in washington   those voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the supreme court invalidated a key provision of the voting rights act in    he said of native americans  republicans deny that voting law changes passed by republican dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes   these are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud   said lindsay walters  national spokeswoman at the republican national committee  at issue in north dakota are revisions pushed largely by republican state legislators in  and  to a  state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity  norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in january in u s  district court in north dakota  they said they were refused the right to vote in november  because many old tribal ids such as norquay s don t list a current residential address   it says some tribal members can t afford a new tribal id or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver s licenses on the reservations   richard mccloud  chairman of the turtle mountain band of chippewa indians  said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the   needed to obtain a new tribal card    ten dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family   said mccloud at the tribe s headquarters on the reservation of about   people a few miles  km  south of the canadian border   maybe it s no big deal if you work  but it s a big deal to people that don t have access to     he said  north dakota s secretary of state  al jaeger  the only defendant in the suit  said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election  he said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what ids are accepted  jaeger s deputy  jim silrum  said the id requirements are not a barrier for the  percent of state residents with driver s licenses  an accepted form of id  so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule  those with no driver s license  can get a non driver state id allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free  jaeger and silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state id  republican state representative jim kasper from fargo repeated his party s argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud  but silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities  in the  presidential election  there were only nine cases of people voting twice  but that was because they used the same id rather than a lack of proper identification  he said  state representative kylie oversen  a democrat from grand forks  said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of republicans  she said republicans pushed for the bill after heidi heitkamp  a democrat  was elected to the u s  senate in  by less than   votes  in sparsely populated states such as north dakota  with just   people  congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes  rolette county  surrounding norquay s reservation  is one of two counties in the state where about  percent of the population is native american  those two counties were the only places in north dakota that gave president barack obama more than  percent of the vote in   after the changes in the id law were implemented in north dakota  voter turnout in rolette county dropped by more than  percentage points between the  and  mid term elections  more than any other county in the state  election data from the secretary of state s office shows   what has happened is the native american vote has become something that can tip elections   said jean schroedel  a professor at claremont graduate university in california who studies native american voting  the native american rights fund  a non profit law firm representing norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state  plans to file a motion by june  requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the id law ahead of november s election  according to court documents
