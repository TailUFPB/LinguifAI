  this version of the may  story has been corrects to update new name of group to  glbtq legal advocates   defenders  from  gay and lesbian advocates and defenders   in the sixth paragraph  by daniel trotta and daniel wiessner  reuters    the legal battle over transgender rights between the state of north carolina and the u s  government has moved the country closer to settling one of the last frontiers in civil rights law   at issue is whether transgender people deserve the same federal protections that have been extended to groups such as blacks and religious minorities  backers of the north carolina law  which requires people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity  say it will protect women and girls from predators  transgender advocates say that claim is unfounded and ignores a modern understanding of people who identify with a gender other than the one assigned at birth   the next step is likely to be a federal judge s decision on whether to impose an injunction  or temporary ruling  to void the north carolina law pending a trial  regardless of how a judge might rule on an injunction  the case stands to add to a growing body of legal decisions that have tended to side in favor of transgender rights but not enough to dissuade states like north carolina   a handful of u s  states and cities have attempted to enact measures affecting lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender rights  but north carolina is the first state to focus on transgender people s use of public bathrooms      this is absolutely a critical moment in terms of the focus and the answers that will come through these cases about the established scope of protections for transgender people   said jennifer levi  a lawyer with glbtq legal advocates   defenders  the north carolina law is the subject of four lawsuits in federal court  two on each side  the u s  justice department and an advocacy group  the american civil liberties union  have each sought to strike it down  saying the law violates the landmark civil rights act of   which jolted a divided nation into applying full rights to african americans a century after the abolition of slavery  north carolina s governor and legislature both sued on monday to protect their law  saying the justice department was trying to strike down a  common sense privacy policy  meant to protect the state s public employees  state officials also said if the obama administration wants protections for transgender people  it should appeal to congress to amend existing laws  at least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex   title vii of the civil rights act  which covers and employment  and title ix of the education amendments of   the issue before the courts is whether  sex  also applies to gender identity  the obama administration has taken a firm stance that transgender people are protected  a point that attorney general loretta lynch emphasized on monday   the entire obama administration wants you to know that we see you  we stand with you  and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward   lynch told transgender people in remarks at a news conference   lynch also threatened to withhold federal funding to the north carolina department of public safety and the university of north carolina while the legal case proceeds  north carolina stands to lose    billion in funds  mainly educational grants  if it does not back down from the law  according to an analysis by lawyers at the university of california  los angeles law school  unless north carolina backs down  any ruling by a trial judge would likely be challenged and end up in a virginia based federal appeals court that only weeks ago issued an important ruling in favor of transgender rights  that court  the u s  court of appeals for the fourth circuit  said a transgender teen from virginia could sue his high school for being barred from using the boy s bathroom  the court noted that federal education officials have interpreted title ix to apply to transgender people but did not directly rule on the issue   so far  only one appeals court has explicitly ruled that the civil rights act prohibits discrimination against transgender people  in a  case brought by a police officer  at least five other appeals courts have suggested that they agreed  some in cases involving other federal discrimination laws  the u s  supreme court could help settle the matter  but experts said it was unlikely to take up any precedent setting case any time soon
