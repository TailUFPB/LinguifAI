west bend  wis   reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump on tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo african american voters  vowing to restore law and order  only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence  speaking a few miles from milwaukee  which was rocked by weekend riots  trump accused his democratic rival hillary clinton of  bigotry  and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants  trump has been repeatedly called a  bigot  by his democratic opponents   i m asking for the vote for every african american citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future   trump said   jobs  safety  opportunity  fair and equal representation  we reject the bigotry of hillary clinton which panders to  and talks down to  communities of color and sees them only as votes   that s all they care about   not as individual human beings worthy of a better future   earlier  trump held three events in milwaukee  a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of sylville smith    authorities said smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it   trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city  including some at a closed fundraiser  he held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement  including milwaukee county sheriff david clarke and inspector edward bailey  but news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions   clarke  who is black and spoke at last month s republican national convention  has criticized the protests  writing in an opinion piece for the hill that they were  a collapse of the social order  where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge   trump also taped a town hall meeting with fox news  in which he blamed president barack obama for what he sees as hostility toward police   he has not been good to the police  simply  and the police are not big fans of his   trump said  trump traveled  minutes outside of milwaukee  which is  percent black  to deliver his appeal to african american voters in the suburb of west bend  wisconsin  a community that is  percent white  he spoke before an almost entirely white audience    a vote for her  clinton  is a vote for another generation of poverty  high crime and lost opportunities   trump said   crime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a trump administration    clinton won the democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state  including overwhelming support from african americans in the south   with each passing trump attack  it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about hillary clinton what s true of himself   clinton spokeswoman jennifer palmieri said   when people started saying he was temperamentally unfit  he called hillary the same  when his ties to the kremlin came under scrutiny  he absurdly claimed that hillary was the one who was too close to putin   now he s accusing her of bigoted remarks   we think the american people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge   trump also took aim at clinton s past acceptance of large speaking fees  saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office  police violence against african americans has set off intermittent  sometimes violent protests in the past two years  igniting a national debate over race and policing in the united states and giving rise to the black lives matter movement  trump said critics of the police  share in the responsibility for the unrest in milwaukee and other places in our country    the war on our police must end and it must end now   trump said   the war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens   the shooting of smith was likely justified  trump argued in an interview with fox news on tuesday morning   but the gun was pointed at his  a police officer s  head  supposedly ready to be fired  who can have a problem with that  that s what the narrative is   trump said   maybe it s not true  if it is true  people shouldn t be rioting    officials from the office of director of national intelligence are expected to give trump a briefing on national security issues this week  an adviser to trump and a source familiar with the matter said on tuesday  presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination  which trump did last month  hillary clinton  trump s democratic rival for the nov   election  is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one  democrats have criticized trump s positions on foreign policy and national security  besides some freewheeling remarks  democratic president barack obama has called trump  unfit  for the presidency and this month warned the republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret
