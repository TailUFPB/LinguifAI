washington  reuters    the u s  interior department on monday finalized a contentious rule to protect streams and forests from the impact of coal mining  one of the obama administration s last major environmental regulations that the incoming trump administration is likely to target  the stream protection rule  which the coal industry strongly opposes  updates  year old regulations with stronger requirements for responsible surface coal mining        the interior department says the rule will protect   miles of streams and   acres of forests over the next two decades   this updated  scientifically modern rule will make life better for a countless number of americans who live near places where coal is being mined   said joseph pizarchik  director of the interior department s office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement  which crafted the rule   pizarchik said his office received over   public comments on the proposal  the stream protection rule requires companies to avoid mining practices that could pollute streams and drinking water sources  restore streams  and promise to return mined areas to their original form  it also requires mining companies to replant these areas with native trees and vegetation in certain cases  the rule also requires testing and monitoring of streams near coal mines before  during and after drilling to ensure that miners can detect increased levels of pollution   industry groups like the national mining association have been vocal opponents of the proposal  saying it places too much of a burden on mining companies  the rule is likely to be reversed by president elect donald trump  who said that in his early days in office he would reverse a number of regulations targeting the coal industry  which he has promised to revive   the republican majority congress could use the congressional review act to block the rule with a simple majority vote  trump would likely not veto it  republican senator shelley moore capito  who represents coal mining state west virginia  called the stream protection rule a  last ditch effort  by the obama administration to burden her state s struggling coal industry   the decision by voters last month makes today s announcement by the office of surface mining an exercise in futility   capito said in a statement   working with president elect trump and our republican congressional majority  i am confident that we will be able to use the congressional review act to stop this rule from taking effect
