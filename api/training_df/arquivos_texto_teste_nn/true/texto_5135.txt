washington  reuters    president donald trump s treasury secretary steven mnuchin used his first senior staff meeting last month to tell his new aides he would not tolerate leaks to the news media  three sources familiar with the matter said  current and former officials said that in a departure from past practice  access to a classified computer system at the white house has been tightened by political appointees to prevent some professional staffers from seeing memos being prepared for the new president   and at the department of homeland security  dhs   some officials told reuters they believe a search is under way for the leaker of a draft intelligence report which found little evidence that citizens of seven muslim majority countries covered by trump s now suspended travel ban pose a threat to the united states   washington career civil servants say the clampdown appears designed to try to limit the flow of information inside and outside government agencies charged with foreign policy and national security and to deter officials from talking to the media about topics that could result in negative stories  the white house did not immediately comment on friday about why it is trying to crack down on leaks  trump  who has been infuriated by some news reports of government dysfunction  has expressed his intention to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the media   we re going to find the leakers  they re going to pay a big price for leaking   he said in response to a reporter s question during a meeting with lawmakers on feb    at a news conference the same day  trump said he had asked the department of justice to look into leaks of  classified information that was given illegally  to journalists regarding contacts between some of his aides and russian officials  several officials in different government agencies who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity said some employees fear their phone calls and emails may be monitored and that they are reluctant to speak their minds during internal discussions  reuters has no independent evidence of this happening  in another effort to deter leaks  white house spokesman sean spicer demanded that some aides there surrender their phones so they could be checked for calls or texts to reporters  politico reported on sunday   word of the inspection quickly leaked  trump said later he supported spicer  he added  i would have handled it differently than sean  but sean handles it his way and i m ok with it   he said in an interview with fox news   on friday  spicer did not respond to requests for comment on his reasons for demanding the phones from his staff  two sources familiar with mnuchin s first meeting with senior treasury staff said he told them that their telephone calls and emails could be monitored to prevent leaks  one of the sources said that staff were told that monitoring could become  policy   asked about mnuchin s comments to his senior staff  a treasury spokesman said   secretary mnuchin had a discussion with staff about confidential information not being shared with the media nor any other sources  in the course of that conversation  the idea of checking phones was not discussed   asked in a follow up email whether mnuchin had raised the possibility of monitoring phones or emails as a matter of policy  the treasury spokesman replied   it was not discussed    attempts by republican and democratic presidents to limit leaks are not new  during republican richard nixon s administration  the fbi wiretapped white house aides and journalists  trump s predecessor  democrat barack obama  aggressively pursued leaks to try to  control the narrative   as white house aides put it  new york times reporter james risen  whose articles led to investigations of leaks  said the obama administration prosecuted nine cases involving whistleblowers and leakers  compared with three by all previous administrations combined  leonard downie  a former executive editor of the washington post  said it was too early to make historical comparisons  he said it is rare to learn about an administration s internal efforts to impose message discipline  at the state department  the fear of getting caught in a leak investigation or running afoul of white house positions is so acute that some officials will discuss issues only face to face rather than use phones  email  texts or other messaging applications  two state department officials said   there is a climate of intimidation  not just about talking to reporters  but also about communicating with colleagues   said one official  speaking on condition of anonymity  acting state department spokesman mark toner did not respond directly to the officials  statements but said secretary of state rex tillerson aimed to foster an open climate where new ideas are raised and considered on their merits   there does have to be some degree of trust among colleagues in order to have those kinds of conversations   toner said    there also is high anxiety in parts of dhs   three officials there said  they said some officials fear phone calls and emails are being monitored to try to find who leaked the draft intelligence  report to the associated press  reuters has no independent evidence that this is the case  the report found that being a citizen of countries covered by trump s jan   temporary immigration ban   iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen   was  an unreliable indicator of terrorist threat   the dhs did not respond to several requests for comment  before trump s jan   inauguration  national security council officials drafting memos  or  packages   for the president on a classified computer system could choose other officials who should have input  several current and former officials said  under a change made after trump took office  staffers now cannot choose who may see and edit a memo  instead  access is approved by the office of the nsc executive secretary  retired army lieutenant general keith kellogg  asked about the new restrictions  national security council spokesman michael anton said   president trump takes very seriously the criminal release of classified information critical to u s  national security  access procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate personnel see material relevant to their duties  while protecting sensitive information   one u s  official called the new system  inefficient   saying kellogg s office may not know who has a stake in any given issue and may not share the drafts widely enough  steven aftergood of the nonprofit federation of american scientists  project on government secrecy  which works to limit official secrecy  said the policy change suggested the white house wants to tighten control over internal deliberations  he said restricting access to information adds friction to the decision making process and predicted that  inferior policy decisions are a likely result   spicer did not immediately comment on friday on whether the new procedure might harm policy making  an administration official said the white house changed the access procedures about a month ago in reaction to leaks of the contents of trump s conversations with the president of mexico and the prime minister of australia  asked if the change had made the nsc less efficient  this official replied   no  because we are being conscientious about ensuring that all relevant staff members and experts are included on materials that they need to see
