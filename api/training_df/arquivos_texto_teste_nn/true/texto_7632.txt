geneva  reuters    syria s political opposition hopes hillary clinton wins the u s  presidential election next week because she has a better understanding of the conflict than donald trump  according to members of a delegation holding talks at the united nations  khaled khoja and hind kabawat  in geneva on monday to press for u n  led negotiations on the release of syrian detainees  said they trusted clinton  a former u s  secretary of state  to deliver on the opposition s top priority   protecting civilians  clinton has called for the establishment of a no fly zone and  safe zones  on the ground in syria to protect non combatants  trump says this could  lead to world war three  due to the potential for conflict with russia  which is providing military support to president bashar al assad  kabawat said trump  who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience  saw islamic state  also known as isis  as the only alternative to assad in syria    for us a woman s leadership at this time would be a good thing  also for many  like trump and others  they think that the syrian conflict is comparing assad with isis and they have to take one side or the other  and of course for them assad will look more prominent than isis   said kabawat    she  clinton  knows that is wrong  she knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom  this is what we are aiming for  to have a president of the u s  with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions   assad  whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of russian warplanes  has branded all those opposed to his rule as  terrorists    trump has said defeating islamic state should be a higher priority than trying to persuade assad to step aside  a departure from a long held u s  policy objective  khoja  leading the syrian opposition delegation in geneva  disagreed with this viewpoint   dealing with only the isis issue will not help with solving the crisis in syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the  assad  regime itself   he said  kabawat  an attorney and a member of the opposition high negotiations committee  added that the syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nation s politics  the opposition delegation  which has links to the free syrian army but not with islamic state or al qaeda linked groups  is in geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases  sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks  khoja said more than  armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from assad s government or russia  adding that the united nations should form a committee on the matter   if it s needed  if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside syria  then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee  and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee  we can discuss it   khoja said   the syrian network of human rights has documented more than   detainees held by the syrian government    held by islamic state and   held by the rest of the opposition  but estimates the real numbers are twice as high
