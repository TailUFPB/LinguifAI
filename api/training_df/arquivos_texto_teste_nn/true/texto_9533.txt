new york  reuters    democratic party activists in some u s  states are using donald trump  the republican presidential candidate who has stirred controversy with his comments about illegal immigrants and women  as the centerpiece of their  get out the vote  campaign for the november elections  in california  canvassers from the orange county democrats carry pictures of trump when they knock on doors ahead of the june  california primary  they ask if people will vote in the primary  and warn that if they don t help pick the strongest possible democrat   this guy will win   said henry vandermeir  the local party chairman in orange county  a traditionally republican island in the state   democrats in new hampshire have unveiled trump sununu lawn signs  looking to tie republican gubernatorial candidate chris sununu to the presumptive republican presidential nominee on issues such as climate change  trump is a skeptic  and healthcare  one sign reads   trump sununu  because health care is for losers   a swipe at trump s vow to repeal the affordable care act  president barack obama s signature healthcare law   every state party is trying to maximize what they can get out of this difference  between candidates  and to tie trump to the republicans in the state   said holly shulman  a spokeswoman for the new hampshire democratic party   the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment  to be sure  republicans appear likely to use hillary clinton  the frontrunner for the democratic nomination who is also a polarizing figure  in a similar fashion    there is no better volunteer recruitment tool  fundraising pitch  or unifier for the republican party than the prospect of a hillary clinton presidency that will surely take us further backwards   the republican national committee said in a statement  democrats are also looking to tie trump to republican senate candidates on the nov   ballot as they seek to regain control of the chamber they lost in the  congressional elections  the democratic senatorial campaign committee last week released so called  trump cards  online  equating several republican senators  policy positions with those of the new york developer      for pennsylvania republican pat toomey and new hampshire s kelly ayotte  for example  the dscc highlighted how they and trump oppose a federal minimum wage hike   the dscc also launched a website in march  partyoftrump com  which labeled some senators  retrumplicans  and asked for donations to help fight senators who support trump  recent polls suggest that a trump clinton matchup could be a tight race  the two candidates were in a dead heat in the three key swing states of florida  ohio and pennsylvania in a quinnipiac university poll earlier in may  and a reuters poll this month showed that much of the backing for clinton and trump comes from people whose primary motivation is to stop the other side from winning  rather than any love for either of the two candidates or their policies      the strategy of highlighting opposing candidates is not without risks  according to bruce newman  the author of  the marketing revolution in politics  what recent u s  presidential campaigns can teach us about effective marketing   if trump   who shocked pundits by beating  other republican hopefuls for the nomination   proves more attractive to the general electorate than hillary clinton  then tying him to other republicans could hurt democrats  we don t know how popular this guy is going to get   newman said   this is just the beginning    this version of the story has been refiled to add dropped  to  in final paragraph
