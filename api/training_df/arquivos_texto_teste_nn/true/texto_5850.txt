washington  reuters    president donald trump said he will announce his nominee to the u s  supreme court on tuesday as he looks to quickly put his stamp on the court by restoring its conservative majority  even as democrats geared up for a senate confirmation fight  trump  set to fill the lingering vacancy on the nation s highest court left by the death of conservative justice antonin scalia in february   said on monday he will reveal his choice at the white house at  p m  on tuesday   gmt on wednesday   two days earlier than previously planned  three conservative u s  appeals court judges appointed to the bench by republican former president george w  bush were among those under close consideration  they are  neil gorsuch  a judge on the denver based  u s  circuit court of appeals  thomas hardiman  who serves on the philadelphia based  u s  circuit court of appeals  and william pryor  a judge on the atlanta based  u s  circuit court of appeals  since scalia s death  the supreme court has been ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals  another conservative justice could be pivotal in cases involving abortion  gun  religious and transgender rights  the death penalty and other contentious matters  trump s appointee to the lifetime post could face stiff opposition from democrats in the republican led u s  senate  which must confirm nominees to the high court  some liberal groups have urged democrats to do everything possible to block trump s nominee  democrats remain furious over majority leader mitch mcconnell s refusal last year to allow the senate to consider democratic president barack obama s nomination of appeals court judge merrick garland for the vacant seat  an action with little precedent in u s  history  democratic senator jeff merkley of oregon vowed to pursue a procedural hurdle called a filibuster for trump s nominee  meaning  votes would be needed in the  seat senate unless its long standing rules are changed  trump s fellow republicans hold a   majority  meaning some democratic votes would be needed   this is the seat that mitch mcconnell and team have stolen from president obama  i won t be complicit in this theft   merkley said in a statement   we need to fight this constitution shredding gambit with everything we ve got   on the senate floor  mcconnell had words of warning for democrats  saying senators should respect trump s election victory and give the nominee  careful consideration followed by an up or down vote   not a filibuster  trump  who took office on jan    said last week he would favor senate republicans eliminating the filibuster  a move dubbed the  nuclear option   for supreme court nominees if democrats block his pick  white house spokesman sean spicer said of democratic opposition   it s all about politics  it s not about qualifications  the president has a right to have his nominees taken up   while not identifying the nominee  spicer referred to the pick as  he  and said the selection came from the list of about  jurists recommended by conservative legal groups  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said this month it is hard to imagine trump picking a nominee who democrats could support  adding he would  absolutely  fight to keep the seat vacant rather than let the senate confirm a nominee deemed to be outside the mainstream  gorsuch    hardiman    and pryor    possess strong conservative credentials  gorsuch joined an opinion in  saying that owners of private companies can object on religious grounds to a provision of the obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women  gorsuch s mother headed the environmental protection agency under republican president ronald reagan before quitting under pressure in   hardiman has embraced a broad interpretation of the u s  constitution s right to bear arms and has backed the right of schools to restrict student speech  gun rights activists are eager for the supreme court to expand on a  ruling that found for the first time that there is an individual right to bear arms for self defense in the home   pryor has been an outspoken critic of the court s  landmark roe v  wade ruling legalizing abortion  calling it  the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history   conservatives are hoping the high court will back restrictions imposed on the procedure by some republican governed states  last year  the supreme court issued its strongest endorsement of abortion rights in more than two decades  striking down a texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in a   ruling  pryor also joined a  ruling favoring a transgender woman who said she was fired when she transitioned from male to female  the supreme court during its current term is due to decide a major transgender rights case for the first time  the justices have not yet heard arguments in the case  in which a virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female born transgender high school student from using the boys  bathroom
