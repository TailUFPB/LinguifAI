 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump is expected to sign executive orders starting on wednesday that include a temporary ban on most refugees and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries  say congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter   trump  who tweeted that a  big day  was planned on national security on wednesday  is expected to ban for several months the entry of refugees into the united states  except for religious minorities escaping persecution  until more aggressive vetting is in place   another order will block visas being issued to anyone from syria  iraq  iran  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen  said the aides and experts  who asked not to be identified   in his tweet late on tuesday  trump said   big day planned on national security tomorrow  among many other things  we will build the wall    more from reuters    commentary  trump s war with the media will damage both    trump to seek  major investigation  on voter fraud    how russia sold its oil jewel  without saying who bought it the border security measures probably include directing the construction of a border wall with mexico and other actions to cut the number of illegal immigrants living in the united states   the sources say the first of the orders will be signed on wednesday  with trump considering measures to tighten border security  he could turn his attention to the refugee issue later this week   stephen legomsky  who was chief counsel at u s  citizenship and immigration services in the obama administration  said the president had the authority to limit refugee admissions and the issuance of visas to specific countries if the administration determined it was in the public s interest    from a legal standpoint  it would be exactly within his legal rights   said legomsky  a professor at washington university school of law in st  louis   but from a policy standpoint  it would be terrible idea because there is such an urgent humanitarian need right now for refugees    oddly enough    trump  kim clones grab hong kong by surprise the republican president  who took office last friday  was expected to sign the first of the orders at the department of homeland security  whose responsibilities include immigration and border security   on the campaign trail  trump initially proposed a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  which he said would protect americans from jihadist attacks   both trump and his nominee for attorney general  senator jeff sessions  have since said they would focus the restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat  rather than a ban on those of a specific religion   many trump supporters decried former president barack obama s decision to increase the number of syrian refugees admitted to the united states over fears that those fleeing the country s civil war would carry out attacks   detractors could launch legal challenges if all the countries subject to the ban are muslim majority nations  said immigration expert hiroshi motomura at ucla school of law   legal arguments could claim the executive orders discriminate against a particular religion  which would be unconstitutional  he said    his comments during the campaign and a number of people on his team focused very much on religion as the target   motomura said   to block entry from the designated countries  trump is likely to tell the state department to stop issuing visas to people from those nations  according to sources familiar with the visa process  he could also instruct u s  customs and border protection to stop any current visa holders from those countries from entering the united states   white house spokesman sean spicer said on tuesday the state and homeland security departments would work on the vetting process once trump s nominee to head the state department  rex tillerson  is installed   other measures may include directing all agencies to finish work on a biometric identification system for non citizens entering and exiting the united states and a crackdown on immigrants fraudulently receiving government benefits  according to the congressional aides and immigration experts   to restrict illegal immigration  trump has promised to build a wall on the u s  mexico border and to deport illegal migrants living inside the united states   trump is also expected to take part in a ceremony installing his new secretary of homeland security  retired marine general john kelly  on wednesday   trump s executive order threatens a refugee resettlement deal with australia signed late last year  and could leave more than   asylum seekers in limbo   the u s  agreed to resettle an unspecified number of refugees being held in papua new guinea  png  and the tiny south pacific island nation of nauru on australia s behalf  under a deal to be administered by the u n  refugee agency    any substantial delay in the relocation of refugees   would be highly concerning from a humanitarian perspective   catherine stubberfield  a spokeswoman of the u n  high commissioner for refugees  told reuters by email    these men  women and children can no longer afford to wait    the deal followed agreement by australia in september to join a u s  led program to resettle refugees from guatemala  honduras and el salvador as part of its annual intake   australia s tough border security laws mandate that asylum seekers intercepted trying to reach the country by boat go for processing to detention camps on png s manus island and nauru   australia does not provide information on the nationalities of those held  but around a third of the   detainees were from countries covered by the executive orders  lawyers and refugee workers for the asylum seekers told reuters    we already didn t have much hope the u s  would accept us   behrouz boochani  an iranian refugee who has spent more than three years on manus island  told reuters    if they do not take us  australia will have to    a spokeswoman for australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull declined to comment
