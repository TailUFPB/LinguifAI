berlin  reuters    after a year of disappointment  european businesses are hoping a victory for hillary clinton in the u s  election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large scale western investments in iran since the opening of its economy  while no one in europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should clinton defeat her republican rival donald trump on nov    a win for the democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year s nuclear deal between iran and world powers  business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the iranian market in   especially in the second half of the year  if a clinton victory is followed by the re election of moderate iranian president hassan rouhani next may   if clinton and rouhani win  then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now   said matthieu etourneau  who advises french firms on the iranian market for medef international  the french employers group   this is what the european banks and companies are waiting for   he said  back in january  when the united states and europe lifted sanctions related to iran s nuclear program  the excitement in europe s business community was palpable  with a population of  million and annual output higher than that of thailand  iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the  break up of the soviet union  european politicians flocked to tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow  rouhani  a pragmatist elected in  on a platform to reduce iran s isolation  traveled to paris and rome to promote his country to eager investors  but within months the euphoria had vanished  replaced by frustration on both sides  the biggest obstacle for european firms seeking to do business in iran has been the reluctance of the continent s largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of u s  sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line  the united states has taken steps to reassure the banks  last month the treasury department s office of foreign assets control  ofac  issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing u s  dollar transactions with iran  but secretary of state john kerry acknowledged at a think tank event in london this week that banks remained skittish  german officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by u s  sanctions coordinator daniel fried  this caution is likely to persist  regardless of who is sitting in the white house  beyond the issue of sanctions  the poor state of iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system  the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners   everyone knows now that this will be a long  step by step process to build up our economic ties   said friedolin strack  head of international markets at the federation of german industries  bdi   still  a clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to europe  her close adviser jake sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed iran s disputed nuclear activity  and she has defended it during the election campaign  trump  by contrast  has called it  one of the worst deals ever made  and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected  bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in europe  recently however  there have been signs of movement  smaller german banks  pressed by their clients to support them in iran  are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services   medium sized banks that finance the german mittelstand have a great deal of interest in iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively   said siegfried utzig  acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the association of german banks  bvb    we can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it s still quite far away   in june  the german government began offering export credit guarantees via insurance group euler hermes for firms wanting to trade with iran  edna schoene  head of german government business at euler hermes  said about  formal applications had been received since then with a total value of about   billion euros  nine of them have been approved  add to that roughly  non binding letters of interest  lois  that have been issued and the volumes push up into the double digit billions of euros  schoene said   the potential in iran is enormous and the demand for export credit guarantees is high  both in terms of formal applications and expressions of interest   schoene said   i expect that we will see the first large scale  credit financed deals in    some european firms are already benefiting from the opening of the iranian economy  last week french carmaker psa group  peup pa   once the market leader  announced it had produced   cars in iran under the peugeot license in the third quarter   percent of its total sales volume  etourneau of medef international is also optimistic that iran s order of  jets from europe s airbus  air pa  and a recent joint venture deal between carmaker renault  rena pa  and iranian investment fund idro will prove a boon for smaller european suppliers     medef international announced last month it was opening an office in tehran  its first outside france  to support small and medium sized french firms seeking to enter the iranian market   we expect that   billion euros in public contracts to be attributed by the iranians before the end of their fiscal year in march   etourneau said   what we are telling companies is that they need a   year strategy  the market will open up progressively
