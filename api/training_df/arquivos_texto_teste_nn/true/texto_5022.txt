new york  reuters    the trump national golf club in westchester county  new york  has a magnificent course  just ask its namesake  u s  president donald trump  who until recently was quoted on its website saying the club  provides more than a membership   it s a true luxury lifestyle   the business is worth more than   million and yielded more than   million from  to early   according to the financial disclosure form trump filed last may  but seven months earlier  an attorney for trump filed a lawsuit against the town of ossining  new york  seeking lower taxes  claiming the course was worth only    million  the lawsuit  which remains pending  has left at least one local official worried that taking a tough negotiating stance against a business owned by the world s most powerful political figure puts her town of   residents at risk of retribution   are we  the puny town of ossining  going to choose to go up against the president s company   said dana levenberg  the town supervisor   i wouldn t want to do anything that has negative repercussions for the town of ossining   ethics experts said disagreements between trump businesses and local governments create unavoidable conflicts of interest  since the federal government is a key source of funding and other benefits for municipalities and counties  over decades as a hard charging businessman  trump has been embroiled in numerous legal battles with local governments  from lawsuits to property tax appeals to zoning fights  at least half a dozen disputes  including the westchester lawsuit  remained unresolved as the trump presidency began in late january   donald trump has shown to date that he can play hardball in these kinds of disputes   said noah bookbinder  executive director of the nonprofit citizens for responsibility and ethics   i would imagine any local official would at least have a moment of pause before going as hard as they otherwise would against the trump companies   but some local officials said they would handle trump related disputes in the same manner as any other  without fear or favor  in florida s palm beach county  where a trump golf course was challenging its tax bill  the county mayor  paulette burdick  allowed that trump s position as president  would pop into my mind  but insisted that officials treat every resident equally  a white house spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment  the trump organization also did not respond to requests for comment  although federal conflicts of interest law does not apply to the president  trump has nevertheless faced criticism since his election about the potential conflicts posed by his business empire  past officeholders have generally placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any appearance of impropriety   trump  however  has refused to do so  instead turning over day to day management of his companies to his two adult sons without divesting his stake  ethics experts have said that solution does nothing to address the problem  since trump still stands to profit from businesses that remain under the control of his immediate family  according to public records and interviews with officials  trump s pending tax disputes at the time of his inauguration included cases in florida  where his lawyers challenged the tax bills for two trump owned golf courses  washington  d c   where trump s new hotel sued the district over its assessment  and chicago  where trump s company filed multiple lawsuits seeking property tax relief for a hotel  new york city records show trump companies were seeking tax breaks for commercial space at both trump tower and trump international hotel and tower  the president also filed appeals in los angeles county over the value of his beverly hills mansion  over the years  trump has repeatedly brought lawsuits against palm beach  florida  for various issues related to mar a lago  his  winter white house   though no case is active  his golf courses also frequently require permits from local governments for construction and development  federal decisions on everything from antiterrorism funding to infrastructure projects can have an outsized impact on states and cities  the mere appearance of a possible quid pro quo  undermines public confidence   said larry noble  the general counsel for the campaign legal center  a nonpartisan group dedicated to democratic reform   it just distorts the decision making field   he said   there are numerous ways a president can help a local government   or not   not all local officials share levenberg s concerns  in palm beach county  steven abrams is both a county commissioner and the chairman of the value adjustment board  which handles tax appeals  placing him squarely in the middle of the issue  but he said trump s status would have no impact on the process   there are pretty standard formulas for determining  property values  he said   there s not a lot of room for discretion based on who you are   for her part  levenberg said the prospect of going up against the president s business is  really scary   but she said she has become more emboldened in recent months after receiving supportive emails from residents urging her to hold the line    you should be paying your share of taxes   she said   you need to shoulder your part of the community burden  and if you re not doing it  that means everybody is picking up the slack for you
