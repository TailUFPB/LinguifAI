washington  reuters    u s  intelligence officials told top congressional leaders a year ago that russian hackers were attacking the democratic party  three sources familiar with the matter said on thursday  but the lawmakers were unable to tell the targets about the hacking because the information was so secret  the disclosure of the top secret information would have revealed that u s  intelligence agencies were continuing to monitor the hacking  as well as the sensitive intelligence sources and the methods they were using to do it  the material was marked with additional restrictions and assigned a unique codeword  limiting access to a small number of officials who needed to know that u s  spy agencies had concluded that two russian intelligence agencies or their proxies were targeting the democratic national committee  the central organizing body of the democratic party  the national security agency and other intelligence agencies sometimes delay informing targets of foreign intelligence activities under similar circumstances  officials have said  the alleged hacking of the democrats and the russian connection did not become public until late last month when the fbi said it was investigating a cyber attack at the dnc  the dnc did not respond to a request for comment for this story  the congressional briefing was given last summer in a secure room called a sensitive compartmented information facility  or scif  to a group of congressional leaders informally known as the  gang of eight   the sources said  the group at the time included four republicans  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house of representatives speaker john boehner  and senator richard burr and representative devin nunes  the house and senate intelligence committee chairs  their democratic counterparts were  senator harry reid and representative nancy pelosi  and senator dianne feinstein and representative adam schiff of the intelligence committees  ashlee strong  press secretary for the current house speaker  paul ryan  declined to comment  and pelosi s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment pelosi on thursday called the hacking an  electronic watergate  and said the russians were behind it  dnc officials have said they did not learn about the hacking until months after the initial congressional briefing  when an agent from an fbi cybersecurity squad asked them last fall about the party s data security arrangements  even then  the democratic sources said  the fbi agent never mentioned that u s  intelligence officials suspected that russian hackers were targeting the organization  the attack on the dnc later led the hackers to other party organizations  including the democratic congressional campaign committee  which raises funds for house candidates  hillary clinton s presidential campaign  and other groups  a dccc spokeswoman declined to comment  the hackers initially used  spearphishing    attacks on the private email accounts of dozens of people working for the organizations  several sources said  one of the sources said the clinton campaign first detected attacks on its data system in early march  and was given what the source described as a  general briefing  about it by the fbi later that month  the source said the fbi made no mention of a russian connection in that briefing and did not say when the penetration first took place   according to a memo obtained by reuters  interim dnc chair donna brazile said on thursday she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board  to ensure prevent future attacks and ensure that the dnc s cybersecurity capabilities are best in class    this version of the story corrects seventh paragraph to show that john boehner was house speaker at time of briefing
