london  reuters    if the fallout from a huge eu tax bill handed to apple includes a push to encourage u s  firms to bring more profits onshore  recent history suggests the impact for the dollar can only be positive   u s  presidential candidates donald trump and hillary clinton have both promised to take steps that would encourage major companies to bring home more of the estimated    trillion in as yet untaxed income they hold offshore   that amount compares to the roughly   billion brought back in  under george w  bush s homeland investment act  hia   which slashed the effective tax rate on repatriated funds from  percent to   percent   as this graphic tmsnrt rs  shows  the dollar rose around  percent that year against both the euro and the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength  even if analysts still argue about how far that move was driven by the tax scheme   against the yen in the same period it rose  percent     the fact that u s  corporations hold larger cash piles offshore than ever is a reason why a new repatriation tax holiday could be a bigger boost for the dollar than in    morgan stanley said in a report in july    though we stress the headline number for offshore earnings overstates the unhedged foreign currency amount  which is relevant for fx markets   the u s  bank also lays out tables of data that it says show where the most money has accumulated  some  percent of funds have been reinvested in europe  including  and  percent in ireland and the netherlands respectively  compared to  percent each in traditional tax havens like bermuda or singapore  but a trawl through the accounts of the biggest u s  corporate holders of funds oversees suggests that much of these funds are held in dollars   meaning little or no money would have to be exchanged from  say  euros into dollars   apple  for example  said last year its    billion in cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were  generally based in u s  dollar denominated holdings    as of june    percent of microsoft s   billion was in u s  government and agency securities  corporate debt or mortgage backed securities  given that in  only around   billion of an estimated   billion in untaxed offshore funds were brought home  that suggests many firms  repatriations might not involve any foreign exchange at all  citigroup chief currency strategist steven englander said that even the simple return of dollars to the united states is likely to have a big impact on the currency    the dollar money would come back into u s  equity markets quicker than the non dollar cash   he said    it would be very good for u s  equity markets and would probably attract foreign money into the u s   pushing up u s  yields in a risk friendly way  it would be very dollar positive   englander  who also studied the issue in detail the last time a new repatriation act was being talked up in   says the figure for the amount currently being held abroad is something like    trillion  converting even a small share of that huge sum from foreign currencies could be significant   no one knows the currency breakdown for sure   percent in dollars sounds reasonable  so  percent of    trillion is a big number   he added
