washington  reuters    the obama administration  in its final weeks  plans to ease the legal obligations on prisoners to pay for child support while they are locked up  targeting practices that critics say can saddle ex convicts with crippling debts  the regulatory changes  if put in place  would give president barack obama something more to show for his efforts to reform the u s  criminal justice system  a legacy issue for the democrat whose time in office ends on jan    as the first black president of a nation that incarcerates a disproportionately large number of black and latino men  obama has made it a priority to address problems that make it difficult for released inmates to reenter society  a white house official  speaking on condition of anonymity because the new rules are not final  expressed confidence they would be completed before obama leaves office  the rules would require that prisoners be allowed to lower the amount of child support they pay in prison  with the goal of preventing large debts that inmates struggle to repay after release and that can lead to reincarceration  some republican critics have said such a change would let parents flout their financial responsibilities  republican speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan last year introduced a bill to block the administration from making such a change  the bill did not become law  a republican house aide told reuters the administration s initiative would amount to a  backdoor effort  to avoid the legislative process  criminal justice reform was supposed to be an area where republicans and democrats could find common ground in   but legislative efforts have stalled  as a result  the administration needs to move forward on its own where it can  the white house official said   we are always happy to sit down and talk with congress  but at some point we have to move forward with what we know we are legally permitted to do and what is right   the official said  child support programs require absent parents to send money  usually to the spouse who has custody  to help raise their children  for prisoners who have little or no income  regular child support payments can accumulate into unmanageable debts  just ask glenn martin  as a young father  he went to prison for six years for armed robbery  while in prison  his child support payments were increased to   a month from   a month  even though he only earned about   a month       when he was released  martin told reuters he faced a    civil judgment for back child support  including interest  he said he tried to get that changed  but judges said state law did not permit modifications for incarceration  martin went on to found a prison reform group  justleadershipusa   we have two decades of evidence that says that being tough just hasn t worked   he said   what it has done is further criminalize the people we should be trying to move into the labor market   most states have changed their laws so that child support payments for prisoners can be modified  but  states still do not allow it or place major obstacles in the way  the obama administration issued draft regulations in late  that would require states to allow prisoners to modify their child support court orders  while also requiring state courts to set orders based on prisoners   actual  income  states run their own child support enforcement programs  but washington sets nationwide standards and reimburses states for  percent of expenditures on the programs and provides incentive payments to states based on meeting certain targets     the final version of the draft rules  still not public  was sent to the white house for review in july  supporters say the changes will help reduce prison populations by preventing ex convicts from accruing debts that make it difficult for them to find legitimate jobs and increases the likelihood they could face jail time over unpaid child support payments  a  administration survey found   federal prisoners had child support orders  with almost   of the prisoners behind on payments  the average amount owed was nearly      the child support system as it exists today in a lot of ways has become     a major driver of mass incarceration   said rebecca vallas  managing director of the poverty to prosperity program at the center for american progress  a washington think tank
