washington  reuters    democrat candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders each picked up primary wins on tuesday in yet another demonstration of how divided the party is in the drawn out national race to win the nomination for november s general election  clinton narrowly defeated sanders in kentucky  a state where she was not expected to win  sanders bested her in oregon  a state that played to his strengths  in kentucky  the two candidates will likely split the  delegates up for grabs  in oregon  sanders will take only a handful more of the  delegates that were awarded      clinton s sizeable lead in delegates means it is likely she will eventually be her party s nominee  but she remains more than  delegates short of sealing the deal  the democratic primary now hits a two week lull  with the final set major contests  including california  scheduled for june   clinton  who spent the past two days campaigning in kentucky  would like to lock up the nomination and turn her attention to the nov   general election and presumptive republican nominee donald trump  trump has begun to organize his general election campaign  on tuesday  he signed a joint fundraising agreement with the republican national committee  the agreement allows him to raise    from a single donor by splitting the funds between his campaign  the rnc and state republican parties   trump  who eschewed donations in the political system through the primary  has thus far insisted on mostly self funding his campaign  the shift to a more traditional fundraising approach could draw the ire of some supporters  trump  in an interview with megyn kelly that aired on fox news tuesday night  said he did have regrets about his actions during the republican primary process   i could have used different language in a couple of instances  but overall i m happy with the outcome   trump said   sanders supporters became angry when nevada state party officials chose to end their convention and block efforts to award the u s  senator from vermont more delegates than he initially won in the february caucus  clinton won the caucus  the nevada incident was a warning about the potential for fireworks at july s democratic national convention in philadelphia  clinton s campaign continued to express confidence that she would be able to unify the party   hillary clinton is grateful to the thousands of nevadans who came out to participate in the caucuses and convention process   clinton campaign manager robby mook said   she believes every voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated  harassed or threatened in this process  when the primary process is complete  our party must come together and ensure a democrat is elected to serve as our next president   mook said  sanders on tuesday joined his supporters in criticizing the nevada democratic party after saturday s events  one sanders supporter threw a chair  unhappy about being blocked in a rules vote that was part of the effort to help the senator win more delegates to the national convention  others drew chalk graffiti on a party building  while the state s party chairwoman has been receiving death threats  sanders framed nevada s incident as a warning   if the democratic party is to be successful in november  it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned   sanders said in a statement on the nevada incident    sanders   who said he condemns violence and personal harassment of individuals   leveled some of the same complaints his supporters did  arguing that state party chairwoman roberta lange did not allow a headcount on a disputed rules change  he also argued that  delegates to the state convention were not given a hearing before being ruled ineligible  the state party disputed the sanders campaign s interpretation of the events  it said some delegates did not show up at the convention and others were disqualified because they were not registered as democrats in time   the sanders campaign is continuing to be dishonest about what happened saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the threats of violence of his supporters   the nevada democratic party said in a statement  sanders supporters began circulating a picture of lange on the internet that included her cellphone number and encouraged others to contact her to express their unhappiness   lange said on msnbc she had been receiving death threats  including many containing vulgar language  public messages sent to her twitter account included a barrage of derogatory statements  msnbc played some of the voicemails  including one saying  people like you should be hung in a public execution    what you heard is a few of the thousands of emails and texts and facebook messages and twitter messages that i ve gotten   lange said on msnbc   threats to my family  to my grandson  to my husband   sanders  continued presence in the race is prompting concerns among clinton allies that he will damage her ability to take on trump and hurt her in the fall   but sanders supporters shrug off that worry  arguing that trump is such a flawed candidate that clinton will easily dispatch with him if she faces him in the nov   election  clinton s camp seems to agree    ultimately  we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose   to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the white house out of donald trump s hands   her campaign manager mook said
