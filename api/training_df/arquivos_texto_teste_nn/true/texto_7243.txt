washington  reuters    it will be a new day at the u s  securities and exchange commission after president elect donald trump installs his choice to run the agency  with trump s transition team already in regulatory relief mode and promising to revamp the dodd frank financial reform legislation  some rules already are marked for death or dialback  expected on the chopping block soon after trump takes the oath of office is a proposal that would require companies to disclose pay ratios between their ceos and employees  another would require companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals   minerals that were mined in a war torn region of africa  dead for now is any prospect of the sec approving a tough fiduciary rule for financial advisers  say policy experts  trump s decision to tap former republican sec commissioner paul atkins to help manage the trump team s transition efforts at the sec and other financial agencies offers a window into some other changes that could be in store  atkins  the founder of the regulatory consulting firm patomak global partners  is viewed by some to be a top contender for the position of sec chairman itself  though as the transition head he could also recommend someone else for that job    atkins  well known conservative views on everything from enforcement penalties to corporate governance are likely to be reflected in the sec s agenda  here are five policy areas likely to change  paul atkins was a staunch critic of the public company accounting oversight board  pcaob   a body created after the enron accounting scandal to police and write new rules for corporate auditors  atkins raised concerns about the board s budget and high salaries  and advocated against prescriptive accounting rules that he felt constrained auditors from making professional judgments  recently  republicans have criticized the pcaob for taking on more progressive causes  such as proposing companies rotate auditors to reduce conflicts or requiring accounting firms to disclose the name of individual partners working on company audits  the pcaob s chairman jim doty  who advocated for the controversial reform measures  will almost certainly not be re appointed by the incoming sec chair   i expect that a new chair will refocus the board s standard setting agenda on the core audit function   said hunton   williams partner scott kimpel   i would expect a return to the basics   the topic of whether to impose corporate penalties against a company would come under scrutiny  during his time at the sec  atkins advocated for an enforcement approach that he said did not unduly punish corporate shareholders that had already suffered from the misconduct  he called for the sec to carefully weigh who had profited from the bad behavior  and urged the sec to hold individuals accountable for their actions  atkins has long opined that the sec s rules requiring  best price  execution of stock trades actually skews the market by causing fragmentation and harming price discovery by directing orders away from traditional stock exchanges into  dark pool  trading platforms  as a commissioner  paul atkins was critical of the rule called regulation national market system  nms   saying it could impede true price discovery and encourage gaming of the system  in january  he wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal calling for the sec to do major surgery on the rule  allowing considerations beyond  best price  and speed to determine order flow  the dodd frank law gave the sec newfound powers to reward whistleblowers who come forward with tips of corporate malfeasance  from august  through fiscal year   the sec has received more than   tips  and by august of   the program had given out more than   million in rewards  but corporate america has long disliked the part of the rule that protects whistleblowers from having to report wrongdoing to their own companies before they tip off the government  in   atkins urged the sec to require whistleblowers to report internally first  saying a failure to do so could undermine compliance programs  whether this will change remains to be seen  especially in the wake of the wells fargo   co scandal  where employees who reported internally about the opening of unauthorized accounts were fired  atkins  cares deeply about the commission and its enforcement program   said jordan thomas  a whistleblower attorney at labaton sucharow who previously worked in the sec s enforcement division during atkins  tenure   i find it very hard to believe that he would support undermining such a successful program   atkins was a strong proponent of the  jump start our business startups act  which scaled back some sec rules to help smaller companies raise capital  in testimony on capitol hill  atkins advocated for additional steps to be taken to help smaller companies  including rules to help create venture exchanges for mid cap stocks and broadening efforts to exempt private capital raising rules from regulation by states
