new york  reuters    donald trump campaigned for president as a savvy billionaire who would apply his business acumen to improving the u s  economy  cutting taxes for americans and negotiating better trade deals  but his vast  complicated network of businesses under the trump organization  including numerous foreign investments and debts  could create unprecedented conflicts of interest when he takes the oath of office as u s  president in january  government ethics experts said   federal law does not prohibit the president from being involved in private business while in office  even though members of congress and lower ranking executive branch officials are subject to strict conflict of interest rules  lyndon johnson  for instance  quietly managed his broadcasting businesses despite insisting publicly that he had ceased all involvement  according to his biographer  robert caro   there are no legal restrictions  no legal requirements   said noah bookbinder  the executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington  but most presidents in recent decades have voluntarily placed their personal assets  including property and financial holdings  in blind trusts overseen by independent advisers to avoid any appearance of impropriety  experts said  under a blind trust  the owner has no say or knowledge in how the assets are managed  president barack obama was one exception  but his investments are mostly in broad based index funds and u s  treasury notes with little chance of conflicts  trump s businesses include licensing deals  hotels and golf courses around the world  during the campaign  he filed a  page financial disclosure statement  as required by law  that showed he had financial interests in more than  entities with names like china trademark llc and dt marks qatar llc but had few details  while plenty of wealthy men have been president  no one has ascended to the white house with such a complex array of assets  trump s spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how he planned to manage his businesses while he was in the white house  during the campaign  trump did say he would likely transfer day to day operations to his children  but experts in government ethics said that would do little to insulate trump   that presumably frees some time up for him to be the president  but it doesn t do anything to clear the conflicts of interest   said kenneth gross  a washington  d c  based lawyer who has counseled high ranking political appointees on ethics laws   his family s interests  his children s interests  are co existent with his own   the nature of trump s businesses  gross said  makes a blind trust all but meaningless   even if he were inclined to shift control of his empire from his family  an idea he has rejected  gross advised michael bloomberg  a new york billionaire businessman  when he became mayor of new york city  bloomberg stepped away from day to day operations at his data and media company  bloomberg lp  and donated all terminals that were used by city agencies to avoid any impression of profiting from public funds  some of the potential problems for the republican president elect are obvious  one of his latest ventures  a luxury hotel in washington just blocks from the white house  leases its property from the u s  government  putting trump on both sides of any landlord tenant disputes  others are more opaque  trump has licensing deals and diverse real estate holdings in numerous countries that could benefit from foreign government subsidies or tax breaks  companies in which he holds an interest owe hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to foreign banks that are subject to u s  regulations  such as deutsche bank and bank of china  according to the new york times and the wall street journal  his properties include hotels in countries like turkey  uruguay  the philippines and south korea  and golf courses in the united arab emirates  ireland and britain    conflicts of interest could stem  for example  from countries trying to influence policies by doing business with any of his companies or even his children  his daughter ivanka has a line of fashion products  which along with other trump branded items are made in countries like china  trump has accused china of currency manipulation and threatened to put tariffs on its imports  trump s opponent  democratic nominee hillary clinton  faced criticism during the campaign over the clinton foundation  the charity founded by her husband  former president bill clinton  that was despite an ethics agreement that hillary clinton signed in  in order to become obama s secretary state that was designed to ensure donors could not sway u s  foreign policy  under the deal  the state department was allowed to review any new contributions from foreign governments  unlike clinton  however  trump is not answerable to anyone else as president  and he has already shown himself willing to blur the lines between campaigning and marketing  holding events at his own properties and touting his companies during speeches   given the high profile properties that bear his name  a blind trust would do little to help his case  experts said   you can t put a golf course in a blind trust  it would be pointless   said robert kelner  a washington lawyer and an expert on government ethics   the idea behind a blind trust is that it s blind   you don t know what assets are held   the only unassailable solution  experts said  would be for trump to sell off his businesses and place the proceeds in a blind trust  with no legal requirements  trump s actions as president are only subject to the will of the voters or to built in checks and balances like congressional oversight   the potential for conflicts is exacerbated by the lack of publicly known details about trump s holdings  even his net worth is unclear  trump has boasted of more than   billion in wealth  but financial magazines have estimated his fortune at less than half that  he has refused to release his tax returns  breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition  and legal experts said he is under no obligation to do so as president  his dealings with foreign governments are thus largely unknown  he will likely face scrutiny of policy decisions that affect countries where he is known to have business interests  said bookbinder
