 washington  reuters    donald trump may have done just enough in sunday s presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat   and that may have put republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position   had trump imploded  the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent  increasing demands for him to drop out of the race   but that didn t happen  now  republicans who have seen their party torn apart by trump s candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma  publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the white house   the manhattan real estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate  hammering his democratic opponent hillary clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  and again raising decades old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband bill clinton   that likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat clinton in the nov   election    his no holds barred approach to hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since bill clinton was in office   said craig robinson  former political director of the iowa republican party   the republican base and talk radio will love this performance    but the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women  college educated  and suburban voters  a recent reuters ipsos poll showed close to  percent of americans were still undecided on which candidate to support  sixty percent of those were women   a poll taken by cnn immediately following the debate showed republicans have reason to be anxious  viewers said clinton had beaten trump in the encounter   percent to  percent   the furor over the  videotape  in which trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women  led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him  including arizona senator john mccain  their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of president richard nixon  a republican  in    the house republican conference  a body comprised of the almost  republicans in the u s  house of representatives  was set to meet on monday to discuss the foundering trump campaign  a house leadership aide said  house speaker paul ryan pointedly disinvited trump for a joint appearance in wisconsin that had been scheduled for saturday following publication of the tape   all but six of the  republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned trump s comments in the video  although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out   since the release of the video  the party s governing body  the republican national committee  has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it    there hasn t been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the rnc going forward   said an rnc official who asked to remain unidentified   the tape intensified talk in republican circles about diverting funds from trump to prop up house and senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash    it s well past time to cut all ties with trump and focus on preserving the republican congress and down ballot offices  immediately   said john weaver  a veteran republican strategist   republican officials have another worry  that trump s unpopularity may lead many republican voters to stay at home on election day   against this backdrop of panic and condemnation  trump on sunday sought to rally the party s base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about   he offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the country s chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage  he also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husband s sexual history   in doing so  trump may have stopped the bleeding  but he did nothing to stop the worrying
