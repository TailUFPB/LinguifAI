washington  reuters    democrat hillary clinton will press republican donald trump to provide more specifics on his policies in their presidential debate on monday  two top clinton campaign aides said ahead of a face off that could set u s  television audience records      on the eve of the debate at hofstra university in suburban new york  aides to clinton have sought to cast trump  a new york businessman and former reality tv host  as lacking the temperament and experience to serve as president  trump s aides for their part have sought to reinforce voter doubts about clinton s trustworthiness  the debate  the first of three face to face matchups between the two candidates  will begin at  p m  on monday   gmt on tuesday   it comes as opinion polls show a tight race between clinton  a former secretary of state  and trump  six weeks before the nov   election   we re going to have a lot of people really tuning into this election for the first time  they re going to see these two candidates onstage   clinton campaign manager robby mook said on sunday in an interview with abc s  this week    i think they re going to see that donald trump is unfit  unprepared  and over his head  i doubt he will have a command of the issues   mook said clinton would challenge trump at the debate  to reveal what his plans are  you know  for example  he has not revealed any plan whatsoever to defeat isis  islamic state  militants   trump has said he would work closely with nato allies to defeat islamic state and vowed to wage a  military  cyber and financial  war against the militant group   donald trump s been all about himself  but she s got to tell people what she wants to do for them   john podesta  chairman of clinton s campaign  told nbc s  meet the press  on sunday  trump s campaign manager  kellyanne conway  in a separate  this week  interview on sunday  attacked clinton s trustworthiness   you know  if you re running against a clinton  veracity is certainly always on the table   she said   hillary clinton s casual relationship with the truth is well known to americans  i m sure we ll see it on full display tomorrow night   the trump campaign put to rest on sunday the prospect that he might invite gennifer flowers  who had an affair with clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  to attend the debate  after dallas mavericks owner mark cuban  a clinton supporter and vociferous critic of trump  tweeted that he had a  front row  seat to watch the hofstra debate  trump raised the possibility in a tweet of inviting flowers to the debate  but mike pence  trump s running mate  told  fox news sunday  that flowers would not attend the debate   donald trump was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by hillary clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from what the american people are going to be focused on tomorrow night  which is on the issues  on the choice that we face   pence said  supporters of both candidates sought to manage expectations before the debate  mook said the moderator of monday s debate  nbc news anchor lester holt  should fact check candidates  statements  although trump s campaign said it should be up to american voters to gauge who they thought was telling the truth  to prepare for the debate  clinton has been holding mock debate sessions where longtime aide philippe reines plays the role of trump  trump aides said their candidate  who like clinton participated in numerous tv debates during their respective parties  nominating races  was preparing for monday s event but not doing mock debates where someone plays the role of clinton  trump s advisers said the republican presidential nominee was going up against a highly seasoned politician   he s the outsider  he s a person who has never run before  let alone be in a presidential debate  but he s going to be ready   said republican national committee chairman reince priebus   and i think one of the things donald trump has going for him is he s got very good instincts
