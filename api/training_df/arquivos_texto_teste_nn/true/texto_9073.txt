washington  reuters    if the u s  supreme court in the coming days decides a high profile immigration case in favor of the obama administration  the ruling could have an unexpected beneficiary  republican presidential contender donald trump    the obama administration is asking the high court to revive its  proposal to protect up to  million people from deportation  a plan that was blocked by lower courts  the court could rule that a president has broad authority to interpret and enforce federal immigration law   such a ruling would allow obama to implement his signature executive action on immigration  aimed at the parents of u s  citizens  children  before he leaves office  it could also help trump  who has put forth his own sweeping and controversial plans on immigration ahead of the nov   election   to the extent the court has language about the president s wide authority in immigration law generally  that would certainly strengthen trump s hand   said stephen yale loehr  an immigration law expert at cornell law school  the supreme court s ruling will come at a key phase in the presidential election cycle  with candidates trump and his democratic rival hillary clinton trading jabs over immigration policy following the mass shooting in a orlando nightclub in which a gunman killed  people   trump has proposed curbing immigration from countries with a history of terrorism  blocking the entry of muslims and deporting the estimated  million people in the united states who entered the country illegally   if he wins the race for the white house  trump might need to invoke his own executive authority   as happened with obama   if the u s  congress does not approve his proposals  which have sparked outrage at home and abroad  the current case is unlikely to provide any support for trump s  proposal to bar muslims  which legal experts say would face other legal hurdles because it targets people on the basis of religion  but legal experts say it could help trump if he seeks to block entry from certain countries under a provision of immigration law that gives the president the power to suspend entry of noncitizens whose entry  would be detrimental to the interests of the united states    that provision has previously only been used block entry of small groups of people  such as officials linked with foreign governments hostile to the united states  applying it to entire countries could prompt a similar lawsuit to the one filed against obama  clinton could also seize on an obama victory in the case  but her own immigration proposals are more modest  she has said that absent action by congress to reform the system entirely  she would keep obama s program in place and seek to expand on it  under the u s  constitution  congress passes laws and the executive branch enforces them  in the immigration context  congress has traditionally given the president considerable leeway to interpret how to implement the laws  the high court  evenly split   between liberals and conservatives following the death of justice antonin scalia in february  could decide the case on narrower grounds than the broad question of executive power   it could avoid touching on immigration law at all by finding that the states challenging obama s proposal did not have legal standing to sue  the court could also split    which would leave in place the lower court decision blocking the plan but without setting any legal precedent      u s  presidents generally have discretion to enforce immigration law  but the plan s challengers said obama exceeded the limits of his authority by setting up a program that would allow millions to gain temporary legal status and work permits   critics say his plan was unlawful in part because it effectively granted relief from deportation to a much bigger class of people than had ever benefited from any similar programs in the past  texas and  other states who filed suit said it was an unconstitutional abuse of power  obama s lawyers told the supreme court that obama was acting within the government s exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide who to deport
