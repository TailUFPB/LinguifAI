washington  reuters    republicans on wednesday passed a bill in the house of representatives that touched on nearly every step u s  agencies take in creating and applying new rules  continuing their blitz to radically reform  abusive  federal regulation of areas from the environment to the workplace  in a   vote  the house passed the  regulatory accountability act   which combined eight bills aimed at changing how the vast government bureaucracy runs  only five democrats voted for it  the legislation would give president elect donald trump tools  to wipe out abusive regulation   said bob goodlatte  the judiciary committee chairman who is among the many house leaders calling for lighter regulation and saying the costs to comply with federal rules are too high  republicans say there is little accountability for regulations that apply to almost every aspect of american life because they are created by appointed officials and not elected representatives  federal agencies operate either independently or under the president s authority   the current reform push is part of trump s campaign promise to  drain the swamp   house majority leader kevin mccarthy said on wednesday  as house republicans push for reform   last week they passed bills requiring congressional approval of major rules and giving congress power to kill dozens of recently enacted ones   democrats are fighting back  democrats have said the many extra procedures required by the reform bills would stall agencies  work  making it impossible to create needed regulations on the environment  financial markets and other areas  democrats contend that slowing down rulemaking is intended to help big businesses escape oversight  the accountability act would jeopardize the government s capability  to safeguard public health and safety  the environment  workplace safety and consumer financial protections   the judiciary committee s senior democrat  john conyers  said before the vote     worse yet  many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate the ability of regulated entities   such as well funded corporate interests   to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose   conyers said  specifically  the bill would require agencies to post more detailed information on proposals for an extended period of time  limit judge s interpretations in legal challenges  and require agencies to enact the lowest cost version of a rule   the house is expected to vote on thursday on changes to the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission  the major securities and derivatives regulators   still  none of these bills may become law  as democrats hold enough seats in the senate to filibuster
