beijing  reuters    combining public bluster with behind the scenes diplomacy  china wrested a concession from the united states as the two presidents spoke for the first time this week  but beijing may not be able to derive much comfort from the win on u s  policy toward taiwan  several areas of disagreement between the superpowers  including currency  trade  the south china sea and north korea  were not mentioned in public statements on thursday s telephone conversation between presidents xi jinping and donald trump  in getting trump to change course on the  one china  policy  beijing may have overplayed its hand  trump had upset beijing before he took office by taking a call from taiwan president tsai ing wen  then casting doubt on the  one china  policy  under which washington acknowledges the chinese position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of it  trump changed tack and agreed to honor the  one china  policy during the call  prompting jubilation in china  beijing  had been working on diplomatic ways to engage trump s team and largely blaming taiwan for stirring things up   laying the foundation for that call had been the low key engagement of china s former ambassador to washington and top diplomat  the urbane and fluent english speaking yang jiechi  with trump s national security adviser michael flynn   china was pragmatic and patient  it made every effort to smooth out the relationship  and it paid off   said jia qingguo  dean of the school of international studies at peking university  who has advised the government on foreign policy  but china also made very clear taiwan was not up for negotiation  unleashing state media to threaten war and punishment for u s  firms if that bottom line was breached  china has long described self ruled taiwan  claimed by beijing as its sacred territory  as the most sensitive issue in sino u s  relations   its military had become alarmed after the trump tsai call and was considering strong measures to prevent the island from moving toward independence  sources with ties to senior military officers told reuters in december   a source familiar with china s thinking on relations with the united states  speaking to reuters last month  said china had actually not been too bothered with trump s taiwan comments before he took office as he was not president then and was only expressing his personal view   if he continues with this once he becomes president then there s no saying what we ll do   the source said  despite the u s  concession  military tensions remain  on saturday  the overseas edition of the ruling communist party s people s daily placed a picture on its front page of chinese warships about to embark on a new round of drills in the south china sea  right next to an upbeat commentary about the xi trump call  the paper s wechat account took a harsher line  saying that with trump getting back with the program on  one china   taiwan had better watch out   the heart of that madame tsai on the other side of the taiwan strait must at this moment be chilled to the core   it said  one senior western diplomat said china had been redoubling its efforts to win over the vatican  one of a handful of countries to retain official ties with taiwan  taiwan says it hopes for continued u s  support  and one ruling democratic progressive party official told reuters that the  one china  policy had not affected previous u s  arms sales to taiwan  even as u s  presidents  commitment to the island have waxed and waned  xi has put great personal political capital into seeking a solution over taiwan  an issue that has festered since  when defeated nationalist forces fled to the island after losing the civil war to the communists  china has never renounced the use of force to bring taiwan under its control  but in its relations with washington  the risk for beijing remains that its diplomatic win over  one china  will be short lived  as trump will not want to be seen as having caved in   what he s shown the chinese is he s willing to touch the  third rail  of u s  china relations   said dean cheng  china expert at the conservative heritage foundation in washington   beijing can t predict what he ll do next   and he s only been in office three weeks  what is he going to do on trade and other economic issues   u s  officials said the affirmation of the  one china  policy was an effort to get the relationship back on track and moving forward   but trump s change of tack may be seen by beijing as a climbdown  said tom rafferty  the china regional manager for the economist intelligence unit   mr trump is erratic and will not appreciate the suggestion that he has been weak
