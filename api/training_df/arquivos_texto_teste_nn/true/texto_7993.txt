 reuters    testimony by a former ally of new jersey governor chris christie that the republican knew about the  bridgegate  traffic scandal as it was going on could endanger his best chance at a political future  a role in a trump administration  christie has denied claims he had been an active participant in the plan to deliberately create massive traffic jams on a key bridge to new york to punish a democratic mayor s refusal to endorse his re election bid  but each piece of evidence that ties christie closer to the scandal makes him more of a liability for republican presidential contender donald trump  a new york real estate developer who has tapped the governor to head his transition team   every revelation increases the odds that trump will distance himself from christie  especially as election day gets closer   said julian zelizer  a professor of history and public affairs at new jersey s princeton university   christie still serves a value to trump  who wants to compete in blue states   he added   but there will be a point where the revelations overwhelm any sense of loyalty or any perception that he remains valuable to the campaign   a trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the  year old governor s political future is already limited  new jersey law prevents him from running for a third consecutive term next year  and polls show that bridgegate has seriously hurt his popularity  explaining in part why christie  who hoped to be president  quickly tied his fortunes to trump  christie on tuesday repeated that he had not known about the lane closure plan    there s all kinds of stuff going on up in a courtroom in newark  and i want to be really clear to all of you about something   christie told reporters in trenton   i had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments   that contradicted the testimony of david wildstein  a former executive at the port authority of new york and new jersey  in a federal court in newark  where two other ex christie allies face criminal charges for their role in the scandal  while bridget kelly  his former deputy chief of staff and bill baroni  a close associate and former executive at the port authority  are on trial for their role in the  incident  christie himself has not been charged criminally  the governor was at the peak of his popularity at the time  having stepped into the national spotlight when he toured  superstorm sandy ravaged new jersey shore with president barack obama  with his eye on the white house  he was eager to secure the endorsements of fort lee mayor mark sokolich and other democratic mayors to show he was a politician able to forge alliances across party lines  the lane closures  which generated massive traffic jams at the george washington bridge and national headlines  took a heavy toll on christie s image and drew the mockery of the state s favorite son  rock star bruce springsteen  a rutgers eagleton poll conducted early this month found that  percent of state residents held a favorable view of christie  down  percentage points from a year earlier and one third of what it was at christie s peak of popularity in february    bridgegate almost wholly contributed to the downfall that we ve seen for the governor   said ashley koning  director of the eagleton center for public interest polling at new jersey s rutgers university  his low popularity makes it highly unlikely he d be successful in another statewide run  whether it was for governor in  or for another office  she said  after christie s bid for the  republican presidential nomination failed  he pivoted quickly to endorse trump  who embraced his support and named him transition chair in may  christie would be charged with helping build a cabinet for a trump white house and serve as a liaison with the outgoing obama team   christie was a federal prosecutor in new jersey  suggesting the likeliest job in a trump cabinet would be attorney general   it s hard to imagine that he would be able to win senate confirmation with knowledge of this scheme confirmed   said brigid callahan harrison  professor of political science and law at new jersey s montclair state university   trump could also pick christie for a staff role  she said  bill stepien  who managed both of christie s gubernatorial runs  is an adviser to the trump campaign  harrison added   from what we know of trump  he may not be overly cautious about affiliating himself with people that could be damaging
