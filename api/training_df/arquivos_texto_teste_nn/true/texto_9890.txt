washington  reuters    the u s  government is poised to approve two long delayed sales of boeing co fighter jets to qatar and kuwait  and could announce the multibillion dollar deals during president barack obama s visit to the gulf this week  according to two sources familiar with the matter  both deals have been stalled amid concerns raised by israel that equipment sent to gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it  and by the obama administration s broader decision making on military aid to the gulf   however  the pentagon and the state department both have  signed off on the sale of some  f  fighter jets to qatar and  f a  f super hornets to kuwait  both built by boeing  the white house is expected to follow suit shortly  the sale to kuwait is worth about   billion and the one to qatar is probably close to   billion  sources familiar with the matter said   the last hurdle now is getting approval from the national security council and the white house   said one of the sources  the pentagon had no immediate comment  a senior obama administration official said it was the administration s policy not to comment on potential arm sales until it has formally notified congress of an intent to sell something  but  the official said  the united states is committed to the security and stability of the gulf region and defense sales   fit into the overall u s  regional diplomatic strategy   expected approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the white house seeks to shore up relations with gulf allies as they increase their military capabilities amid growing fears that washington is drawing closer to iran in the aftermath of the nuclear deal with that country  senior u s  officials  including navy secretary ray mabus have publicly urged approval of the weapons sales  which will help maintain production of the fourth generation boeing fighter jets  while the newer and more advanced lockheed martin corp f  fighter jet enters service in coming years  one senior u s  defense official said the pentagon is keen to see the boeing f  and f a  production lines in st  louis continue and does not want to  foreclose any options on fourth generation aircraft at this point   boeing already is spending  hundreds of millions  of dollars to buy long lead materials such as titanium to prepare for a possible kuwaiti order for f a  f super hornets and a  separate u s  navy order for  jets put on the service s  unfunded priorities  list submitted to congress  the navy is hoping that congress will provide the funding to pay for the boeing jets in fiscal   although the planes were not included in its base budget request  it already has earmarked funding for more f a  f jets in fiscal   a larger concern now is the boeing f  line  which is set to end in  after boeing completes work on a large order for saudi arabia  unless a follow on order is approved
