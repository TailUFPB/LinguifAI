washington  reuters    federal investigators have secured a warrant to examine newly discovered emails related to hillary clinton s private server  a source familiar with the matter said on sunday  as a prominent democrat accused fbi director james comey of breaking the law by trying to influence the election  the warrant will allow the federal bureau of investigation to examine the emails to see if they are relevant to its probe of the private email server used for government work by clinton  the democratic presidential nominee  while she was secretary of state from  to   comey came under heavy pressure from democrats on sunday to quickly provide details of the emails  as clinton allies worried the prolonged controversy could extend beyond the nov   election and cast a shadow over a clinton transition if she wins the white house  comey s disclosure of the email discovery in a letter to congress on friday plunged the final days of the white house race between clinton and republican donald trump into turmoil  clinton had opened a recent lead over trump in national polls  but it had been narrowing even before the email controversy resurfaced  the unexpected turn in the email controversy shook  financial markets  conviction of a clinton victory in the election and the u s  dollar slipped against major currencies in early asian trading on monday  u s  senate democratic leader harry reid sent a letter to comey on sunday suggesting he violated the hatch act  which bars the use of a federal government position to influence an election   through your partisan actions  you may have broken the law   reid  a senator from nevada  said in the letter to comey  clinton campaign chairman john podesta and campaign manager robby mook questioned comey s decision to send a letter notifying congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant  comey s letter was  long on innuendo  short on facts   podesta said on cnn s  state of the union  program  and accused the fbi chief of breaking precedent by disclosing aspects of an investigation so close to the election   we are calling on mr  comey to come forward and explain what s at issue here   podesta said  adding the significance of the emails was unclear   he might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign  so close to the voting   podesta said  comey s letter was sent over the objections of justice department officials  but those officials did not try to stop the fbi from getting the warrant  a source familiar with the decision said  because they are interested in the fbi moving quickly on the probe  sources close to the investigation have said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former democratic u s  representative anthony weiner  the estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin  weiner is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a  year old girl in north carolina  the fbi already had a warrant to search weiner s laptop in that probe  but needed a warrant to look at the material that might be related to clinton  sources familiar with the matter said fbi agents working on the weiner investigation saw material on a laptop belonging to weiner that led them to believe it might be relevant to the investigation of clinton s email practices  trump has highlighted the issue as proof for his argument that clinton is corrupt and untrustworthy   we have one ultimate check on hillary s corruption and that is the power of the vote   trump told a rally in las vegas on sunday   the only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions   comey  who announced in july that the fbi s long investigation of clinton s emails was ending without any charges  said in his letter the agency would review the newly surfaced emails to determine their relevance to the investigation of her handling of classified information  richard painter  a professor at the university of minnesota law school and the chief white house ethics lawyer from  to   said he filed a complaint over comey s actions with the office of special counsel  which investigates hatch act violations   we cannot allow f b i  or justice department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway  that is an abuse of power   he said in a column in the new york times  but daniel richman  a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at columbia law school  called the allegations that comey improperly tried to influence the election  inane    comey s critics cannot show his letter violated the hatch act unless they can prove that the fbi director was intending to influence the election rather than inform congress  which was comey s stated aim   said richman  who said he had advised comey on law enforcement policy but not this issue  an abc news washington post poll released on sunday showed clinton with a statistically insignificant  point national lead on trump  about a third of likely voters in the poll said they were less likely to back clinton given comey s disclosure  clinton  who told a florida rally on saturday that comey s letter was  deeply troubling   did not address the issue directly on sunday but referred vaguely to voters overcoming a  distraction    there s a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to the kind of future we want and who can get us there   she told a packed gay nightclub in wilton manors  florida  where hundreds of supporters who could not get in lined the streets outside   we don t want a president who would appoint supreme court justices to overturn marriage equality   she said
