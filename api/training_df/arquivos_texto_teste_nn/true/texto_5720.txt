washington  reuters    the united states is expected to impose sanctions on multiple iranian entities as early as friday following tehran s recent ballistic missile test  but in a way that will not violate the  iran nuclear deal  sources familiar with the matter said on thursday  one source  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said about eight iranian entities were to be sanctioned  or  designated  in u s  legal jargon  for terrorism related activities and about  for ballistic missile related activities under separate existing u s  executive orders  the source declined to name the entities  the sources said the new sanctions had been in the works for some time and that iran s decision to test fire a ballistic missile on sunday had helped to trigger u s  president donald trump s decision to impose them  the white house signaled a newly aggressive stance toward iran on wednesday when michael flynn  trump s national security adviser  made a statement putting iran  on notice  for test firing the missile and senior u s  officials said the administration was reviewing how to respond  the new sanctions may be the leading edge of a tougher policy but the sources stressed that the united states was imposing them in a manner so as not to conflict with the  iran nuclear deal under which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions  trump said earlier on thursday that  nothing is off the table  in dealing with iran following the missile launch  and his fellow republicans in congress said they would back him up with new sanctions  trump s comment was in response to a question about whether he would consider military options to respond to tehran  a day after flynn s comment about putting iran  on notice   the sanctions are not likely to have much  if any  practical effect on the iranian entities or on u s  companies or individuals who are  with few exceptions  barred from dealing with iran  the sanctions are to be imposed under executive order   which freezes the u s  assets of entities or individuals who commit  threaten to commit  or support terrorism  and executive order   which freezes the assets of weapons of mass destruction proliferators or their supporters  given the long history of u s  sanctions against tehran dating to the  islamic revolution  there are unlikely to be any assets under u s  jurisdiction to be blocked  however  the sanctions could have the effect of dissuading foreign companies from dealing with the iranian entities who are designated  said brookings institution analyst robert einhorn  spokespeople for the white house  the state department and the treasury department had no immediate comment
