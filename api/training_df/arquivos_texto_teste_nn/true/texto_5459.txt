moscow  reuters    russia s parliament applauded on learning that donald trump had won the u s  election  but prospects for better relations with washington have suffered setbacks since then and the resignation of trump s national security adviser is the biggest blow yet  the kremlin still believes a rapprochement is feasible  even if it might take longer than initially thought  but the clock is ticking  vladimir putin is expected to run for another presidential term next year  and an easing in western sanctions could speed russia s recovery from a recession and safeguard his national popularity  for now  russia plans to keep working with the trump administration towards a rapprochement  looking to improve the atmosphere  with relations having sunk to a post cold war nadir under trump s predecessor barack obama as a result of moscow s  annexation of crimea  they could hardly get worse  a first meeting between russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and u s  secretary of state rex tillerson  expected in germany later this week  will give the kremlin a chance to grasp what washington is now thinking and where this may lead  the resignation of national security adviser michael flynn  who was seen in moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with russia  has underscored for the kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement with washington and drove home the urgent need to find new areas of common interest   flynn  who shared dinner with putin in  and favoured washington uniting with russia against islamic state militants  quit on monday after revelations he had improperly discussed the issue of u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to washington before trump took office  a u s  official said flynn indicated to the envoy that the sanctions  would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the u s  and russia     flynn  unlike many other high ranking americans  was at least open to dialogue   said konstantin kosachev  head of the upper house of parliament s foreign affairs committee   either trump has not gained the requisite independence and  is being gradually  and not unsuccessfully  backed into a corner  or russophobia has already infected the new administration   other russian politicians suggested flynn had been forced to resign to harm relations with moscow  but the kremlin  anxious not to feed fears of russian media manipulation to influence u s  politics  said only that it was an internal u s  matter   trump came to power talking of wanting cooperative u s  russian relations  for example to take joint action against islamic state militants  so far  there s been scant improvement   trump spoke by phone to putin on jan    but reuters learnt that the call had not gone smoothly  trump used it to denounce a treaty that caps u s  and russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the united states  the kremlin is also struggling to set up a meeting  dmitry peskov  putin s spokesman  said on tuesday he could not say when or where the russian leader would meet trump and that it was  premature  to even talk about what direction u s  russian relations might take  a series of u s  senate confirmation hearings for trump s cabinet nominees did not go the kremlin s way either  with the incoming defense secretary and secretary of state both raising concerns about the dangers of russia as an unpredictable military player   russian officials are frustrated too that trump has not yet filled key senior staff positions at the state department  leaving russian diplomats feeling they have nobody to work with      to have cooperation  you need someone to promote it from the other end   maria zakharova  spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry  testily told a news briefing last week  moscow seems to have been taken aback by the strength of congressional opposition to trump overseeing a rapprochement with russia  a factor that would make it hard for him to ease sanctions even if he wanted to  in a further reverse for the kremlin  senior u s  senators have introduced legislation that would give congress the right to review any move to relax sanctions on russia  sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  told state television last week moscow was aware of how difficult the domestic u s  scene was becoming for russia      does the lack of political consensus inside the u s  create problems for our bilateral relations   kislyak asked rhetorically   that is an objective reality   there were muted expectations in moscow that trump might move fast to reverse obama s expulsion in december of  suspected russian spies over allegations of russian backed cyber attacks on u s  election campaign groups to help trump win  obama shut down two russian compounds at the same time that he said were used by russian personnel for  intelligence related purposes   back then  trump praised putin for refraining from retaliation  calling him  very smart   but trump has given no indication since that he will roll back any of the measures  one of the biggest setbacks for moscow followed a flare up in fighting in eastern ukraine where government forces are facing off against pro russian separatist forces   before the escalation in january  which both sides blame on each other  the trump administration gave the impression it was open to looking at reviewing sanctions on russia  afterwards  nikki haley  the new u s  ambassador to the united nations  blamed russia for the fighting and said ukraine related sanctions would not be lifted until moscow returned crimea to ukraine  something russia says it will never do  flynn s resignation may hurt more  though   flynn was the main lobbyist for the  big deal with putin  project   said russian opposition activist ilya yashin     there was nobody in trump s entourage who so persistently lobbied to cancel the sanctions as flynn  today is a black day for kremlin diplomacy and for putin personally
