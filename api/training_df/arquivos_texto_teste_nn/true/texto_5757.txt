bet el  west bank  reuters    for many in the israeli settlement of bet el  deep in the occupied west bank  donald trump s choice of jared kushner as his senior adviser on the middle east is a sign of politics shifting in their favor  they regard kushner  whose family s charitable foundation has donated tens of thousands of dollars to their settlement  as part of a diplomatic rebalancing after what they view as eight years of anti israel bias under the u s  administration of barack obama   he will stand up for our interests  i suppose he will lean in our favor   said avi lavi    who has lived in bet el for more than  years   he ll be fair  as opposed to obama  whose policy leaned always towards the arabs   new u s  president trump says his son in law kushner    is capable of brokering the  ultimate deal  to deliver peace between israelis and palestinians      roi margalit  manager of the bet el yeshiva  a seminary complex with around  students  said kushner  an orthodox jewish father of three  understood the position of israeli settlers better than previous envoys   at least now we have someone who knows us   the  year old added   he will now have to study the other side  the palestinians  and see if there is any common ground        trump s pick for israeli ambassador has sparked particular enthusiasm in the community  david friedman  who chairs the american friends of bet el institutions fundraising group  the white house did not immediately respond to requests for comment from kushner and friedman  kushner  a businessman who built his career on real estate and publishing  has said little about his views about one of the world s most intractable conflicts  either during the campaign or since trump took office  the big question for the palestinians is whether he can be an impartial actor given his family foundation s past financial ties to bet el   palestinian president mahmoud abbas has been careful to say he looks forward to working with the trump administration  but others are less optimistic  wasel abu youssef  a senior official at the palestine liberation organisation  the main palestinian political umbrella body  said kushner could not be a neutral envoy if he was supportive of israeli settlements  hani al masri  a political scientist and director of the palestinian center for policy research and strategic studies  said kushner would be a representative of israel rather than of the united states   if he attempts to resume negotiations  he will seek to hold them at a lower level than previous negotiations  it will be more biased to the israeli position in an era where israel is more extreme    palestinians want the west bank and gaza strip for an independent state  with its capital in east jerusalem   israel has built about  settlements in the west bank  about   settlers live there and a further   in east jerusalem  among about   million palestinians      most countries consider the settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace as they reduce and fragment the territory palestinians need for a viable state   israel disagrees  citing biblical  historical and political connections to the land and security interests  bet el  a community of   families perched on a hillside where many believe god promised jacob the land  has been financed in part by donations from american backers  among its donors have been the donald j  trump foundation  which gave    in   and the foundation of charles and seryl kushner  the parents of jared  which gave    in   u s  tax records show  the new york based american friends of bet el institutions hosts dinners to raise funds for the settlement  which overlooks the palestinian city ramallah  kushner has left it up to his father in law to comment on what role he might play   jared is such a good kid and he ll make a deal with israel that no one else can   trump told the times of london newspaper last month   he s a natural dealmaker   everyone likes him   middle east analysts say the settlement donations by kushner s family foundation are not necessarily deal breakers   after decades of failed negotiations  the real test is whether he is prepared to rethink the way the middle east peace process is conducted  said hugh lovatt  a fellow of the european council on foreign relations   if he reverts to pushing for a process for the sake of process and diplomatic prestige  then he will prove no more successful than his predecessors   lovatt told reuters    if he acquiesces to israeli territorial demands and gives a green light to more settlement activity  he could even do irreparable damage to the prospects of long term peace   a key diplomatic factor will be whether the trump administration commits itself to a two state solution   israel and an independent palestinian state living side by side  this remains firmly the goal for the palestinians and  according to prime minister benjamin netanyahu  the israelis  but some of kushner s supporters in bet el appear to be heading in a different direction   and the political voice of hardliners could prove a significant obstacle should peace talks resume   the two state solution is a scam   said shai alon  the head of the local council  who describes himself as optimistic about the  trump era     it s not going to happen
