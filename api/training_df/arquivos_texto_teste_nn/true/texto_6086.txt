wellington tokyo  reuters    australia and new zealand said on tuesday they hope to salvage the trans pacific partnership  tpp  by encouraging china and other asian countries to join the trade pact after u s  president donald trump kept a promise to abandon the accord  the tpp  which the united states had signed but not ratified  was a pillar of former u s  president barack obama s policy to pivot to asia   japanese prime minister shinzo abe has touted it as an engine of economic reform  as well as a counter weight to a rising china  which is not a tpp member  fulfilling a campaign pledge  trump signed an executive order in the oval office on monday pulling the united states out of the  tpp agreement and distancing the united states from its asian allies  australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said he had held discussions with abe  new zealand prime minister bill english and singapore prime minister lee hsien loong overnight about the possibility of proceeding without the united states   losing the united states from the tpp is a big loss  there is no question about that   turnbull told reporters in canberra on tuesday   but we are not about to walk away     certainly there is potential for china to join the tpp   in beijing  foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying did not say directly whether china would be interested in joining the tpp but that at a time of economic uncertainly the asia pacific should make its own contributions to growth with openness   we think that in the present situation  no matter what happens  all should keep going down the path of open  inclusive  continuous development  seeking cooperation and win win   hua told a daily news briefing   obama had framed the tpp without china in an effort to write asia s trade rules before beijing could  establishing u s  economic leadership in the region as part of his  pivot to asia   china has proposed a counter pact  the free trade area of the asia pacific  ftaap  and has championed the southeast asian backed regional comprehensive economic partnership  rcep   hua said efforts on ftaap should be stepped up  adding china hoped talks on rcep could be concluded at an early date  new zealand s english said the united states was ceding influence to china and the region s focus could switch to alternative trade deals   we ve got this rcep agreement with southeast asia  which up until now has been on a bit of a slow burn  but we might find the political will for that to pick up if tpp isn t going to proceed   english said  malaysia s trade minister said negotiators from the remaining tpp countries would be in  constant communication  to decide the best way forward   notwithstanding the current position of the new u s  administration on  tpp   we will continue to engage with our american colleagues to strengthen our bilateral trade and economic relations  given the u s  s importance as our third largest trading partner and a major source of investment   mustapa mohamed said in a statement  the ttp  which has been five years in the making  requires ratification by at least six countries accounting for  percent of the combined gross domestic product of the member nations  australia held open the possibility of china  the world s top exporter  joining a revised deal   the original architecture was to enable other countries to join   australian trade minister steven ciobo told the australian broadcasting corporation on tuesday   certainly i know that indonesia has expressed interest and there would be scope for china if we are able to reformulate it   japan has led the push for the partnership  which includes brunei  canada  chile  malaysia  mexico  peru and vietnam   there is no change to our view that free trade is the source of economic growth   japanese economy minister nobuteru ishihara told reporters  when asked whether japan would be open to negotiating a bilateral trade pact with the united states  ishihara said it was uncertain whether u s  trade officials would start such negotiations  japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary koichi hagiuda said separately that japan was not considering moves with other tpp members based on a lack of u s  involvement   as prime minister abe has made clear  tpp without the united states is meaningless and the balance of interests would crumble   he told a news conference  adding japan would keep explaining the benefits of the pact for america  abe had made tpp a core of his economic growth policies and along with the obama administration  viewed it as strategically vital in the face of a rising china trump took office on friday and pledged to end what he called an  american carnage  of rusted factories and crime  he vowed to bring jobs back by renegotiating what he called bad multilateral trade deals in favor of bilateral ones  new zealand trade minister todd mcclay said he had talked with a number of tpp member ministers at the world economic forum in davos last week and he expected they would meet in coming months   the agreement still has value as a fta  free trade agreement  with the other countries involved   mcclay said in an emailed statement to reuters
