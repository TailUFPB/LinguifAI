new york  reuters    michelle obama will be ceding the title of first lady to melania trump next month  but she may hold for some time the other distinction she earned during her time in the white house  america s best known advocate for healthy food      the non profit organization she helped create as first lady  partnership for a healthier america  pha   where she is honorary chair  will continue its work convincing food companies to improve nutrition content and labeling of products  the group said       michelle obama has been a tremendous leader in this space   said larry soler  president and chief executive of the group   that legacy is going to continue for a long time after this   when president elect donald trump and a republican controlled congress take over on jan    lawmakers are expected to take aim at what one of them has called  burdensome new rules  on food  school lunches and menu labeling standards are likely to be among the changes that may come under fire   trump  a self professed fan of junk food  has not been explicit on what he plans to do with food policy  although he campaigned for the nov   election on a broad promise to undo regulations on business   nutrition advocates believe that  regardless of regulatory changes  private sector partnerships forged under michelle obama s time at pha are likely to endure   the first lady helped launch pha in   in conjunction with her broader  let s move   effort to tackle childhood obesity in the united states      since then  the organization has inked voluntary deals with scores of food companies  universities  hospitals and hotel chains aimed at improving nutritional content in food offerings      companies that have made such agreements  like the world s no  retailer wal mart stores inc and convenience store chain kwik trip  say they expect to uphold the commitments they have made regardless of any policy changes in washington       our commitment to provide healthy food   specifically for young people   will not only continue but it will grow   said a spokesman for wisconsin based kwik trip  which agreed with pha this year to offer more fruit  vegetables and whole grain foods at its stores at low cost      pha said its work will continue unabated after the obamas leave the white house  and expects that consumer demand will continue to drive companies to participate  the first lady expects to continue her work on the issue  though it is unclear exactly what her role will be      i will always be here as a partner in this effort   always   she said earlier this year   michelle obama took her healthy eating agenda from the white house   where she built an organic vegetable garden   to the halls of congress  where she lobbied lawmakers in the passage in  of the healthy  hunger free kids act  republicans balked at renewing elements of the healthy  hunger free kids act in  and the house of representatives introduced legislation that critics say would dial back access to the program   republican representative todd rokita from indiana this year introduced legislation to overhaul the school lunch program  in part to make sure that  the first lady michelle obama inspired nutrition standards are revised so that school food is more edible   he has also said he plans to work toward reforms of  burdensome new rules  with the new president           also under threat may be another measure to usher in more detailed labeling requirements for menus at restaurants and grocery stores  which passed as part of the  health overhaul known as the affordable care act or obamacare  trump has said he will repeal obamacare        we have a sense of  trump s  personal eating habits  but not his view of food policy  but given his anti regulatory  anti science rhetoric  we re on high alert   said margo wootan  director of nutrition policy at center for science in the public interest in washington      a spokesman for trump s transition team did not respond to requests for comment  melania trump  who last month pinpointed cyber bullying as her cause as first lady  has not mentioned interest in the healthy eating issue      trump s early choices in building his administration have also triggered some concerns among healthy food advocates      he has nominated representative tom price of georgia to head the department of health and human services  which oversees the national institutes of health and works to develop dietary guidelines with the u s  department of agriculture  price is an opponent of obamacare and voted for a bill that would have banned state labeling of genetically modified ingredients      trump has yet to select an agriculture secretary      regardless of legislative repeals  supporters of michelle obama s efforts to get healthier food into mainstream america believe the impact of her work cannot be undone       there was very little positive industry action before she got there  health and obesity issues weren t on their agendas   said sam kass  a chef and former executive director of  let s move   who also served as president barack obama s nutrition policy advisor      now it is the top priority for every ceo
