washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s transition team has not announced a point person dedicated to cyber security policy or staffing in his administration  an omission that could make the united states more vulnerable to threats and worsen a government cyber talent shortfall  current and former national security officials said  they and multiple sources involved with the trump transition organization said they were unaware of any person in the trump orbit who is dealing specifically with cyber security  and that there has been minimal contact with federal agencies  the apparent lack of expertise or prioritization coincides with u s  intelligence agencies  including the cia  having   pivoted to digital warfare to address the growing national security and economic threats that nation states and extremist groups pose in cyberspace  in response to a request for comment  a trump spokeswoman referred to a cyber security  vision  on republican trump s campaign website  which calls for an immediate review of u s  cyber defenses and vulnerabilities and lists high profile hacks as  key issues  without further explanation  it did not mention cyber attacks on democratic party political organizations during the election campaign that the u s  government said were carried out by russia to interfere with the nov   vote  trump praised wikileaks for publishing leaked emails from his opponent hillary clinton s campaign and also questioned whether russia was responsible for the hacks  a former national security agency  nsa  official who reviewed the  vision  statement said it was short on detail  kellyanne conway  a senior advisor to trump who managed his campaign  told reporters in the lobby of trump tower wednesday that reports of a rocky transition process were false   you don t form a federal government overnight   she said  the ousting of former republican lawmaker mike rogers from trump s transition team on tuesday left a void of expertise on cyber and intelligence matters for the president elect  officials said    rogers  who chaired the house intelligence committee while in congress was talked about in washington as a potential cia director or director of national intelligence  former defense intelligence agency director michael flynn and retired lieutenant general ronald burgess are part of trump s transition team  they were focused on intelligence and security matters  according to a trump team document that has circulated among washington trade and lobbying organizations in the week since the new york businessman s stunning election victory  flynn is a contender to be the next director of national intelligence or white house national security adviser  according to people close to him and multiple media reports  a less likely possibility  according to the people  is flynn would be named head of the national security agency  but neither flynn nor burgess are experts on cyber security  nor have they indicated an interest in the subject to obama administration officials  sources close to the trump and obama teams said  the federal government has struggled for years to keep pace with the rising need for cyber talent   a july memo from the white house s office of management and budget found a critical shortage of talent across the country was worsened in government  caused in part by an inability to compete with lucrative salaries in the private sector   james norton  a former george w  bush administration official who helped set up the department of homeland security s first cyber security team  said that trump s transition team may be waiting to move forward on the issue until after cabinet level security posts are filled    cyber will be a priority   said norton  now president of washington based consulting firm play action strategies llc   there s a little bit of fog  but i think that will clear once the names of the nominees are out    but finding and retaining qualified technical people to serve in government may become even more difficult under a trump presidency because of disagreements with his policies and politics  three former national security officials said   the president elect s bombastic statements on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and at times elicited public mockery  such as when trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant islamist propaganda or urged his supporters to boycott apple when it refused to help the fbi unlock an iphone tied to one of the san bernardino  calif   shooters  susan hennessey  a former attorney in the office of the general counsel at the nsa  said she has been urging people in the intelligence community to keep working in trump s administration because their expertise will be necessary to protect the country and resist potential abuses of executive power on issues such as surveillance   in candor  i m sad to be asking former colleagues whom i respect to consider setting aside their conscience in order to serve their country   said hennessey  who now serves as managing editor of the national security blog lawfare   i can t and don t blame anyone who feels they can t stay   a current national security official who has been approached by the trump transition team said all or most political appointees in the obama administration are expected to be sent packing after trump s inauguration on jan    he predicted that as much as five to  percent of the federal workforce also might leave   richard clarke  a former senior white house advisor on counterterrorism and cyber security in both the bill clinton and george w  bush administrations  said trump s election presents an opportunity to civil servants to help shape or resist the president elect s opinion on policy matters  he said many of the same concerns about trump existed within the federal bureaucracy when former president ronald reagan was elected in    these people like reagan and trump are not well grounded in policy   clarke said   they don t have a lot of firm beliefs that stem from years of analysis and experience   clarke told reuters   you can change their mind if you do it subtly  if they trust you  and you may not even know you ve changed their mind  because they don t know what their mind is   some parts of government are more effective than others at  slow rolling  the president s impulses  clarke said  but  you can t slow roll work that needs to be done   such as improving cyber security and addressing cyber threats  he said
