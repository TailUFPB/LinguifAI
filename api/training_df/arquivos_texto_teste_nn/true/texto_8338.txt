 muncie  indiana  reuters    one night a month  retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago   but the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics    it can get pretty heated   says gerald poor  the group s  year old president  of their political discussions   i call it to order if it gets out of hand    their anger is understandable  the group is a remnant of a once powerful united auto workers union local  which at its peak in the  represented over   workers who made transmissions in muncie for borgwarner inc  the global auto parts maker  an american flag drapes the wall at one end of the room  portraits of former labor bosses line the other  salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field   for this group of mostly white  working class men  the last two decades have brought much loss  in this election   with the victory of the populist donald trump as the republican party nominee and the strong run by the populist bernie sanders for the democratic party crown   many say they feel they re finally being heard again   working class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in american politics  many here speak wistfully of how john f  kennedy stopped at borgwarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in   for these men  this year s election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted   in the primary  trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in delaware county  which encompasses muncie  just over  percent of republican voters went for trump  democrats picked sanders over hillary clinton by an even wider margin    candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it   says  year old bruce reynolds  who followed his father and grandfather into a career at borgwarner   gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling  abandoned factory  where he notes with precision that he worked for   and a half years   he says he s still skeptical of both side s promises   neither trump nor clinton was his first choice  reynolds and his wife voted for sanders in the primary  he says  among other things  they couldn t support clinton  she s the wife of former president bill clinton  who signed the north american free trade agreement  which many here blame for muncie s economic decline  they were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of trump  the other side s top candidate   yet both plan to vote for trump in november  and reynolds says they ve grown comfortable with the choice    i know  it sounds like we re confused   he says  but they re not   like many trump supporters  he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidate s message to lock onto those that he likes  for reynolds  it s the hope of bringing back jobs for his children  some of whom still struggle to find decent work   trump s gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole  such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in america s cities at the republican national convention  but for someone in muncie  that s not far off reality   an analysis by reuters found delaware county is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of america s white working class men   in   white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three quarters of all white men living in the county  by   their proportion had dropped by about  percentage points  according to the us census bureau  but while this group s share of the population held relatively steady  the earnings of white men with full time jobs had fallen dramatically   in    percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners  with incomes of    or less  based on  dollars  by    percent of them were in the bottom third   meanwhile  the percentage of white men in full time jobs making between    and    dropped from  percent to  percent  and the percentage in the ranks of earners above    slipped from  percent to  percent   in essence  white men in muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder  they have clustered at the bottom  poorer and more isolated than ever before  even as the overall u s  economy has grown and globalized   the same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from new jersey and upstate new york to alabama and kentucky   according to the data  in about   counties across the united states nearly  percent of those where data is available the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period  the trend is particularly pronounced in the rust belt states of michigan  ohio and indiana   jonathan haidt  a social psychologist at new york university s stern school of business  studies how people adopt their political beliefs   trump is the first candidate to speak to and speak for working class white men in a long time   haidt says  that separates him from the last two republican nominees  mitt romney  who lost in   didn t do that   and john mccain didn t particularly reach out to that constituency  in    as for trump s extreme positions and outright falsehoods  haidt notes   if your hero says things that are untrue  you ll cut him slack    muncie was once the epitome of america s muscular manufacturing economy  after natural gas was discovered here late in the  century  the city attracted dozens of energy intensive glass manufacturers  most notably ball corp  which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars   the auto industry followed  and muncie became a hub for transmission making  the term  muncie transmission  is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by general motors corp in the   one particularly powerful version is the  rock crusher   used in corvettes and other muscle cars   borgwarner  based in auburn hills  michigan  has even deeper roots in muncie than gm  warner gear was founded here in  and merged with other businesses to create what became borgwarner in the late   many former workers here still call it warner gear   in the   a husband and wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical american community  they called it  middletown   to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole  muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them   the center for middletown studies at ball state university has continued the work  compiling oral histories and  in recent years  focused on the devastation of deindustrialization  james connolly  a history professor who runs the center  says that more than anything else  muncie s working class white men feel a loss of power  when the big factories were humming  the unions were an unstoppable force not just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits  but a voice in almost everything else   to illustrate this power  he cites a locally famous episode from the   when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages    a group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets   says connolly  a local union leader who had nothing to do with the waitresses  other than knowing about them through community connections called the then mayor  who was visiting washington  and  ordered him home  to intervene  the mayor returned and the police backed off    the strikers weren t union members but there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control   says connolly  with the decline of the unions  working class people  feel like they ve been robbed of that voice    and yet unions  which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city  are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are  that tension is visible at the old school where the borgwarner retirees meet   the muncie delaware county senior center was created to give retirees from the big factories particularly men a place to go for companionship and activities  one recent day  the room the borgwarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing    some people don t like the photos  of the union leaders  says jim shields  a janitor  motioning toward the  portraits that adorn the front of the room  they feel the images carry an implicitly political  pro union message  so  there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station  he said   we had complaints   now  when the borgwarner retiree group isn t meeting  shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them   michael hicks  a ball state economist who studies manufacturing  says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for trump   it s always easier to blame a larger force for your problems  whether that s mexicans or greedy factory owners   he says   but these people aren t stupid  they know the jobs aren t coming back   the bigger concern for many of them  he says  is what will happen to their children   the reynolds family is a good example  bruce reynolds s oldest son  bruce jr  is a baptist pastor and is supporting trump  albeit reluctantly   i don t think any of them can fix it   bruce jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation  from growing drug addiction to broken families   reynolds s second son  robert  followed his father into borgwarner after high school  that job didn t last  after just four years  he was laid off in  during a wave of downsizing  he and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered    i make   an hour less now than i made  years ago   says robert  who enthusiastically backs trump  after a series of low paying jobs  including a stint at wal mart and as a manager of a video store  he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for   an hour  he likes the job  he says  although the company recently cut three paid holidays  including the fourth of july   robert concedes that he finds the republican candidate s approach to foreign policy worrisome   you wonder if something will upset him and he ll declare war   he says   that would be awful   he also doesn t like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign   this country was built on bring us your tired  your poor i think we should honor what our forefathers built   he says   but he also doesn t believe trump s message is racist   i think he s looking at all the illegal activity going on in the u s  and how it affects the job market   he says   he s just not very tactful  in how he expresses this  meanwhile  trump s promise to restore the economy is the draw   to be sure  muncie has retained some of its smaller factories  and other jobs have come in  including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a caterpillar inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant  but none of these are unionized  and the wages and benefits aren t as high as the old places offered   one frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don t seem to reflect what they see around them  muncie s jobless rate is   percent  less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of   percent or indiana s   percent   but the impact of deindustrialization including the exodus of over   factory jobs since  in a city of only   people is visible almost everywhere   most of the departing companies tore down their factories  leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble  borgwarner left a handful of structures including a   million square foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town   the city  especially the once thriving white working class neighborhoods on the south side  is now dotted with over   abandoned houses  some can t be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs   meanwhile  the fbi recently opened a probe of the city government  which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district  the fbi wouldn t comment on the investigation  and mayor dennis tyler said he can t talk about it  there have been no indictments in the case  and it s possible no charges will result   mayor tyler  a democrat  notes the jobless rate stood just under  percent four years ago  when he took office  so there s been improvement  but he understands working class frustration    they feel they ve intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last  years   says tyler   trump s appeal here isn t restricted to working class white men  another local supporter is todd murray  president and ceo of family owned mursix corp  which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights  his company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over  people   murray says he knows some of trump s trade proposals such as putting hefty tariffs on goods from mexico and china could hit his own business  he exports  percent of his output  mostly to mexico  and operates his own small plant in china  but he insists he s  not smart enough to know how that would all shake out   he still strongly favors the republican standard bearer  who he sees as more pro business   but the economy alone doesn t explain trump s appeal  another family with deep roots at borgwarner is the lephart clan  at one point in the  and   the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there  a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder  each holding a lunch bucket  except for the brother at the top  who holds the family dog   david lephart  whose father is one of the nine brothers  avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job hopping and retraining but he s still a trump supporter  he commutes to a uaw job as a pipefitter at a gm plant in marion  indiana  he earns about    a year  with overtime  he says  and has put both of his children through college   the  year old says one thing that influenced his transition from democrat to republican was talking to his children  whom he describes as part of the  business world   his son is now a stockbroker in indianapolis    for the first half of my life  i thought democrat was the only way to be   lephart says   there s this belief that you can t be republican and union but i don t believe that any more
