washington  reuters    a dozen democratic u s  senators on thursday denounced a trump administration plan to revamp a government program on countering violent extremism  saying narrowing its focus solely to islamic threats could jeopardize security and may be illegal  restructuring the program to omit white supremacists and other non islamist groups  would severely damage our credibility with foreign allies and partners as an honest broker in the fight against violent extremism  and prove divisive in communities across our country   senators cory booker  brian schatz and  others wrote in a letter addressed to cabinet secretaries  reuters reported last week that republican president donald trump s administration wants to rename the  countering violent extremism   or cve  program introduced by the previous democratic administration of barack obama to  countering islamic extremism  or  countering radical islamic extremism   the potential name change reflects a broader goal of trump s to exclude groups in the program s purview such as white supremacist  whose followers have also carried out bombings and shootings in the united states  five sources familiar with the matter said  cve aimed to address the causes of why some people are drawn to violence or extremism by providing grants and other resources to community groups to develop prevention efforts  including using social media  earlier this month  trump signed an executive order temporarily blocking travel to the united states by people from seven predominantly muslim countries  prompting a global outcry and charges from his critics that he was advancing a white nationalist agenda  trump has rejected characterizations of the order as a  muslim ban  and said it is necessary to protect national security  department of homeland security  dhs  officials who work on cve met on tuesday to continue discussions about the proposed changes  according to two sources who have worked closely with dhs on the program  refocusing cve efforts largely on islam would  alienate muslim organizations and individuals in the united states   the senators wrote to secretary of state rex tillerson  secretary of defense james mattis  homeland security secretary john kelly and wade warren  acting administrator for the u s  agency for international development   it will also put u s  service members  diplomats  development practitioners  and citizens traveling the world at significant risk  and will increase the likelihood of more attacks   the letter said  and could  violate constitutional protections and the rights of american citizens   at least three community organizations have already declined funding collectively totaling nearly    million awarded under the auspices of the cve task force  citing concerns about the trump administration s posture toward muslims and the possible changes to the program   white house press secretary sean spicer declined to comment on the reported changes last week  but said during a briefing that the program was initially intended to focus on  rooting out radical islamic terrorism   several former dhs officials told reuters the cve program was not conceived with that goal  although it has been criticized by even some supporters as tacitly too focused on muslims or largely ineffective
