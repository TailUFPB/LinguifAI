chicago  reuters    illinois owes a handful of financial consortia more than   million under an obscure program intended to speed up overdue payments to the cash strapped state s vendors  an analysis of state records shows  political feuding between republican governor bruce rauner and democrats who control the legislature has kept illinois without a full operating budget since july   contributing to a doubling of the unpaid bills backlog  the amount of overdue bills could reach    billion  or  percent of available operating revenue  when the current fiscal year ends june   the rauner administration has projected   come fiscal   the backlog is projected to balloon to   billion  no other u s  state defers payments to the extent illinois does to manage cash flow  credit rating analysts said  the one of its kind  bill payment program seeks to avert the nightmare scenario for a state in the worst financial shape in the country  a shutdown of essential services such as employee health insurance  a disruption of prison food supplies or mothballing of state trooper cars in need of fuel and maintenance   i don t think there is any other alternative for us   illinois central management services director michael hoffman told a legislative panel in may  but it comes at a heavy cost with unlimited late payment fees now approaching  percent in some cases for illinois  cash strapped government  whose general obligation  go  low investment grade credit ratings are the lowest among u s  states   the state s negative credit outlook means its   billion of outstanding go bonds could lurch closer to the junk level if the growing unpaid bill pile impairs its ability to provide essential services  affects debt payments and inflates its already huge   billion unfunded pension liability       no other state or business would operate by incurring obligations to its vendors and setting up a third party payment structure that dramatically inflates the costs of those services   said laurence msall  president of the chicago based civic federation  a non partisan government watchdog   under the vendor support initiative  vsi  program launched last year to replace a similar plan introduced in   state vendors can get paid without delay  percent of what they are owed by state designated financial lenders   when the state finally pays  the vendors get the final  percent  while the lenders keep the late penalty fees  in illinois  receivables more than  days past due accumulate interest at a rate of  percent per month  for the lenders  the risk is that the state will not pay up and they will need to fight for compensation in courts  but that has not happened yet  the firms include financial institutions such as citibank n a   c n  and bank of america corp  bac n   a distressed debt investor tied to a rauner campaign donor  and political insiders  including hillary clinton s  campaign manager and a former two term republican illinois governor  lindsay trittipoe  majority investor of the second largest consortium  illinois financing partners llp  told reuters his group was performing a vital function rather than exploiting the state s financial miseries   our money is flowing into the market  helping the wheels of commerce to keep working   he said  citi and bank of america declined to comment for this story and representatives from the largest state qualified buyer of receivables  chicago based vendor assistance program  and some of its investors did not respond to interview requests  fees on unpaid bills in the program have been growing by more than    million per week and could exceed   million by june   according to a reuters analysis of state data as of sept    by the end of rauner s term in january   total interest on unpaid receivables in the program could exceed   million if there is no progress in reducing the bill backlog  reuters calculations show   graphic  tmsnrt rs   that total represents more than what illinois allocated in operating funds last june to keep seven of its nine public universities open for six months   as of late september  four participating vsi lenders had bought   unpaid receivables worth    billion under the program  late payment penalties on those billings surpassed   million and continue to grow  reuters has found  illinois law places no limit on how long the late fees can accrue and since  the state has spent about   million in late payment penalties  according to state comptroller data  three of the four firms now involved also took part in a similar program launched under previous democratic governor pat quinn  its current version has sparked questions over how firms were vetted  a lack of up to date disclosures about their owners and financing  and patchy accounting of vendor payments  additionally  state business registration of one of the firms  payplant llc  expired two months before the program s launch  according to the illinois secretary of state s office  a company representative blamed  a procedural lapse  and said it had begun the process in october to reinstate its llc status   the focus should be on transparency   said illinois treasurer michael frerichs  a democrat   if we have a program like this  we don t want to turn it over to loan sharks   using the state data  reuters calculated the average rate on late payments at   percent through late september  during that same period  the dow jones industrial average only gained   percent   it seems that  it  creates a real perverse incentive for them to wait as long as they can   democratic representative elaine nekritz said about the buyers of vendor invoices   state spokeswoman meredith krantz defended the program  saying it helped vendors  be paid more quickly than the state s payment cycle would otherwise allow    one big non profit participating state vendor  chicago based safer foundation  saw no other options   do you want to get nothing or  percent now and the other  percent later   said victor dickson  the group s president and ceo   we chose   let s get  percent and keep serving our clients
