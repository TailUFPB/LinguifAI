washington new york  reuters    republicans on a u s  house of representatives panel said they were making progress on a puerto rico debt relief bill that will take the same basic approach as an earlier failed version  despite cancelling plans to unveil new legislation on wednesday  the house natural resources committee said more time was needed to refine the bill s language  house democratic leadership now expects legislation from the committee before the end of the week  competing forces have fought over the bill and raised concerns that creditor rights and long established municipal bond market hierarchy would be set aside in a broader plan to fix puerto rico s festering debt problems that have resulted in a breakdown in the island s social services   the new bill itself already protects existing lawful creditor priorities and liens  the integrity of creditor hierarchy will be preserved   said parish braden  spokesman for the natural resources committee said on wednesday  hnrc chairman rob bishop told reuters on monday the bill is still expected to include the installation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the u s  commonwealth s credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan   the introduction  of the bill  is not being delayed due to the underlying foundation of the board   braden said  adding   there aren t hang ups  there are a number of refinements to the bill being made to ensure internal consistency among the titles  of the bill     one source familiar with the delay said it was due to a need to refine language related to the minimum wage and land use issues over the island of vieques  u s  house democratic leader nancy pelosi said on wednesday her party could not support the latest legislative effort but still hopes for an agreement within a few days   we were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasn t something we could support  and so another few days of back and forth i think will produce something that we can take to the floor   pelosi told reporters   i m hoping maybe by friday  so that we can have something for next week   she added  puerto rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of   billion it cannot pay  a staggering  percent poverty rate and increased migration among its   million citizens to the u s  mainland drains economic activity  the ranking democrat on the hnrc issued a statement that said the families on the island needed relief from cuts to public services but remained hopeful a deal is close at hand   we are making progress  but we are not there yet  the situation in puerto rico is dire  but a bill that doesn t solve the problem  or doesn t pass  won t help anyone   ra√∫l grijalva  a democrat from arizona said  puerto rico defaulted on may  for a third time on some of its debt  missing a roughly   million payment owed by the government development bank  the island s main fiscal agent  the may  default and the nearly   billion july  debt payments have spurred congressional activity    senator chuck  schumer from the senate is pushing to get something done  but the problem here is that democrats are going to push for protections for unions and for pensioners and we feel like they should be at the bottom of the heap because that s the way the law states   republican representative john fleming of louisiana  a tea party favorite and member of the hnrc  told reuters on wednesday   i think there s just big divisions on how this goes  but i think the way it was previously set up  it s not going to fly   fleming said
