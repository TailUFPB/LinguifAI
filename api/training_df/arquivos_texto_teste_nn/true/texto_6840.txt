new york washington  reuters    president elect donald trump plans to nominate a third retired general for a top job in his new administration with the choice of a battle hardened marine commander to lead the agency set up after the sept     attacks to protect the u s  homeland   trump is expected to name former marine general john kelly    as head of the department of homeland security  a source familiar with the decision told reuters on wednesday  kelly told fox news on wednesday that he has  been asked and would consider it an honor   if confirmed by the senate  kelly will be in charge of the agency tasked with securing borders against illegal immigration  protecting the president  responding to natural disasters  coordinating intelligence and counterterrorism   like trump  kelly is believed to hold strong views on stopping illegal immigration  the four star general told a congressional committee last year that the lack of security on the u s  mexican border represents a national security threat       as former head of the military s southern command  kelly was responsible for u s  military activities and relationships in latin america and the caribbean  he was a proponent of keeping open the u s  military prison in guantanamo bay  cuba  kelly  whose son was killed fighting the taliban in afghanistan  retired in january after a  year military career  cbs first reported that trump would nominate kelly to the position  which would put him in charge of more than   employees  those include secret service and border patrol agents as well as the agency that clears refugees for resettlement in the united states  under democratic president barack obama  the department s border patrol and immigration enforcement agents were criticized by civil rights groups for acting as a paramilitary force that neglected the humanitarian mission of helping immigrants escaping violence  with a retired general as chief  the department risks furthering that image and facing backlash from democrats and immigrant rights groups   trump energized voters in the election campaign by promising to build a wall on the u s  mexico border in order to keep out mexican immigrants he described as rapists and murderers      in testimony last year before the senate armed services committee  kelly said people smuggling activities on the southern border were a dire threat        terrorist organizations could seek to leverage those same smuggling routes to move operatives with intent to cause grave harm to our citizens or even bring weapons of mass destruction into the united states   kelly said   such sentiments may have endeared him to trump  who warned repeatedly during his presidential campaign of dangers from illegal immigration  and pledged to make mexico pay for the wall along the border  the republican president elect  who has no military experience  also plans to nominate retired general james mattis to lead the pentagon and picked retired lieutenant general michael flynn to be his national security adviser  trump may be forced to look to generals to fill key positions because he lacks a relationship with republican establishment figures  said former white house and state department official p j  crowley    he never served in government  so until the campaign  he didn t have an established bench   said crowley   he s forming a pickup team on the fly  on an individual basis  they have a lot of international operational experience but far less domestic political experience  how well they will gel together remains to be seen   said crowley  author of  red line   a book on u s  foreign policy  trump s transition team is also said to be considering former army general david petraeus for secretary of state   kelly served in iraq several times  and in  was the first marine in more than  years to be promoted to the rank of brigadier general while in a combat zone  in   his son  marine  lieutenant robert m  kelly  was killed in helmand province in southern afghanistan  human rights groups had feared someone would be appointed to homeland security with a stronger anti immigration position  such as kansas secretary of state kris kobach  who is a proponent of reinvigorating a system to track muslims entering the united states on visas  frank sharry  executive director of america s voice education fund  an immigrant rights advocacy group  said he was hopeful kelly s experience in central america would make him sympathetic to migrants fleeing violence in the region   but sharry said he was concerned over the number of generals trump has appointed   at times trump s cabinet looks like a military junta  there s been a securitization of migration that is out of whack with reality   said sharry   but i ll take a general with knowledge of the americas over a radical like kobach   the national border patrol council  an early trump backer that represents some   border patrol agents and other employees  noted that kelly had no immigration experience but had  stellar credentials   it said in a statement that his popularity with troops boded well for morale problems at the department of homeland security  but added that  we believe no other cabinet level nominee will be under more pressure to produce     kelly questioned the pentagon s decision to allow women to serve in combat  and differed publicly with obama over the president s attempt to close the guantanamo bay prison   there are no innocent men down there   kelly said of guantanamo in a january interview with the military times newspaper  the republican controlled senate must confirm kelly for the homeland security post
