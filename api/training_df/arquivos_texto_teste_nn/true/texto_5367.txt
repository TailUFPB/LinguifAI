washington  reuters    after a tumultuous opening month in the white house  president donald trump is heading to a friendlier  familiar and potentially rejuvenating place  the campaign trail  beset by vicious fights over his cabinet  legal setbacks over his immigration orders  the resignation of his national security adviser and an investigation into possible links between his campaign and russian intelligence  trump is turning to the winning formula that vaulted him into the white house  big  adoring crowds and fiery  angry speeches  he has replaced hillary clinton  his former democratic presidential rival  with a new foil  newspapers and tv news outlets that have reported unflattering revelations of dysfunction or other problems in the white house  he has described them as  lying    corrupt    failing  and  late on friday  as  the enemy of the american people   on saturday  he holds a campaign rally in an airport hangar in melbourne  florida  just up the coast from his mar a lago resort where he will spend the weekend  the event gives trump a chance to bypass what he says is an unfair media and take his message straight to his supporters   it will remind people that he still has a lot of support out there  and he probably needs the reminder   said republican strategist john feehery   when you are inside the bubble  it s not a bad idea to reconnect with your supporters and get re energized   trump s race against clinton was marked by big  boisterous rallies  and the event in florida is likely to be the first of many as he tries to appeal directly to his most passionate supporters and reframe his image following growing questions over his temperament and ties between his campaign and russian intelligence  shortly after an unusually long and combative  minute presidential news conference on thursday  trump s campaign sent out a fundraising email featuring a  media accountability survey  asking supporters about coverage   i ve made it a point to cut through the media s noise and go straight to the american people  it worked during the campaign  and it will work again over these next four years   trump said in the email  democrats countered with their own fundraising email  seeking donations to ensure  trump is a one term president    first he had republican primary opponents  then he had hillary clinton  and now he has the evil media   said republican strategist rich galen   he s very comfortable in this kind of campaign mode   the florida rally marks an extraordinarily early start to the  white house campaign for trump  who filed re election papers with the federal election commission  fec  five hours after he was sworn in as president on jan    his predecessor  barack obama  filed the same form in april   more than two years into his first term as president  the paperwork was not a formal declaration of trump s candidacy  but allowed him to continue raising funds  including the money received from sales of his popular red  make america great again  hats  the trump campaign raised    million in december and had about    million on hand at the end of the year  the last time it was required to file a report with the fec  obama and other presidents have traditionally held campaign style events to support their legislative initiatives  but they were organized and paid for by the white house  saturday s rally will be organized and run by the campaign  the white house said  obama hit the road frequently in early  to rally voters behind his economic stimulus package  but he was also supported by an outside group called organizing for america that filled some of the role of a campaign organization by building  grassroots backing for his policies  by keeping his campaign intact  including his campaign website  trump has made the concept of a  permanent campaign  into reality  the website  which features a photo of the inauguration  stresses trump s campaign cannot stop because  we still have much work to do   trump s first presidential event outside washington was on friday in north charleston  south carolina  where he visited an airplane plant operated by boeing co to celebrate the unveiling of its latest dreamliner jet  on air force one after the charleston event  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump is headed back on to the campaign trail because the media does not always deliver his message well  and  he can do that very effectively by taking the stage and talking to the people of america   trump s early re election campaign start has created some confusion for federal workers worried about possibly violating a u s  law prohibiting them from engaging in political activity in the workplace  the u s  office of special counsel  an independent government agency that protects federal bureaucrats from unfair personnel practices  issued guidance to federal workers last week after it said it received  numerous  questions about whether they can express their views on trump given his intention to run for re election  federal workers would violate the law if they start calling for his re election or defeat while on duty  the memo said  but since the election is still three years away workers can express approval or disapproval of his policies or actions but  may not display signs in their office that read  reelect trump in   or express  views on his candidacy while in the workplace  once he formally announces his candidacy  the memo said  workers who are on duty or in the office cannot do anything  directed at the success or failure of his candidacy
