washington  reuters    retired neurosurgeon ben carson  a rival turned supporter of donald trump  overcame his stated qualms about a lack of government experience on monday to accept the president elect s nomination to lead the department of housing and urban development  democrats criticized the republican president elect s latest pick for his incoming administration  calling carson unqualified to take over   billion agency that oversees public housing  carson  a popular writer and speaker in conservative circles  has been a close adviser to trump since he dropped out of the  republican presidential primary contest and he is a vice chairman of trump s transition team  trump discussed the job with carson before the thanksgiving day holiday last month  although   despite his own presidential run   carson had previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in federal government  picking up that theme  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on monday   dr  ben carson is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as housing and urban development   trump  a real estate magnate who also has no government experience and has never held public office  expressed confidence carson could do the job  saying in a statement that he  has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities   carson    is the first african american picked for a cabinet spot by trump  who takes office on jan   and has been gradually filling out his administration since beating democrat hillary clinton in the nov   presidential election  carson said he was honored to accept the post  which requires confirmation by the u s  senate   i feel that i can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need   he said in the statement  republicans control the senate and senator lindsey graham  who has been a sometimes strong critic of trump  praised carson in a statement  saying  i m sure he will be an agent of change in a department that could stand some change   carson  a respected neurosurgeon at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore  had been considered for u s  surgeon general and head of health and human services department  his business manager  armstrong williams  said last month that carson had decided not to serve in trump s administration because  his life has not prepared him to be a cabinet secretary   but carson said after meeting with trump he believed he could make a contribution  like many of the initial field of  white house hopefuls who vied for the republican party s  presidential nomination  carson was a frequent target of trump attacks during the campaign  but he became one of his most high profile african american supporters after trump secured the nomination  carson enjoyed a brief surge early in the presidential campaign that took him to the top of the republican polls in late   but trump went after him  questioning his mental stability because of childhood incidents in which carson said he attacked his mother with a hammer and tried to stab another boy  carson s campaign sputtered after that and he dropped out of the race in march  he would take over a department whose mission has been to help middle  and low income people find housing by offering a combination of public housing  rent subsidies and mortgage assistance  the agency oversees mortgage lending and is also responsible for enforcing laws intended to prevent discrimination against those attempting to rent or buy homes  carson has been critical of hud efforts under the administration of democratic president barack obama to compel local governments to actively seek to end discrimination  instead of just responding to instances of racial discrimination  in a column he wrote in  for the washington times  carson called the program a  mandated social engineering scheme   if confirmed to the post  he could seek to end the obama program  other picks by trump so far for his administration include  marine corps general james mattis as defense secretary  u s   representative mike pompeo as cia director  senator jeff sessions as attorney general  retired general michael flynn as national security adviser  republican national committee chairman reince priebus as chief of staff and right wing media executive steve bannon as chief white house strategist  trump is still considering various candidates to fill the post of u s  secretary of state  former vice president al gore  a democrat and a longtime advocate for strong steps to tackle climate change  was scheduled to meet on monday with trump s daughter ivanka  in the past  trump has dismissed the idea of man made climate change as a hoax and he said during the campaign that he would seek to get the united states out of the paris agreement to reduce global emissions of fossil fuels  but last month he told the new york times he had an open mind on this  meanwhile  green party presidential nominee jill stein  filed suit in federal court in pennsylvania on monday in an attempt to force a statewide recount of voting there  adding to recounts in michigan and wisconsin  even if the recounts were to proceed in all three states  there is almost no chance that they would overturn trump s victory in last month s election
