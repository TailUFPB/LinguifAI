boston  reuters    many opinion polls show democrat hillary clinton leading republican donald trump in a tight race for the nov   u s  presidential election  but any one of four factors may make the outcome harder to predict  among the challenges for pollsters  the historic unpopularity of both candidates  the potential election day voter response to the polls themselves  the growing abandonment of landlines for cellphones  and the rise of online polling  some high profile stumbles worldwide   including opinion polls that missed colombia s oct   rejection of a peace deal   underscore how technological  social and cultural shifts have made polling more difficult than ever  an average of polls compiled by realclearpolitics com shows former secretary of state clinton beating trump  a businessman  by   percentage points  highlighting the difficulties  the range varies from plus  for clinton to a straight tie  trump has said the election is rigged against him and this week  in a reuters interview  he accused media organizations of tilting the polls deliberately  but he has yet to offer any widely accepted evidence to back up these claims  voter turnout in the last few presidential elections has been about  percent  but given both candidates  low overall popularity  turnout this year may fall to as low as  percent  said cliff zukin  a professor emeritus of political science at new jersey s rutgers university and a former president of the american association for public opinion research   that makes it hard to guess who might stay home   it s always been difficult to simulate a likely electorate and i think that s harder to do in    zukin said  a second pitfall is the effect of the polling itself on voters  sociologists believe polls can weaken projected winners by making their supporters more confident of the outcome and  therefore  less likely to vote   the percentage of trump supporters who expect him to win has dropped to  percent in a reuters ipsos poll conducted from oct     down from  percent from sept     clinton supporters  confidence rose at the same time  if that leads to a higher turnout of trump supporters than of clinton supporters  it might affect the election outcome  pollsters caution  however  that the effect of polls on the electorate can only go so far       if it were showing clinton up by  points  then it s certainly possible that it would be within the margin of error that trump might win   said douglas schwartz  director of the quinnipiac university poll   but if you re finding that all of these high quality polls are showing clinton consistently ahead  then i think you can trust them   he said  one of the biggest factors in polling today is the prevalence of cellphones  about half of americans have only a cellphone and no landline  according to federal communications commission data  more than double the number who were wireless only in    this makes it harder and more expensive for pollsters to gather a truly random sample of opinions because u s  law prohibits computerized auto dialing  also known as robocalls  to cellphones and there is no central directory for cellphones   polling cellphones can costs  to  percent more than polling land lines due to requirements that the numbers be dialed manually  according to pew research center estimates  this has led polling outfits to generally rely on lower sample sizes to come up with results  calls to cellphones are also more easily screened by their users  and as a result pollsters say they connect with just  percent of people they try to contact  down from  percent a few decades ago   but courtney kennedy  director of survey research at pew said   in terms of data  the quality is better   many respondents on cellphones are young and racially diverse  she said  others  such as reuters ipsos  conduct surveys online  this allows them to reach large numbers of people at lower cost  but because participants are volunteers in many cases  rather than selected at random  segments of the electorate may be left out      the lower or skewed response in both cellphone and online polls can pose a challenge with pollsters having to adjust results to match the real world  to accomplish this  they weight more heavily the opinions of types of voters under represented in their surveys  pollsters use population statistics  experience and intuition to do this  for instance  if the proportion of men who respond to a survey is lower than their proportion of the overall population  the pollster will adjust the finding to try to even that out   then you ve built in an assumption that the males that didn t respond are like the males that responded  and that s an unknowable fact   said robert groves  provost of georgetown university  a social statistician and author of seven books on polling who served as director of the u s  census bureau from  through   but such modeling can work well in some cases  a study by columbia university statisticians  published in  in the international journal of forecasting  showed that a poll of users of microsoft corp s xbox gaming system could be used to accurately predict the election s outcome  the gamers were far younger  whiter and more male than the u s  electorate and predicted a sweeping victory for republican mitt romney in   but when the results were weighted according to voters who turned out in   they predicted president barack obama s  re election  getting the weightings right this time could be a tougher job because trump has attracted many supporters who historically have voted erratically  or not at all   we can t apply  and  models to    said ashley koning  director of the eagleton center for public interest polling at rutgers university
