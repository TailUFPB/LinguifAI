washington  reuters    u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump offered a message of ethnic harmony on friday at a christian evangelical conference as he sought to calm concern about his criticism of a mexican american judge  in a departure from his usual freewheeling style  trump read a carefully scripted speech from a teleprompter as part of a new push by his campaign to tone down the outspoken new yorker s harsh rhetoric  trump s remarks included a wide ranging attack on democratic rival hillary clinton  and he said money aimed at resettling syrian refugees in the united states should instead be spent on tackling poverty in u s  cities  speaking to the annual conference of the conservative faith   freedom coalition  trump did not mention the controversy over his charge that u s  district judge gonzalo curiel cannot treat him fairly because of his mexican heritage  but trump did make a point of saying he would represent all americans if elected president on nov     freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the tone of his hue   trump said   right now  we have a very divided nation  we re going to bring our nation together   paul ryan  the top elected u s  republican  had criticized trump for what he called a  textbook definition of a racist comment  for his remarks about the judge  other republican leaders warned trump to change his tone or risk losing their support  mitt romney  the  republican presidential nominee who  led a movement to derail trump s nomination  told cnn he would not consider running for the white house  romney blasted trump for comments that he said denigrated mexicans  women and religion   presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation  and trickle down racism  trickle down bigotry and trickle down misogyny   all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of america   he said  romney said he expects trump to get the republican nomination  but said that he will not vote for either trump or clinton  he left open the possibility of casting a ballot for the libertarian party candidate  former new mexico governor gary johnson  as trump sought to rally more republicans behind him  clinton met with u s  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts to try and shore up support from the left wing of the democratic party  clinton later addressed the planned parenthood action fund  the nonpartisan arm of the women s health group  and had trump trained in her sights   this is a man who has called women pigs  dogs and disgusting animals  it s kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights   said clinton  the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party    clinton leads trump by  percentage points  nearly the same  as a week ago  according to a reuters ipsos poll released on friday        trump on friday criticized clinton s willingness to accept thousands of syrian refugees into the united states and challenged her to  replace her support for increased refugee admission  in favor of a new jobs program for inner cities      he stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from republicans and democrats   we have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what s going on with refugees where we don t know where they re coming from   trump said   we have to use the money to take care of our poorest americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that they re in   at the funeral on friday of boxing champion muhammad ali  a convert to islam  one speaker  a rabbi  inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of muslims    we will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down muslims and blaming muslims for a few people   said rabbi michael lerner  the editor of tikkun magazine  who said he attended the ceremony in louisville  kentucky  as a representative of american jews  trump said clinton s refusal to use the phrase  radical islamic terrorism    favored by republicans to describe violent islamist militants   makes her unfit to be president  the real estate mogul s struggle to unify republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical faith   freedom conference  where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name  former campaign rival carly fiorina steered clear of trump  speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold   u s  representative virginia foxx  a north carolina republican  said a republican president is needed  without mentioning trump   we don t want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities   she said  but conference organizer ralph reed was adamant in his support for trump  saying the new yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past republican presidential nominees failed to do   we understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied   reed told the crowd
