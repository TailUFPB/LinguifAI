 reuters    u s  judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing president donald trump s executive order restricting immigration from seven muslim majority countries  however  lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on sunday to follow the judges  rulings  judges in california  massachusetts  virginia and washington state  each home to international airports  issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on saturday night by u s  district judge ann donnelly in new york s brooklyn borough  donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from iraq being held at john f  kennedy international airport  while none of the rulings struck down friday s executive order by the new republican president  the growing number of them could complicate the administration s effort to enforce it  the rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order  said andrew pincus  a mayer brown partner representing two yemeni men who were denied u s  entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents   people have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status  or visas   pincus said   there are serious questions about whether those rights  which were created by statute  can be unilaterally taken away without process   trump s order halted travel by people with passports from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  and stopped the resettlement of refugees for  days  he said these actions were needed  to protect the american people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the united states   the order sparked a global backlash  including from u s  allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive  attorneys general from california  new york   other states and washington  d c   meanwhile  in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called trump s  dangerous  and  unconstitutional  order  the u s  department of homeland security on sunday said it  will comply with judicial orders   while enforcing trump s order in a manner that ensures those entering the united states  do not pose a threat to our country or the american people   striking that balance has caused confusion  according to lawyers who worked overnight and on sunday to help travelers at jfk airport  washington dulles international airport in northern virginia  and elsewhere  immigration lawyer sharifa abbasi said some border patrol agents at dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees  even after being shown an order from u s  district judge leonie brinkema requiring such access  abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agency s office  where no one was answering   there is really no method to this madness   becca heller  director of the new york based international refugee assistance project organization  told reporters on a conference call  supporters of trump s order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it    it is better  to  be safe than sorry   said jessica vaughan  director of policy studies at the conservative center for immigration studies in washington  lawsuits on behalf of more than  individual travelers have been filed nationwide  activists and lawyers estimated  some have come from large corporate firms including mayer brown  kirkland   ellis  and cleary gottlieb steen   hamilton  in boston  u s  district judge allison burroughs on sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two iranians who have taught at the university of massachusetts  and had been detained at the city s logan international airport  burroughs  ruling appeared to go further than donnelly s by barring the detention  as well as the removal  of approved refugees  visa holders and permanent u s  residents entering from the seven countries  donnelly s order forbade only removal  matthew segal  legal director of the american civil liberties union of massachusetts  in a statement called burroughs  ruling  a huge victory for justice  in the face of what he called trump s  unconstitutional ban on muslims   the u s  constitution s first amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion  trump s order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution  which the president said was aimed at helping christians in syria  burroughs  ruling also prompted some trump critics to urge holders of green cards  which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the united states  to fly into boston  to lessen the risk of detainment  white house chief of staff reince priebus said several times on nbc s  meet the press  that trump s order does not affect green card holders  moving forward  or  going forward   in a ruling on sunday  u s  district judge dolly gee in los angeles directed the return to the united states of ali khoshbakhti vayeghan  who authorities had sent back to his native iran following trump s order   the ruling from brinkema  in alexandria  virginia  barred the homeland security agency from removing an estimated  to  legal permanent residents who had been detained at dulles  in seattle  u s  district judge thomas zilly barred the government from removing two people  who were not named in court papers  he scheduled a feb   hearing on whether to lift that stay
