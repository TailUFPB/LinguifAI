los angeles washington  reuters    americans  growing alarm over rising prescription drug costs will pressure a new u s  administration and congress to take action on pharmaceutical pricing  industry executives and healthcare experts say  drugmaker stocks  battered in recent months  soared this week after republican presidential candidate donald trump s victory  democratic rival hillary clinton had vowed to take on pharmaceutical  price gouging   and some pundits predicted the democrats would gain control of the senate  giving her a stronger hand  the republican sweep of congress eliminated those fears  while boosting chances for other measures  such as corporate tax reforms that would benefit industry  however  the vote did not change a key dynamic  u s  consumers are paying more of the cost of drugs through higher health insurance deductibles and copayments  making them more sensitive to manufacturer price hikes  most recently  a sixfold increase in the price of mylan nv s epipen stoked outrage for families who rely on the lifesaving allergy shot and prompted investigations by state attorneys general and congress  if a manufacturer sharply raises the price of a drug   it will be in the headlines  i don t think it matters which party is in office   said sandra hunt  principal at pricewaterhousecooper s health industry practice  republican lawmakers have taken up drug pricing alongside democrats  republicans senator charles grassley of iowa  chair of the senate judiciary committee  and representative jason chaffetz  chair of the house committee on oversight and government reform  led inquiries into mylan s epipen pricing   a very strong majority of republican voters want the congress to address drug prices   said john rother  president and ceo of the national coalition on health care  which campaigns for lower prices  an october kaiser family foundation survey showed that  percent of respondents said making drugs for chronic conditions affordable should be a top health care priority for the federal government  among republican respondents   percent put drug prices as a top priority  a poll conducted by the harvard t h  chan school of public health found that  percent of voters   including  percent of likely clinton voters and  percent of trump supporters   believe the federal government should be able to limit pharmaceutical drug price hikes  trump and republican leaders have vowed to repeal president barack obama s healthcare reform law  known as obamacare  which has extended medical insurance to more than  million americans  despite complaints about obamacare insurance premium increases  just  percent of kaiser poll respondents said that overturning it was a high priority  chaffetz is  evaluating his next steps  on the drug pricing issue when the next congress convenes  an aide said  a representative for grassley said he would press forward with a scheduled nov   hearing into mylan s epipen pricing   the u s  has always been a country that supports innovation     and we hope it will remain the same   said pascal soriot  chief executive of astrazeneca plc  which sells drugs like cholesterol fighter crestor   but we also believe we will continue to have to deal with price ressures     clinton s proposals to curb drug prices included capping consumers  monthly out of pocket costs  in the past  trump has suggested allowing the government s medicare health program for seniors to negotiate prices and making it easier to import drugs from countries where they sell for less  a trump administration also could provide extra funding to the u s  food and drug administration to speed approval of generic drugs  which still tend to cost far less than their brand name equivalents  health policy experts said  capital alpha partners analyst kim monk  in a research note on wednesday  said she expects advisors and congress to steer trump toward  more republican oriented ideas   including pricing drugs based on their relative health benefit and requiring more disclosure of pricing details  consumer advocate rother cited the fair drug pricing act  introduced in september by senators john mccain  an arizona republican  and tammy baldwin  wisconsin democrat  as a potential vehicle for federal action  the bill would require manufacturers to explain annual price increases of more than  percent   it is a bipartisan bill consistent with traditional republican health policy based on transparency and competition   rother said  in california  voters on tuesday rejected a ballot measure that would have require drugmakers to provide state health plans with discounts similar to those given to the u s  department of veterans affairs  the va pays the lowest prices in the country     drugmakers spent more than   million on a campaign to defeat the measure       a similar measure will go before ohio voters  who backed trump in the election  next november  the coalition behind california s proposition on wednesday urged legislators to come up with  a more comprehensive solution to lower sky rocketing drug prices
