jerusalem washington  reuters    israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and new u s  president donald trump  seizing on an iranian missile test  are nearing common ground on a tougher u s  policy towards tehran ahead of their first face to face talks at the white house  but people familiar with the trump administration s thinking say that its evolving strategy is likely to be aimed not at dismantling iran s july  nuclear deal with six world powers  as presidential candidate trump sometimes advocated  but tightening its enforcement and pressuring the islamic republic into renegotiating key provisions  options under consideration  they say  would include wider scrutiny of iran s compliance by the international atomic energy agency  the u n  nuclear watchdog  including access to iranian military sites  and seeking to remove  sunset  terms that allow some curbs on iranian nuclear activity to start expiring in  years and lift other limits after  years  in a shift of position for netanyahu  all signs in israel point to him being on board with the emerging u s  plan  though it may prove impossible to get other world powers and iran to consider revising the landmark nuclear deal  two years ago  netanyahu infuriated the obama white house by addressing the u s  congress to rally hawkish opposition to a budding iran pact he condemned as a  historic mistake  that should be torn up  as trump and netanyahu prepare for their feb   meeting  focus has shifted to iran s ballistic missile test last week  the white house said the missile launch was not a direct breach of the nuclear deal but  violates the spirit of that    trump responded by slapping fresh sanctions on individuals and entities  some of them linked to iran s elite revolutionary guards  irgc   a u n  security council resolution underpinning the nuclear pact urges iran to refrain from testing missiles designed to be able to carry nuclear warheads  but imposes no obligation  however  trump tweeted   iran is playing with fire  and  they don t appreciate how  kind  president obama was to them  not me   trump s national security adviser  michael flynn  warned that washington  would no longer tolerate iran s provocations   netanyahu  appreciated  the comments  ayatollah ali khamenei  iran s supreme leader  on tuesday dismissed the u s  decision to put iran  on notice  over its missile tests and called trump the  real face  of american corruption  iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif was quoted as saying iran would not renegotiate the nuclear deal  beyond the rhetoric  the missile test gave the new republican president and the conservative israeli leader   who had an often acrimonious relationship with trump s democratic predecessor barack obama   an early chance to show they are on the same page in seeking to restrain iranian military ambitions  netanyahu wrote on facebook last week   at my upcoming meeting with president trump in washington  i intend to raise the renewal of sanctions against iran in this context and in other contexts  iranian aggression must not go unanswered   in london for talks with british prime minister theresa may on monday  netanyahu said  responsible  nations should follow  trump s imposition of new sanctions as iran remained a deadly menace to israel and  threatens the world   but he stopped short of any call to cancel the nuclear accord  israeli officials privately acknowledged that he would not advocate ripping up a deal that has been emphatically  reaffirmed by the other big power signatories   britain  france  germany  russia and china   since trump s election victory  russia said on monday it disagreed with trump s assessment of iran as  the number one terrorist state  and a russian diplomat said any move to rework the nuclear pact would inflame middle east tensions   don t try to fix what is not broken   deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said  trump s stance could weaken the hand of pragmatists in tehran who have been willing to negotiate a detente with the west after decades of volatile confrontation  a former senior iranian official said  under the accord  tehran received relief from global economic sanctions and in return committed to capping its uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb grade material  cutting the number of its centrifuge enrichment machines by two thirds  reducing its enriched uranium stockpile and submitting to a more intrusive iaea inspections regime  diplomats close to the iaea consider the deal a success so far  voicing little concern with overall iranian compliance   despite netanyahu s insistence that it will only pave the islamic republic s path towards nuclear weapons once major restrictions expire  years after its signing  with german  french and british firms busy cultivating new business with iran  washington s peers in the six power group almost surely would rebuff any u s  thrust to reopen the deal  daniel shapiro  who recently ended his tenure as u s  ambassador to israel under obama  told reuters he would be surprised if trump and netanyahu  determined so early in the time working together that they would rather scrap that agreement than try to enforce it in a tough manner and put other pressures unrelated to that deal on the iranians   some foreign policy experts say u s  efforts to tighten the screws on iran could seek to goad it into ditching the nuclear accord in hopes that tehran   and not washington   would then have to shoulder international blame for its collapse  according to israel s haaretz newspaper  an israeli intelligence assessment recently presented to netanyahu said revoking the pact would be an error  causing a chasm between washington and other signatories like russia and china  amos yadlin  former head of israeli military intelligence  said there were many areas outside the deal where pressure could be applied on iran to change what he called its negative behavior of  subversiveness  supporting terrorism   but beyond new sanctions and sharpened rhetoric  analysts say  it is unclear how far trump could go  arguments for restraint would include the risk of military escalation in the gulf  out of which  percent of the world s seaborne crude oil is shipped  and strong european support for the nuclear deal  though the new u s  strategy is in the early stages of development  the trump administration  the sources say  is considering a range of measures  including seeking  zero tolerance  for any iranian violations  trump s aides accused the obama administration of turning a blind eye to some alleged iranian infractions to avoid anything that would undermine confidence in the integrity of the deal  obama administration officials denied being  soft  on iran  other u s  strategy options  the sources say  include sanctioning iranian industries that aid missile development and designating as a terrorist group the revolutionary guards  accused by u s  officials of fuelling middle east proxy wars  that designation could also dissuade foreign investment in iran because the guards oversee a sprawling business empire there
