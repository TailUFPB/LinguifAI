washington  reuters    seven democratic senators urged the u s  justice department on wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies  saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower quality healthcare for consumers  the department is reviewing aetna inc s   billion plan to buy humana inc and anthem inc s   billion proposal to buy cigna corp  if approved  the deals  both of which were announced last july  would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three   we urge the doj  justice department  to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers   wrote senators richard blumenthal of connecticut  al franken of minnesota  elizabeth warren and edward markey of massachusetts  sherrod brown of ohio  dianne feinstein of california and mazie hirono of hawaii  the letter was dated wednesday and addressed to renata hesse  who heads the justice department s antitrust division  in the letter  the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients    the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers   they wrote  the lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues  and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets  but then did not use them   we are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today  given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past   the lawmakers wrote  capitol hill does not have a say in whether the justice department sues to stop deals  aetna spokesman t j  crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with humana in the second half of this year   we believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers  we continue to cooperate with the department of justice on its thorough review of the transaction   crawford said  representatives of anthem could not immediately be reached for comment
