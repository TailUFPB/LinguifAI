washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump on tuesday pressured fellow republicans working to repeal obamacare in congress to pass a replacement for the healthcare law at the same time or soon after they vote to dismantle it  trump told the new york times he wanted a substitute for president barack obama s  healthcare law done  very quickly or simultaneously  to the vote to get rid of it   nyti ms   the law  popularly known as obamacare  has enabled millions of previously uninsured americans to obtain health insurance  but republicans condemn it as a government overreach  with trump set to succeed obama on jan    republicans  who control both chambers of congress  face a dilemma  they have a chance to make good on their promise to gut the law  but forging an agreement on a replacement plan has eluded them   if congress does not put in place a substitute  millions of americans with the insurance may be at risk of losing coverage  the law extended insurance coverage to uninsured americans by expanding the medicaid program for the poor and creating online exchanges where people can shop for health insurance plans  it also provides subsidies to help individuals and families afford those plans  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on tuesday that some elements of an insurance substitute likely would be ready when lawmakers vote to repeal obamacare  but others would take longer   some republicans have said it could take up to two years to craft a replacement  trump said a delay of that length was unacceptable  telling the times   it won t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said trump s comments were  not inconsistent  with lawmakers  plans  the senate is set to vote this week on a timeline to draft legislation repealing obamacare  if it passes  the house would vote next  but a vote to actually repeal the law would come later  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said republicans were mired in  internecine fights  and called on trump to publish his own obamacare substitute   trump during the  election campaign put forth general principles for health reform  such as removing the mandate that all americans have insurance or pay a tax and expanding the use of tax free health savings accounts  but he did not release a full plan   if they are repealing  they have an obligation to show us a full replacement plan  not just a little piece of it   schumer said   and once they show us that plan  we ll give them our opinion of it   u s  senator lamar alexander  a republican who heads the health committee  said some obamacare replacement steps need to be in place before march   when insurance companies will be deciding whether to offer plans for   in a speech on tuesday  alexander said interim steps could include letting people use obamacare subsidies to purchase other plans or giving states flexibility to determine which benefits insurance plans must cover   house speaker ryan said republicans would like to pack whatever replacement provisions they can into repeal legislation  because the senate plans to use a budget procedure known as reconciliation  they only need majority support in the  member senate where republicans hold  seats  republican senator orrin hatch  who heads the finance panel  said senate rules for the reconciliation process could make it difficult to put replacement provisions in the repeal bill   if he can come up with something that would help push this forward  i d be all for it   hatch said of ryan
