indianapolis  reuters    donald trump s success in the race for the white house may well depend on the support of republican evangelicals suspicious of the front runner s more liberal side as he discloses his social views  a new york businessman who has never held public office  trump has had some success with evangelicals in states such as south carolina   but there are signs of slippage on the eve of tuesday s nominating contest in indiana  a conservative midwestern u s  state that has voted republican in nine of the last  presidential elections  trump    has taken stances on planned parenthood family clinics and gay and transgender rights that raise christian conservative concerns  including in such states as indiana where they make up a high proportion of voters  a new nbc wall street journal marist opinion poll shows trump with a wide lead in indiana   percent  to  percent for his nearest rival  u s  senator ted cruz of texas  and  percent for ohio governor john kasich      most previous indiana opinion polls showed a tighter race with trump leading cruz by only a few points  a trump win in the state could be crucial to his chances of securing the nomination but may also offer a gauge of whether he can rally evangelicals  cruz    emphasizes his christian faith on the campaign trail  focused on indiana  he says trump is not an authentic republican  a new cruz advertisement brands trump and democratic front runner hillary clinton as two sides of the same coin   both support the obamacare individual mandate  both support taxpayer funding for planned parenthood  both support letting transgender men go in little girls  bathrooms   it says   trump has praised planned parenthood family clinics as having helped millions of women even if he opposes funding its abortion component  he backs letting transgender people use the bathroom  they feel is appropriate   if evangelicals are unenthusiastic  they could sit out the nov   general election  potentially handing the white house to former u s  secretary of state hillary clinton  the democratic front runner  or her rival  u s  senator bernie sanders   the fear is a lot of them are going to stay home   said bob vander plaats  a leading evangelical activist in iowa   you can t win without our base   trump rankled some social conservatives by criticizing north carolina s controversial law that requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender of their birth   the restroom thing is big with a lot of people   said shan rutherford  a pastor in greenwood  indiana  rutherford said he was initially drawn to trump s message  but was put off by his stance on social issues and his insulting demeanor on the campaign trail  rutherford  who backs cruz  said if the white house race came down to trump versus clinton  he might not vote  the pew research center says  percent of registered republican voters nationwide identify themselves as  born again  or  evangelical   pew also found that only  percent of republicans view trump as a religious person  by contrast   percent viewed cruz that way  cruz has assailed trump for his stance on the north carolina bathroom law  trump has said there have been few problems with transgender people using bathrooms  he also has said the question should be left to states to decide  cruz charges allowing grown men in bathrooms with little girls is  opening the door for predators   on friday  cruz was endorsed by indiana governor mike pence  a social conservative who last year signed a bill that critics said could be used by business owners to deny services to same sex couples  trump has said he supports prohibiting companies from firing employees based on sexual orientation  although he has criticized last year s u s  supreme court decision legalizing same sex marriage  cruz has deployed his father  rafael cruz  an evangelical minister  as a surrogate in churches in indiana  a reuters ipsos tracking poll showed  percent of respondents would not vote in a white house race between trump and clinton  but when filtered to those who attend church nearly every week  the number jumped to  percent  the party cannot afford a low turnout in november   demographic trends in recent years have favored democrats  with the pool of republican voters  overwhelmingly white and older  steadily shrinking  eric houseman  a paramedic from indianapolis who attended a cruz rally in franklin  indiana  predicted trump would lose support through such missteps as inaccurately referring in january to a book of the bible as  two corinthians  rather than second corinthians or corinthians ii   people are beginning to see he s a lot of talk   houseman said  upstate  ron johnson  pastor at the living stones church in crown point  votes republican but was adamant that he would not vote for trump  trump does not share his christian values  johnson said       i am not going to be part of the demise of this country   he said  but mark burns  a south carolina pastor who has become a leading trump surrogate in the media  said trump s appeal to evangelicals does not stem from the strength of his religious views   we re not voting for the next pastor  we re voting for the next commander in chief   burns said
