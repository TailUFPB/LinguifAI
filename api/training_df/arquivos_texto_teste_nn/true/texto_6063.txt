america and discourage the car industry from investing in mexico  trump  who has threatened to impose  percent tariffs on imported vehicles  opened a white house meeting with general motors co ceo mary barra  ford motor co s mark fields and fiat chrysler automobiles nv s sergio marchionne by saying he wanted to see more auto plants in the united states  in return  the new republican president has vowed to cut regulations and taxes to make it more attractive for businesses to operate in the united states  he promised during his campaign to be a job creating president and stressed that message in his inaugural address last friday   we have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants   many other plants   he told reporters at the start of the meeting   it s happening  it s happening big league   matt blunt  who heads a u s  automaker trade association and attended the meeting  told reuters that trump asked what his administration could do  on domestic and trade policy that would help make the united states more competitive and strengthen the ability of automakers to add production here   the hour long meeting was the latest sign of trump s uncommon degree of intervention for a u s  president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly pressured automakers and other manufacturers to  buy american and hire american   it was the first time the heads of the big three automakers met jointly with a u s  president since a  session with barack obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards by   automakers have urged the trump administration to rethink those aggressive mandates  the auto executives on tuesday raised the issue of the fuel efficiency rules  trade policy and other regulatory matters  another person briefed on the meeting said  marchionne told reporters afterward that trump did not give them specifics on what regulations he would cut  the companies also discussed autonomous and electric vehicles and trump asked about advanced vehicles  the person said  with flattening u s  auto sales and excess capacity in the united states  u s  automakers have been reluctant to open new u s  auto plants in recent years  gm and ford last built new u s  assembly plants in   while fiat chrysler opened a new transmission plant in indiana in   kristin dziczek  an analyst at the michigan based center for automotive research  said automakers still had excess capacity in north america after suffering in the  and  from overcapacity and shifts in market share  building a new plant would take three or more years and cost at least   billion  industry experts said  automakers have expanded operations at existing u s  plants to meet rising demand for trucks and suvs  gm  ford  fiat chrysler and foreign automakers have announced new u s  jobs and investments in recent weeks   coinciding with tuesday s meeting  toyota motor corp said it would add  jobs and invest   million in an indiana plant  aiming to boost production of a popular suv by  percent  ford s fields said automakers wanted to work with trump to create a  renaissance in american manufacturing  and that trump s economic priorities were encouraging  including his move on monday to formally bow out of the  nation trans pacific partnership trade pact championed by obama    the mother of all trade barriers is currency manipulation  and tpp failed in meaningfully dealing with that  and we appreciate the president s courage to walk away from a bad trade deal   fields told reporters after the meeting  barra said there was a  huge opportunity  to work together with the government to  improve the environment  improve safety and improve the jobs creation   u s  automakers have collectively added more than   jobs since   the year when gm and chrysler  now a unit of italian american fiat chrysler  filed for bankruptcy as part of government bailouts during the u s  recession  they have invested more than   billion in u s  facilities during that period   despite the vocal pressure from trump  the companies are unlikely to truly change their existing business plans for now  said sam fiorani  vice president of global vehicle forecasting with autoforecast solutions   we need to have more concrete policies from the president   he said   automakers will make decisions on whether there is a solid business case  does it make more sense to build outside the u s  or to build in the u s    gm said in  it would invest   billion in mexico through   a move that would allow it to double its production capacity  and barra has said the automaker is not reconsidering the plan  while automakers are adding u s  jobs  they are also cutting u s  production of small cars  on monday  gm ended two shifts of production of small cars in ohio and michigan  cutting about   jobs  barclays auto analyst brian johnson said in a note on tuesday that  automakers will be willing to make a deal that would bring back jobs to the u s  in return for a slower ramp of  fuel efficiency  targets and related state level mandates    auto stocks rose on tuesday  u s  listed shares of fiat chrysler gained   percent to     while ford was up   percent to
