washington  reuters    republicans cheered after the u s  supreme court on thursday thwarted president barack obama s plan to offer millions of undocumented immigrants relief from deportation  but any sense of triumph might last only until the november presidential election   if recent history is a guide  the stalled cause of immigration reform could energize hispanic voters in support of likely democratic nominee hillary clinton  hurting republican donald trump s chances of reaching the white house   four years ago  obama  seeking reelection to a second term  made republican opposition to reform a central theme of his campaign  he ended up swamping his opponent  mitt romney  by almost a  to  margin among latino voters  who now make up around  percent of the u s  electorate  republican hopes for securing a larger share of that vote this election already seemed grim given trump s vow to deport the estimated  million immigrants in the country illegally and to build a wall along the southern u s  border   democrats were quick to assail the ruling and voice concern about the fate of the  million or so immigrants who were to be shielded from deportation by obama s executive action  but it was also clear that they believe the high court has handed them a potent weapon to spur latinos   the fastest growing segment of the u s  electorate   to vote in greater numbers  the latino voting bloc is expected to swell to   million in   up  million from  years ago   the prospect of clinton filling the current vacancy on the top court with a liberal leading justice who could  potentially  protect immigration reform programs  may galvanize those voters as well  republicans in congress have refused to accept obama s pick for the top court to fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative justice antonin scalia in february   the justices  ruling on thursday sent the question of the legality of obama s program back to a texas federal court for trial  leaving open the possibility that the matter could return to the high court on appeal at a later date   the court s decision  just adds fuel to the fire that s already raging   said brad bannon  a democratic strategist   each of these events raises the intensity and the latino turnout even more   in the wake of the ruling  immigration activists vowed payback in november s election and staged protests on thursday  a recent survey by latino decisions  a polling firm  showed that about half of the u s  hispanic electorate showed greater enthusiasm to vote in  as compared to   with support for obama s pro immigrant executive orders running high    we should expect similar dynamics this fall  perhaps even more so given the election is likely to determine the ideological direction of the supreme court   said david damore  an analyst for the firm  given trump s unpopularity with latino voters  the question for many democrats both in and outside the clinton campaign has been less about attracting the bloc s support and more about making sure it votes in large enough numbers to help offset trump s expected advantage among white voters   the court s decision may also help make traditionally republican states with increasing hispanic populations such as arizona more competitive this election  strategists in both parties said   reed galen  a republican strategist in california  said the ruling could boost democratic hopes in latino heavy battleground states such as nevada  colorado  and florida    the issue isn t getting  fired up   galen said   it s getting them to show up   galen believes there is little his party can do now to mitigate the damage he believes trump has done to its appeal among hispanics  a republican national committee  autopsy  report after romney s defeat said it was essential for the party to broaden its appeal to hispanic voters by embracing immigration reform    trump has pushed the envelope on immigration so far for republicans  i don t know this  is going to be any more damaging   he said   the barn s already been blown up   but rev  samuel rodriguez  the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference  a conservative advocacy group  disagreed  he said republicans in congress could still enact reform this year  which would ward off trump s deportation threat while building stronger ties with latino voters    this is the quintessential green light for republicans to put their money where their mouth is   rodriguez said   many republicans were careful on thursday to applaud the court s ruling on the grounds that it curtailed what they viewed as an abuse of executive authority by obama  without delving into the underlying immigration issues    the constitution is clear  the president is not permitted to write laws   only congress is   said paul ryan  the speaker of the u s  house of representatives   ryan supports comprehensive immigration reform  trump  however  went further  praising the ruling and saying the election now held the key to blocking further illegal immigration    the election  and the supreme court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and  hence  a country   he said in a statement  he has vowed to reverse obama s executive actions on immigration as president
