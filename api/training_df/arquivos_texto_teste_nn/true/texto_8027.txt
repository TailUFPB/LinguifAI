ottawa  reuters    canadian diplomats are fanning out across the united states to talk up the benefits of trade with state and local leaders and counter what senior officials see as a worrying mood of protectionism swirling through the u s  election campaign  amid voter anger about the supposed harm done by international trade deals  both republican presidential nominee donald trump and democratic rival hillary clinton have talked about altering the three nation north american free trade agreement  that could have calamitous results for canada  which sends  percent of all its exports to the united states  from trade forums in kentucky  california and illinois addressing state legislators and small business owners to meetings with mayors  labor unions and interest groups  a team of diplomats has gone coast to coast to explain how important canada is as a trading partner  the diplomatic offensive comes amid concerns in ottawa about both candidates  who opinion show are in a tight race ahead of the nov   election  trump has talked about renegotiating the nafta treaty with canada and mexico to secure more favorable terms for the united states  but he has also said he would revive transcanada corp s cross border keystone xl pipeline project  which democratic president barack obama s administration blocked over environment concerns  clinton has said she opposes keystone xl  current and former government officials in ottawa said a clinton presidency posed its own challenges for canada  they see the democrat as tough on trade and more hawkish than democratic president barack obama  who quickly struck up a warm relationship with canadian prime minister justin trudeau   while tough talk on trade has occurred in previous u s  election campaigns   there is an undercurrent and a mood here which is concerning me   said david macnaughton  canada s ambassador to washington  a clinton campaign representative declined to comment when asked about her approach to canada if she were elected  trump s campaign could not immediately be reached for comment  macnaughton  who took up the job in march  has already visited denver  colorado springs and boston and plans trips to massachusetts  michigan and california next month  an embassy spokeswoman said diplomats were intensifying their outreach effort and doing more events than usual  at every meeting  they hand out tip sheets showing canada is the top export destination for  u s  states  and that  million u s  jobs depend on trade with canada  trudeau will not say which candidate he favors  stressing he is happy to work with whomever u s  voters elect  but his center left liberals have more policies in common with u s  democrats  elected last october  he and obama have become close  exchanging visits to each other s countries    some of the issues that we are going to be facing will be very much the same regardless of who wins      i think we have to prepare to deal with some pretty difficult situations on the trade front   said macnaughton  adding that some americans had little idea about the size of the u s  trading relationship with canada  roland paris  who served as trudeau s foreign policy adviser until late june  said trump had tapped into some very strong anti trade sentiment   those feelings aren t going away any time soon     we may be heading into some protectionist headwinds  even with a hillary clinton presidency   he said   trump and clinton also oppose a proposed pacific trade deal that could benefit canada  one person with day to day knowledge of the u s  canada trade file also predicted strains over canadian exports of softwood lumber  as well as canada s system of protection for its dairy industry  which u s  producers strongly dislike  another potential area for concern is canada s defense spending  which is   percent of gross domestic product  far below the  percent commitment agreed on by nato members  macnaughton said that in his talks with republicans and democrats  both had raised the issue of  u s  allies stepping up to the plate  in military terms  trump stirred concerns among allies and even some republicans earlier this year by saying he would decide whether to come to the aid of baltic nato allies in the event of russian aggression only after reviewing if they  have fulfilled their obligations to us   former canadian diplomat colin robertson  who had several postings in the united states  also predicted hard discussions with clinton administration officials over defense   we will be circled because we are at   percent   said robertson  vice president of the canadian global affairs institute  that may not sit well with trudeau s government  which is pledging to run large budget deficits for at least the next five years to fund investment in infrastructure and social programs  a government source said canada had taken part in a number of high profile nato missions and was ready to push back on demands to increase spending in the military   we re quite prepared and proud to stand up on our record and explain why there might be a discrepancy between numbers     and our actual contribution   said the source  who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic
