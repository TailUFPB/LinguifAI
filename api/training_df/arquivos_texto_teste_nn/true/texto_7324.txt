algonac  mich   reuters    back in april  there were already early signs in this quiet michigan town of the rural american discontent that helped propel donald trump to election victory  even if it was underestimated by the washington establishment  pollsters and hillary clinton s campaign  on a return visit after tuesday s election  reuters found that many of algonac s   residents were jubilant that trump had captured the white house  although there were also echoes of what some people said seven months ago  that he is an uncertain  high stakes gamble  but the bare fact of his success drew only shrugs  who else did city folks really expect would win  reuters first visited this town on a bend of the st  clair river in april after results from the republican and democratic parties  primary elections suggested it might be a hotbed of the  dissatisfaction with the status quo that would become a dominant force by november   reut rs   it was a town in a county in a state that all disproportionately turned out in the primaries for the unexpected outsider candidates  the republican trump  a rich real estate developer and television star who had never held political office  and democratic socialist bernie sanders  a  u s  senator from vermont who had emerged as clinton s closest rival for the democratic party nomination  trump went on to win his party s nomination  while sanders was beaten by clinton   even though they came at the problem from very different perspectives  both men had fired up a town that was in a sour mood  striking a chord with their talk of a rigged economic system and their loud disgust at the decline of american manufacturing  algonac leans republican  and  on both visits  it took no time at all to find trump fans  and only a little longer to find sanders fans  but it took days of asking around to find someone with a warm word for clinton  on tuesday  the vote in algonac was  percent for trump   percent for clinton  residents of algonac can easily list the relatives and neighbors who have struggled with the painful decline of manufacturing or who were forced to move after auto factories with well paid union jobs an hour away in the detroit area shut down or moved abroad  older residents recall decades back when algonac was still a proud self sufficient manufacturing hub  employing scores of locals at the chris craft factory  which turned out photogenic wooden boats that remain prized by wealthy collectors   pete beauregard has turned the factory into a harbor club where the town s summer visitors stow their boats    the rural area is going to want to be heard   he said  delighting in trump s victory  up the road  jay deboyer was in a dive bar he had worked in as a younger man  drinking an afternoon glass of water and dressed in a suit he had worn to deliver st  clair county s final elections results to the courthouse in his role as county clerk   the center of the country is what put donald trump in office   he said    if the economy s okay  they shut their mouths and go to work   he said  describing the sort of people who live in places like algonac  where  percent of residents are white    but if you start to smack them  when you start telling the guys working in a coal mine in west virginia   for the good of the country  we re going to put you out of a job  for the good of cleaner air we re going to put you out of a job   then you start to create a constituency of people that fall into a category of  the enemy of my enemy is my friend    mentioning clinton  a former secretary of state  u s  senator and first lady  tended to draw scorn among algonac residents in april  even among some democrats who said they viewed her as untrustworthy  her election loss and emotional concession speech this week appeared not to soften this  with some expressing their ill feeling in crude terms   trump that bitch   reads a tall wooden sign alongside the main road into town  evoking a familiar anti clinton slogan among trump fans  seeing it being photographed  paul paulus    wandered out from the building where he was regreasing old tractors to boast he had built it entirely himself   some of his neighbors  particularly women  had told reuters on both visits that  even if they disliked clinton  they despaired at the insults and coarse language that trump and his fans had reveled in  paulus described his victory over such qualms   they had tried to get the township to take it down   he said  smiling at the memory of the fight as he looked up at his sign   but the township said it s not coming down as  bitch  is not a bad word  it s a female dog   jan evans  a devout  year old christian who runs a store making slogan t shirts for the local schools  sports teams  said she thought there were better ways to talk about people  but she sympathized with the sort of anxiety that moved people to support trump  she recently learned that her monthly health insurance premiums under obamacare  a healthcare law that trump has said he will repeal and replace  would go from   to    but she worried that trump s victory would not help  either  she did not know what his healthcare plans were as he has not given details  she said that when she voted  she filled out down ballot lines for local and state elections and left the presidential vote until the end to give her more time to think    neither one really deserved it   she said of clinton and trump  her pen hovered for quite a while  but she declined to say where on the ballot it landed   everybody  they re a little bit frightened  they re hopeful  they know we need change   she said of trump s victory   but this is the change
