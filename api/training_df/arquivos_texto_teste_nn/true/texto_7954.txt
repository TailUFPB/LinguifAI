hours of friday  he did not elaborate on his allegations beyond saying that the clinton campaign was unaware of the beauty queen s past and had been  duped  by her   at a campaign rally in coral springs  florida  clinton said the episode was evidence that  a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have the nuclear codes    who gets up at  a m  in the morning to engage in a twitter attack against a former miss universe  i mean he hurled as many insults as he could  really  why does he do things like that    his latest twitter meltdown is unhinged  even for him  it proves again

was deliberate   it s difficult  and when you have a situation like that and you know it s bad and you think that  million people are watching  what do you do  stop the show  i wonder why it was bad   he said
