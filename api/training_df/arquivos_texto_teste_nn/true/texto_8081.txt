 reuters    u s  senate lawmakers excoriated wells fargo   co s chief on tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened  million bogus customer accounts  potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are  too big to fail    chief executive officer john stumpf told the senate banking committee on tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating  but some democratic senators called for his resignation  under fire  stumpf said he has told his managers to do  whatever it takes  to make customers whole  refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings  but he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices  and at times downplayed the scope of the affair  in answer to a question  he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing wells fargo  the consumer finance protection bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit class action lawsuits  earlier this month  the lender agreed to pay   million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit  savings and other accounts without customers  knowledge  about   million will directly go to customers  many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts  the revelations are a severe hit to wells fargo s reputation  during the financial crisis  the bank trumpeted itself as conservative  in contrast to its rivals   besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives  wells fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance   the scandal also renewed debate over whether u s  banks are  too big to fail  and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse   lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay  including clawbacks of compensation  and limits on forced arbitration  wells fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a now retired executive at the center of the scandal  carrie tolstedt   democratic senators jeff merkley of oregon and elizabeth warren of massachusetts called for stumpf to resign  with warren saying stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated    you should resign  you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on  and you should be criminally investigated   warren said   the bank s board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives  stumpf told the committee           i accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices   stumpf said  adding later   i apologize to all of the american people and our customers  and i will make it right    lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings  increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan  new credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individual s credit  wells fargo has acknowledged bank employees  inappropriately opened  the customer accounts and that about   employees were fired over five years  former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer      abuses were found as early as   stumpf said  but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year  at that time  stumpf said  managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees   it never dawned on us that there could be a cycle   the ceo said   it just sort of begs the issue of where was management   said senator sherrod brown of ohio  the senior democrat on the panel  brown said employees were caught  forging signatures  and stealing identities  social security numbers  and customers  hard earned cash  so as to hang on to their low paying jobs and make money for the high paying executives at wells fargo   thomas curry  the comptroller of the currency  said the agency is considering action against individual wells fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations   the u s  attorney s offices in manhattan and in san francisco are investigating wells fargo  a person familiar with the matter said last week   while democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks  republicans also grilled stumpf  louisiana senator david vitter pressed the ceo on how  customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved   why isn t this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as wells is not only too big to fail but it s too big to manage and too big to regulate   vitter asked  stumpf said the widespread abuse was  a problem of focus and not of size   stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand  he suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren  according to the bank   wells fargo shares rose  percent to
