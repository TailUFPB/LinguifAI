washington  reuters    some prominent republicans are urging donald trump to quit as the party s presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles  the real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the white house race and wrote on twitter on sunday that republicans who are attacking him are  self righteous hypocrites       with only a month to go before the nov   election against democrat hillary clinton  it would be a massive stretch to substitute trump for his running mate mike pence or anyone else  republican strategists and u s  election experts said      it is  virtually impossible to replace somebody in august  let alone october   republican strategist karl rove said on  fox news sunday    after a video of trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced friday  republicans such as u s  senator mike lee of utah and senator mark kirk of illinois urged trump to remove himself from the race  the  video showed trump  then a reality tv star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman  the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife  melania   making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to election day would be without precedent in the history of modern u s  presidential elections  in   democratic presidential candidate george mcgovern s running mate  thomas eagleton  was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression  eagleton withdrew from the race in august of that year and was replaced by sargent shriver  in   missouri voters faced a last minute candidate change in the state s u s  senate race after the democratic challenger mel carnahan died in a plane crash  a month before the election  carnahan s name remained on the ballot  however  and the dead man won the election  his widow  jean carnahan was appointed to fill the seat    republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated   the party does have procedure  known as rule   that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit  republican leaders could try to pressure trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help  but as of sunday  trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race  but if trump were to decide to quit  the process would involve convening a  member committee of the republican convention to select a new nominee  said thomas schwartz  a presidential historian at vanderbilt university  experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with republican attorneys fighting state by state legal battles to make the last minute candidate swaps on paper ballots  long after many state deadlines have already passed  even more daunting  would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast  about   americans already have voted in person or through the mail  according to michael p  mcdonald  a florida state university political science professor who tracks early voting  the figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days  early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more  another problem for republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result  concern about such challenges could deter some republicans from voting  the republican party might argue that those ballots already cast for trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate  said matthew dallek  an expert on presidential politics at george washington university s graduate school of political management  democratic national committee chairwoman donna brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by republicans to replace trump as their candidate on the ballot  adding that it would be  very confusing  for voters with early ballots already being cast   it would be political suicide for donald trump to step down right now   she told abc news   i m sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway  if there are any efforts underway   she said when asked if democrats would oppose any effort by republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots  dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to  utter chaos    we would be operating in uncharted territory  you would be in this legal netherworld   he said
