new york  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump said on tuesday he is willing to talk to north korean leader kim jong un to try to stop pyongyang s nuclear program  proposing a major shift in u s  policy toward the isolated nation  in a wide ranging interview with reuters  trump also called for a renegotiation of the paris climate accord  said he disapproved of russian president vladimir putin s actions in eastern ukraine  and said he would seek to dismantle most of the u s  dodd frank financial regulations if he is elected president  the presumptive republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with north korea  but said he was open to talking to its leader    i would speak to him  i would have no problem speaking to him   he said   asked whether he would try to talk some sense into the north korean leader  trump replied   absolutely    north korea s mission to the united nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on trump s remarks      trump    also said he would press china  pyongyang s only major diplomatic and economic supporter  to help find a solution   i would put a lot of pressure on china because economically we have tremendous power over china   he said in the interview in his office on the  floor of trump tower in manhattan   china can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call       a chinese official said dialogue was needed to resolve issues on the korean peninsula   china supports direct talks and communication between the united states and north korea  we believe this is beneficial   foreign ministry spokesman hong lei told reporters  trump s preparedness to talk directly with kim contrasts with president barack obama s policy of relying on senior u s  officials to talk to senior north korean officials  obama has not engaged personally with kim  but he has pushed for new diplomatic overtures to iran and cuba that produced a nuclear deal with tehran and improved ties with havana  sitting at his desk with an expansive view of central park  trump spoke at length about his economic and foreign policy ideas in the half hour interview  facing him on his desk is a framed photograph of his father  the late fred trump  a wall displays framed photos of trump with various celebrities  as well as numerous magazine covers on which he has appeared  on russia  trump tempered past praise of putin  saying the nice comments the russian leader has made about him in the past would only go so far   the fact that he said good things about me doesn t mean that it s going to help him in a negotiation  it won t help him at all   he said  an adviser to hillary clinton  the leading democratic presidential candidate  criticized trump s foreign policy comments  noting they came soon after trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with british prime minister david cameron    let me get this straight  donald trump insults the leader of our closest ally  then turns around and says he d love to talk to kim jong un   clinton s senior foreign policy adviser  jake sullivan  said in a statement  trump  seems to have a bizarre fascination with foreign strongmen like putin and kim  but his approach to foreign policy makes no sense for the rest of us   he said  in the reuters interview  trump said he thought cameron s criticism of him was inappropriate but  i m sure i ll have a good relationship with him   trump said he is  not a big fan  of the paris climate accord  which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than  countries  he said he would want to renegotiate the deal because it treats the united states unfairly and gives favorable treatment to countries like china    i will be looking at that very  very seriously  and at a minimum i will be renegotiating those agreements  at a minimum  and at a maximum i may do something else   he said  a renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord  committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet  trump has been criticized for offering far fewer specific policy proposals than clinton  his likely rival for the nov   presidential election  the new york billionaire said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks that would propose dismantling nearly all of dodd frank  a package of financial reforms put in place after the   financial crisis   dodd frank is a very negative force  which has developed a very bad name   he said  trump took a dim view of clinton s stated desire to put her husband  former president bill clinton  in charge of building up the u s  economy    the wife wants to make him in charge of the economy   he said  clinton described trump s idea of dismantling dodd frank as reckless   latest reckless idea from trump  gut rules on wall street  and leave middle class families out to dry   she said on twitter  trump said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble in the tech start up industry  with some companies selling shares at high valuations without ever turning a profit   i m talking about companies that have never made any money  that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars   he said  silicon valley investors responded on twitter by poking fun at trump s campaign slogan  make america great again   by repeating the phrase   make bubbles great again   on the u s  federal reserve  trump said that while he eventually wants a republican to head it  he is  not an enemy  of current chair janet yellen  who was appointed by obama   i m not a person that thinks janet yellen is doing a bad job  i happen to be a low interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head  which can happen at some point   he said  adding that inflation  doesn t seem like it s happening any time soon       the real estate mogul said he would maintain the current level of benefits for social security recipients  a position championed by former republican presidential candidate mike huckabee  trump said he would not raise the retirement age or impose a sliding scale of benefits depending on income levels  some republican lawmakers have pushed for structural reforms to social security to extend its solvency  the depleted social security trust fund  trump said  would be replenished by the increased tax revenue that would flow into the government from the higher job growth spurred by his economic policies
