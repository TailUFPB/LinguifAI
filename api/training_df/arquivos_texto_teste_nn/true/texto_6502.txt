boston  reuters    a massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the united states to build the proposed wall along the mexican border that is one of u s  president elect donald trump s most prominent campaign promises   i can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall   bristol county sheriff thomas hodgson said at his swearing in ceremony for a fourth term in office late wednesday    aside from learning and perfecting construction skills  the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country  and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other americans upon release  can be very powerful   he said  hodgson  who like trump is a republican  said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall  described by trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration  trump  who will be sworn in on jan    insisted during his campaign that he would convince the mexican government to pay for the wall  though mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so  officials in the trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the united states has a long history of prison labor  with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences  opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated  the federal prisons system operates some  factories around the united states that produced about   million worth of clothing  electronics  furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended sept    according to its financial statements  still  an attorney for the american civil liberties union in massachusetts said hodgson s proposal could violate prisoners  rights   the proposal is perverse  it s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional   aclu staff counsel laura rotolo said in a phone interview   it certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in massachusetts or their families  it s about politics   in response to a request by the trump transition office  the department of homeland security last month identified more than  miles   km  along the u s  mexico border where new fencing could be erected  according to a document seen by reuters   the document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than   billion
