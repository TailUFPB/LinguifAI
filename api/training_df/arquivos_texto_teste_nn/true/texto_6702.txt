washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump must divest his luxury washington hotel in a building leased from the federal government because the arrangement violates conflict of interest rules  congressional democrats said on wednesday  the general services administration  which manages property owned by the federal government  including the old post office  housing the trump international hotel  has said the lease would violate federal conflict of interest rules once the republican businessman is sworn in on jan    according to a letter to the agency from lawmakers  the letter referred to a dec   briefing to congressional staffers by a gsa official whom the letter did not name   the deputy commissioner made clear that mr  trump must divest himself not only of managerial control  but of all ownership interest as well   representative elijah cummings of maryland and three other democrats said in the letter  which was made public on wednesday  the hotel is a few blocks from the white house and has become a rallying point for anti trump protesters since it opened in september  it is among businesses that could create unprecedented conflicts of interest for trump  a new york real estate developer and former reality tv star  trump s company has not responded to the gsa s concerns about the potential conflict  the democratic lawmakers said  they asked the agency for documents about the lease  profit and expense projections and legal memos about the conflict of interest  the hotel lease includes a standard gsa provision barring members of congress or other elected federal officials   such as the president   from having any part of it   trump has said he will draw up documents that will remove him from day to day business operations  he had planned a thursday news conference to disclose details  but put that announcement off until next month  trump will address the hotel issue in january  spokesman jason miller told reporters  in response to the democrats  letter  the gsa said in a statement it could not speak definitively about divestment until trump s financial arrangements were completed and he had become president  the agency added   to do so now would be premature   later on wednesday  cummings said democrats still stood   percent behind  the letter  saying gsa informed their staff of the lease issue  federal law does not prohibit the president s involvement in private business while in office  even though lawmakers and executive branch officials are subject to conflict of interest rules   but most presidents in recent decades have placed their personal assets in blind trusts so they do not know how their decisions influence their personal fortunes  trump has said he plans to avoid the conflict issue by transferring control of his businesses to his oldest three children   but the u s  office of government ethics said in a letter to democratic senator tom carper of delaware on monday that such a transfer would not qualify legally as a blind trust nor eliminate conflicts of interest
