washington  reuters    the obama administration and u s  senate republican leaders scrambled on tuesday to garner enough support to get a puerto rico debt relief bill through a critical procedural vote set for wednesday which several lawmakers predicted would be close  after months of waiting for congress to act as puerto rico s economic crisis progressively worsened  the caribbean island appeared to be on the verge of securing a relief plan from washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling   billion debt  the leaders of both political parties in the senate are on board  but the outcome appeared uncertain  the obama administration sent treasury secretary jack lew to capitol hill on tuesday to try to persuade recalcitrant democrats  while republicans heard arguments for the legislation from fellow senators at a closed door luncheon   we will win the vote tomorrow   said senator bill nelson  a florida democrat  as he left the meeting with lew  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  told reporters he was  very much on board   and was urging republicans to back the measure establishing a federal oversight board to be in charge of restructuring the u s  territory s debt   i m hopeful and optimistic that the  obama  administration will be able to get democrats on board  and we believe strongly that it s an approach that appeals to most republicans   mcconnell said  senate democratic leader harry reid said he would support the bill  the senate democratic whip  dick durbin of illinois  a recent convert to the proposal  said he was trying to get a majority of democrats to back it   house democratic leader nancy pelosi added that while there is much to the legislation she objected to  she implored her senate colleagues to adopt the bill   failure to pass this bill would be a tremendous win for the unscrupulous hedge funds that have held this bill up for six months demanding to be first in line over the needs of the people of puerto rico   she said   unless congress acts  our fellow americans in puerto rico will be plunged into deep economic turmoil in just three days  time   puerto rico s   million residents are u s  citizens  the u s  territory is reeling from a  percent poverty rate  a steady flow of outward migration to the u s  mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services  but durbin predicted  it will be close  wednesday morning  when the puerto rico debt relief bill will need a supermajority of  senators  votes to stay alive in the senate   and despite mcconnell s expression of optimism  other republicans said the leadership appeared worried behind the scenes   i think leadership is concerned because they re really whipping it   said senator dean heller  a nevada republican   when they whipped me last night  i said  no   so they re coming back and asking if i ll reconsider   the white house joined the fray  with spokesman josh earnest saying that without action by congress to help puerto rico deal with its debt  the need for a bailout of the u s  territory will become more likely  the measure is identical to the plan passed by the house of representatives earlier this month  as congress tries to send it to president barack obama to sign into law by july   that is when puerto rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make    billion in payments   if the wednesday morning procedural vote is successful  it would clear the measure for passage this week   but republican skeptics of the bill are worried it could constitute a bailout   something its supporters deny   while democrats have expressed concern about the composition of the oversight board and labor provisions that they say could lower minimum wages for young workers in puerto rico  the top democrat on the senate finance committee  oregon s ron wyden  announced tuesday he would back the legislation  but ohio democratic senator sherrod brown appeared to be wavering even after meeting with lew  wyden and other democrats in a senate office building   brown said he would be more likely to vote  yes  in wednesday s procedural vote if senate leaders promise him a vote on an unrelated issue   legislation to ensure that the federal government and coal mine operators honor payment of promised pensions and health benefits to retired miners  lew said he thought there was   broad understanding  of the urgency   i just do not believe that we can let three and a half million americans descend into chaos   he said
