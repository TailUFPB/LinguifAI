washington new york  reuters    britain s stunning vote to leave the european union  buoyed by a frenzy of nationalism and populist anger  was a crushing rejection of the political elite  republican donald trump hopes it is also a preview of november s u s  presidential election  the referendum result reverberated immediately in a u s  presidential campaign dominated by trump s rapid rise to capture the nomination  fueled by a similar brew of anti establishment and anti globalization sentiment  the vote in britain reinforced the notion that the insurgent campaign launched by the wealthy real estate developer had tapped into a global political movement that might be hard to stop   this is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs   and that s donald trump   republican strategist john feehery said  trump  who has spent much of his campaign warning of the dangers posed by immigrants who illegally enter from mexico and proposing a temporary ban on u s  entry for muslims  has matched the global mood with his rhetoric   there are swaths of the population around the world who are struggling economically in the current economy  and groping for targets of blame   said katherine cramer  a political scientist at the university of wisconsin madison   trump and the brexit vote offer up tangible targets  and it is not surprising that people grab onto them  the vote yesterday is a reminder that trump could very well win the presidential election   she said  a brexit supporter  trump was happy to note the parallels to his own campaign when he reopened his golf course in turnberry  scotland  on friday  presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton bemoaned the result  the referendum  which most british opinion polls had predicted was headed to defeat  was a wake up call for democrats who have been heartened by clinton s lead over trump in opinion polls of late   i woke up this morning a little dismayed   said democratic strategist dane strother   the question is whether trump is similarly underperforming in the polls here  if that under polled anger was present in britain  as a democrat you have to hope it isn t mirrored here   global stock markets wobbled immediately after the vote  which experts warned could trigger a global recession and weaken the u s  economy  british prime minister david cameron  who said after the vote he could step down by october  presents a cautionary lesson for clinton as she prepares to face trump  british voters ignored repeated warnings from cameron about the dire consequences of a departure from the european union  clinton can take advantage of the unsettled global mood without indulging in predictions of doom or the over the top rhetoric that sometimes has set back trump  republican strategist rich galen said   she can reflect some of the same sentiment that trump and the brexit forces tapped into but use it to her advantage   galen said   she is not going to  and doesn t want to  out trump trump  but the idea is to say   i understand these concerns    clinton adviser jake sullivan told reporters after the vote that she has  a real confidence that americans are generous  tolerant  big hearted people  who believe that the country is stronger together   they re going to watch what impact  the brexit vote  ends up having on the u k  and on the british economy and come november  they are going to make their own decision about the kind of leadership that they re looking for   he said  differences between the electorates in the united kingdom and the united states are one reason the brexit sentiment may not translate fully into success for trump   about  million votes were cast in the last british general election in   with about  percent of those cast by minority voters  polling in the uk ahead of the brexit vote suggested broad support for staying in the eu among those voters  by contrast  according to the pew research center  nonwhite voters constituted  percent of all voters in the  u s  general election   and by a huge margin they backed democratic president barack obama  pew projects that by november  nearly one in three voters will be a minority  and opinion polls show trump struggling with those blocs  just being more mature  experienced and sympathetic than trump may not be enough for clinton   the argument is you need a responsible grownup  but a large part of the world doesn t want a responsible grownup   said tom rath  a new hampshire based republican strategist   i don t think it s enough to say i know all the stuff he doesn t or he s rash  because right now people aren t filtering that through
