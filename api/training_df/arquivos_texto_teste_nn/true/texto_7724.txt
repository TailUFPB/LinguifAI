new york  reuters    prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into u s  stock markets are fading fast as republican donald trump s victory odds lengthen  a reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark s p  index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the nov   election  moreover  based on options term structures   calculated from prices of options with different expirations   it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome  even with election day barely two weeks away  michael purves  head of derivatives research at weeden   co  said   there had been a modest premium bump for november options a few weeks ago  but that seems to have faded steadily with trump s slide in polls   purves said  in a reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month  a victory by democrat hillary clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term   trump s chances of defeating clinton to capture the white house have diminished markedly over the last several weeks  according to most polls and prediction markets  the reuters ipsos states of the nation project  which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all  states  estimates that clinton has a better than  percent chance of winning the minimum of  electoral college votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today  the most likely outcome would be  votes for clinton to  for trump  on predictit  a popular online predictions and betting market  clinton s implied chances of victory have risen to around  percent from around  percent a month ago  the lack of positioning for an election related volatility shock is consistent across the options market   i just don t see a whole lot of shifting of positions  i don t see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that  it s a little bit surprising   said randy frederick  managing director  trading and derivatives at charles schwab  austin  texas   if it was a much closer race it might have been a different story  but the polls have hillary clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea   frederick said  a brookings institution study published on friday from two u s  economics professors concluded that a clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility  whereas a trump victory would send it soaring  justin wolfers  of the university of michigan  and eric zitzewitz  of dartmouth college  said recent market reactions to pre election events  including the first trump clinton debate and the release of a video of trump making vulgar comments about women  signal that equity volatility could fall by  to  percent with a clinton win   tinyurl com   while the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the s p  index  individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election related volatility  derivatives analysts at deutsche bank said in a recent note  and just because investors are not braced for election linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm  analysts said  given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for november  the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result   if you think trump will win  you want to get long spx puts or long cboe volatility index calls right now as protection   said purves  referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility  a clean sweep by the democrats of the house of representatives  the senate and the white house could also unleash volatility  purves said  indeed  there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election  for s p  index weekly contracts expiring on nov    puts outnumber calls by a   to  margin  compared with   to  for all expirations  according to thomson reuters data  prices for at the money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a   percent move  up or down  in the s p  by then  while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of   percent  nonetheless  demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap  and getting cheaper   for instance  the cost for an s p index option conveying the right to sell an s p index future at the   level  about  percent below friday s close  and expiring on nov    the day after the election  has plunged from    on monday to    on friday  a  percent decline  with trump trailing in opinion polls  the focus ahead of the nov   vote is shifting to whether republicans can keep their narrow majority in the senate or even their larger advantage in the house of representatives   gridlock is the most market friendly outcome  and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating   purves said
