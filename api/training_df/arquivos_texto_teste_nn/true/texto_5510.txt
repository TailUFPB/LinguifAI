washington  reuters    justice anthony kennedy s legal reasoning in a  immigration case suggests the u s  supreme court s frequent swing vote would be skeptical of president donald trump s travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries  the little noticed case involved an afghan born naturalized u s  citizen named fauzia din who argued she had the right for a full explanation from the u s  government as to why her afghan husband was denied entry  the justices ruled   against her   kennedy wrote in a concurring opinion that in some circumstances the u s  government s motives in denying someone entry could be subject to legal review   in their lawsuit challenging trump s jan   ban  the states of washington and minnesota cited kennedy s opinion  lower courts have temporarily blocked the ban  but the administration may ask the supreme court to revive it  trump s executive order barred entry for citizens from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days and imposed a  day halt on all refugees  except refugees from syria who are barred indefinitely  curbing entry to the united states as a national security measure was a central premise of trump s  presidential campaign  originally proposed as a temporary ban on all muslims  he has voiced frustration at the legal challenge to his order  washington and minnesota argued that trump s order violated the u s  constitution by discriminating against muslims  trump during the presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   in the  case  din  who lives in fremont  california  sued the u s  government after her husband  afghan citizen kanishka berashk  was denied a visa in   she objected to the government s visa denial under a law giving consular officials wide discretion to bar people linked to  terrorist activities   the high court s ruling overturned a  u s  circuit court of appeals decision that said din was right to insist the government give her more information about the visa denial  kennedy s opinion suggested he could be willing to dig into the trump administration s rationale for the order  said mark haddad  the los angeles based lawyer who represented din in the  case    the ostensible reason for the travel ban is security but that s not a good faith concern if the underlying reason is religious animus   haddad said   kennedy s opinion showed he is  not prepared to give complete and total deference to the executive branch in the enforcement of immigration laws   haddad added  samuel alito  one of the court s most conservative justices  signed onto kennedy s opinion  in total  six of the current eight justices suggested in that  case that the government was not immune from scrutiny over immigration related decisions if there was evidence of a questionable motive  the case brought by washington and minnesota  or one of several similar disputes around the country  could reach the high court quickly in the wake of thursday s decision by a three judge panel of the san francisco based  circuit upholding a seattle district judge s decision to block trump s order  the trump administration would need to win the support of five of the current eight justices to reinstate the order while litigation over the legality of the directive continues  it could also seek to end the litigation by issuing a new order   neil gorsuch  trump s nominee to fill a lingering vacancy  is awaiting senate confirmation hearings and is unlikely to be seated on the court for at least two months  the  case  called kerry v  din  was cited both by the challenging states and the trump administration in their court fight  washington state s lawyers argued kennedy s opinion showed that courts must look at what motivated the government s decision beyond the words that appear in the order itself  they cited the previous comments by trump and others expressing a desire to keep muslims from entering the united states  the administration noted in court papers kennedy also made it clear that the government is entitled to deference  especially on national security  anil kalhan  an immigration law professor at drexel university s kline school of law in philadelphia  said there are multiple ways of interpreting kennedy s opinion  which could muddy the waters   kennedy s opinion  doesn t necessarily mean he would reach the same conclusion  on trump s ban  kalhan said  in tuesday s  circuit oral argument  administration lawyer august flentje called the executive order  facially legitimate   meaning there is no need for courts to inquire further into motive  judge michelle friedland immediately pounced   haven t there been allegations here of bad faith   she said kennedy s opinion in the din case as well as a  supreme court ruling in a case with similar themes  envision that s something we should look at   the  case involved professors objecting to the u s  government s decision not to allow a marxist academic to speak at a stanford university conference  the appeals court cited both cases in its thursday ruling
