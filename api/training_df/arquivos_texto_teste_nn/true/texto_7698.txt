washington  reuters    the u s  policy of trying to persuade north korea to give up its nuclear weapons  is probably a lost cause  and the best that could be hoped for is a cap on the country s nuclear capability  the director of u s  national intelligence james clapper said on tuesday  however  underscoring conflicting views in the obama administration  the state department said u s  policy was unchanged and continued to be to seek the  verifiable denuclearization  of the korean peninsula  president barack obama has repeatedly stated that the united states will never accept north korean as a nuclear armed state  clapper made clear at an event at the council on foreign relations think tank in new york he did not think that the policy the administration has stuck to  in spite of repeated north korean nuclear tests  was realistic   i think the notion of getting the north koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause   clapper said at the  council on foreign relations think tank in new york   they are not going to do that   that is their ticket to survival   pyongyang has persisted with its missile and nuclear weapons programs  including a sept   nuclear explosion  despite strong international sanctions  clapper said he got a good taste of how the world looks from north korea s viewpoint when he went to pyongyang on a mission in  to secure the release of two americans   they are under siege and they are very paranoid  so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability  whatever it is  is a non starter with them   he said   the best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap  but they are not going to do that just because we ask them  there s going to have to be some significant inducements   u s  state department spokesman john kirby said he had not seen clapper s remarks but told a regular news briefing in washington that the administration did not believe denuclearization was a lost cause   no  nothing s changed     that s not our position  our policy objective is to seek to obtain a verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula  that is the policy  that is both the goal and what we want to see and there is a way to do that   chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang  asked on wednesday about clapper s remarks  said the best way to resolve the north korea nuclear issue was still via talks  china and russia have pushed for a resumption of six party talks on denuclearization in north korea  the talks  which also involve japan  south korea and the united states  have been on hold since   clapper also said it bothered him that the united states was not capitalizing on using information as a weapon against north korea   that s something they worry about a lot     that is a great vulnerability i don t think we have exploited  right now  we are kind of stuck on our narrative and they are kind of stuck on theirs   clapper was asked if he thought north korea could mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that could reach the west coast of the united states and reiterated the intelligence assessment that this had to be a  worst case assumption   he said north korea had yet to test its  intercontinental ballistic missile  so neither north korea nor the united states knew whether it worked   nevertheless  we ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the united states  certainly including alaska and hawaii   he said   they could do it  we have to make the worst case assumption here
