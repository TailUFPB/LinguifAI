washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s goal of overhauling the u s  tax code in  will depend partly on the work of an obscure congressional committee tasked with estimating how much future economic growth will result from tax cuts  known as the joint committee on taxation  or jct  the nonpartisan panel assigns  dynamic scores  to major tax bills in congress  based on economic models  to forecast a bill s ultimate impact on the federal budget  the higher a tax bill s dynamic score  the more likely it is seen as spurring growth  raising tax revenues and keeping the federal deficit in check  as trump and republicans in congress plan the biggest tax reform package in a generation  the jct has come under pressure from corporate lobbyists and other tax cut advocates who worry that too low a dynamic score could show the legislation to add billions  if not trillions of dollars to the federal deficit      the problem is that the joint committee staff has adopted a whole series of assumptions that truly minimize the effects and underestimate the impact that a properly done tax reform could have   said david burton  an economic policy fellow at the conservative heritage foundation think tank  a low dynamic score could force republicans to scale back tax cuts or make the reforms temporary  severely limiting the scope of what was one of trump s top campaign pledges  other analysts warn that pressure for a robust dynamic score raises the danger of a politically expedient number that could help reform pass congress but lead to higher deficits down the road     until last year  jct used a variety of economic models in its arcane calculations  reflecting the uncertainties in such work  but house of representatives republicans changed the rules in  to require that a bill s score reflect only a single estimate of the estimated impact on the wider economy and resulting impact on tax revenues  next year s anticipated tax reform package would be the biggest piece of legislation that jct has scored using this new  narrower approach  presenting the committee with a daunting challenge  jct chief of staff thomas barthold acknowledged the challenge of dynamic scoring in an interview with reuters   the u s  economy is so darn complex  you really can t have one model that picks up all of the complexity and nuance  so the essence of modeling is to try to slim things down  try to emphasize certain points   he said  tax reform is still months away  but the initial legislation expected in  is likely to fall somewhere between two similar but separate plans  one backed by trump and the other by house republicans including speaker paul ryan     the proposals lean heavily for fiscal legitimacy on dynamic scoring  even the most robust independent scores show both plans adding to the deficit  but dynamic scoring  like any economic modeling technique  is far from precise and  when it comes to fiscal policy  any theoretical flaws could lead to very real consequences for taxpayers and the u s  economy  the jct has included macroeconomic analyses in its tax bill scores since   providing a range of estimates on economic effects built on a variety of assumptions  when dave camp  as chairman of the house ways and means committee  produced a tax reform bill in   jct used two models and forecast revenue gains ranging from   billion to   billion  the committee also provided economic growth forecasts from as low as   percent to as high as   percent  the tax package likely to emerge next year will probably be even more complex than camp s  prompting some to worry that budgetary and economic forecasts will range even more widely  some critics  including lobbyists for major corporations that stand to gain from big tax cuts  want jct s numbers to look more like the nonpartisan tax foundation s  a research group whose work has been embraced by trump and house republicans  the tax foundation estimates that the house republican tax plan would lead to a   percent higher gross domestic product over the long term    percent higher wages and   million new full time equivalent jobs  it predicts the plan would reduce government revenue by    trillion over a decade  not counting macroeconomic effects  but by only   billion once economic growth is taken into account  by contrast  the centrist tax policy center estimates the house plan would add  percent to gdp over  years and erase    trillion of revenue  even with positive macroeconomic feedback  due to higher federal debt interest
