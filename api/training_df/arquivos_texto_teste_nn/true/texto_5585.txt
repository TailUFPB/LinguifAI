washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives  republican leader said on tuesday that legislation to replace former president barack obama s signature healthcare law would be completed this year  trying to dispel the idea that the party is retreating from its campaign promise to dismantle obamacare quickly   the question is how long does it take to implement the full replacement of obamacare   house speaker paul ryan told a news briefing   we hope to get this done as fast as possible   ryan was responding to questions about republican president donald trump s weekend interview with fox news in which he said it might take until next year to replace the affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  which republicans consider federal government overreach  trump and congressional republicans campaigned on a promise to scrap the  healthcare law  but they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law  which has enabled up to  million previously uninsured americans to obtain health coverage   maybe it ll take till sometime into next year   trump said    on tuesday at the white house  spokesman sean spicer said the administration was  optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year   spicer also said trump still favors lowering drug prices as part of healthcare reform  with the government negotiating directly with companies on prices to be paid by the medicare insurance program  spicer said trump was committed to using his  skills as a businessman  to drive pharmaceutical prices down  ryan said it was important to get u s  representative tom price confirmed as secretary of the department of health and human services soon  so he too can  get to work with replacing  the healthcare law  the senate is expected to confirm price this week  ryan said he was not bothered by recent protests against dismantling obamacare that have taken place at some republican lawmakers  meetings with constituents   peaceful protests are something we honor in this country   he said  while republicans voted last month to start scrapping obamacare  they missed a target date of jan   to begin drafting legislation  this raised some doubts about how quickly they will be able to undo the complicated law  even though they have the majority in congress  at a recent congressional retreat  republican leaders told lawmakers they hoped congress would legislate the repeal by march or april  as part of a process known as budget reconciliation  but some republicans  like representative tom mcclintock  have said they think doing it this way will actually make repealing obamacare  harder and slower  while further disrupting an already faltering healthcare market
