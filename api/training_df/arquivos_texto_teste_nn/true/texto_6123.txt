dubai  reuters    gulf arab states are quietly applauding the arrival in the white house of a hawkish leader opposed to their adversary iran  even if they suspect donald trump s short temper and abrasive tweets may at times heighten tensions in the combustible middle east  while many countries around the world listened with concern to his protectionist inaugural address  gulf arab officials appear optimistic  they see in trump a strong president who will shore up washington s role as their main strategic partner in a region central to u s  security and energy interests  in gulf arab eyes  that involves above all checking what they see as a surge of iranian support for paramilitary allies in syria  iraq  yemen and lebanon and for fellow shi ite muslims in bahrain and saudi arabia s oil producing eastern province  it also means overlooking for now rhetoric about uniting  the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism  in an address that critics said echoed george w  bush s  crusade  against terrorism  a phrase which  for muslims  evokes barbarous campaigns by medieval christians against islam  saudi arabia in particular appears relieved at the departure of barack obama  who it felt considered riyadh s alliance with washington less important than negotiating a deal in  to neutralize iran s nuclear program  the relationship is a pillar of the middle east s security balance  but it has suffered since riyadh took issue with what it saw as obama s withdrawal from the region  and a perceived inclination towards iran since the  arab uprisings  there have been tensions over syria  where obama dismissed gulf arab urgings to give more aid to rebels fighting president bashar al assad  who has survived thanks to iranian and russian backing   perception is important  trump does not look like the kind of guy who will bend towards iran or anyone else   said abdulrahman al rashed  a veteran saudi commentator   if he behaves as he says  then we will see another ronald reagan  someone all the forces in the region will take seriously  that s what we have missed in the past eight years  unfortunately   some worry that trump s twitter habit   his rapid  unbridled messages of praise or blame   mean he is unsuited to handling the volatility of the middle east  faisal al yafai  a columnist with the national newspaper of abu dhabi  said that while his use of social media could be a problem  trump was unlikely to change   at some point down the line something will happen in the world that will require a careful response  a careful policy  and trump will react emotionally  that is always going to be the worry  but that s his attitude  that s who he is  those who like trump like that aspect of his personality   he said  some arab commentators see a political resemblance between trump and reagan  who also campaigned on the slogan of making america great again  reagan was also a strong backer of the military  although in the middle east his   presidency was marked by extended crises involving iran  lebanon and libya   while few in the gulf expect trump to repudiate the iran nuclear deal despite his threats to do so  most want tehran pressured to roll back what gulf arabs see as subversion in fellow arab states by a revolutionary theocracy   i think he is going to be very  very tough on iran  he will be decisive   said a gulf arab businessman  noting he expected the deal maker trump would demand something in return  moments after his speech  the white house website said the trump administration would make defeating  radical islamic terror groups  its top foreign policy goal and would develop a  state of the art  missile defense system to protect against attacks from iran and north korea   that will be the job in particular of secretary of defense james mattis  secretary of state nominee rex tillerson  and cia chief nominee mike pompeo  all well known to saudi officials   in particular mattis  a retired marine general known for distrust of iran  is a familiar figure to gulf arab rulers  a former leader of central command  which oversees u s  military operations in the middle east and south asia  mattis said in senate confirmation hearings this month that iran was  the biggest destabilizing force in the middle east and its policies are contrary to our interests   such views play well with gulf arabs   we hope trump can correct  obama s  policy  and while we are not sure of that yet  his choices to run the administration all sound experienced   said al rashed  on syria  yemen  iran and bahrain  arenas for a tussle for influence between riyadh and tehran  obama s preference for dialogue appeared weak to some gulf arabs  trump s own vision of  peace through strength  may change that perception of a passive washington  and encourage gulf arabs to press on with a military build up that relies heavily on u s  and european defense companies  any number of issues could yet disturb ties   jerusalem  oil policy  perceived anti muslim prejudice  and a u s  law allowing lawsuits against riyadh over the sept   attacks  one of the most explosive appears to be trump s vow to move the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  which would upend decades of u s  policy  and his appointment as ambassador a lawyer who raised money for a major jewish settlement  israel and the palestinians  who are seeking a state of their own  both claim jerusalem as their capital    it would create a lot of chaos  a new intifada maybe   a gulf source with knowledge of official thinking said  adding trump would think long and hard about a move that would be  a huge burden on the peace process     another issue is trump s policy of seeking to destroy islamic state  gulf arab states agree with him on the goal  but use of polarizing language seen as demonizing muslims  and reliance solely on military force  would raise objections  such language could also inflame militancy by hindering the hearts and minds effort needed to counter the thinking behind the violence   the worst part about the speech is that he will target islam as a religion in the name of fighting what he called radical islamic terrorism  a blank label that is meaningless   tweeted daham al qahtani  a kuwaiti political analyst   if he goes back to the era of bush  and  you are either with us or with the terrorists   this polarized idea  and then also the idea that military forces can solve it  then i think we will find ourselves in a very difficult situation  with a war that is going to be unwinnable   al yafai said   corrects in  para to iraq from iran
