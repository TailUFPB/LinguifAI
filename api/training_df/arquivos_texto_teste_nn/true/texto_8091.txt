washington  reuters    when hillary clinton attended her first major white house meeting on russia in february   the new secretary of state insisted that she wanted to play a leading role in president barack obama s effort to  reset  u s  relations with moscow  but while clinton became implementer in chief for one of obama s signature first term initiatives  she was consistently more skeptical than most of his top aides about how far russian leader vladimir putin was prepared to go in turning the page  according to current and former u s  officials  that stance is indicative of how she would go about dealing with moscow if she is elected u s  president on nov    aides to both clinton and obama told reuters  with u s  relations with moscow already plumbing post cold war lows  the aides and veteran russia watchers said she would likely take a harder line than obama or republican nominee donald trump  who has praised putin as a strong leader  dealing with putin  who is flexing his geopolitical muscle from ukraine to syria to cyberspace  will be among clinton s biggest foreign policy challenges   one made more daunting by the personal bad blood between them  jake sullivan  a former top state department aide and now senior clinton campaign advisor  said clinton could consider the shipping of lethal arms to ukraine government forces and the creation of no fly or safe zones in syria  obama has rejected both ideas  while such moves could further stoke tensions and might even face resistance from some u s  allies  sullivan said in an interview with reuters that clinton could manage ties with russia effectively because putin would  respect her as u s  president  her strength  her clarity  her predictability   according to current and former clinton advisers  she could consider other policy moves such as stiffer sanctions against russia over ukraine and doing more to wean russia s neighbors off reliance on moscow s energy supplies  russia is watching warily   she is not perceived by many people as the kremlin s preferred candidate   said andrey kortunov  director general of the russian international affairs council  a think tank close to the russian foreign ministry   many here believe that she would be tougher on russia than obama   he said   clinton s first fence mending effort in march  was not so much a show of strength than of diplomatic clumsiness  she handed foreign minister sergei lavrov a red button that was supposed to have the word  reset  on it  instead  it was labeled with the russian word meaning  overcharged   clinton s distrust of putin deepened  mirrored by his growing list of grievances against her  by the time she prepared to leave the state department in early   former officials said  she wrote at least two confidential memos to obama urging a more hard nosed approach  at the time  many in the president s inner circle were not convinced the reset had run its course  they said  since clinton s departure  putin has reasserted russia on the world stage  seizing ukraine s crimea region and intervening militarily in syria s civil war  u s  officials have linked the hacking of democratic party computers to the russian government   which the kremlin denies  like most national security policies under obama  the attempt to  reset  u s  russian relations was managed from the white house by the president himself  along with aides from his  campaign  including russia specialist michael mcfaul   no one should pretend that this wasn t an obama driven policy   said philip gordon  clinton s top europe adviser at the state department   but it s also not as if she went grumpily to the table and was told by the president  you re doing it      she thought it had logic   mcfaul  who later became ambassador to russia  said in an interview that from the first white house meeting on russia in early  clinton was skeptical of the prospects for transforming u s  russian relations in a way that  some of us aspired to back then    two other officials backed up his account   the first fruits of the reset were promising  putin had   temporarily  it turned out   stepped down as   president  with the younger  reform minded dmitry medvedev in his place  obama and medvedev signed a new strategic nuclear arms control pact  cooperated to sanction iran for its nuclear program and agreed to let u s  troops and equipment transit russia to support a american military  surge  in afghanistan   but after little more than two years  the  reset  ran out of steam  by mid   it was clear that putin was returning to the presidency  clinton first met putin at his residence outside moscow in march   she persuaded him to back tougher u n  sanctions on iran  according to two people with knowledge of the session  in front of the tv cameras  however  putin railed against u s  trade and economic policies as clinton watched  clinton and putin have been exchanging broadsides for nearly a decade  putin  a former kgb agent   doesn t have a soul   clinton quipped on the eve of the  new hampshire presidential primary  riffing off of president george w  bush s comment seven years earlier that he had looked into putin s eyes and seen his soul  the russian leader retorted   at a minimum  a head of state should have a head   a u s  official who was involved in russia policymaking said clinton sometimes chose her words poorly  inflaming russian resentment over its perceived post cold war humiliation  a nationalist strain that putin has long used to his advantage    she played into that   said the official  who requested anonymity   the most serious rift of clinton s tenure occurred in late   as crowds filled the streets of russian cities protesting parliamentary elections marred by allegations of voting fraud  clinton  in a statement approved by the white house  called the election  neither free nor fair   putin  who was preparing to retake the presidency  accused her of trying to foment a new russian revolution  a steady slide in contacts between clinton and the russian leadership and in overall relations followed   secretary clinton s views on russia were always a little harder edged than president obama s   said john beyrle  obama s first ambassador to moscow  that partly reflected a  splitting up of responsibilities   he said  obama cooperated with medvedev  clinton grappled with lavrov and putin  some russia watchers say clinton s record was mixed   the reset was the right approach   said thomas graham  former russia adviser under bush s republican administration  but he faulted clinton and obama s team for not doing more to  actively reach out to putin and open lines of communication
