cleveland  reuters    bourbon flowed  a jazz band played  and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers  lobby group on monday for attendees of the republican national convention  seven blocks away in cleveland  in the arena where donald trump was to officially accept his party s nod for the white house  a fight boiled over between trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination  delegates shouted at each other  the chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium  microphones went dead  typically  the republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions  at the official one  activists from all  states come to hear testimonials about their party s presidential nominee and watch the candidate s official coronation  at the other  republicans in the professional class   strategists  lobbyists  pollsters  lawmakers   rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts  woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night  all the while conducting informal business  swapping pledges of support and plans for the future  this year  the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced  several lobbyists and activists said  and some parties were more subdued  the distilled spirits council s soiree  normally a jam packed affair  drew a more modest crowd this year  according to some republicans who have attended it at past conventions  the council s senior vice president  frank coleman  pooh poohed the idea that attendance was down   it was a very large venue   he said  saying that the party still attracted about  people over the course of the evening  republican strategist ron bonjean said there was a muted tone at some cleveland gatherings  which he attributed to the unique relationship between trump and his party s establishment  mitt romney  the  republican presidential candidate and a former massachusetts governor  and senator john mccain  the party s  nominee  hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars  by contrast  trump  a real estate developer and former reality tv star who has never held elective office  clinched the republican nomination by touting his outsider status    you have a non politician  a hollywood entertainer trying to show americans he s fit for office  and you have republicans who are used to coming to these things for years   bonjean said  the two groups  he said  weren t mixing so smoothly  inside the convention arena on thursday evening  trump fans cheered  danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the event s finale   trump s speech formally accepting the nomination  but in bars and parties nearby  there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions  some republicans flew in to cleveland for only for a day or two  to host events for lawmakers and clients  then left before trump s thursday night speech  one lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate  who spoke on condition of anonymity  had a mission in cleveland that had little to do with trump  mingling with congressional republicans and showing support for their re election efforts  the informal convention did still take place  although more subdued  one strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino  he won     a group of three made quick glances at a tv screen as trump s wife  melania  spoke on monday night  checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge  but there were constant reminders that cleveland was different  as an outsider  trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising  before the convention started  companies that habitually donate to the rnc withheld pledges or withdrew them  leading organizers to ask casino mogul sheldon adelson  a generous party benefactor  for an urgent donation  a strategist who asked for help to raise a last minute    to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up  eight of the  people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely  on tuesday  trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appear at a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town  according to a report in time magazine  later that day  new jersey governor chris christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease trump into office if he wins the nov   election against democrat hillary clinton  such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries  a man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared   i think i see about    in here
