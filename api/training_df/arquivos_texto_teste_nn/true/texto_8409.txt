columbus  ohio washington  reuters    rob portman is largely ignoring donald trump  which is hard to do in u s  politics today  but the strategy seems to be working for the republican senator in his re election bid in ohio  as congressional republicans across the country grapple with the trump effect on their home state campaigns  the mild mannered portman    may be pointing the way forward in his race  the nation s most expensive senate contest so far this year  last week in columbus  the state capital  portman made no mention of trump in a campaign appearance  though the new york businessman is the republican presidential nominee and portman has endorsed him  on portman s web site  trump is absent  portman has hit the campaign trail in ohio with a republican who had white house ambitions  but it s the state s governor john kasich  not trump  kasich lost his bid for the party s nomination to trump  since then  kasich pointedly has not endorsed trump  a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office and whose smash mouth politics worries many republicans who fear he may lose them votes in senate and house of representatives races  those concerns have been compounded by trump falling behind his democratic rival hillary clinton in opinion polls  portman campaign manager corey bliss said his boss has never wavered in his support of trump and there has been no conscious effort to de couple portman from the presidential nominee   but a story on the cleveland com web site last week reported that portman  a veteran washington insider  has yet to appear at a single trump campaign event  or even in the same photo  with  him  while effectively disconnecting himself from his party s nominee  portman has led democratic rival ted strickland by five to nine points in various polls since late july  strickland is a  year old ex governor of the midwestern swing state  a monmouth university poll on monday gave portman a lead of  percent to  percent over strickland  while clinton had  percent of likely ohio voters and trump had  percent  portman does not view either presidential nominee as crucial to the ohio election  bliss said   we are focused on our race and running for u s  senate   he said   with the nov   elections nearing rapidly  the ohio race is the costliest u s  senate show down in   candidates  parties and outside groups have spent   million  said the center for responsive politics  a campaign finance watchdog group  portman worked briefly for former president george h w  bush  then was elected to the house  he resigned to be u s  trade representative in    then director of the u s  office of management and budget for president george w  bush   strickland  a former ohio governor  previously represented southeastern ohio in congress for  years  that region of the state could play a role in the portman strickland fight  but trump himself is a major factor  paul beck  a political science professor emeritus at ohio state university  said despite distancing himself from trump  portman could still be hurt if republicans are so turned off by the presidential nominee that they decide not to vote at all   these are real worries  and it s a challenge to republican candidates all over the country  but particularly to rob portman   beck said
