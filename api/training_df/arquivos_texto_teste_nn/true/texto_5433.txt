new york washington  reuters    the trump administration on wednesday proposed changes to the obamacare individual insurance market that insurers welcomed as a good start but that raised the possibility of higher out of pocket cost for consumers  president donald trump and congressional republicans have promised to scrap the  healthcare law that is a key legacy of democrat barack obama s presidency  but they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law  which extended health insurance to  million americans  the proposed new rule  issued by a division of the u s  department of health and human services  sets out changes that are meant to shore up the system developed by obama  and comes after humana inc  hum n  on tuesday said it would pull out of this market in   it is unclear which elements of obamacare could survive in the republicans  replacement  the rule does not address changes that must be made by law  such as for obamacare s income based subsidies  the changes would tighten enrollment processes and allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments  making it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans  insurers say  gaming the system  has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers  the affordable care act aimed to chip away at soaring healthcare spending  but data shows costs are still rising  the u s  government reported separately on wednesday that total u s  medical spending in  is estimated to rise   percent to    trillion after a   percent spending uptick in   the administration on wednesday also backed off implementing tougher oversight of the individual mandate  the requirement for all americans to have health insurance or pay a fine  that was due to go into effect for  taxes  the u s  internal revenue service said as a result of trump s executive order to reduce regulatory burden  it will not reject tax filings for the year  that fail to indicate whether they had health coverage or paid the penalty set under obamacare  this is a return to the policy for  taxes  the irs said  the mandate was supposed to bring in healthy customers but republicans have vowed to overturn it and insurers say it has not worked   aetna  aet n  ceo mark bertolini on wednesday said during a wall street journal forum that the obamacare exchanges had entered a  death spiral  in which rising premiums pushed out the healthiest customers  which in turn raises rates  aetna cut back offering new plans for  and it and anthem inc   antm n  have said that without changes  they might not take part after this year   bertolini said in a statement that new health secretary tom price and the trump administration have  taken some good initial steps with the proposed regulation   the top two industry groups  america s health insurance plans and blue cross blue shield association  echoed that view  shares of insurers were mixed in the early afternoon on wednesday with aetna gaining  percent to     cigna off less than  percent at    and humana off   percent to     anthem fell less than  percent to     the centers for medicare   medicaid services  which are part of the department of health and human services  on wednesday proposed the new rule that includes verifying the status of enrollees outside of the usual enrollment period  it also proposes insurers can collect unpaid premiums from members when they sign up with the same issuer again  an incentive for people to always have insurance   in addition  it proposed lowering the amount of guaranteed coverage for some  silver  level plans in the program  which it said could raise out of pocket spending and cut premiums  it would give the states oversight of doctor and hospital networks included in the plans  reflecting a republican theme that healthcare oversight be reduced at the federal level  the rule proposes shortening the open enrollment period for the individual market to nov   through dec    similar to employer sponsored insurance market and medicare  the weakening of the mandate and the new cms rule making it tougher for people to sign up would have contradictory effects on premium pricing  according to jonathan gruber  professor of economics at mit and one of the architects of the affordable care act   you re basically saying on the one hand  we have to weaken the mandate for political reasons but we have to lower prices  so we have to kick people out of the exchanges   gruber said  patient advocate families usa said the new rules would discourage younger  healthier people from enrolling  reduce financial assistance for families and make it harder for them to find networks that include their doctors  republican lawmakers  who are working on an obamacare replacement  said the rule was a start   if we don t take more steps like that  having an obamacare subsidy will be like having a bus ticket in a town where no buses run  because there will be zero choices to buy   senator lamar alexander  chairman of the senate health committee  told reporters outside the senate   wall street said the proposed changes could help insurer profitability but it was not clear by how much   as one would expect tightening special enrollment periods  shortening the open enrollment period to six weeks and mandating payment of premiums before coverage should lead to an improvement in the risk pool
