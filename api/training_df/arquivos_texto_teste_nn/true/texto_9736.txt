and said she would have little support if she were not a woman  as trump and clinton  fresh off big wins in five northeastern state primaries on tuesday  circled each other for a potential matchup in the nov   u s  presidential election  his comments portended what could be an unusually nasty campaign  like other controversial remarks during his white house campaign  trump s comments drew criticism from a wide spectrum but also reinforced his image   which has been attractive to some supporters   for plain talk that defies political norms   the only thing she s got going is the fact that she s a woman   trump    said on thursday on nbc s  today  show  refusing to back down from targeting clinton    for what he called  playing the woman s card       trump s remarks  reaching into an area of gender attacks that is conventionally seen as off limits  energized democrats   keep talking  donald trump   democratic committee national chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz told cnn on wednesday   every single day when donald trump opens his mouth  he does more to alienate women   trump  unfazed by the criticism  told supporters in evansville  indiana  that he has gotten a bad rap   nobody cherishes and nobody respects women more than donald trump   he said after being introduced by famed former indiana university basketball coach bobby knight   i will be so much better to women than hillary clinton   trump  who can be as free with his personal attacks on men   has consistently polled poorly with women  democrats and republicans both accuse trump of sexism over verbal insults lobbed at fox news anchor megyn kelly and former republican presidential candidate carly fiorina  on wednesday  trump s closest republican rival  u s  senator ted cruz of texas  named fiorina    as his running mate should he win the party s nomination  a move that could help him draw women s support   donald has a problem with strong women   cruz    told reporters in fort wayne  indiana  before a rally   this is not subtle  it s not complicated   u s  democratic senator barbara boxer  who fended off a  senate challenge from fiorina  said trump is insulting all women when he attacks clinton and other prominent women  such as kelly  in this way   either trump has spent too much time in his trump tower and has no clue about what s happening  or he truly dislikes women and are quite threatened by them   boxer said on msnbc  but trump said women would support his positions on security and jobs  u s  representative renee ellmers  a republican who has endorsed him  said she believed trump could overcome his unpopularity with women voters with his straight talk   to me  this is breaking all the rules  this is going against any of the typical history books and elections of the past

rules   when he is attacked  he will respond   trump s campaign manager  corey lewandowski  told reuters   the campaign is going to proceed under the mantra  which we ve had in this campaign from day one  which is  let mr  trump be mr  trump   a reuters ipsos poll this month showed a big gender gap in opinions about trump  about two thirds of women had an unfavorable view of the billionaire businessman and former reality tv star  while  percent of men had a negative view of him  in her political career  clinton has sometimes benefited from missteps by male candidates  her  u s  senate rival  new york republican rick lazio  was seen as a bully when he stepped close to her on stage during a debate to demand she sign a pledge   early in her first presidential campaign in   clinton accused her male opponents of  piling on  and said that would prompt more women to support her  then senator barack obama s comments during a debate in new hampshire that year that she was  likable enough  were seen by some as patronizing  and as helping her win the state s primary  if trump wins the nomination  his willingness to raise clinton s gender and other issues could make for one of the most contentious general election campaigns in recent history   i don t think there s going to be any taboos with donald trump   said james pethokoukis  a scholar with the conservative american enterprise institute   he s not going to treat her with any sort of kid gloves   retired u s  house speaker john boehner  a republican  weighed in on the presidential race during a talk at stanford

who is a staunch fiscal conservative and who angered many of his  colleagues in congress by leading a government shutdown in    i get along with almost everyone  but i have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life   boehner said  cruz said boehner was allowing  his inner trump  to come out   what made john boehner mad is that i led a movement of the people to hold washington accountable   cruz told reporters
