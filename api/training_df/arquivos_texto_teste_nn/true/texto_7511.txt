kokomo  indiana  reuters    the lettering is crude  scrawled in black spray paint on the sidewalk in front of karen peters  neatly kept home in the quiet  working class neighborhood where she s lived most of her life  but the contempt is clear       kkk bitch       the racially charged graffiti appeared in mid october on cars  homes and telephone poles in the small city of kokomo  indiana  many victims  like peters  were african american  though some were not  many also had lawn signs for democratic candidates in this week s presidential election  and the signs at several homes were painted over with the ku klux klan s notorious initials       i think it s a political thing  it s getting out of hand   said peters  who believes the heated tenor of the presidential campaign   and especially the aggressive  nativist rhetoric of republican candidate donald trump   has emboldened extremists       when you have  candidates  saying ignorant things  maybe other people think it s ok to do this stuff  and that s pretty doggone sad     it seems like our country is going backwards       police have no suspects in the attacks  democrats  including the mayor and local party officials  believe they were politically motivated  local republicans are skeptical  suggesting the damage is the work of ignorant hooligans with no place in the party           across the united states  the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate      it s hard to quantify the impact  there is no national data that tracks politically motivated crimes or incendiary speech   however  the percentage of voters who believe insulting political opponents is  sometimes fair game  has climbed over the campaign season  from  percent in march to  percent in october  according to surveys by the non partisan pew research center  a majority of voters for both parties have  very unfavorable  views of the other party   a first since pew began asking the question in    and trust in government is hovering near all time lows   these indicators reflect inter group tensions that can translate into everything from coarse discourse or low levels of aggression all the way up to extremist acts   said brian levin  director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university       while much of the venom has been aimed at immigrants  african americans and other groups typically aligned with democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  republicans also have faced vitriol and hostility  much of the debate over extremism has focused on the so called alt right  a loose knit movement of white nationalists  anti semites and immigration foes that has emerged from the political shadows to align itself with the trump campaign       trump s vows to build a wall on the mexican border  deport millions of illegal immigrants and scrutinize muslims for ties to terrorism have energized the alt right community   such rhetoric has helped legitimize the alt right s concerns about an erosion of the country s white  christian majority  said michael hill  a self described white supremacist  anti semite and xenophobe who heads the league of the south  a  southern nationalist  group dedicated to creating an independent  white man s land        the general political climate that sort of surrounds his campaign has been very fruitful  not only for us  but for other right wing groups   hill said      similar nationalist undercurrents have stirred other countries  from russia to japan to britain  last summer  as britain s debate over leaving the european union reached a fever pitch  jo cox  a pro eu lawmaker  was shot and stabbed in the street  murder suspect thomas mair proclaimed  death to traitors  freedom for britain       in the united states  reports of hostile political displays  vandalism and violence are cropping up regularly   in mississippi  a black church was burned and painted with  vote trump   in north carolina  a county republican office was set ablaze last month and a nearby building spray painted with  nazi republicans leave town   in ohio  a truck load of manure was dumped at a democratic campaign office  in utah  a man displaying trump yard signs found kkk graffiti on his car  in wisconsin  a fan at a college football game wore a president barack obama mask with a noose on his neck   neither the trump nor the clinton campaigns responded to requests for comment      trump s positions are consistent with the alt right goal of  slowing the dispossession of whites   said jared taylor  a white nationalist whose website  american renaissance  is a movement favorite  but the media is over hyping his support within the alt right  in an attempt to discredit him   taylor added      trump has been criticized by both democrats and some republicans for being slow to condemn the more extreme elements of the political right  but when a leading kkk newspaper ran a pro trump story on its front page last week  his campaign immediately issued a statement rejecting the  repulsive  article      taylor  hill and other alt right figures say they don t advocate or condone vandalism or violence  they dismiss the notion that their rhetoric constitutes hate speech  arguing that their vilification by the left is far more hateful      left wing extremists do have a history of aggressive confrontation with people or groups seen as fascist or racist  says heidi beirich  of the southern poverty law center  an organization that monitors extremist movements   there s usually more violence from the anti racists than the racists   she said  the free speech provisions of the u s  constitution s first amendment grant broad protections for inflammatory rhetoric  but state and federal statutes do give law enforcement agencies authority to investigate and prosecute  hate crimes  motivated by bias against a race  ethnicity  religion  disability or sexual orientation      a  percent increase in hate crimes documented last year by the california state university researchers showed relatively little underlying change in attacks against most minority groups  but crimes against muslims rose  percent  some who study and work in the political arena believe there has been a general erosion in civility that began long before the start of the current presidential race  craig dunn  republican party chairman for howard county  indiana  which includes kokomo  says that a minority of extreme voices are being amplified over the internet and social media  fueling  a general breakdown in civility       local officials worry about how their community is being affected   the atmosphere is  more volatile  there s more tension   said kokomo mayor greg goodnight  a democrat  the graffiti attacks were deeply troubling  he adds   i don t remember anything like this ever happening here   monica fowler    who had  kkk  sprayed on her democratic yard signs  is struggling with the attacks   it s okay to disagree   she says   but if what you re doing is going to scare or harm another person  how dare you    this story corrects in the ninth paragraph to state that trust  not distrust  in government is near all time lows note  paragraph  contains language that may offend some readers
