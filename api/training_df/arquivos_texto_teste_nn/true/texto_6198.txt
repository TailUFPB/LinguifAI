washington  reuters    shortly after donald trump won the u s  presidential election in november  vice president elect mike pence visited the country s largest manufacturing lobby group  six blocks from the white house  to brainstorm about trump s legislative agenda  the conversation at the national association of manufacturers was friendly  with a lot of  give and take   said aric newhouse  nam s senior vice president of government relations  the business group felt pence spoke their language and that it would be full steam ahead on long sought goals such as simplifying the tax code and repealing obamacare  president barack obama s signature legislation that aimed to extend health insurance to cover more americans  but over the past week  trump has sown confusion about some of his legislative aims  he criticized a key element of his republican party s tax plan  known as the border adjustment tax  he also seemed to muddy the waters on his promise of repealing obamacare by calling for healthcare insurance for all  while nam was not unduly alarmed  the episode highlights the challenge facing pence    who will serve as chief emissary to capitol hill for trump after the new york businessman is sworn in as the  u s  president on friday  pence spent a dozen years as a congressman beginning in   forging a number of personal relationships  especially with conservatives  while he does not have a reputation on the hill as a deal maker  lawmakers  hill aides and lobbyists describe him as affable and a good communicator who is respectful in his dealings with both friend and foe   but the nam experience shows that pence s biggest obstacle in striking deals in congress may be trump himself  that s because people negotiating with pence may not always know if he speaks for his boss  pence and trump are a study in contrasts  where trump is combative and chases the limelight  pence  most recently governor of indiana  is even keeled and calm  a man described by republicans and democrats as articulate and upbeat  few vice presidents in modern u s  history have occupied the central role in legislative affairs that pence will have  former vice president dick cheney cut deals and cajoled lawmakers for president george w  bush  but pence s assignment may be broader  in trump s first  days in office  pence will be  leading the charge  on a number of initiatives in congress  such as rewriting obamacare and overhauling the tax code  senior trump  adviser kellyanne conway told reuters   he has the assurance and the green light to do so from president trump   conway said   he is a major part of every serious conversation and important decision that is made  especially when it comes to the legislative agenda   she said  while pence certainly appears to be part of trump s inner circle  it s far from clear who is closest to the new president  or whether they will tend to agree with pence  even though republicans control both chambers of congress  pence will need plenty of political finesse to rally the party s sometimes unruly rank and file lawmakers behind trump s agenda  once it is more fully fleshed out  from the conservative tea party faction to the moderate republicans  the party remains divided  many republicans differ with trump on issues such as free trade and worry he might be too willing to spend money that could increase budget deficits  in his home state of indiana during the   pence honed his communication skills as a talk radio host  but his low key style stood in stark contrast to many conservative radio hosts  he has called himself  rush limbaugh on decaf   referring to the influential right wing talk show host famous for his flame throwing statements   pence  who was raised catholic and later became an evangelical christian  would sometimes host bible studies in his office in the house of representatives  texas representative john carter attended those meetings and recalled that pence  had a little setup of a radio station  there in a reminder of his former career  during republican president george w  bush s administration  pence firmly established himself as a fiscal hawk  he resisted initiatives that he viewed as government overreach  including the   no child left behind  education reform that emphasized standardized testing as a way of gauging how well schools were doing in raising student performance  pence s staunch opposition to big government made him one of the  forerunners  to what later became the tea party  said michael steel  a former spokesman for house speaker paul ryan s predecessor  john boehner  republican senator jeff flake  who served in the house with pence during the   said the two of them fashioned themselves as self appointed fiscal watchdogs  they kept a close eye on late night sessions where other lawmakers would seek to get more government spending approved without anyone noticing   mike and i would have to wait up all night and rush to the  house  floor and burst through the doors  to object to those measures  flake recounted in an interview   somebody said at one point when we burst through it looked like the saloon doors in  butch cassidy and the sundance kid    flake said  referring to the  film about the two wild west outlaws  representative jim jordan of ohio  a leading conservative voice  said pence has been a role model for other republicans on how to advance conservative principles without being hard edged       i always remember the line pence had   i m a conservative and i m not mad about it      it s a line i ve used many times  saying that mike pence always used to say that   jordan said  pence calls speaker ryan  who has struggled with staunch conservatives in his caucus  a close friend  their ties may help to smooth over some of the tensions that arose between ryan and trump during the  campaign   cultivating republicans won t be pence s only job  if republicans in the house of representatives can rally around trump s agenda  democrats will have few tools to block them  but in the senate  democrats can use procedural moves to stop legislation that does not otherwise have support from  senators  republicans control  votes in the  member chamber  pence s smooth demeanor will go only so far given his ideological gulf with congressional democrats  he has raised the ire of democrats with his outspoken stance against abortion  his work against gay rights  his opposition to measures aimed at women s pay equity in the workplace and his determination to repeal obamacare   republican senator roy blunt of missouri  who was part of the house republican leadership during the mid   said he expected pence would stick to his conservative principles  even if they clashed with trump s   i don t think he d be very effective arguing against his own feelings   blunt said   but i think he d be smart enough to go to the president and say   i can be supportive of this because you are the president and i am the vice president  but i am not going to be a good salesman   on that particular issue
