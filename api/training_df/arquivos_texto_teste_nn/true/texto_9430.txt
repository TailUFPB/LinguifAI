washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives voted down on monday a measure that would have compelled cell phone carriers to disclose a phone s location with law enforcement in the event of an emergency  amid a last minute lobbying effort from privacy advocates opposed to it  lawmakers voted   to pass the kelsey smith act  falling short of the two thirds threshold necessary due to rules invoked to expedite the bill s vote  the rejection was considered surprising  as house leadership rarely schedules a vote on legislation it is not confident will pass  however  civil liberties groups aggressively opposed the bill on monday  arguing that while well intended  it would create a warrant loophole and could lead to expanded government surveillance   r street  a libertarian leaning think tank  said phone companies already possess the authority to share cell phone location data in emergency situations and did so frequently  making the legislation largely unnecessary  the bill is named after a deceased  year old kansas woman who disappeared following a visit to a local target store in   smith was found murdered four days later only after verizon  her cell phone provider  shared the location of her phone with authorities  according to representative kevin yoder  a kansas republican and author of the bill   while i m disappointed in tonight s outcome  i look forward to the bill being brought back to the house floor when a simple majority vote can get it passed   yoder said in a statement  smith s parents were in attendance in the house chamber during the vote  according to yoder s office  more than  states have already adopted versions of the law since smith s death
