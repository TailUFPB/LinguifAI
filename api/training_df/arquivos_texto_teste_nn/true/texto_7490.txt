washington philadelphia  reuters    voters and civil rights groups reported long lines  isolated cases of malfunctioning equipment and some harassment at polling places in tuesday s u s  presidential election but fears of widespread violence at the polls did not materialize  nationwide  civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints  receiving about   calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of tuesday evening  democratic party officials  however  said they did not see systemic voter suppression efforts  civil rights groups  who have enlisted   volunteers  said  percent of the calls they had received through the telephone hotline by early afternoon were from african american and latino voters  complaints of voter intimidation were especially prevalent in florida  georgia  ohio and arizona with a disproportionate share coming from minority voters   we are hearing more complaints about voter intimidation than we have in presidential cycles from prior years   said kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  republican presidential candidate donald trump has repeatedly said the election would be  rigged  and called on his supporters to watch for signs of fraud in urban areas  raising fears they could clash with minority voters  numerous studies have found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the united states  absent on tuesday were reports of the kind of hostile political displays  vandalism and violence that have cropped up regularly throughout the campaign  a polling station was locked down in southern california after one person was killed and three wounded by gunfire but police saw no immediate indication the incident was linked to election day  but isolated reports of voter intimidation and harassment flooded the voter complaint hotline run by a coalition of civil rights groups throughout the day  an african american voter called the hotline from alabama s shelby county to report that a white poll worker had indicated she would have to wash her hands after handling the voter s photo identification card   shelby county lawyers persuaded the u s  supreme court in  to strike down a key provision of the landmark voting rights act requiring states with a history of voter discrimination to get federal clearance for changes to their election laws  clarke said many voter complaints to the hotline came from states formerly covered by that provision  some voters in florida reported a heavy  unexplained police presence at several polling sites around the state  a group of students in the state were told their votes would not count because their college dormitory was considered a hotel   in ohio s franklin county  the hotline received complaints that somali american voters were told they would have to vote provisionally because their addresses did not match their identification cards   and then were told that the polling site had run out of provisional ballots  in georgia s dekalb county  a group calling itself defenders of democracy was pressuring voters in line to fill out sample ballots and sign pledges that they would cast the same votes on the real ballot  according to reports received by the hotline  the federal government reduced its election monitoring program in the wake of a  u s  supreme court decision that weakened federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination  revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also have left voters uncertain about when and where they can cast their ballot and whether they will need to present photo identification   a nevada judge on tuesday rejected a request from trump for records from a las vegas polling place that his campaign said had improperly remained open last week to accommodate people who were lined up to vote  the judge agreed with a county attorney who argued that election officials already preserve records   malfunctioning machines dominated voter complaints out of pennsylvania  arizona  new york  north carolina and virginia  trump cited reports that polling machines were switching votes for republican candidates to votes for democrats as cause for concern that the election outcome might not be valid  once again warning of a rigged system  speaking to fox news  trump provided no evidence to support the allegations or say where polling machines were breaking down  although there were some problems in pennsylvania  voters in at least four pennsylvania counties said touch screen voting machines were mistakenly switching votes  state officials  however  said they did not believe any ballots had been wrongly counted as a result of the machine malfunctions  pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that relies on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that would allow officials to double check the outcome if it is challenged  the machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly  a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age   but es s  the company that makes the machines  said voters have a chance to confirm their choices before they cast their ballot  making it impossible for the machine to flip a vote from one candidate to another  local officials test machines to make sure they are calibrated properly before each election  the philadelphia district attorney s office  which monitors voting in the state s largest city  said on twitter it was not receiving any complaints out of the ordinary  electronic voting rolls in durham county  north carolina  malfunctioned early on tuesday  prompting the county to ask the state board of elections to extend voting hours in eight precincts until  p m   an hour and a half later than they were supposed to be open  the state elections board on tuesday evening agreed to extend voting hours in the precincts by between  and  minutes
