washington  reuters    president elect donald trump s rejection this weekend of u s  intelligence analysts  conclusion that russia intervened in the  election to help him win the white house is the latest in a string of conflicts between trump and the intelligence community he will command  most of them involve russia  which has grown increasingly aggressive   according to what u s  intelligence agencies have told congress and the administration of president barack obama   in syria and ukraine  the agencies also reported that russia has ratcheted up activities in cyberspace including meddling  sometimes covertly  in european and u s  elections  the intelligence agencies have concluded with  high confidence  that not only did their russian counterparts direct the hacking of democratic party organizations and leaders  but they did so to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton  not just to shake confidence in the u s  electoral system  a senior u s  official said on friday       the president elect s transition office responded by releasing a statement that exaggerated his margin of victory and attacked the u s  intelligence community s work on iraq  but did not address the analysts  conclusion about russia   these are the same people that said saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction   the statement said   the election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history  it s now time to move on and  make america great again     in a statement issued on saturday  california democrat adam schiff  a member of the house intelligence committee  called the russian hacking of the u s  election  spectacularly successful    one would also have to be willfully blind not to see that these russian actions were uniformly damaging to secretary  of state hillary  clinton and helpful to donald trump   schiff said   i do not believe this was coincidental or unintended   trump has rejected the intelligence agencies  finding   i don t believe they interfered   he told time magazine about russia in an interview published this week   that became a laughing point  not a talking point  a laughing point  any time i do something  they say   oh  russia interfered    russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the u s  election  the president elect has been receiving the president s daily brief  pdb   one of the most highly classified documents in the u s  government and which can include details of u s  and allied covert operations  only once a week  that is far less often than most of his predecessors so far  intelligence officials said  trump has not requested a special briefing on russia  despite the agencies  warnings that russian president vladimir putin is trying to undermine trans atlantic unity and test u s  and allied resolve  in fact  two officials with knowledge of the situation said on saturday that trump s transition team has made only  incidental contact  with the central intelligence agency  this is despite the fact that trump s choice to head the cia  u s  representative mike pompeo  has limited experience working with the agency  the kansas republican served on the house intelligence committee and the select committee investigating the  attack on u s  diplomatic and intelligence facilities in benghazi  libya  democrats and some republicans in congress who have been briefed on the russian activities share the intelligence agencies  alarm about trump s plans for the  agency intelligence community  which includes the national security agency  the defense intelligence agency and the national counterterrorism center  privately  some members of the clandestine service  the cia s body of spies  said they would resign rather than obey any order to resume waterboarding or other  enhanced interrogation techniques  that trump endorsed during his campaign elsewhere in the   billion a year intelligence community officials on saturday said they fear that trump might invite legal trouble by trying to vastly expand electronic and physical surveillance of suspected terrorists based on their religion or national origin  none of that may come to pass  of course  and campaign rhetoric and tweets do not always predict policies  the officials conceded however  trump s statements about russia and business dealings there  as well as those of retired army lieutenant michael flynn  his choice for national security adviser  are  worrisome to many of the officials tracking putin s growing aggressiveness from seas to skies to cyberspace  obama has ordered the intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the  election and deliver a report before he leaves office on jan    the white house said on friday  obama s homeland security adviser  lisa monaco  told reporters on friday the report s results would be shared with lawmakers and others   the president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the  election process     and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders  to include the congress   she said during an event hosted by the christian science monitor
