miami  reuters    donald trump was in the middle of creating another nickname for democratic rival hillary clinton    hillary rotten clinton     when he suddenly thought of his mild mannered vice presidential running mate  mike pence   you think mike pence would say this   he smiled to the audience in roanoke  virginia   what a high quality person   on their first campaign swing together this week  trump and pence are giving voters an initial look at their odd couple pairing as they prepare to battle against clinton and her running mate  tim kaine  the virginia governor  in the nov   presidential election  their public routine is a work in progress  but it s clear that they ve learned from their first joint appearance  a sometimes awkward interview on cbs s   minutes   in that session  trump frequently talked over pence and pence went out of his way to wave off his differences with trump on policies like his past support for the north american free trade agreement  which trump wants to renegotiate  they now have a system  when they campaign together  pence introduces trump enthusiastically as the modern day equivalent of  republican president ronald reagan and speaks of himself as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a u s  marine  then he steps aside  the trump pence union was a political marriage of necessity  the combustible  free wheeling trump needed the staid  staunchly conservative pence  the governor of indiana  to give him some credibility with establishment republicans and a boost in the midwest  the risks for pence seem minimal and the upsides are huge  he opted out of the  republican presidential sweepstakes in the fallout over his fight over a religious freedom law in indiana that critics said was anti gay  and he faced a potentially difficult re election race for governor  with his experience as a former member of congress  he could serve as a conduit to lawmakers in a trump administration  something that could be important for a presidential candidate who has never held elective office  in the two weeks since he was named trump s running mate  pence has become a lightning rod for criticism from democrats who portray him as holding extreme right wing views  clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  described pence as  an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families   pence seems to be still getting accustomed to trump s worldview  while introducing trump in roanoke on monday  he hewed closely to the establishment republican position in criticizing clinton for not doing more to ensure that a contingent of u s  troops was left in iraq after a u s  iraqi agreement expired   remember  it was hillary clinton who squandered the gains that were made at the close of our presence in iraq  the failure in judgment that sent isis on the loose   pence said in roanoke  using an acronym for the islamic state militant group  that was at odds with trump s view that the american invasion of iraq was wrong   i didn t want to go to iraq   trump said moments after pence spoke  still  pence s loyalty to trump seems absolute   in his speech introducing trump at their appearance before the veterans of foreign wars convention in charlotte  north carolina  on tuesday  pence tried to show what trump is like behind all the bluster   i know this man s heart   pence said   i know the way he speaks  when the cameras are off   trump chose pence over former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and new jersey governor chris christie  the two other finalists  although republican elites have been divided over trump s presidential bid  many approve his choice in a no     mike pence is a good man  he will add value to the ticket   tweeted jeb bush  the former florida governor and one of trump s former rivals for the nomination  gingrich said via email that pence is proving to be  a good balance for trump s powerful personality    trump himself jokingly brought up the vetting process that led him to pence  describing a candidate who was squeaky clean compared to others whose background checks turned up  many pages  of materials   with mike  they came back with like nothing  he s the most perfect human being  this guy  i love him  where is he  i love him   trump said
