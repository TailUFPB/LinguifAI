new york  reuters    republican presidential hopeful donald trump staged a harsh attack on his democratic rival hillary clinton on wednesday  accusing her of corruption and dangerous incompetence as he tried to put his campaign back on track after recent setbacks  in a speech in new york that clinton s campaign called  nutty  and that was criticized by some republicans  trump argued that the former secretary of state is part of a political establishment that has cheated american workers through bad trade deals and endangered u s  national security  both candidates are seeking to overcome their high unfavorable ratings among voters at the nov   election by painting the other as a villain who puts personal gain over the interests of less powerful americans   even by the standards of modern presidential races  the sparring between clinton  a former secretary of state and u s  senator  and brash businessman trump has made for unusually acidic rhetoric   hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the united states   trump told a small crowd of supporters at a hotel he owns in manhattan  accusing her of having run the state department  like her own personal hedge fund    clinton s staff quickly dismissed that attack and others as  lies   trump read his speech from a teleprompter to curb his off the cuff comments but he pulled no punches  he said clinton  has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft  and described her as  a world class liar   republican lindsey graham  a u s  senator from south carolina who has so far declined to support trump  said he disagreed that clinton may be the most corrupt person to have run for the white house  and challenged trump to become more presidential   my advice to mr  trump would be to make the case that you have the temperament  knowledge and judgment to be president   he said on cnn   that s the mountain you ve got to climb   trump s campaign has been distracted in recent weeks by racially charged comments he made about a mexican american judge and the republican s firing of campaign manager corey lewandowski this week      the new york real estate mogul is trailing clinton in most opinion polls  and campaign finance figures released on monday show he has raised only a fraction of the amount clinton has brought in  although trump has said he is willing to loan his campaign more money      in his speech  trump repeated accusations that clinton s decisions as america s top diplomat were influenced by donations to the clinton foundation and associated charities   clinton and her staff have denied this and similar allegations  dismissing them as politically motivated smears   the only thing donald trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories   clinton spokesman glen caplin said  the state department has said it is not aware of any evidence of improper influence  although it has acknowledged that new donations from foreign governments should have been submitted to the department s ethics advisers for prior review but were not  in breach of an ethics agreement clinton signed before taking office  trump attacked the clinton foundation for accepting millions of dollars from saudi arabia and other countries criticized by the united states for not protecting the rights of women and gay people  clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  has said that accepting such funding is not an endorsement of everything a foreign government does  clinton added a pointed defense of the clinton foundation in a speech later on wednesday   the clinton foundation helps poor people around the world get access to lifesaving aids medicine   she told cheering supporters in raleigh  north carolina   donald trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties   trump also said clinton had used bad political judgment in her four years as secretary of state  failing to stop the rise of islamic state  keep strong sanctions on iran or avoid chaos in libya   her decisions spread death  destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched   trump said           on tuesday  clinton delivered her own blistering attack on trump  saying that putting him in the white house would be a disaster for the u s  economy   on wednesday  clinton won the endorsement of former u s  national security adviser brent scowcroft  a republican who served under presidents gerald ford and george h w  bush  a reuters ipsos poll this week showed that   percent of likely voters backed clinton  while   percent supported trump  some of the accusations made by trump on wednesday appeared to contradict the public record  he said clinton would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees to the united states without any prior screening  but under the current process  refugees must wait months or years in foreign camps while u s  security agencies review their backgrounds  a system clinton supports  trump said clinton was sleeping  soundly  in her bed as a deadly attack unfolded in benghazi  libya  in  in which four americans were killed  state department records show clinton was in her state department office when news of the opening assaults came through  she has said she later worked through the night on the u s  response
