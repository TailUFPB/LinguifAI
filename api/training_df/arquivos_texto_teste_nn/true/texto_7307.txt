washington  reuters    congressional republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down obamacare following donald trump s election as u s  president  including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation  trump s victory on tuesday means republicans will control the white house  senate and house of representatives  but congressional democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against republican efforts to repeal the  law considered president barack obama s signature domestic policy achievement  the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  has provided  million previously uninsured americans with health coverage  republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law  which they call a government overreach  wyoming senator john barrasso  a member of senate republican leadership  said one way for the incoming president and congress to attack obamacare immediately after trump takes office on jan   would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of health and human services  the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law   we could confirm someone on jan   who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states  to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers   barrasso said in a telephone interview  barrasso noted that the senate needs only a simple majority vote in the  seat chamber to confirm cabinet members  as opposed to  votes to overcome procedural hurdles the democrats could present to repeal legislation  passing repeal legislation  is not a  day one  activity  but a new secretary of hhs going after the regulations can be a  day one  activity   barrasso added  trump during the campaign called obamacare  a disaster  and joined fellow republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax free health savings accounts  his transition website says trump wants a solution that  returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states   in repealing obamacare  congressional republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around democrats in the senate  where rules protect the rights of the minority party  republicans in congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of obamacare in january  but obama vetoed the legislation  the bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage  as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law  and would have eliminated expansion of the medicaid insurance health insurance program   republican representative chris collins of new york  one of trump s earliest supporters on capitol hill  said he hopes congress can pass a similar bill gutting obamacare within trump s first  days in office  a promise trump made during the presidential campaign  but some changes will doubtless be phased in over time  collins said   there s nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone s health insurance plan for    collins said in an interview   from a replacement standpoint  our position has always been as republicans to move forward in a step by step fashion   barrasso said  in an interview with the wall street journal published on friday  trump said he was considering retaining parts of obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age  on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions  while waiting for congress to act on legislation  the new hhs secretary could be reworking obamacare regulations  barrasso said  for example  regulations could give u s  states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law  such as exemptions from the so called individual mandate requiring americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it  kim monk  an analyst at capital alpha partners  which provides policy research to financial institutions  said trump s hhs might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for obamacare  insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill  hhs might also be able to alter the language on  essential benefits  that the law requires insurance plans to cover  which include trips to the emergency room  maternity and newborn care  and mental health services  monk said   the law requires they have to cover  essential health benefit categories  but how that gets defined  a lot of that is interpretative   monk said   and of course  everything the obama administration interpreted was more  more  more  more expensive coverage  and all these things lead to premium increases   collins  a member of the trump transition team s executive committee  said the job of hhs secretary or surgeon general  would be great for ben carson   referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination and later endorsed trump
