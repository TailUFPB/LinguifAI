new york  reuters    the scandal over improper sales practices at wells fargo   co extended to thousands of small business owners  according to a u s  lawmaker  raising questions about the scope of the bank s issues with unauthorized accounts  in a sept   letter viewed by reuters on tuesday  sen  david vitter  a louisiana republican  demanded that wells fargo chief executive john stumpf provide a  full accounting  of customers affected  vitter is a member of the u s  senate s banking committee and also heads its small business committee  discussions between congressional staffers and wells fargo  have indicated that the fraudulent activity of your employees was not limited to wells fargo s consumer banking operations   vitter wrote   thousands of small business owners were impacted by this fraud   a person familiar with vitter s probe say wells has identified about   small business accounts that were subject to improper practices  vitter spokeswoman cheyenne klotz declined to comment on specifics about those practices  revelations of wells fargo s problems with small business customers come almost a month after it reached a   million settlement over opening as many as  million accounts in retail customers  names without their knowledge  the bank has said it fired about   employees for improperly opening the accounts  the disclosures have caused a public furor  with stumpf facing heated questions before two congressional committees and other u s  authorities launching investigations into the bank s sales practices  including the justice department and the labor department   while the vast majority of accounts in the settlement were consumer accounts  to the extent there were small business accounts included  all were previously reported in the total number of potentially impacted accounts   said wells spokeswoman jennifer langan   as stated earlier  wells fargo has already refunded   accounts  the impacted accounts  including small business  were part of our retail bank business   a consumer financial protection board spokesman contradicted the wells statement  however  saying its figure of nearly  million accounts being affected did not include small business accounts  wells is also battling lawsuits from former employees  customers and shareholders related to the issue  in a second letter  vitter requested that the small business administration s inspector general  peggy gustafson  investigate wells  too  senior bank executives have apologized for opening accounts customers did not request  but characterized the issue as limited to relatively few customers and employees in the retail bank  early results from vitter s examination are the first hard sign that problems may extend further  reuters also spoke to a former wells employee  and a lawyer representing former employees and a former and current wells customer  who described abusive sales practices with multiple business accounts      jose maldonado  a restaurant owner in southern california who banked with wells fargo for  years  said he discovered seven accounts after enlisting the help of his accountant  he initially closed extraneous ones  and ultimately moved his remaining business to bank of america corp and jpmorgan chase   co   i don t like wells fargo anymore  i don t feel comfortable   maldonado said in an interview   in the past  there were sometimes crazy accounts without my permission   langan declined to comment on maldonado s accounts  an ex wells fargo business banker  who declined to be identified  said employees at his former branch were required to sell products to small business customers such as hair salon owners and carpet cleaners in packages of three   regardless of whether they needed them  those typically included accounts for checking  credit card processing and payroll  and were often linked to additional savings accounts  said the former wells banker  bankers also tacked on business credit cards and were pressured to call a wells insurance unit  with the customer present  to push business liability policies     langan  the wells spokeswoman  said the bank discontinued those packages in april   attorney jonathan delshad filed two class action lawsuits against wells fargo in september on behalf of former employees  including one business banker  who say they were fired for refusing to create fake accounts to hit sales quotas  wells suspended those quotas on oct    other former wells fargo business bankers contacted delshad after the lawsuit received media attention  he said   business owners are also being ripped off   one wrote to him in a message he provided to reuters  business and corporate governance experts say small business customers can be as susceptible to fraud as any customer   owners are typically knowledgeable about their business expertise but not about banking services  said peter conti brown  a financial regulation professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  for example  a new dentist who borrows from a bank to buy a practice may then need other services that she does not even know exist  such as payroll management or credit card clearing  but the potential for abuse still exists  he said  a bank can sell multiple  unnecessary accounts and credit cards to sole proprietors whose needs rarely exceed making deposits and writing checks  the risk of abuse is greater when bankers are required to sell a certain number of products to meet performance goals   the best case is that you will sour your relationship  and in the worst case  you ll get bankers committing fraud   conti brown said   wells fargo has seen both of these things    this article corrects the lede to add the dropped word  of
