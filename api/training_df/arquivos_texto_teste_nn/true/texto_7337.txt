washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor donald trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen  due to take office on jan    trump  the winner in tuesday s election  campaigned at times to dismantle obama s nuclear deal with iran and to reimpose sanctions obama eased on cuba  trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way obama has deployed troops abroad to combat islamist militant groups  in his most notable foreign policy achievements  obama  a democrat  used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a republican controlled congress committed to blocking his agenda  the u s  constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy  both republican and democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders  presidential memoranda and what are called findings   he  obama  relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy   said thomas wright  director of the project on international order and strategy at the brookings institution    that is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a trump administration   wright said  obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to democrat hillary clinton  his former secretary of state  but she lost the presidential election to trump  a republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military   often contradicting himself during the campaign  trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue  major constraints include budget caps  laws he cannot reverse without congress  and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon  trump said in an october speech that he would  cancel every unconstitutional executive action  memorandum and order issued by president obama  on his first day in office  without saying who would determine their constitutionality  a trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on thursday on his latest plans  perhaps nowhere has obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the  deal with iran  which republicans and some democrats said put too few restrictions on iran s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief  trump has vowed to dismantle it  although his statements on the deal have been contradictory  a president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order   anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order   said zachary goldman  a former u s  treasury official now at new york university  obama drew enough support from democrats to block a republican led resolution rejecting the iran deal  achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus   trump will have the added advantage of working with a u s  senate and a house of representatives controlled by fellow republicans  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he hoped trump would  see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself  which would not require us   breaking with longstanding u s  policy on another issue  obama restored diplomatic ties with cuba in   but facing opposition in congress to lifting a broad economic embargo  especially from republicans  he used executive actions to ease some u s  sanctions  obama capped his cuba efforts last month with a sweeping   presidential policy directive   which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement  people to people exchanges  and greater u s  business ties  trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not  obama s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for u s  businesses and travelers that it would be difficult  if not impossible  for any republican president to reverse the opening to cuba  trump could roll back obama s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes  obama issued an executive order in july requiring annual disclosures about such strikes  as commander in chief  trump will wield the power to mobilize the u s  military on short notice and without first seeking approval from congress  obama deployed u s  troops to iraq  syria and libya to help fight the islamic state militant group by relying on the authority congress granted president george w  bush to battle al qaeda  that same authority would allow trump to ramp up u s  deployments in fights against islamist militants if he chose to do so  one former u s  intelligence official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in congress once the operation is under way  trump s powers  however  are limited  he pledged to expand the army  grow the marine corps  boost the navy from  to  ships and submarines  and raise the number of air force tactical aircraft from   to    for starters  that would require that congress scrap government spending caps under the budget control act  trump s support for water boarding  an interrogation technique that simulates drowning  also would meet opposition  congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other  extreme interrogation techniques  widely considered torture  obama signed the measure into law last november
