washington  reuters    in declining to seek prosecution of hillary clinton  fbi director james comey said the former secretary of state s handling of classified emails was  extremely careless    conduct  legal experts said  that falls short of  gross negligence   a standard for criminal charges under the espionage act   although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information  our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case   comey said in a news conference tuesday detailing the fbi investigation and his decision  several legal experts agreed with comey s conclusion that there was no recent precedent for bringing such a case without evidence of willful intent or gross negligence  and they said it would have been difficult to convince a jury to convict clinton based on the evidence   extreme carelessness doesn t necessarily translate into gross negligence   said laurie levenson  a professor of law at loyola law school in los angeles and former federal prosecutor    the only times i have seen these statutes used has been situations in which people knew they were disclosing classified  confidential information  or they could show they didn t really care   levenson said   comey said investigators determined that clinton exchanged  emails that contained government secrets and that she and her staff should have known the information was classified  but unlike other cases prosecuted under the espionage act  the fbi has not suggested that clinton intentionally shared government secrets with people not authorized to see them  the statute for charging gross negligence under the espionage act  written in   requires the information be  removed from its proper place   a tough legal requirement in the digital age  said stephen vladeck  a law professor at university of texas  vladeck said the law is not  well suited for careless discussion of information in unsecured media that doesn t dispossess the government of that information or direct it right into the hands of a foreign power    previous cases charged under the espionage act have shown intent  experts said  defense attorney abbe lowell said comey s decision was  completely consistent  with every case brought for leaking classified government information   defendants in other cases include stephen kim  lowell s client who pleaded guilty to leaking state department documents to the press  as well as former c i a  director general david petraeus  he admitted to keeping classified information  which he would also share with his biographer  in his home  while telling the government he had returned all such information   the one common denominator of all such cases is that the individual involved intentionally sent material to those not authorized to receive it  like the press  like a foreign government   lowell said  comey said the fbi  did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information   but he said it did find  evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive  highly classified information   his recommendation  which attorney general loretta lynch previously said she would accept  angered republicans who said her actions should be punished   republican presidential front runner donald trump reacted to the news from his twitter account  saying   the system is rigged  general petraeus got in trouble for far less   in that case  the fbi recommended a felony charge  but attorney general eric holder pursued a misdemeanor under another part of the law  and petraeus pleaded guilty  he was sentenced to two years probation in    the fbi had recordings of petraeus acknowledging the information in notebooks in his home was highly classified  petraeus also admitted to lying to the fbi about sharing the information with paula broadwell  his biographer and lover  steven aftergood  director of the federation of american scientists  project on government secrecy  said clinton s cooperation with fbi investigators also may have helped her avoid charges   there was no obstruction of justice  no failure to cooperate truthfully with investigators  no concealment of her activity   aftergood said  legal precedent suggests that clinton is unlikely to face a misdemeanor charge for recklessness because recent cases that ended with misdemeanors began as much larger felony charges against individuals who intended to leak information  in   thomas drake  a whistleblower from the nationalsecurity agency who helped expose the government s warrantless surveillance of americans  was charged with espionage after the government accused him of bringing five classified documents home  he denied the accusation  and those charges were dropped  drake pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer   somebody needs to ask comey about my case   drake  who now works at an apple store in maryland  wrote in an email late tuesday  former president bill clinton s national security adviser pleaded guilty in  to smuggling classified documents out of the national archives by stuffing them under his clothes  he was fined    and sentenced to two years of probation
