beijing  reuters    whether president elect donald trump goes through with a deployment of a u s  anti missile system in south korea will be a key indicator to how political ties unfold with china  sources with ties to the leadership in beijing said  beijing will also be keeping a close eye on trump s meeting on thursday with prime minister shinzo abe of japan  its key regional rival  for clues on how the president elect  who has never held public office  is likely to conduct foreign policy  they said  south korea and the united states have agreed to deploy a terminal high altitude area defence  thaad  anti missile system  to counter missile threats from north korea  it is expected to be in place within eight to  months  the commander of u s  forces in south korea said earlier this month  china has argued the planned deployment undermines strategic stability in northeast asia  and worries that thaad s powerful radar provides coverage of china s missile installations   whether deployment of the terminal high altitude area defense is delayed is a political weather vane   one source said  a security adviser to trump said last week his meeting in new york with abe on thursday may mark the start of talks to garner tokyo s support for a push back against china s growing influence in asia   we have heard what he said  we will now watch what he does   said the source  requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media   we will play it by ear   the source said  invoking an idiom that translates to blocking a punch or a kick as it comes  trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances with japan and south korea  suggesting they need to pay more for a u s  military presence and even hinting they should develop their own nuclear weapons capability  japan going nuclear would be china s worst nightmare and is likely to provoke strong reaction  diplomats and analysts have said  china s relations with japan have long been poisoned by what beijing sees as tokyo s failure to fully atone for its invasion and occupation of parts of china before and during world war two as well as competing claims over a group of east china sea islets   northeast asia would be a powder keg   a second source said  referring to a nuclearized sub region including china  japan  north and south korea  the state council information office  or cabinet spokesman s office  had no immediate comment  china is generally opposed to military alliances  seeing them as cold war relics   china s stability obsessed leaders do not know what to make of the  year old trump  whose win over hillary clinton was unexpected  and has backpedaled on some of his more controversial campaign statements  for example  trump pledged his commitment to defending south korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call last week with south korean president park geun hye  trump had said during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw the   u s  troops stationed in south korea unless seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the u s  deployment  trump told reuters in an interview in may he was willing to talk to north korean leader kim jong un to try to stop pyongyang s nuclear program   a major shift in u s  policy toward the isolated nation   but has also called for china to do more to rein in pyongyang  sino u s  relations after trump takes office on jan   are expected to be fluid  although chinese president xi jinping told trump during a telephone call on monday cooperation was the  only correct choice  for the two giants  a statement from trump s presidential transition office said the two men  established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another  and he believes the two countries will have one of the strongest relationships moving forward  trump s election does offer some good news for china  it signals the demise of the u s  led trans pacific partnership  tpp   which excludes china  it raises the possibility of belated u s  backing for the china led asian infrastructure investment bank  and possibly marks an end to president obama s strategic  pivot  to asia  the bad news is that trump has often made provocative remarks about china during his campaign  including threats to slap  percent tariffs on imports from china and label the world s second biggest economy a currency manipulator  wei jianguo  a retired vice commerce minister  was optimistic a trade war could be avoided   protectionism is on the rise  but a trade war between china and the united states is unlikely   wei  vice chairman of the china center for international economic exchanges  a government backed think tank  told reuters   that was just election rhetoric   he said
