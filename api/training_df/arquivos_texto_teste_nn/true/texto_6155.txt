washington  reuters    donald trump took power as the  president of the united states on friday and pledged to end what he called an  american carnage  of rusted factories and crime in an inaugural address that was a populist and nationalist rallying cry   striking a defiant tone  trump said american workers have been devastated by the outsourcing of jobs abroad    from this day forward it s going to be only america first   the republican told thousands of people gathered on the national mall to see him take over from democrat barack obama  with obama and three other former presidents

more than  people were arrested  aerial pictures of the crowds of trump supporters on the mall showed a much smaller turnout at midday on friday than that in comparable photos from obama s first

foreign industry at the expense of american companies  subsidized the armies of other countries while letting the u s  military become depleted  and spent trillions abroad while allowing infrastructure at home to crumble   the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world   he said  trump accused the washington establishment of protecting itself but abandoning regular citizens who have suffered from poverty and crime   this american carnage stops right here and stops right now   he said   every decision on trade  on taxes  on immigration  on foreign affairs  will be made to benefit american workers and american families   he said  trump    takes over a country divided after a savage  election campaign   the grim vision

ceremony  in the oval office  which obama vacated friday morning  gold drapes had already been hung in place of crimson ones  trump s election was greeted with concern by many countries around the world  in part because of the potential for an isolationist foreign policy  in an interview after trump was sworn in  german vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said   what we heard today were high nationalistic tones     i think we have to prepare for a rough ride   gabriel told public broadcaster zdf  adding that europe should stand together to defend its interests  mexican president enrique

limo and walked part of the parade route  waving to cheering well wishers  later  they watched some of the parade from a reviewing stand built on pennsylvania avenue in front of the white house  trump takes office with work to do to improve his image  an abc news washington post poll this week found only  percent of americans viewed him favorably  the lowest rating for an incoming president since democrat jimmy carter in   and the same percentage approved of how he has handled the transition   trump s rise  while welcomed by republicans tired of obama s eight years in office  raises a host of questions for the united states       trump campaigned on a pledge to take the country on a more isolationist  protectionist path and he has vowed to impose a  percent tariff on imports from u s

trump senior adviser kellyanne conway told fox news  democrats  in search of firm political footing after the unexpected defeat of clinton  are planning to fight him at every turn    trump s critics have been emboldened to attack his legitimacy because his win came only in the electoral college  which gives smaller states more clout in the outcome  he lost the popular vote to clinton by about   million  trump s critics also point to the conclusion of u s  intelligence agencies that russia used hacking and other methods during the campaign to try to tilt the election in the republican s favor  trump has acknowledged the finding   denied by moscow   that russia was behind the hacking but said it did not affect the outcome of the election
