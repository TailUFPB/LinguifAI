west palm beach  fla  washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on monday named lieutenant general herbert raymond mcmaster as his new national security adviser  choosing a military officer known for speaking his mind and challenging his superiors   mcmaster is a highly regarded military tactician and strategic thinker  but his selection surprised some observers who wondered how the officer  whose army career stalled at times for his questioning of authority  would deal with a white house that has not welcomed criticism   he is highly respected by everybody in the military and we re very honored to have him   trump told reporters in west palm beach where he spent the weekend   he s a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience   one subject on which trump and mcmaster could soon differ is russia  mcmaster shares the consensus view among the u s  national security establishment that russia is a threat and an antagonist to the united states  while the man whom mcmaster is replacing  retired lieutenant general michael flynn  appeared to view it more as a potential geopolitical partner   trump in the past has expressed a willingness to engage with russia more than his predecessor  barack obama   flynn was fired as national security adviser on feb   after reports emerged that he had misled vice president mike pence about speaking to russia s ambassador to the united states about u s  sanctions before trump s inauguration  the ouster  coming so early in trump s administration  was another upset for a white house that has been hit by miscues  including the controversial rollout of a travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries  since the republican president took office on jan    the national security adviser is an independent aide to the president and does not require confirmation by the u s  senate  he has broad influence over foreign policy and attends national security council meetings along with the heads of the state department  the department of defense and key security agencies  republican senator john mccain  chairman of the senate armed services committee and a frequent trump critic  praised mcmaster as an  outstanding  choice   i give president trump great credit for this decision   mccain said in a statement   a former u s  ambassador to russia under obama  michael mcfaul  a democrat  praised mcmaster on twitter as  terrific  and said mcmaster  will not be afraid to question his boss   mcmaster  who flew back to the washington area from florida with trump on air force one  will remain on active military duty  the white house said   trump also said keith kellogg  a retired u s  army lieutenant general who has been serving as the acting national security adviser  as chief of staff to the national security council  john bolton  a former u s  ambassador to the united nations  would be asked to serve the administration in another capacity  trump said   he has a good number of ideas that i must tell you i agree very much with   trump said of bolton  who served in republican president george w  bush s administration    kellogg and bolton were among those in contention as trump spent the long presidents day weekend considering his options for replacing flynn  his first choice  retired vice admiral robert harward  turned down the job last week  mcmaster    is a west point graduate known as  h r    with a ph d  in u s  history from the university of north carolina at chapel hill  he was listed as one of time magazine s  most influential people in   partly because of his willingness to buck the system  a combat veteran  he gained renown in the first gulf war   and was awarded a silver star   after he commanded a small troop of the u s   armored cavalry regiment that destroyed a much larger iraqi republican guard force in  in a place called  easting  for its map coordinates  in what many consider the biggest tank battle since world war two  as one fellow officer put it  referring to trump s inner circle of aides and speaking on condition of anonymity  the trump white house  has its own republican guard  which may be harder for him to deal with than the iraqis were   the iraqi republican guard was the elite military force of ousted dictator saddam hussein  trump relies on a tight  insular group of advisers  who at times appear to have competing political agendas  senior adviser steve bannon has asserted his influence by taking a seat on the national security council    mcmaster s fame grew after his  book  dereliction of duty  criticized the country s military and political leadership for poor leadership during the vietnam war  trump s pick was praised by one of the president s strongest backers in the u s  congress  republican senator tom cotton  who called mcmaster  one of the finest combat leaders of our generation and also a great strategic mind    in a july     interview with the columbus ledger enquirer in columbus  georgia  where fort benning is located  mcmaster  then the base commander  said   some people have a misunderstanding about the army   some people think  hey  you re in the military and everything is super hierarchical and you re in an environment that is intolerable of criticism and people don t want frank assessments   i think the opposite is the case      and the commanders that i ve worked for  they want frank assessments  they want criticism and feedback   that attitude was not always shared by his superiors  and it led to his being passed over for promotion to brigadier general twice  in  and   on mcmaster s third and last try  general david petraeus   who at one point was also on trump s candidate list for national security adviser   returned from iraq to head the promotion board that finally gave mcmaster his first general s star  then a colonel  mcmaster was commander of the  armored cavalry regiment that in the spring of  captured  held and began to stabilize tal afar on the iraqi syrian border  the city was held by sunni extremists  a crossing point between syria and iraq for jihadists who started as al qaeda in mesopotamia under abu musab al zarqawi and morphed into islamic state after he was killed  mcmaster s preparation of the regiment is legendary  he trained his soldiers in iraqi culture  the differences among sunnis  shi ites and turkomen  and had them read books on the history of the region and counterinsurgency strategy  it was a sharp change from the  kill and capture  tactics the united states had used in iraq since the invasion in march   and to which the obama administration returned in afghanistan  iraq and syria  the strategy was largely a success  although mcmaster s use of it and especially his willingness to acknowledge that iraqis had some legitimate grievances against one another and the occupying coalition forces  did not endear him to his superiors and helped delay his promotion to brigadier general  the strategy did not survive the departure of mcmaster s troops  with tal afar falling into the hands of sunni militants  along with the west part of mosul  it is now a key objective in the battle to rid iraq of islamic state   this story corrects kellogg s rank to retired lieutenant general  in paragraph   corrects headline to reflect that mcmaster is a lieutenant general
