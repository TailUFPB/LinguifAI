 reuters    u s  senator ted cruz is poised to notch another small but important victory in his battle with billionaire donald trump for the republican presidential nomination at a hotel convention center in the ranching city of casper  wyoming  this weekend   a committee of wyoming republicans is likely to hand cruz most of the state s  remaining delegates to the party s national convention in july  political operatives  including trump supporters in the state  told reuters  that may not seem like a big number  but both men are engaged in a fierce struggle to win as many as possible of the party insiders who could decide the presidential nominee at a contested convention   cruz s strength in wyoming underscores the contrast between the way the rivals handle this nuance of american politics  where cruz focuses on organizing at a minute level to court delegates in preparation for a convention fight  trump has run a national campaign focused on winning the popular vote in early nominating contests and has paid little attention to the more arcane elements of u s  presidential politics      cruz s effort has included personal visits to far flung areas  regular conference calls among his state supporters  and hospitality suites to court backers within state parties  while trump has assailed the delegate system as  rigged  and only recently reorganized his campaign to focus on them    i think cruz has done a good job with how they targeted states   said jason osborne  a republican strategist who has advised trump  and who previously worked on former candidate ben carson s campaign   an operation like trump s was built for something completely different    trump s campaign did not respond to requests for comment   the united states has a unique system for picking presidential nominees  a combination of nominating polls   usually in the form of state primaries  caucuses  and party conventions   are used to apportion delegates to candidates   in the republican race  a candidate needs to win a majority of the total   delegates to get the nomination  while trump has won  state nominating contests so far to cruz s nine  the billionaire leads the texas senator by only  delegates       to avoid a convention fight  trump needs   delegates to secure the nomination  that means he has to win nearly  percent of the remaining delegates before july   cruz s effort in wyoming  america s least populous state  is a window into his broader delegate strategy and helps explain how he has become a formidable candidate despite his relatively underdog performance in the primaries so far   the effort began in   while most other candidates were focused on the early races in iowa or new hampshire  ed buchanan  a trial attorney in cheyenne  got a call from heidi cruz  the candidate s wife  in october asking if he would become the state chairman for cruz s presidential campaign   buchanan  a former speaker of the state house  agreed to the role  which has taken him to every corner of the state trying to court support and build a slate of delegates   some states allow the voters to select the delegates who will attend the republican convention on their behalf  but in most  like wyoming  colorado and north dakota  voters have no say in who goes to cleveland   if trump doesn t have the   delegates needed to win the nomination outright  many delegates will become free at the july convention to pick a candidate based on their personal preference  not the choice of the voters in their state   that is why campaigns want their supporters among the delegates and that is where buchanan comes in   he is responsible for assembling a list of the cruz campaign s preferred delegates  which he will present to the casper conference  each would be cruz delegate has promised not to switch allegiances if the voting at the cleveland convention goes beyond one ballot   buchanan expects them to stick to their word  if they don t  it will not go unnoticed  he said    it s a small state  the people who are in political circles know each other and that would not be forgotten   he said   in wyoming  cruz won nine of the  delegates who were selected at county level meetings in march  nearly   of the state s most active party members will decide in casper this weekend the remaining  delegates to be voted on   cruz will speak on saturday and his supporters have organized a hospitality room  where they will have freebies like campaign buttons and food   trump has not campaigned in the state and will spend the weekend in new york  which holds a major primary next week  he will send former alaska governor sarah palin in his stead    cruz was here  and that makes a difference to a small state   former u s  senator alan simpson of wyoming said in an interview   trump has been slow to adapt his campaign to the delegate fight and has instead attacked the process    i know the rules very well  but i know it s stacked against me by the establishment   trump said on cnn on tuesday   it is likely now too late to combat cruz s operation in wyoming   dick shanor  who will attend the national convention to support cruz  said supporters organized to get like minded voters to show up at the county elections last month  helping the senator to score those early delegate wins   jack volsey  a trump supporter from rock springs  wyoming  had a different experience  he said he sent a message to a pro trump facebook group in the state asking how he could participate in his county convention  but he never heard back  he was eventually selected as an alternate delegate to this weekend s gathering  but he has decided not to go    i m not going to go there to sit on the sidelines when i m sure it s a done deal already
