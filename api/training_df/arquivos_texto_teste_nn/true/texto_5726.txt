ottawa winnipeg  reuters    canadian prime minister justin trudeau is taking a low key approach to dealing with u s  president donald trump  seeking to avoid clashes while indirectly signaling the two leaders  differences to a domestic audience  insiders acknowledge the cautious strategy could anger progressives whose support helped bring trudeau to power in  but say for now  he has no choice but to hold fire  canada sends  percent of its exports to the united states and could suffer if it is targeted by trump   why poke a grizzly bear while it s having lunch  trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans   said one senior political source  while trudeau s close friendship with former president barack obama was often referred to as a  bromance  and  dude plomacy   canadian prime ministers have not always had close ties with u s  presidents  still  few in ottawa have experienced anything like trump  insiders said   he is totally unpredictable   said another government source  although canada regards the united states as its closest ally  trudeau has yet to visit washington to see trump   a visit tentatively scheduled this week was canceled after a shooter killed six muslims in a quebec mosque and no new date has been set  said two people familiar with the matter  michael kergin  a former canadian ambassador to washington  said trudeau s caution was wise   he s been playing it pretty well by restraining the temptation to be publicly critical of the president  at the same time  it s a delicate balance   said kergin  now a senior adviser at law firm bennett jones  trudeau was also right not to follow british prime minister theresa may in rushing to washington to  gin up a special relationship   only to watch trump make an unpopular move on immigration after she left  kergin said  trump labeled a refugee swap deal with australia  dumb  on thursday after a telephone call with prime minister malcolm turnbull that the washington post reported was acrimonious  turnbull kept any sparring behind closed doors  trudeau  however  has taken indirect shots  when trump signed orders banning people from seven muslim majority states  trudeau tweeted that canada was open to those fleeing war  his chief spokeswoman blasted u s  network fox news on tuesday for a tweet falsely claiming the quebec gunman was of moroccan origin  but she said nothing publicly when trump s spokesman said the attack on muslims showed why it was important to suspend immigration from muslim nations    this approach infuriates the opposition new democrats  who have called on trudeau to denounce trump s  racist  immigration policy   trudeau team members acknowledge that over time  liberals could lose support before a  election if the prime minister is deemed not to be standing up for canadian values such as inclusiveness   that is a risk  but we ll address it closer to the time   said the first ottawa insider  surveys show the liberals have a healthy  but narrowing  advantage over their nearest rivals  pollster nik nanos of nanos research said it was too early for trudeau to be aggressive    he has to avoid making any kind of criticism  trump has a very thin skin and he s quick to lash out   he said
