washington  reuters    a democratic senator on monday prevented legislation from being quickly considered that would expand the fbi s power to use secretive surveillance orders to obtain some internet records  arguing it would lead to a  dramatic erosion  of u s  privacy rights    senator ron wyden of oregon placed a hold on the annual intelligence authorization act  which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the cia and other u s  intelligence agencies  a provision of the authorization bill would allow the federal bureau of investigation to use national security letters  which do not require a warrant  to compel companies such as alphabet inc s google and facebook to hand over certain internet records  these would include email metadata  some browsing history and social media log in information  such an expansion would allow the fbi to retrieve sensitive data of u s  citizens without court approval  wyden said    convenience alone does not justify such a dramatic erosion of americans  constitutional rights   he said on the senate floor  national security letters are the latest flashpoint in a years long debate pitting u s  surveillance operations against digital privacy interests  wyden s objection blocks the senate from rapidly advancing the bill and now forces republican senate leader mitch mcconnell to go through normal order to hold a roll call vote  a process that can take days  currently  national security letters  or nsls  can only compel sharing of phone billing records  according to a  legal memo written by the u s  justice department  still  the fbi has used the letters since then to request internet records during national security investigations  senate republicans have attempted to advance the nsl expansion  which fbi director james comey has called his top legislative priority  several times in recent months  last week the senate came two votes short of advancing separate legislation that would have expanded national security letters   though some republicans invoked the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando earlier this month to promote that measure  richard burr  the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee  said last week it was  one hundred percent correct  that it would not have prevented the massacre  wyden also said he opposed another provision of the authorization bill that would limit the jurisdiction of the privacy and civil liberties oversight board  a government advisory committee that reviews the legality and effectiveness u s  surveillance programs
