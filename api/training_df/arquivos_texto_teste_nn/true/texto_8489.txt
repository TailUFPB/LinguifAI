washington  reuters    democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton on wednesday accused republican opponent donald trump of inciting violence with his call for gun rights activists to stop her from nominating liberal u s  supreme court justices  clinton s comments added to a growing outcry over trump s remarks on tuesday at a north carolina rally  which some interpreted as a call for violence against his white house rival  his remarks also fueled widespread concerns about his ability to stay on track   words matter  my friends   the former u s  secretary of state  who rarely engages in direct back and forths with her republican rival  said at a rally in des moines  iowa   and if you are running to be president or you are president of the united states  words can have tremendous consequences    yesterday  we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from donald trump that crossed the line   she said  citing  his casual inciting of violence   trump insisted in an interview with fox news that his remarks were a call for political  not physical  action   there is tremendous political power to save the second amendment  tremendous   the new york businessman said   and you look at the power they have in terms of votes and that s what i was referring to  obviously that s what i was referring to  and everybody knows it   the u s  constitution s second amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms   i can t think of anything remotely comparable to it  no one tells a joke about the opponent getting shot  i ve never heard it   said bob shrum  a top aide for al gore s presidential campaign in  and john kerry s in   high profile republicans and rank and file voters appeared shaken on wednesday after a string of trump misfires  struggling with how to best reject his divisive candidacy  some pledged to withhold their endorsement and others backed clinton   some  including msnbc host joe scarborough  a former republican congressman from florida  called for party leaders to replace trump on the ticket  a new reuters ipsos poll taken aug      before trump s latest controversy   showed that nearly one fifth of  registered republicans said they want trump to drop out of the race and another  percent said they  don t know  whether the republican nominee should or not  clinton s campaign  seeing an opening  has moved to bring disenchanted republicans into the fold by announcing an official intraparty outreach effort on behalf of the democratic nominee  clinton s campaign now has a website for republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support  listing  prominent republicans and independents who have endorsed her  on monday   republican national security officials signed an open letter questioning trump s temperament  calling him reckless and unqualified to be president      other top republicans  including senator susan collins of maine this week  have disavowed trump but said they cannot back clinton  james rohrscheib    a registered republican and retired u s  navy officer from washington state  told reuters the reality is the nov   election will be a  tough one    i m in a quandary as to who i am going to vote for   rohrscheib said  trump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so called washington elite to his drive to change the status quo  one group that appears unswayed is trump s donors  reuters interviewed nine major trump donors on wednesday  and not one said his second amendment comment had given them pause  trump texas fundraising co chair gaylord hughey called the interpretation of his remark as condoning violence  ridiculous  and  ludicrous    it s just another issue the press has really twisted to make headlines   hughey said  but mike smith  a republican voter and reuters ipsos poll respondent  said the support trump is still receiving from republicans  almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary    i m almost at the point where i think i m going to vote for hillary  i don t like her   said smith  a  year old retiree who lives in clearwater  florida   but mr  trump is making me very nervous   republican strategist and trump supporter ford o connell said trump has  dug himself a deep hole  with voters and to win the election he will need to  make it a referendum on hillary clinton and the  rigged system    trump sought to do just that by using an economic policy speech in detroit on monday to correct a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of a fallen muslim american soldier  but his remarks tuesday undermined that effort   if she gets to pick her judges  nothing you can do folks   trump said at the rally in north carolina   although the second amendment people  maybe there is  i don t know   he continued  a federal official familiar with the matter denied a media report that the u s  secret service  which investigates threats against presidents and candidates  had formally spoken with the trump campaign about his remark  trump s comment and the resulting backlash occurred as reuters ipsos polling showed some  percent of   registered voters believe trump should exit the race  and that as of tuesday  clinton led trump by more than  percentage points  up from a  point lead late last week  strategists and trump detractors agreed that it would be difficult  if not impossible  to remove trump from the republican ticket   it s wishful thinking to believe the republicans are going to replace its nominee after the convention  people are grasping at straws   ron bonjean  a republican strategist unaffiliated with trump  told reuters  a more likely scenario would be a replay of the  presidential race  when the republican party essentially deserted nominee bob dole  who was badly trailing president bill clinton  to focus on congressional races
