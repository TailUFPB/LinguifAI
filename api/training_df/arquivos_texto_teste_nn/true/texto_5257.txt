washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s first budget proposal will spare big social welfare programs such as social security and medicare from any cuts  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in an interview broadcast on sunday  mnuchin said trump would also use a major policy speech to a joint session of congress on tuesday night to preview some elements of his sweeping plans to cut taxes for the middle class  simplify the tax system and make american companies more globally competitive with lower rates and changes to encourage u s  manufacturing  speaking on fox news channel s  sunday morning futures  program  mnuchin  who has acknowledged that tax reform is his top policy priority  said the budget plan would not seek cuts to federal benefits programs known as  entitlements    we are not touching those now  so don t expect to see that as part of this budget  ok   mnuchin said of the programs  according to a transcript provided by fox   we are very focused on other aspects and that s what s very important to us  and that s the president s priority   trump during his election campaign promised not to cut social security  medicare healthcare for seniors nor medicaid healthcare for the poor  preservation of these programs  coupled with a middle class tax cut  would aid the retirees and working class americans who make up a significant portion of trump s political base  in a transcript of the fox news channel interview  mnuchin said trump will be  touching on tax reform  in his speech  mnuchin said the plan would cut the number of tax brackets and  create a level playing field for u s  companies to be able to compete in the world   but wall street  which has sent stocks to record highs on anticipation of trump s tax cut plans  has grown impatient and could react negatively to a lack of substantive details about the plan in trump s speech  financial analysts said     with both chambers of the u s  congress in republican hands  trump has the potential to enact major elements of his legislative agenda   but divisions with the republican party over the approach on obamacare and taxes could prove to be an obstacle  some republican lawmakers have urged trump to lay out more specifics on his policy plans  saying that more white house engagement is needed to build momentum in congress for his agenda  mnuchin offered little new information and said key tax plan  elements were not yet settled  he said trump was looking at a  reciprocal tax  that would help create more trade parity with other countries  trump administration officials have complained that many countries charge value added taxes on imports while exempting exports from taxation  but mnuchin again said he was still  studying very carefully  a house republican border tax adjustment plan that would levy a  percent tax on imports to encourage more u s  based production and exports  that plan aims to raise more than   trillion in revenue over a decade to offset lower tax rates for businesses   there are certain aspects that the president likes about the concept of a border adjusted tax  there are certain aspects that he s very concerned about   mnuchin said   he added that the trump administration would work with the house of representatives and senate to craft  a combined plan that takes the best of all of this when we bring it forward   in a comment suggesting that trump s budget and tax plans may use aggressive revenue assumptions  mnuchin said the administration  fundamentally believes in dynamic scoring   a budget calculation method that assumes that a lower tax burden boosts revenues by encouraging economic activity  the congressional budget office has previously used mainly  static  scoring methods that assume very conservative economic effects of tax and budget changes
