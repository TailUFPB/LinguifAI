 reuters    within a few weeks of winning the white house  president elect donald trump could face another group of u s  citizens  a federal jury in california  courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now defunct trump university who claim they were defrauded by a series of real estate seminars  a hearing in federal court in san diego is set for thursday  and the trial is scheduled to begin on nov    barring any delays or if trump decides to settle the case     while presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties  the u s  supreme court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office  the  ruling came in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against president bill clinton by paula jones  which was settled before it went to trial   lawyers said they could think of no similar situation like the one now involving trump   i m certain there is nothing comparable to this   said    alan dershowitz  professor emeritus at harvard law school   lawyers for both trump and the plaintiffs declined to comment on wednesday  dershowitz said the supreme court also held that a case cannot be delayed just because the defendant is president  though judges are still free to grant reasonable delays to any party  miami trial consultant sandy marks  who is not involved in the case  said he thought trump might ask the presiding judge  gonzalo curiel  to postpone the trial in an effort to settle the case before taking office   i think the judge would be foolhardy not to give him a short  delay    said marks   which would give him a chance to resolve the case with all these people and put it behind him   trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he would win the lawsuit  and he accused curiel of being biased against him because of his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with mexico  the judge was born in indiana to mexican parents  at the hearing on thursday  lawyers will argue pre trial motions  including one by trump to block potential jurors from hearing comments made or publicized during the campaign  such as those about the judge  lawyers for the students have argued the comments could help jurors assess trump s credibility as a witness  trump is listed as defense witness in the case and could be called to testify by the plaintiffs as well  he was previously deposed by the students  lawyers   claims against trump over the seminars date to   with two class actions filed in federal court in san diego and another case brought by new york attorney general eric schneiderman on behalf of students who claim they were misled into paying as much as    each to learn worthless real estate investing  secrets  from instructors  hand picked  by trump  trump has admitted he did not hand pick instructors  but has argued the claim was marketing language not meant to be taken literally  he claims most students were happy with their courses   if the trial goes forward  several legal experts said it would be hard to seat an impartial jury  since so many people already have strong opinions about the president elect  parties often hire specialized jury consultants to pick jurors  but new york lawyer robert anello said they were not infallible   if experienced pollsters can t get it right   he said   how can a jury consultant who is not spending as much time studying the demographics   in an interview a day before the election  jeffrey goldman  a lawyer for trump in the new york case  said the media s  drumbeat of distortion  about trump university would make it hard to find impartial jurors  several experts noted that jurors  who will answer a questionnaire in addition to being questioned by the lawyers and the judge  are generally taken at their word when they say they can be impartial  boston jury consultant edward schwartz said he expects both sides to make an effort to vet jurors by their public social media postings  dershowitz noted that san diego  though located in deep blue california  is not as politically monolithic as  say  san francisco  it has an ethnically diverse population and also has a large military presence   this is a jury consultant s nightmare to pick in a case like this   said dershowitz   it will be taught in jury consulting school
