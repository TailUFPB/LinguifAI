 reuters    the u s  government spent more than a decade preparing responses to malicious hacking by a foreign power but had no clear strategy when russia launched a disinformation campaign over the internet during the u s  election campaign  current and former white house cyber security advisers said  far more effort has gone into plotting offensive hacking and preparing defenses against the less probable but more dramatic damage from electronic assaults on the power grid  financial system or direct manipulation of voting machines  over the last several years  u s  intelligence agencies tracked russia s use of coordinated hacking and disinformation in ukraine and elsewhere  the advisers and intelligence experts said  but there was little sustained  high level government conversation about the risk of the propaganda coming to the united states  during the presidential election it did   to an extent that may have altered the outcome  the security sources said  but u s  officials felt limited in investigating russian supported propaganda efforts because of free speech guarantees in the constitution   a former white house official cautioned that any u s  government attempt to counter the flow of foreign state backed disinformation through deterrence would face major political  legal and moral obstacles     you would have to have massive surveillance and curtailed freedom and that is a cost we have not been willing to accept   said the former official  who spoke on condition of anonymity   they  russia  can control distribution of information in ways we don t   clinton watts  a security consultant  former fbi agent and a fellow at the nonprofit foreign policy research institute  said the u s  government no longer has an organization  such as the u s  information agency  that provided counter narratives during the cold war  he said that most major russian disinformation campaigns in the united states and europe have started at russian government funded media outlets  such as rt television or sputnik news  before being amplified on twitter by others  watts said it was urgent for the u s  government to build the capability to track what is happening online and dispute false stories   those two things need to be done immediately   watts said   you have to have a public statement or it leads to conspiracy theories   a defense spending pill passed this month calls for the state department to establish a  global engagement center  to take on some of that work  but similar efforts to counter less sophisticated islamic state narratives have fallen short  the u s  government formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against u s  political organizations in october  a month before the nov   election  james lewis  a cyber security expert at the center for strategic   international studies who has worked for the departments of state and commerce and the u s  military  said washington needed to move beyond antiquated notions of projecting influence if it hoped to catch up with russia   they have rt and all we know how to do is send a carrier battle group   lewis said   we re going to be stuck until we find a way deal with that   watts  who said he has tracked tens of thousands of pro russia twitter handles since   believes many of the most effective stories stoke fear of war or other calamities or promote a narrative of corrupt western politicians  media and other elites   he and others said sputnik shows the intensity of the russian effort  launched two years ago as a successor to the official russian wire service and radio network  sputnik does not merely parrot the kremlin political line  according to experts  it has gone out of its way to hire outsiders with social media expertise  including left and right leaning americans who are critical of u s  policies  sputnik news did not respond to a request for comment  during the election campaign  one of the most prominent fulltime sputnik writers and commentators  cassandra fairbanks  shifted from an ardent anti police protestor and supporter of socialist u s  senator bernie sanders to a vocal backer of republican donald trump  fairbanks said in an interview with reuters that sputnik had not told her to advocate for trump  now president elect  she said she was swayed by trump s opposition to overseas wars and international trade agreements   i did my best to push for him   fairbanks said   but that was of my free will   a woman in her thirties with more than   twitter followers  fairbanks was an activist with the hacking movement known as anonymous before she joined sputnik     the day before the election  fairbanks said on a youtube channel that it was  pretty likely  that the authors of emails hacked from the account of democratic candidate hillary clinton s campaign manager john podesta were using code words for pedophilia when they spoke about pizza   the assertion fed the falsehood that clinton supporters were operating a child sex ring out of a washington based pizza parlor  the channel  with   million subscribers  was run by alex jones  a radio host who has said the   attacks were an  inside job   joe fionda  a veteran of the occupy protests who worked briefly for sputnik in   said the organization s articles and social media efforts overall were aimed at praising russian president vladimir putin s allies such as syria and dwelling on negative news in the united states  including police misconduct  some u s  officials and political analysts have said putin could believe businessman trump would be friendlier to russia than clinton  especially when it came to economic sanctions  fionda said spreading hacked emails was a priority at sputnik  he said his job included trying to create viral memes on a facebook page called mutinous media  which did not list a sputnik connection  former workers of the democratic national committee  one of the groups infiltrated by russian backed hackers  said the u s  government should consider providing funding for the technological defense of major political parties  they said that once hacked emails began appearing online  party functionaries were constantly behind in responding   they also said that the staff of democratic president barack obama had been overly concerned about not appearing to defend its own party s candidate  obama has asked spy agencies to deliver an analysis of russian meddling in the election that will include discussion of propaganda operations  office of the director of national intelligence general counsel robert litt told reuters  asked on tuesday whether he thought the u s  government had been caught off guard  litt said   i m not touching this with an  foot pole  it is a very important issue that the intelligence community is looking at very carefully  and it will issue a report in due time
