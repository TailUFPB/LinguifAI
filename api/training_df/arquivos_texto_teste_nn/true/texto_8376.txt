 reuters    mylan nv said on thursday it would reduce the out of pocket costs of its emergency epipen allergy injection for some patients amid a wave of criticism from lawmakers and the public over the product s rapidly escalating price  the list price of the drug will remain the same  but the company said it would increase the maximum copay assistance program to   from   for patients who pay for the  pak in cash or who are covered by a commercial health insurer  the price of epipen has skyrocketed to   from   since it was acquired by mylan in    mylan also said it is doubling the eligibility for its patient assistance program  which will eliminate out of pocket costs for uninsured and under insured patients and families  government paid programs are not eligible for the copay assistance program  ronny gal  an analyst with bernstein  said when all is said and done he estimates a total price reduction for epipen of  percent  the price rose  percent in the second quarter of  versus the same quarter a year ago   thus we are basically rolling back the increase of the past year   he said   in all  we estimate that today s news results in a   percent hit on epipen revenues   he expects that to translate into a   percent hit to mylan s earnings per share over the next few years  he estimates the company will earn    a share in  and    in   mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases  valeant pharmaceuticals international inc and turing pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases  presidential candidate hillary clinton  who has spoken out against escalating drug prices   welcomes the fact that mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families   tyrone gayle  a campaign spokesman  said in a statement  however  he added   discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of epipens are insufficient  because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums   clinton s view was echoed by democratic lawmakers  including rep  elijah cummings  who said mylan s move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug   offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases   he said in a statement   nobody is buying this pr move any more   mylan chief executive heather bresch  defending the price in an interview on thursday on cnbc  said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving epipen  including making its needle invisible  since acquiring the device from german generic drugmaker merck kgaa    when we picked up this product  they  merck  weren t spending a dollar on it   said bresch   bresch said mylan recoups less than half of epipen s list price because pharmacy benefit managers  which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers  are involved  along with insurers and others  democratic u s  senator amy klobuchar said mylan s action was a  welcome relief  to many who are struggling to afford the medication  but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs  earlier this year  clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs  making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected  on wednesday  clinton pressed mylan to voluntarily cut the epipen price  sending the company s share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks  mylan shares fell more than  percent this week before rising   percent on thursday after announcement of the discount program  epipens are preloaded injections of epinephrine  adrenaline  used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated  anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen  which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees  certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction  symptoms include itching  swelling of the lips  tongue and roof of the mouth  tight chestedness and difficulty breathing  people who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an epipen  which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms       a group of lawmakers said on wednesday they had written the u s  food and drug administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the epipen  fda spokeswoman theresa eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter  and will respond directly to the congressional members   she noted that the fda does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices  bresch  daughter of democratic u s  senator joe manchin of west virginia  said she contacted members of congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an  unsustainable  drug pricing system  she said one of the calls was to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  r iowa   who recently wrote a letter to mylan asking for an explanation of big epipen price increases
