 reuters    when hewlett packard enterprise ceo meg whitman announced last week that she wouldn t vote for her party s presidential nominee  donald trump  she pledged to raise money for the democratic candidate  hillary clinton  and to urge like minded republicans to follow suit  she won t have to talk her fellow tech industry conservatives into spurning trump  they already have  his campaign has pulled in less than  percent of what republican nominee mitt romney had raised from tech donors by this point in the  race   but raising money for clinton may prove difficult  while the democrat has raised  times more than trump from tech donors so far  she has drawn less than half of what president barack obama had raised from tech employees by this point four years ago  and less than bernie sanders  her opponent in the democratic primary  collected before he left the race  tech industry employees   long a reliable source of presidential donations  especially for democrats   have refused to open their wallets for trump  and they ve been stingier than usual with clinton  too  according to an analysis performed for reuters by crowdpac  a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that analyzes campaign contribution data   trump and clinton together reported having received    million from tech workers as of june   compared with   million donated to president barack obama and his republican rival mitt romney through june   according to the crowdpac analysis  in   more than    million in tech donations had gone to obama and mccain by june   for a graphic tracking contributions from tech workers in the last three elections  see  tmsnrt rs  the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this story  the clinton campaign asked for the methodology of the crowdpac analysis but did not comment on its findings  to quantify the tech industry s political giving  crowdpac tallied contributions of more than     the federal election commission s reporting threshold   from donors who listed technology companies as their employers  as well as individuals who work in related roles  such as software engineers and venture capitalists  contributions to campaigns  super pacs and joint fundraising committees were included  the analysis may have missed people who work at small technology companies not yet recognized by crowdpac  as well as individuals who have given less than    technology firms lobby the government on a range of issues  from privacy and encryption to immigration and trade  and they have a strong interest in who sits in the oval office  but this year  campaign finance records and interviews with more than two dozen people in the industry suggest that many would be donors in silicon valley remain unwashed by either candidate   matt mcilwain  managing director of madrona venture group  gave money to romney in  and to republican marco rubio in year s presidential primary election  but he won t support either trump or clinton in the general election    candidates need to have that embrace of innovation and articulate how it is a road for anybody in our society   he said   i m not inspired by either of the major party candidates    democrats consistently draw more tech money than republicans  but the giving is unusually lopsided this year  trump has raised a mere    from  tech donors so far  clinton  by contrast  has raised    million from   individuals in the industry  according to crowdpac s analysis   at this point in   romney had raised    million and obama had raised    million  silicon valley republicans say trump s paltry donation totals are no surprise given his public statements attacking the tech industry   earlier this year  trump called for a boycott of apple products after the company stopped cooperating with federal law enforcement efforts to break into the password protected iphone of one attacker in the mass shooting in san bernardino  trump also accused amazon ceo jeff bezos of orchestrating an online retail monopoly   trump s positions on limiting immigration and free trade run counter to some of the industry s most basic interests  for clinton  having a long track record in politics is a liability with some donors in an industry that reveres innovation    she s an incremental technocrat  and for people who are used to taking on the world  that is not very inspiring   said gregory ferenstein  author of  the age of optimists   a book about politics and silicon valley  to be sure  clinton has many friends in silicon valley  and she has had considerably more success than trump in wooing deep pocket donors in the industry   venture capitalist john doerr  for example  has contributed    to the clinton campaign and affiliate super pacs and fundraising committees  and zynga co founder mark pincus has given     according to crowdpac  many in the valley reason that backing clinton is the surest way to thwart trump   we want to make it clear what the risks are of a trump presidency  but it s much more energizing to get excited about a candidate   box chief executive aaron levie said in an interview  some of obama s biggest silicon valley backers have yet to give money in this race  including pandora media chief executive tim westergren  who had donated    to obama and to fundraising committees and affiliated super pacs by june   and venture capitalist vinod khosla  who had given     according to a crowdpac analysis of donations  reliable gop donors  too  have held back  tiger global management founder charles coleman and venture capitalist marc andreessen   both of whom had given    to romney and affiliated super pacs and fundraising committees by june    had yet to donate by june   andreessen has endorsed clinton  westergren and khosla did not respond to requests for comment  coleman and andreessen declined to comment  carrie sheffield  founder of multimedia company bold  typically votes for republicans and donated to romney  but she says she won t give to   or vote for   trump    i don t think that he s fit for office   she said  both clinton and trump have also struggled to convert many donors who gave to their opponents in the primary   bernie sanders raised far more in tech donations during the primary than clinton  pulling in    million before leaving the primary race  most of it in small contributions   in the republican primary  marco rubio drew    million in tech donations  thanks to a handful of large gifts from top tech executives  including oracle s larry ellison  mark hurd and safra catz   josh smith  a sanders donor who does not plan to vote in the presidential election  said he was troubled by clinton s comments in a debate last year urging tech companies to work with law enforcement to prevent attacks  the remarks left some in the industry feeling that clinton would not protect their livelihoods and did not share their beliefs about  the sanctity of information   said smith  founder of code corps  which helps developers work on public software projects for social good   sanders donor xiaohoa michelle ching said she will vote for clinton  but has had trouble supporting a candidate who has been readying her path to the presidency for so long    i am not going to go out of my way  even with the threat of a trump presidency   said ching  who is chief executive of literator  an educational technology startup  ferenstein predicts that silicon valley donations to clinton will pick up    you ll see much more money from silicon valley flow to clinton toward the end of the race   he predicted   because people are scared of a president trump
