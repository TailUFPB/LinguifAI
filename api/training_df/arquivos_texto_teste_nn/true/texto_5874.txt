washington new york  reuters    president donald trump s order to restrict people from seven muslim majority countries from entering the united states sparked confusion and anger on saturday after immigrants and refugees were kept off flights and left stranded in airports  in his most sweeping decision since taking office a week ago  trump  a republican  put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other countries  civil rights and faith groups  activists and democratic politicians were furious and vowed to fight the order  capping a day of confusion and chaos and protests in several airports across the country  a federal judge in brooklyn  new york  granted a temporary reprieve  the american civil liberties union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the united states  supporters outside the brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in dallas  chicago  new york and elsewhere cheered the decision  but a bigger fight lay ahead  the court action does not reverse trump s order  which was criticized by some of america s closest allies  trump  a businessman who successfully tapped into american fears about terror attacks during his campaign  had promised what he called  extreme vetting  of immigrants and refugees from areas the white house said the u s  congress deemed to be high risk  he told reporters in the white house s oval office on saturday that his order was  not a muslim ban  and said the measures were long overdue   it s working out very nicely  you see it at the airports  you see it all over   trump said  along with syria  the ban affects travelers with passports from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  the department of homeland security said about  travelers had been affected by the order   of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the united states  another  were stopped by airlines before boarding  the order  affects a minor portion of international travelers   the department said in a statement  saying the measures  inconvenienced  less than  percent of travelers   the new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them  and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students  pegah rahmani    waited at washington s dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents  both iranian citizens with u s  green cards   they weren t treating them very well   she said  rahmani s grandfather is  and legally blind  her grandmother is  and recently had a stroke  they were released to loud cheers and cries  several democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges  and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination   i don t think anyone is going to take this lying down   said cleveland immigration lawyer david leopold   this is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming   the white house did not respond immediately to a request for comment   the department of homeland security said the order would stay in place   no foreign national in a foreign land  without ties to the united states  has any unfettered right to demand entry into the united states   the department statement said  mark krikorian  the director of the conservative center for immigration studies  called lawsuits challenging the order  last ditch efforts  that would only apply to a few individuals  and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win   the first amendment doesn t apply to foreigners living abroad  the law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants   krikorian said  some leaders from the u s  technology industry  a major employer of foreign workers  issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un american   this ban will impact many innocent people   said travis kalanick  chief executive of uber technologies inc uber ul  who said he would raise the issue at a white house meeting on friday  arab travelers in the middle east and north africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory  iran vowed to retaliate  sudan called the action  very unfortunate  after washington  lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism  a yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban  iraq s former ambassador to the united states  lukman faily  told reuters that trump s ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks  and could backfire   we have a strong partnership with u s   more so in the urgent fight against terrorism  this ban move will not help  and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership  faily said  allies in the united kingdom  france and germany were critical  canadian prime minister justin trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming syrian refugees  confusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules  some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival  however  senior administration officials said it would have been  reckless  to broadcast details of the order in advance  other officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case by case basis  airlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country  travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports  said houston immigration lawyer mana yegani  at chicago o hare international airport  brothers bardia and ayden noohi waited for four hours for their father kasra noohi   who has an iranian passport and a u s  green card   to be allowed through  they knew trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems   i didn t think he d actually do it   bardia noohi    said   a lot of politicians just talk   thousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo  melanie nezer of the hebrew immigrant aid society said she knew of roughly   who were booked to come to the united states next week  trump s order indefinitely bans refugees from syria  in a television interview  he said he would seek to prioritize christian refugees fleeing the war torn country  u s  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public  at the state department  a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order  which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the  national interest   however  a federal law enforcement official said   it s unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is
