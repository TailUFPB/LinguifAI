middletown  conn    two years ago  judy konopka and craig diangelo lost their jobs in the it department of what was then known as northeast utilities  a regional electricity provider  when the company decided to replace about  employees with guest workers from india  in order to receive a more lucrative separation package  they had to train their foreign replacements both here and overseas   both had trouble finding new work  konopka    is still looking  diangelo    is working as a contractor for a company that provides no benefits  making substantially less than he did before  he views himself as a victim of globalization  a casualty of offshoring and he credits donald trump  the presumptive republican presidential nominee who has cast himself as the champion of displaced and disaffected u s  workers  for bringing the issue to light    i ll vote for him   says diangelo  over dinner at a thai restaurant on this town s main street  two others at the table murmur in assent   he continues  his voice rising   i wasn t planning on retiring early  i wasn t planning on making    less  i ve had to cut back a lot  i basically live paycheck to paycheck     i could never vote for hillary clinton   diangelo says  citing clinton s support of the north american free trade agreement  passed while her husband  bill  was president  as well as her advocacy of the proposed trans pacific partnership  a trade pact that s still being negotiated by the obama administration   challenged by bernie sanders  clinton has since retracted her support of tpp   even konopka  who favors clinton  she calls trump  the biggest idiot    has to admit clinton s support of trade deals such as nafta gives her pause  when northeast utilities fired her after  years   i felt betrayed   konopka took advantage of a federal trade assistance program to improve her skills in web design  then discovered she couldn t compete with designers outside the country who were willing to work for much less  now  to get by  she sells vintage books on the web   it s starting to get really scary   she says   this presidential election is  purportedly  the year of the angry voter  with images of scuffles at trump rallies occupying cable news screens  but as befitting someone who lives in a place called middletown  konopka is more typical of voters  consumed by a stomach churning uncertainty  a vague sense of something lost  and an inescapable belief that an array of powerful forces corporations  politicians  government aren t looking out for them   economists and pundits have been struggling to explain why  with unemployment below  percent and a bounty of positive economic indicators  voters seem so dismayed  so distrustful  it might be something as simple as bargaining power   in his best known book  the art of the deal  trump advises every negotiator to  use your leverage   but increasingly  u s  workers  white and blue collar alike  feel they have none  they ve seen their power erode as they are tossed into a global labor pool  as companies consolidate and shed jobs to please wall street  as unions wither  state budgets tighten  technology advances and iconic brands such as nabisco pack up and move to mexico   the squeeze is on    there s a feeling among workers that not only are they replaceable  but that they will be replaced   says gary chaison  a professor of industrial relations at clark university in nearby worcester  massachusetts   that there is no security anymore  that someone is making a profit by letting them go     trump   he adds   has tapped into that very well    according to reuters ipsos polling   percent of trump supporters either have had to take a lower paying job in the last few years  have a family member who has had to do so  or have a family member whose home has been threatened by foreclosure  in a sign of how widespread the phenomenon has become   percent of clinton supporters reported the same dismal tally    people feel more insecure about trade than terrorism   chaison tells me   everyone knows someone who has lost their job    what bothers diangelo most is that he was let go by a company that still valued his skill just not him   the sad part is that my job is still there   he says   it didn t go away  i went away    none of this should feel particularly new  the united states has been bleeding middle class workers especially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors as long as bruce springsteen has been around to sing about it  candidates adorned with hard hats vowing to bring back factory jobs have become a set piece of modern politics   the united states has lost more than  million manufacturing jobs in the past  years as the trade deficit has mushroomed  according to the economic policy institute  a liberal think tank in washington  wage growth in almost all sectors has flatlined over that time  including for the bottom  percent of fouryear college graduates and growth overall has been anemic  at under  percent  and while the  million jobs vaporized in the flash of the great recession have been recovered  the majority of them are of lesser quality than the ones they replaced   perhaps most fundamentally  the relationship between employee and employer has shifted  workers  share of the pie has decreased substantially since the   when the country s corporate and industrial base began to erode  last year  workers  share dropped to   percent of corporate income  even as technology has made workforces more productive and efficient  u s  corporate profits  meantime  returned to pre recession levels in   workers  sense that the recovery is only partial  it helps employers more than it helps workers   chaison says   if workers  sense of slippage seems familiar  the way their discontent is rippling through our politics feels newly transformative  voters threw out the republicans running congress in   then two years later elected the first african american president  an outsider who vowed reform  souring on him  they replaced democrats then controlling congress with another set of republicans in  and   making governance as unstable as the business sector  in a period of war  terrorism and economic chaos  all that churn might best be viewed as a deeply frustrated electorate trying to use what little leverage they have to change a system they consider to be otherwise unaccountable   trump has been the main beneficiary of that frustration  he makes those in the crowd feel like they matter  that they finally have a bully of their own who can push back at what they view as an alliance of unprincipled corporate culture and an enabling government   you re looking at a situation where the jobs are being ripped out of our states  out of our country  like candy from a baby   trump said at a rally this spring   it has been trump  along with democrat sanders  who has pushed the issue of job losses to countries such as china  mexico and india to the forefront  trump has threatened to slap a tax on imports and tear up trade deals  in indiana earlier this year  he ripped air conditioner manufacturer carrier for announcing it would lay off   workers and move its operations to mexico  he gave nabisco the same treatment  pledging he would no longer eat oreos  he has slammed companies such as apple and boeing for their overseas operations  as well   few presidential candidates have such temerity to challenge well known american brands  but clearly it is resonating   they might not like everything he says  but they believe he says what he thinks   lewis gossett  president of the south carolina manufacturers alliance  told me last summer   i think we re repeating a time in history when the very rich are removed from the very poor    michael smith is one of the americans trump rallies for  smith was among  nabisco employees laid off at the bakery on chicago s south side earlier this year  after the company announced it was transferring some work to mexico  he got the news at  a m   it was   smith tells me   a dark night when all your livelihood passes in front of you  and you feel like you ve been given the royal shaft    smith operated the machines that wrapped oreo cookies and ritz crackers  with overtime  he could clear    a year  he s  and wasn t thinking he would have to re enter the job market   the day before  smith had shown up at a shareholders meeting in chicago to confront irene rosenfeld  the chief executive of mondelez international  the holding company that oversees the nabisco brand  about the move to mexico  while sympathetic  rosenfeld said it was her duty to maximize the corporation s value to its shareholders worldwide by cutting costs    there are two types of ceo mindsets   smith responded   those who care about shareholders and those who care about the shareholders and the people    in our conversation  smith didn t begrudge the company s legal right to relocate the jobs  but he questions a ceo who earned more than   million in compensation over the last two years exhorting the virtues of cost cutting to a room full of laid off blue collar workers   that s not good citizenship   he says   wealth comes from the workers  that profitability comes from us    clinton met with a small group of the nabisco workers in march  the day before the illinois primary  but the visit didn t leave smith with much hope that as president she could do much either for the workers  situation or to reverse the demands of a globalized economy  in part  that s due to clinton s support of nafta  which smith terms an  infection   but also because of the lobbying might of mondelez  a   billion company  and other big corporations   smith is the unusual american voter who says he hasn t decided between clinton and trump  he ll focus on the election later  first  he has to keep his household afloat and his daughter in school at columbia college in chicago  he has six months  salary to cushion him   he s trying to stay optimistic about finding work  saying his wife and daughter are counting on him  but  he concedes   i think i have been a little bit in denial  even people of faith have bouts of depression    angela valero gives a one word reply when i ask her about a potential clinton trump matchup   ugh   i might as well be asking about who s going to win the next regatta on mars  so far is the election from her daily concerns   valero s dream job was to be a corrections officer  she was finally hired on by the state of connecticut last fall  the single mother of an  year old girl thought that  at last  she had a reliable  stable position with benefits   but after completing an academy training course and being posted as a guard at the state maximum security facility in nearby uncasville  she found out this spring that she was being laid off  a consequence of a decision made by connecticut s democratic governor  dannel malloy  and the state legislature to not raise taxes on the wealthy to cover a budget shortfall  lawmakers worried that the state s richest residents would relocate to florida  which has no state income tax  or other states with lower taxes   during the downturn  connecticut lost a bevy of high paying jobs in the financial services sector in the corporate hub of stamford and elsewhere  the jobs created during the recovery were less lucrative  resulting in lower tax revenue  in addition  the state was spooked when general electric  responding to an effort by the legislature to raise business taxes  announced it was relocating its headquarters from fairfield to boston  aetna  the health insurer based in hartford  also threatened to leave the state   that shelved any notion of new taxes  the state looked to trim its public workforce instead   easy targets   says lori pelletier  president of the state afl cio   rape counselors  child service workers  prison guards began receiving pink slips  ultimately    or more state workers could be let go  pelletier contrasted that with the  jobs ge is moving to boston something that drew substantial media attention   the state of massachusetts and the city of boston helped recruit ge with a generous benefit package  including   million in property tax relief for a corporation that critics have long held pays little in u s  taxes   angela last year paid more taxes than ge   pelletier says   and she s the one losing her job    valero tells me she has little faith that anyone in washington can help her  she doesn t sleep more than four hours a night  kept up by worrying about paying the electric bill and keeping her house  she has no idea whether she ll ever be recalled to work   throughout the interview  she stays stoic  determined  like the corrections office she was trained to be  only at the end of our conversation does she slip a bit   i held back the tears   she says with relief   ron ozer greets me at the door with the sheepishness of someone who isn t used to being at home during the workday  ozer    was laid off from dupont co  in january after a  year career  a ph d in chemical engineering  he has more than  patents to his name  he worked on long term projects at the dupont experimental station in wilmington  delaware  one of the more storied research facilities in the country  where products such as nylon  lycra and kevlar were created    some of the great developments in american industry came out of that site   ozer says   it was a time when america was growing so dramatically    but a lack of growth and pressure from investors forced dupont to announce a merger with another giant  dow chemical  in advance of the merger  it has begun to shed jobs  in delaware alone  dupont plans to dump   workers many in the area of long term research  which can be expensive without yielding immediate rewards to shareholders  ozer s group was eviscerated   the   billion merger of dupont and dow blends two u s  companies that date back to the  century  barry lynn  an economist at the new america think tank  says that industry consolidation chills the labor market  sapping demand for skilled workers such as ozer  dominant companies can use their market power to charge customers more or make suppliers pay less all without having to grow and create jobs to survive  indeed  the push from wall street is to cull and cut  not grow  and when companies do expand today it s largely through acquisition  not investment    that s a huge amount of the energy that s behind trump   lynn says   the sense of power being consolidated and being out of control and harming me and my family and my community    ozer will try to take advantage of his contacts at dupont to become a consultant  but admits that s a gamble  asked if he thinks he can replicate the six figure salary he enjoyed at dupont  he laughs   i m not confident of that    his chief concern is his two daughters  both of whom are out of college  in order to give his youngest a leg up in the market  he sent her to private haverford college in pennsylvania  tuition      going deep into debt to do so   i have a lot of possibilities  but i need things to start turning into dollars soon   he says   for sara blackwell  representing u s  workers displaced by the federal  b visa program began as a gig  now  it s a full blown cause   the tampa lawyer has been giving away clients who would distract her from her work  she jokes she s stopped sleeping and exercising  recently  she launched a website called protectusworkers com   i speak to an average of  people a day who are victims of this   she tells me   the more i learn about this  the more i have to fight    she began by representing it workers at walt disney world in florida who were replaced by guest workers from india brought in on temporary visas by outsourcing firms that contracted with disney  she has filed a long shot conspiracy lawsuit in federal court   blackwell contends that the practice of outsourcing low end  back office it jobs to cut costs has become endemic  globalization  she says  is systematically lowering the standard of living of american workers   it s a race to the bottom   she says   the disney case garnered the attention of some in the u s  senate  including jeff sessions  a republican from alabama who now is at the forefront of a fight against the american tech industry  which wants to expand the guest worker program citing a lack of domestic qualified engineers and programmers   but those tech companies are at the back of the line  according to ron hira  a professor at howard university who tracks applications  outsourcing firms have been crowding out tech companies in the race to acquire the highly coveted  b visas  which are capped at   a year   sessions  who is also a fierce opponent of immigration reform  was one of the first u s  politicians to embrace trump and blackwell has spoken out against the program at several trump rallies   she also has consulted with the outsourced employees who worked at northeast utilities in connecticut  including craig diangelo   part of diangelo s frustration and part of what is driving him toward trump is that washington has done so little to curb what he views as abuses of the  b program  there is a greater push now on capitol hill to broaden the program rather than rein it in   there s nobody to help us   he tells me   there s nobody to say you can t do this    richard blumenthal  a u s  senator from connecticut  has been part of efforts to expand the program  but also to reform it   it s a desperately serious problem   he says   he told me that even though there is some bipartisan consensus on reform  efforts still aren t moving forward  consumed by the same paralysis that s stalling everything else    there are powerful forces against us   blumenthal says   including the companies that exploit these programs    to diangelo  that s the dilemma of the modern  middle class voter  he worked hard for years  lost his job when his only transgression was being too old and making too much money  was humiliated when he had to train his replacement  and then watched how state and federal politicians have been able to do nothing to help him   why shouldn t he support donald trump  what s worth preserving  he s a tech worker  sipping pinot grigio over pad thai  he s no militant or conspiracist  yet      there is going to be an uprising   he says   people are starting to say   i ve had enough of this  i ve really had enough      this report first appeared in  the
