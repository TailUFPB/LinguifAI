washington  reuters    president barack obama exhorted fellow democrats on wednesday to preserve his legacy defining healthcare law as republicans moved ahead with their long sought bid to scrap it in what vice president elect mike pence called the  first order of business  of donald trump s administration  the emerging democratic strategy is to warn that republicans risk throwing the entire u s  healthcare system into chaos by moving to dismantle the  affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  without a plan to replace it   republicans argue the system is already broken and that they will help more people gain coverage by repealing the law while working to minimize disruptions to those who depend on it  both obama and pence visited capitol hill for closed door discussions on obamacare  pence  the indiana governor and a former member of the u s  house of representatives  met republican lawmakers to plot the path forward on scuttling the law    the first order of business is to keep our promise to repeal obamacare and replace it with the kind of healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government   pence told a news conference  down the hall from pence  obama  who hands over the presidency to trump on jan    urged democratic lawmakers to protect his signature domestic policy measure  he told reporters his message was   look out for the american people   democrats acknowledge they lack the votes needed to stop repeal legislation being pushed by republicans  who will control the white house and both chambers of congress when trump takes office  but they are warning of the risks of the repeal legislation in hopes of spurring a public backlash against it  without a replacement by republicans  as early as   the roughly  million people who gained insurance under the law could see their coverage in jeopardy   the republican plan to cut healthcare wouldn t  make america great again    senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters  invoking trump s campaign slogan   it would make america sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care   since the law was enacted  republicans in congress have voted more than  times to try to repeal all or part of it and conservatives have filed suits to try to invalidate it  republicans criticize obamacare as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by adding burdens on businesses  republicans on wednesday stepped up their rhetorical attack on obamacare  with house speaker paul ryan saying the law ruined the american healthcare system  trump wrote on twitter that republicans  must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster  with its poor coverage and massive premium increases      pence said trump would work with congressional leaders for a  smooth transition to a market based healthcare reform system  through legislative and executive action      republicans have offered few details  however  on what a replacement for obamacare would look like  ryan said lawmakers would take action that did not  pull the rug out from anybody  and that the party had  plenty of ideas   democratic senator debbie stabenow said republicans were  pulling the string that s going to unravel the whole  healthcare  system   schumer said any effort by republicans to shift the blame to democrats would fail   they want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us  not going to happen  it s their responsibility  plain and simple    the house republican study committee  composed of the most conservative members of the chamber  signaled they were aware of the risk of appearing not to have a plan and filed a bill on wednesday that could constitute a replacement  house republicans last year offered a proposal that would  among other things  provide refundable tax credits to help people afford their medical insurance premiums  obamacare helped people obtain insurance by increasing funding to states to expand the medicaid healthcare program for the poor and providing government subsidies to help people obtain coverage from private insurers through government run exchanges  republican senator rand paul  who is a doctor  joined the democrats in voting against beginning consideration of the obamacare repeal resolution  while paul said he supported repealing the law  he added the current proposal would increase the government debt by    trillion in the next  years    is that really what the republican party represents   paul said during senate floor debate  the united states has a more complicated healthcare system than some other rich nations whose governments provide medical coverage  many americans get health insurance through their employers  others buy policies directly from private insurers or are eligible for government run programs for elderly and low income people  about  million had no medical insurance in   according to the most recent government statistics  the u s  population tops  million people  trump has vowed to protect some popular parts of obamacare  such as barring insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions
