caracas  reuters    in a curious convergence of events on the same day last week  four venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings  state governors quickly hit twitter to celebrate  then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement  opposition hopes for a referendum to recall president nicolas maduro were dashed  on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive  the vote was off  for many in the opposition  that settled a years old debate about the nature of venezuela s socialist government  uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship  their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the south american opec member of  million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis   can anyone in the world now really doubt that venezuela is living in tyranny   said housewife mabel pinate    dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against maduro on wednesday   we are sick of this  it s time to toughen up and do what we must to save venezuela   added pinate  whose husband was fired from state oil company pdvsa by maduro s predecessor hugo chavez and whose two children have gone abroad  after pinning its hopes on a referendum this year   which could have triggered a presidential election and put them in power after  years of leftist rule   the enraged opposition democratic unity coalition has taken its gloves off  it is holding a symbolic political trial of maduro in the legislature  organizing daily street protests  and shunning talks with the government that had been announced by the vatican for this weekend   recalling tactics that led to a short lived coup against chavez in  and a shutdown of the oil industry  the coalition has also called for a general strike on friday and a march to the miraflores presidential palace next week    we ve reached the limit   said henrique capriles  a usually moderate opposition leader  calling the government  satan    does the opposition have anything to negotiate with the government  nothing  why does the government want dialogue  because the water has risen to its neck   he said   some hardliners  most notably veteran activist maria corina machado and jailed protest leader leopoldo lopez  wife lilian tintori  are calling for gandhi style civil disobedience   the government is vowing an iron fist  it says well known troublemakers  who were behind the  putsch  are again seeking a coup against an elected government  with the help of the united states and compliant foreign media   i fear nobody and nothing   maduro told red shirted supporters at one of his daily rallies and tv appearances this week  the ruling socialist party s no    diosdado cabello said any companies heeding the strike call would be seized by workers and the military   we re not going to allow craziness   long proud of its democratic credentials after winning numerous elections under chavez  the ruling socialist party says it is the opposition flouting venezuela s democracy given that independent institutions shot down the referendum  officials also argue that the very existence of protests and virulent public criticism of maduro prove democracy is alive and well in venezuela  maduro insists the referendum decision was made by independent judges and electoral officials based on technical criteria  and denies the socialist party had any sway over the result  but critics say both the judiciary and electoral council have long been in the government s pocket  the supreme court has repeatedly shot down legislation  passed by the opposition dominated congress while interpreting the constitution to favor the executive branch and limit the reach of lawmakers  and the elections council has steadily shifted the requirements for requesting the recall vote  maduro would have faced probable defeat and removal from power if the referendum had gone ahead   his challenge now is to contain street protests and respond to deep anger among all venezuelans at the dreadful state of the economy  food shortages  long shopping lines and runaway prices have eroded the ruling  chavismo  movement s popularity among the poor and seen maduro s ratings slide to just over  percent   but as unhappy as they are  disaffected former  chavistas  are not yet ready to throw their lot in en masse with coalition leaders they still view with suspicion   they are all from privileged families  how can they represent me   said orlando diaz    a mechanic and father of four from a slum in western caracas who has seen work dry up and income tumble during a nearly three year recession   do i hate maduro  yes  he has betrayed the comandante  chavez   he is a fool  will i join these people in their crying and marching  no way  frankly  i don t know where to turn  i don t see a future  i just have to find bread for my family today and tomorrow  that s all i think about   the opposition s challenge is how to incorporate people like diaz and his neighbors from the gritty hillside antimano  barrio   into their street push  on wednesday  they drew hundreds of thousands nationwide  but students and traditional supporters remained at the vanguard  scores of people on both sides were killed during anti maduro protests in  and there was new violence on wednesday  with dozens of injuries and arrests  a policemen was shot dead in an incident the government blamed on demonstrators    a recall referendum in  would have meant the automatic exit from power of  chavismo    said local pollster luis vicente leon   eschewing democratic codes and values  the government preferred to assume     the risk of a popular reaction   the next presidential election is due at the end of  and most venezuelans assume another candidate will emerge from within  chavismo  instead of maduro  but given the events of recent days  opposition supporters are beginning to wonder if that election will even take place
