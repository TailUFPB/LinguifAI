west palm beach  fla  moscow  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump upped the stakes on friday in a back and forth exchange with president vladimir putin over nuclear weapons that tested the republican s promises to improve relations with russia    offering a glimpse of how he might conduct diplomacy after taking office on jan    trump reportedly welcomed a nuclear arms race with russia and china and boasted that the united states would win it      msnbc host mika brzezinski said trump told her in an off air phone call   let it be an arms race  we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all   the television station did not play his comments on air         it was the second brusque comment about atomic weapons in two days from the new york businessman that alarmed nuclear non proliferation experts worried about fueling global tension  the broadsides from trump s resort in florida appeared to be aimed mostly at putin even though the two men have vowed to patch up relations between their countries once the republican enters the white house  trump tweeted unexpectedly on thursday that   the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes   but gave no further details  that comment appeared to be a response to putin who said earlier on thursday that russia needed to  strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces       russia and the united states are at odds over syria s civil war and ukraine but cold war style nuclear tensions have greatly eased in recent years  moscow and washington signed the new start nuclear treaty in  which reduced strategic weapons and delivery systems   putin  accused by the obama administration of overseeing a wave of cyber attacks against u s  political organizations during the presidential campaign  said on friday he had no interest in competing with the u s  nuclear weapon program   if anyone is unleashing an arms race it s not us     we will never spend resources on an arms race that we can t afford   he said at a news conference  the russian president said he was surprised by state department comments that the u s  military is the most powerful in the world   nobody is arguing with that   putin said   he said he did not regard the united states as a potential aggressor and said he saw nothing new or remarkable about trump s own statement about wanting to expand u s  nuclear capabilities             the united states is in the midst of a   trillion   year modernization of its aging nuclear arsenal and replacement of its ballistic missile submarines  bombers and land based missiles  it is a price tag that most experts say the united states can ill afford      russia  also bound by new start limits  is carrying out its own costly modernization program but is not expanding its warhead stockpile  trump spokesman sean spicer said the president elect s nuclear comments were meant to send a general message of strength to countries like russia and china rather than indicate the united states planned to build up its nuclear capabilities      he is going to do what it takes to protect this country and if another country or countries want to threaten our safety and sovereignty  he is going to do what it takes   spicer said oncnn  trump was elected president unexpectedly last month partly on a platform of building up the u s  military but he also pledged to cut taxes and control federal spending    his nuclear comments suggest that improving relations with moscow might not be easy   trump on friday released what he said was  a very nice letter  from putin dated dec   in which the russian leader sought bilateral cooperation and a  new level  of relations  in an accompanying statement  trump said he hoped both countries could  live up to these thoughts  rather than  have to travel an alternative path             the obama administration has accused russia of trying to interfere with the u s  election by hacking democratic party accounts  information from those hacks was leaked online  causing political problems for democratic candidate hillary clinton      putin dismissed suggestions moscow had helped trump to victory   the current administration and the leadership of the democratic party are trying to blame all their failures on external factors   he said at his friday news conference      we are talking about  a party which has clearly forgotten the original meaning of its own name  they  the democrats  are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame  in my view this  how shall i say it  degrades their own dignity  you have to know how to lose with dignity   trump expressed his agreement with putin s view of the democrats   so true   trump tweeted friday evening  putin  who spoke positively of trump before his election win  said that only moscow had believed in his victory   trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end  when nobody believed in him   putin said  adding with a smile   except for you and me
