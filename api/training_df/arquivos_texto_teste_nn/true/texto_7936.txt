washington  reuters    new york s attorney general ordered republican presidential nominee donald trump s charitable foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state  warning that a failure to do so would be a  continuing fraud   for trump  the cease and desist order was the latest in a series of blows that has sent his campaign reeling  the new york businessman and his aides spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from a new york times report that said trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for almost  years  new york attorney general eric schneiderman s office said the donald j  trump foundation was violating a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the office s charities bureau  the order followed a series of reports in the washington post that suggested improprieties by the foundation  including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving trump businesses   the failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under article  a with the charities bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of new york   according to a letter dated on friday that the office posted online on monday  trump s campaign has suggested that the probe launched by schneiderman  a democrat  was politically motivated  while again putting trump s campaign on the defensive  the order could also undercut his efforts to make the clinton foundation  the family charity of democratic presidential rival hillary clinton  a primary target in his campaign against her for the nov   election  trump has sought to paint the clinton foundation as a  pay to play  operation under which the former u s  secretary of state and her husband  former president bill clinton  rewarded big donors to the foundation with access  the clinton foundation  which has   million in assets and almost  staffers  is a radically different charitable vehicle from the small scale trump nonprofit  it has worked to reduce the cost of drugs for people with hiv in developing countries  eradicate childhood obesity in the united states and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  there has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the state department while clinton headed the agency  while some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior state department officials  clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them  the scrutiny of the trump foundation came as the republican candidate was dealing with a torrent of bad news  including his shaky performance in his first debate with clinton on sept   and the release by the new york times of tax records that showed trump taking an almost   billion loss in  that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to  years  in its series on the trump foundation  the washington post reported that trump may have violated u s  internal revenue service rules against  self dealing  by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself  which were then hung at his private golf clubs in new york and florida  the newspaper also said that trump may have improperly used the foundation to settle legal disputes  including one at his palm beach  florida  estate  diverted income from his business to the charity to avoid paying income tax  and donated foundation money to support florida attorney general pam bondi  a republican  who was considering launching an investigation into trump university  trump s for profit education venture  the foundation ended up paying a    fine to the irs for that donation  a trump organization representative told the post the donation was meant to be from trump s personal account  and that it came from his foundation s account by clerical error  in response to the post s reporting  schneiderman s office began a probe into the trump foundation  the trump campaign said in a statement on monday that the charity would cooperate with the investigation   while we remain very concerned about the political motives behind ag schneiderman s investigation  the trump foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation   said trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks   because this is an ongoing legal matter  the trump foundation will not comment further at this time   she added  the new york attorney general s office is the sole regulator of charities in the state  a spokesman for the office said it was not unusual for the regulator to send notices to charities whose filings were overdue or incomplete but that a cease and desist letter was more serious  while letters such as the one the trump foundation  which is based in woodbury  new york  on long island  received are not judgments of wrongdoing  they are sent only after the office gets  a clear indication of wrongdoing   the spokesman said  trump established the charitable foundation in   but it runs no programs of its own  instead  it donates money to other nonprofit groups such as the police athletic league for youths  once the foundation began soliciting money from other donors beyond the trump family  it was required by new york law to register with the state and file regular reports
