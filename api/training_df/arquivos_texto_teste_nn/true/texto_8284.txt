washington new york  reuters    hillary clinton said on friday that if elected to the white house she would create an oversight panel to protect u s  consumers from large price hikes on long available  lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary  adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices  clinton  the democratic presidential candidate  would seek to give the panel an  aggressive new set of enforcement tools   including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an  unjustified  outlier price increase  on a long available or generic drug  her campaign said   over the past year  we ve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long standing  life saving treatments with little or no new innovation or r d   clinton said in a statement  if clinton defeats republican rival donald trump in the nov   election  she would need the support of the u s  congress to implement key measures of her proposal  which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago  even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies  it could be difficult to get republican lawmakers on board  morningstar analyst damien conover said  adding that a  republican congress would push back hard on this   clinton s campaign cited turing pharmaceuticals llc s raising the price of its aids drug daraprim  pyrimethamine  and mylan nv s repeated steep price increases on epipen for severe allergy sufferers as  troubling  examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny  conover said clinton s plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall  drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies  the arca pharmaceutical index of large u s  and european drugmakers rose   percent on friday  in line with gains for the broad stock market  shares of mylan fell   percent to    on the nasdaq  the nasdaq biotech index slipped   percent  the decline was slight compared to the more than   percent drop in the index seen on sept      when clinton blasted  price gouging  in the specialty drug market on twitter  responding to reports that turing had acquired daraprim  an older antibiotic  and then hiked its price by   percent   soon afterward  clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs  including allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs   her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out of pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions  it aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products  and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising  dr  peter bach  the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at new york s memorial sloan kettering cancer center  said clinton s announcement on friday was a  flag  for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes   it s a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition   bach said  saying the campaign was focusing on a  sub category  of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug  bach said he was contacted by the clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity  the oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase  the manufacturer s production cost and the treatment s relative value to patients and public health  clinton s campaign said  terry haines  head of political analysis for evercore isi  said clinton s proposed panel had little hope of getting through congress   but clinton  if elected  might be able to achieve price reform via changes to medicare s prescription drug benefit  known as medicare part d  if she works with congress to reform the affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  haines said  in that event  haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come  under sustained headline risk in  as aca reforms are discussed           in cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition  clinton s administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the united states  dr  aaron kesselheim  an associate professor at harvard medical school  called it a  bold idea  to get the federal government  involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets   until recently  there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the u s  food and drug administration  although the wait time has shortened  there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the u s  market  kesselheim said   having the government get involved as a long term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market   he said  kesselheim has testified before congress about high cost generic and long available drugs and spoke to clinton s campaign about his research as it developed its proposals
