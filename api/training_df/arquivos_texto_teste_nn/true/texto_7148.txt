washington  reuters    former republican presidential nominee mitt romney is under  active consideration  to serve as u s  secretary of state along with other candidates  vice president elect mike pence said on  fox news sunday    romney  who met president elect donald trump on saturday  was a critic of trump during the campaign  pence said that romney was willing to be considered for the position  trump was  very grateful that governor mitt romney came in  they had a good meeting  it was a warm and a substantive exchange and i know he is under active consideration to be secretary of state    along with some other distinguished americans    but democrats were skeptical that romney is an actual contender  representative adam schiff  a california democrat  said on cnn sunday that he would love romney to get the position and he would be a  consummate diplomat    but i think it s a total head fake  i think this is donald trump still being the entertainer  still running a show where he wants to build suspense and he alone knows who the contestant will be the winner  it s more of a nod to the appearance of bringing people together
