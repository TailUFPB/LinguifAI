for young blacks trying to start businesses and create jobs in their communities  the new york businessman  who trails democrat hillary clinton in national opinion polls and is struggling to appeal to

formal opening in washington of a trump international hotel just blocks from the white house  trump s detour from the campaign trail to plug his business drew criticism from some fellow republicans  but the former reality tv star said the project  completed  under budget and ahead of schedule   showed what he could accomplish if elected president  his democratic rival  clinton  said   donald trump is actually paying more attention to his business than to the campaign  that s his choice  but we re going to keep working really hard to reach as many voters as possible   speaking to reporters during a flight to new york after campaigning in florida  clinton also said the proposed merger of at t inc and time warner inc  raises questions and concerns and they should be looked into   in charlotte  trump provided few details of   century glass steagall   which would build on the  depression era law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking  glass steagall was repealed in  under then president bill clinton  hillary clinton s husband  the  financial crisis prompted an overhaul of banking rules with the passage in  of  dodd frank  wall street reforms that many republicans have criticized   dodd frank has been a disaster  making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need   trump said  trump  speaking to a mostly white audience after meeting with black religious leaders  said he would step up the police presence in u s  cities so that  every poor african american child  can walk on the streets in safety   safety is a civil right  the problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police   he said  last month  hundreds of demonstrators protested in charlotte after the release of videos showing the fatal shooting of a black man by police officers  while trump s speech stuck mainly to policy initiatives  he also got in a jab at clinton   honestly  she has less energy than jeb bush   trump said  criticizing clinton s stamina and harking back to his charges that bush  a former rival for the republican nomination  was  low energy   clinton told reporters that  there was not an ounce of complacency  in her campaign and said that if elected  she would reach out to republicans and independents  including congressional leaders   both before the inauguration and to continue afterwards   before trump s charlotte speech  much of wednesday s media attention focused on trump s appearance at his new   room luxury hotel  republican strategist steve schmidt  who led  republican presidential nominee john mccain s unsuccessful campaign  said the hotel stop was the latest inexplicable act from trump and atypical behavior for someone trying to win the white house       the walls are collapsing   schmidt told msnbc in an interview   he is not doing any of the normal activities that you d be doing  days out in a presidential race for somebody who s competitive  you don t take a time out to tend to your business interests   trump  making his first run for elected office  often highlights his business accomplishments and has held numerous events at his properties since launching his white house bid last year  including a trip to scotland to open a refurbished golf resort in june  asked after the event why he was in washington instead of campaigning in a battleground state  trump told cnn it was  a very rude question  and said he worked hard on the trail every day   i can t take one hour off to cut a ribbon at one of the great hotels of the world  i mean  i think i m entitled to it   trump told abc news  he said there was a double standard  noting that clinton was not criticized for taking time to see the singer adele in concert on tuesday night  clinton campaigned on wednesday in florida  where many opinion polls show a tight race  an average of florida polls compiled by realclearpolitics showed clinton at   percent compared with   percent for trump in a race including third party candidates  clinton has a strong lead in the race to secure the  electoral college votes   or tally of wins from the states   needed to capture the white house  according to results from reuters
