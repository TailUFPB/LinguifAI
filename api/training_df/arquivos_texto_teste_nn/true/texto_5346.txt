munich  reuters    u s  republican senators plan to introduce legislation to impose further sanctions on iran  accusing it of violating u n  security council resolutions by testing ballistic missiles and acting to  destabilise  the middle east  a u s  senator said sunday   i think it is now time for the congress to take iran on directly in terms of what they ve done outside the nuclear program   senator lindsey graham  a member of the senate armed services committee  told the munich security conference  graham said he and other republicans would introduce measures to hold iran accountable for its actions      tensions between tehran and washington have risen since an  iranian ballistic missile test that prompted u s  president donald trump s administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the country s revolutionary guards   iran is a bad actor in the greatest sense of the word when it comes to the region  to iran  i say  if you want us to treat you differently then stop building missiles  test firing them in defiance of u n  resolution and writing  death to israel  on the missile  that s a mixed message   graham said  iranian foreign minister mohammed javad zarif told the conference earlier on sunday that iran did not respond well to sanctions or threats  james jones  a former supreme allied commander in europe and president barack obama s first national security adviser  told a separate event in munich that he remained convinced that sanctions had persuaded iran to negotiate the  landmark deal with six world powers to curb its nuclear program   the sanctions did work  iran would never have come to the negotiating table without sanctions   jones said   this is a new form of response that if properly utilized can change behavior and get people to do things that they otherwise wouldn t do   senator christopher murphy  a member of the senate foreign relations committee  told the same panel there was nothing preventing congress from imposing sanctions beyond those that were lifted as a result of the  nuclear agreement with iran  murphy  a democrat  said had backed the nuclear deal in the explicit understanding that it would not prevent congress from taking actions against iran outside the nuclear issue   there s going to be a conversation about what the proportional response is   murphy said  referring to iran s missile test   but i don t necessarily think there s going to be partisan division over whether or not we have the ability as a congress to speak on issues outside of the nuclear agreement   murphy said the united states needed to decide whether it wanted to take a broader role in the regional conflict   we have to make a decision whether we are going to get involved in the emerging proxy war in a bigger way than we are today  between iran and saudi   he said
