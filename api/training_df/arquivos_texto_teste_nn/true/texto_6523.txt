 washington  reuters    in a wide ranging request for documents and analysis  president elect donald trump s transition team asked the department of homeland security last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction   the team also asked about the department s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the obama administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners  and it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties   don t miss  megyn kelly leaving fox news to join nbc reuters tv  trump fears grow in mexico valley where dollar is king the requests were made in a dec   meeting between trump s transition team and department of homeland security officials  according to an internal agency memo reviewed by reuters  the document offers a glimpse into the president elect s strategy for securing the u s  borders and reversing polices put in place by the obama administration    trump s transition team did not comment in response to reuters inquiries  a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security and u s  customs and border protection declined to comment        in response to the transition team request  u s  customs and border protection staffers identified more than  miles along the u s  mexico border  and about the same distance along the u s  canada border  where new fencing could be erected  according to a document seen by reuters       reuters could not determine whether the trump team is considering a northern border barrier  during the campaign  trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the u s  mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with canada   one program the transition team asked about  according to the email summary  was operation phalanx  an aerial surveillance program that authorizes   army national guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration   the program once deployed   airmen under president george w  bush but was downsized by barack obama  a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security         the transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since obama took office in   according to the memo summarizing the meeting       trump has said he intends to undo obama s executive actions on immigration  including a  order to allow children brought to the u s  illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work   the program  known as daca  collected information including participants  addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed  another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason  including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns  according to the internal memo seen by reuters       a department of homeland security official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect daca recipients and other migrants from deportation   on the campaign trail  trump vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants  a promise that may have prompted the transition team s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities       the internal memo summarizing the meeting between trump s transition team and u s  customs and border protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers   the department of homeland security official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders  u s  customs and border protection then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the u s  canada border   reuters reviewed a copy of the report  which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be    billion and cover  miles along border of canada and the states of washington  idaho  montana  new york  vermont  new hampshire and maine      adding  miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive  according to the estimate of    billion  because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing   pedestrian fences require more staff and would cost    million per mile versus    million per mile to build to build  according to the report   in fiscal year   the latest year for which data is available  border patrol agents apprehended   illegal migrants on the u s  canada border compared to   apprehended on the u s  mexico border
