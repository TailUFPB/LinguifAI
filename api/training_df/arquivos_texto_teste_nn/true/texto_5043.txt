 reuters    the state of hawaii requested emergency court intervention on wednesday to halt a revised executive order from president donald trump placing u s  entry restrictions on refugees and travelers from six muslim majority countries  arguing that the new travel ban violates the u s  constitution  the state asked a hawaii federal court to grant a temporary restraining order that should apply nationally  u s  district court judge derrick watson ruled earlier in the day that the state could sue over trump s new order  which was signed by the president on monday   it is the first legal challenge to the revised order  watson said the state could revise its initial lawsuit  which had challenged trump s original ban signed in january  a hearing is set for march   a day before the new ban is to go into effect   the government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks   some legal experts have said court challenges will be more difficult now because changes to the order give exemptions to more people   the revised travel order changed and replaced the original  more sweeping ban issued on jan   that caused chaos and protests at airports and was challenged in more than two dozen lawsuits around the country  a federal judge in seattle put the first order on hold  in a decision upheld by an appeals court in san francisco  the new order is much more narrowly tailored  it keeps a  day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen  but excludes iraq and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants  it also removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria   the order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders  and makes waivers possible for some business  diplomatic and other travelers   immigration advocates have said the new ban  like the original one  discriminates against muslims  but the first hurdle in a lawsuit is proving  standing  to sue  which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy  with so many exemptions  legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals that a court would rule have a right to sue  hawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty  it also says the island state s economy would be hit by a decline in tourism  the court papers cite reports that travel to the united states  took a nosedive  after trump s actions  the state was joined by a new plaintiff named ismail elshikh  an american citizen from egypt who is an imam at the muslim association of hawaii whose mother in law lives in syria  according to the lawsuit     this second executive order is infected with the same legal problems as the first order   the state said in court papers filed on tuesday  the president s order  is subjecting a portion of hawaii s population  including dr  elshikh  his family  and members of his mosque  to discrimination and second class treatment   hawaii said  the lawsuit says that elshikh fears his mother in law will not be able to enter the country under the new order   the family is devastated   the filing said   one of the groups eligible for waivers under the new ban are those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry   adam lauridsen  a san francisco attorney representing students challenging trump s first order  said the waiver provisions in the new ban are similar to case by case exemptions allowed in the first ban  earlier legal challenges were allowed to move forward despite those waivers  he said  in support of its actions  the trump administration has cited a section of law that says the president can suspend  entry to the united states by  any class  of foreigners if he finds it would be  detrimental to the interests  of the country
