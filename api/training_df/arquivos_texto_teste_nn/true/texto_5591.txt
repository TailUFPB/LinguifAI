washington houston  reuters    the u s  army will grant the final permit for the controversial dakota access oil pipeline after an order from president donald trump to expedite the project despite opposition from native american tribes and climate activists  in a court filing on tuesday  the army said that it would allow the final section of the line to tunnel under north dakota s lake oahe  part of the missouri river system  this could enable the    billion pipeline to begin operation as soon as june    energy transfer partners  etp n  is building the   mile    km  line to help move crude from the shale oilfields of north dakota to illinois en route to the gulf of mexico  where many u s  refineries are located  protests against the project last year drew drew thousands of people to the north dakota plains including native american tribes and environmental activists  and protest camps sprung up  the movement attracted high profile political and celebrity supporters  the permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipeline s completion  and tuesday s decision drew praise from supporters of the project and outrage from activists  including promises of a legal challenge from the standing rock sioux tribe   it s great to see this new administration following through on their promises and letting projects go forward to the benefit of american consumers and workers   said john stoody  spokesman for the association of oil pipe lines   the standing rock sioux  which contends the pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and potentially pollute its water source        vowed to shut pipeline operations down if construction is completed  without elaborating how it would do so  the tribe called on its supporters to protest in washington on march  rather than return to north dakota   as native peoples  we have been knocked down again  but we will get back up   the tribe said in the statement   we will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact  we call on the native nations of the united states to stand together  unite and fight back   former president barack obama s administration last year delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in december ordered an environmental study  less than two weeks after trump ordered a review of the permit request  the army said in a filing in district court in washington d c  it would cancel that study  the final permit  known as an easement  could come in as little as a day  according to the filing  there was no need for the environmental study as there was already enough information on the potential impact of the pipeline to grant the permit  robert speer  acting secretary of the u s  army  said in a statement  trump issued an order on jan   to expedite both the dakota access pipeline and to revive another controversial multibillion dollar oil artery  keystone xl  obama s administration blocked that project in   at the dakota access construction site  law enforcement and protesters clashed violently on several occasions throughout the fall  more than  people were arrested  and police were criticized for using water cannons in  degree fahrenheit  minus  degree celsius  weather against activists in late november    the granting of an easement  without any environmental review or tribal consultation  is not the end of this fight   said tom goldtooth  executive director of the indigenous environmental network  one of the primary groups protesting the line   it is the new beginning  expect mass resistance far beyond what trump has seen so far    any legal challenge is likely to be a difficult one for pipeline opponents as presidential authority to grant such permits is generally accepted in the courts  the tribe said in a statement the decision  wrongfully terminated  environmental study of the project  deborah sivas  professor of environmental law at stanford and director of stanford s environmental law clinic  said a challenge by the tribe would likely rely on the reasons the army corps itself gave for why more review was needed in december   the tribe will probably argue that an abrupt reversal without a sufficient explanation for why the additional analysis is not necessary is arbitrary and should  therefore  be set aside   she said in an email  supporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil    shares of energy transfer partners finished up  cents at     reversing earlier losses on the news
