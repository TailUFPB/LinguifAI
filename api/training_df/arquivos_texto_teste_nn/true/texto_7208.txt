washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  house of representatives have decided to pursue a short term measure to keep the government funded at current levels until march in order to give incoming president elect donald trump more of a say on budget and appropriations issues  lawmakers said on thursday  the decision  which surfaced as house republicans prepared to meet vice president elect mike pence  calls for replacing a funding measure that expires on dec   with a similar resolution that would run through march   lawmakers said the short term measure would allow trump to have greater input on setting funding priorities for the remainder of fiscal year   which ends on sept    i think the new  incoming government would like to have a say so on how spending is allocated   house speaker paul ryan told reporters   and so we are working with     the new trump administration on the timing of that on the continuing resolution   democrats and some republicans described the decision as a mistake that could lead to a more difficult appropriations task next year  representative hal rogers  who chairs the house appropriations committee  expressed disappointment at the decision  which suspends months of work by lawmakers and their staffs on full scale appropriations bills congress had intended to enact before year end   i am extremely hopeful that the new congress and the new administration will finish these bills   rogers said in a statement  adding that his panel would immediately begin working on the new measure  known as a continuing resolution  representative charlie dent  a republican member of rogers  committee  called the decision a mistake following an election in which democrats were able to increase their senate minority    it will be harder to pass an omnibus in march   dent said   and we ll have a smaller margin in the senate to help us  i d rather clear the decks for a new administration  but apparently the new administration would like to be able to put their imprint on this   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said the continuing resolution would only perpetuate uncertainty about government funding    they re making a big mistake for themselves  they re going to have a kettle of fish in march that they can t even imagine   she said  some conservative house republicans have sought a continuing resolution that would expire at the same time as the legislative limit on the government debt
