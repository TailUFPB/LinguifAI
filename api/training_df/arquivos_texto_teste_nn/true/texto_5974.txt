washington  reuters    president donald trump s push to create safe zones in syria could force him to make some risky decisions about how far to go to protect refugees  including shooting down syrian or russian aircraft or committing thousands of u s  troops  experts said  trump said on wednesday he  will absolutely do safe zones in syria  for refugees fleeing violence  according to a document seen by reuters  he is expected in the coming days to order the pentagon and the state department to draft a plan to create such zones in syria and nearby nations  the document did not spell out what would make a safe zone  safe  and whether it would protect refugees only from threats on the ground   such as jihadist fighters   or whether trump envisions a no fly zone policed by america and its allies  if it is a no fly zone  without negotiating some agreement with russia trump would have to decide whether to give the u s  military the authority to shoot down syrian or russian aircraft if they posed a threat to people in that zone  which his predecessor  former president barack obama  refused to do     this essentially boils down to a willingness to go to war to protect refugees   said jim phillips  a middle east expert at the heritage foundation think tank in washington  noting russia s advanced air defenses  trump promised during his campaign to target jihadists from islamic state  and he has sought to avoid being dragged deeper into syria s conflict   raising the question of whether he might be satisfied by assurances  perhaps from moscow  that neither russian nor syrian jets would target the zone  in moscow  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said trump did not consult with russia and warned that the consequences of such a plan  ought to be weighed up    it is important that this  the plan  does not exacerbate the situation with refugees   he said      phillips and other experts  including former u s  officials  said many refugees would not be satisfied by assurances from moscow  while any deal with syrian president bashar al assad  who also is backed by iran  might not go over well with america s arab allies  the pentagon declined comment on thursday  saying no formal directive to develop such plans had been handed down yet  and some u s  military officials appeared unaware of the document before seeing it described in the media on wednesday   our department right now is tasked with one thing in syria  and that is to degrade and defeat isis   said captain jeff davis  a pentagon spokesman  trump s call for a plan for safe zones is part of a larger directive expected to be signed in coming days that includes a temporary ban on most refugees to the united states and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries deemed to pose a terrorism threat  during and after the presidential campaign  trump called for no fly zones to harbor syrian refugees as an alternative to allowing them into the united states  trump accused the obama administration of failing to screen syrian immigrants entering the united states to ensure they had no militant ties  any safe zone in syria guaranteed by the united states would almost certainly require some degree of u s  military protection  securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops  former u s  officials and experts say  anthony cordesman  a military expert at the center for strategic and international studies think tank  cautioned that a safe zone inside syria could become a diplomatic albatross that would force a trump administration to juggle a host of ethnic and political tensions in syria indefinitely  other experts said jihadists could be attracted to the zone  either to carry out attacks that would embarrass the united states or to use the zone as a safe haven where militants could regroup   such a zone also would be expensive  given the need to house  feed  educate and provide medical care to the refugees   i think these people really have no idea what it takes to support   people  which is really a small number  in terms of the  internally displaced  and refugees  in syria  cordesman said  the draft document gave no details on what would constitute a safe zone  where one might be set up and who would defend it   jordan  turkey and other neighboring countries already host millions of syrian refugees  the turkish government pressed obama  without success  to create a no fly zone on syria s border with turkey but now is at odds with washington over its support for kurdish fighters in syria
