mexico city  reuters    irrespective of whether mexico s decision to extradite drug kingpin joaquin  chapo  guzman aimed to honor outgoing u s  president barack obama or appease his successor  donald trump  law enforcement from both countries say it bodes well for security cooperation  guzman  the feared boss of the sinaloa cartel who shot to international stardom after two jailbreaks  was extradited from a prison in northern mexico to new york on thursday  the eve of trump s inauguration  while some mexican government officials believed guzman s removal served as a valediction for obama s presidency  others saw it as an opening gambit in what are likely to be fraught trade negotiations with a seemingly unfriendly trump administration  but current and former law enforcement officials on both sides of the border said the move would boost security cooperation and could even upgrade relations   what happened today is something that s a victory for both mexico and the united states   said leo silva  who worked for the drug enforcement administration in the northern mexican city of monterrey until    this will obviously improve things   according to a senior u s  law enforcement official based in mexico  both u s  and mexican security forces were already  three steps ahead  in identifying the next chapo   from the mexico side  they work with us a lot  a lot more than people think   said the official  who was not authorized to speak with press   they think they re going to get more support from us  they re on line and i really don t see a huge change  if anything  an improvement   security cooperation has not always run smoothly  and mexico  with its proud  nationalist leanings  has often chafed at what it views as u s  intrusion in its affairs  silva said after vicente fox became president in   mexico gave less access to u s  law enforcement  however  fox s successor  felipe calderon  was more willing to accept u s  help  and silva said he could even pick up the phone and call then attorney general marisela morales  the election of the institutional revolutionary party s enrique pena nieto in  represented a fresh set back  with u s  officials initially kept at arm s length and a new attorney general appointed  jesus murillo karam  who silva called  standoffish   nonetheless  after a rocky start  relations soon warmed and u s  intelligence  particularly the u s  marshals who track fugitives  became a key component in many of the high profile busts that have taken place under pena nieto   it s similar to what we were doing and receiving under calderon  except that this current administration doesn t talk about it or publicize that they re working together   said one former dea agent who worked on mexican cases  after the victory of trump  who has threatened to rip up the north american free trade agreement  slap tariffs on u s  firms  manufacturing in mexico and deport millions of illegal immigrants  some speculated years of hard won security cooperation would fray as mexico sought to show it wouldn t be pushed around by the brash new yorker  but behind the bluster  law enforcement officials from both countries said that was unlikely to happen  and that the situation could even improve if trump  a law and order republican who has repeatedly voiced his support for police and soldiers  focused more on combating mexican cartels   the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential   trump said during his inauguration speech on friday   this american carnage stops right here and stops right now   a mexican anti corruption official swatted away the notion that mexico could shut out the united states on security issues    the government is going to continue the policy that it has always had of combating organized crime   he said  vito guardino  who worked for the dea for  years  said the u s  government used extradition as a yardstick to measure other countries  willingness to cooperate  but if the united states didn t get what it wanted  he said  it found ways of forcing other nations to play ball  a reality unlikely to be lost on mexico  which is heavily reliant on u s  trade  for example  guardino said that when colombia stopped extraditing drug traffickers to the united states in the late   the u s  government used a carrot and stick approach  threatening sanctions while drawing up the multibillion dollar plan colombia  by that metric  chapo s removal represents a calculated show of faith on the part of mexico  which has also signaled to trump s team it is open to reinforcing the northern border to curb drug smuggling and illegal migration  the high stakes political tensions were  however  only one way of looking at things  guardino and many others said  relationships with foreign law enforcement officials often take years to build and rely on trust in dangerous circumstances
