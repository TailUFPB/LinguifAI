daytona beach  fla  golden  colo   reuters    hillary clinton on saturday challenged fbi director james comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server  as the democratic presidential candidate accused him of  deeply troubling  behavior  days before the u s  elections  speaking to volunteers in daytona beach  florida  clinton said   some of you may have heard about a letter the fbi director sent  on friday to the u s  congress informing it that the agency is again reviewing emails  comey had decided in july that the fbi was not going to seek prosecution of clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state   it is pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election   clinton said  adding   it s not just strange  it s unprecedented and it s deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts   she urged comey to  put it all out on the table   in tandem with clinton  fellow democrats on saturday also worked to pressure comey to provide details on a controversy that dominated the presidential campaigns on saturday  less than two weeks before the nov   elections  four u s  senators   patrick leahy  the longest serving senate democrat  dianne feinstein  thomas carper and benjamin cardin   wrote comey and u s  attorney general loretta lynch asking that they provide by monday more detailed information about investigative steps underway  at a press conference in columbus  ohio  the congressional black caucus  comprised of about  members of the house of representatives  nearly all democrats  also urged comey to be more forthcoming  sources close to the investigation on friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner  the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin  weiner  a former democratic u s  congressman from new york  is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a  year old girl in north carolina  republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away at the new fbi development  devoting a large part of a campaign speech in golden  colorado  to attacking clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency   her criminal action was willful  deliberate  intentional and purposeful   trump said  standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn   hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure   comey  however  has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the fbi or the nature of their contents  clinton s campaign team tried to downplay the new review   there s no evidence of wrongdoing  no charge of wrongdoing   said john podesta  who heads the clinton campaign  referring to the fbi s latest announcement that it was taking  appropriate investigative steps  after learning of emails  that appear to be pertinent  to the earlier clinton email probe  in some of his toughest language on saturday  podesta portrayed comey s letter to congress as  light on facts  heavy on innuendo   clinton campaign manager robby mook  trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign  said americans had already  factored  what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots   we don t see it changing the landscape  for undecided voters  mook said  clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters  clinton did a campaign swing through florida as she and trump were thought to be in a tight race in a state famous for its role in close presidential elections  many analysts believe this battleground state is essential for trump to win in order to have any chance of being elected  in recent weeks  trump has been running behind clinton in most public opinion polls  singer and actor jennifer lopez was scheduled to headline a free concert in miami on saturday for clinton supporters  the clinton campaign hopes that  j lo   as she is known by fans  will provide celebrity star power and help clinton connect with young voters who earlier this year flocked to democratic primary challenger bernie sanders  justice department officials  according to a source who asked not to be identified  were opposed to the fbi director s letter being sent to congress and believe his actions conflict with a justice department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections  while lynch did not discuss the matter directly with comey  the source said aides were in touch with each other  comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the fbi s probe of clinton s emails  the source said  during his speech in golden  before flying to arizona to campaign  trump accused the obama administration s justice department of trying to protect clinton from prosecution   the attorney general didn t want anything to happen to hillary  i wonder why  it s very sad  folks  we re living in a third world country   trump said
