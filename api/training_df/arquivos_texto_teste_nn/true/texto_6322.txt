washington  reuters    the incoming u s  administration s tough talk against china has set the stage for showdowns on everything from security to trade and cyberspace  but contradictory signals are sowing uncertainty over how far president elect donald trump is prepared to go in confronting beijing  highlighting the contested south china sea as a potential flashpoint  trump s secretary of state nominee rex tillerson threw out an explosive challenge to beijing on wednesday by calling for it be denied access to artificial islands it is building in the strategic waterway  a trump transition adviser told reuters that tillerson  trump s pick to be america s top diplomat  did not mean to suggest the new administration would impose a naval blockade  which would risk armed confrontation with china  something the new administration was not seeking  but another official authorized to speak on behalf of the transition team pushed back on that view  saying tillerson  did not misspeak  when he said china should be barred from its man made islands  amid the conflicting signals on policy  the team appears to be making progress on plans for a major naval build up in east asia to counter china s rise   the transition adviser told reuters about specifics under consideration  such as basing a second aircraft carrier in the region  deploying more destroyers  attack submarines and missile defense batteries and expanding or adding new bases in japan and australia    they are also looking at installing  air force long range strike assets  in south korea  bordering china s nuclear armed neighbor north korea  said the adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity  trump  who succeeds president barack obama on jan    has vowed to greatly expand the u s  navy to  ships  but his transition team has not made clear how he will fund this  amid other massive spending plans   china s foreign ministry said it could not guess what tillerson meant by his remarks  which came after trump questioned washington s longstanding and highly sensitive  one china  policy over taiwan  but an influential chinese state run tabloid warned on friday that blocking chinese access to south china sea islands would require the united states to  wage war   trump s pick for defense secretary  retired marine general james mattis  did not endorse tillerson s message on the south china sea  which would seem at odds with washington s own longstanding commitment to freedom of navigation for all  asked about the remarks at his confirmation hearing on thursday  mattis said china s actions in the south china sea were part of a broader attack on the world order  but said the state  defense and treasury departments needed to put together an integrated policy  so we are not dealing with an incomplete or an incoherent strategy    the conflicting messages underscore the incoming administration s struggle in crafting an approach to one of the biggest foreign policy challenges facing trump  who during his election campaign repeatedly bashed china  saying it was  killing  and  raping  america on trade  a former u s  official who has informally advised trump s transition team said it may not have fully thought through the risks of any new u s  military or trade pressure on china   we should not underestimate china s willingness to retaliate in kind   the former official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  told reuters  as part of a drive to protect american jobs  trump has threatened to declare china a currency manipulator   even though economists say beijing has been seeking to prop up  not weaken   its currency  he has also threatened to slap punitive tariffs on chinese goods  risking a trade war that could hurt both countries and the global economy  trump has yet to name to his national security team high level members with deep experience of the region  leading some analysts to question whether the new administration will have enough expertise to translate rhetoric on a more robust asia policy into action  but trump has appointed two harsh china critics to his trade team   peter navarro  an academic who authored a book entitled  death by china   and robert lighthizer  a former reagan administration official  trump advisers dismiss concerns their approach could prove risky or counterproductive  arguing that a  peace through strength  stance will put real muscle behind u s  policy in the region after decades of under resourcing due to u s  distractions elsewhere in the world   once we start correcting the military imbalance  i actually think you will get more cooperation rather than less   the trump adviser said  trump and his cabinet nominees have also vowed to step up pressure on china to rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs  including by holding out the possibility of  secondary sanctions  on chinese entities found to be violating sanctions on pyongyang  but analysts say china may be in no mood to cooperate if washington is leaning on it on other issues  those include u s   pressure on beijing to curb cyber hacking of u s  entities  china s official responses to recent broadsides have been measured so far as they wait to see how trump will act once he takes office   we have seen many conflicting messages from people within his prospective administration   said tu xinquan  a trade expert at beijing s university of international business and economics   but analysts say confronting beijing over hot button nationalist issues like taiwan and the south china sea could trigger strong reactions  especially in a year when president xi jinping is seeking to further consolidate power at a  congress of the ruling communist party held every five years  zha daojiong  a professor at peking university  said the theme of clash of civilizations was becoming increasingly popular in chinese circles and this was ominous   this does not bode well at all     and it means that the continued war drums from america on the south china sea would not help matters at all
