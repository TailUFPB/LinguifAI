bedminster  n j   reuters    president elect donald trump on sunday assessed several more contenders for top u s  posts including chris christie and rudy giuliani  as blunt spoken retired marine corps general james mattis emerged as a leading candidate for defense secretary  trump held meetings at his golf resort in bedminster  new jersey  with candidates for senior administration jobs after he takes office on jan    on saturday  he conferred with mattis and mitt romney  formerly a fierce trump critic now under consideration for secretary of state  summing up two days of talks as he said goodbye to retired u s  marines corps general john kelly on sunday evening  trump said he had made decisions on a couple of appointments   we really had some great meetings  and you ll be hearing about them soon   trump transition spokesman sean spicer said no decisions would be announced on sunday night  trump discussed the treasury secretary job with jon gray  a board member of the blackstone group  two sources familiar with their meeting said  a trump transition team statement said their discussion included the u s  economy  global capital markets and the world financial situation  as well as tax reform and long term debt  the last person trump escorted out of the clubhouse was giuliani  the former new york mayor  trump said earlier that giuliani was a candidate for secretary of state  and other things   the trump team statement said trump and giuliani discussed  administration priorities  as well as  restoring america s prominence in the world  ongoing national security issues and threats at various hotspots on a global basis   christie  the republican governor of new jersey  advised trump during the presidential campaign but was dismissed as the head of his transition team  asked by reporters before the meeting whether there was a place for christie in his administration  trump sidestepped the question but called him  a very talented man  great guy   trump met with billionaire investor wilbur ross  who he said was under consideration for commerce secretary  asked whether he wanted the job  ross told reporters   well  time will tell    trump also received jonathan gray  the global head of real estate at the blackstone group  who is being considered for treasury secretary  according to a person briefed on the matter  the president elect has already tapped three senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams  choosing u s  senator jeff sessions for attorney general  u s  representative mike pompeo as cia director  and retired lieutenant general michael flynn as national security adviser  the selections so far suggest that trump  true to his campaign promises  intends to steer national security and foreign policy in a sharply different direction from that of democratic president barack obama  whose record trump harshly criticized during his campaign  obama campaigned extensively for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton before the nov   election and warned during the campaign that trump lacked the temperament and qualifications to be president  in peru  as he wrapped up his last foreign trip  one that was overshadowed by trump s surprise election  obama encouraged democrats on sunday to work with the new administration but said he would weigh in as a citizen if the trump administration challenged values he holds dear   in another sign of trump s novel approach to politics  the new york businessman who has never held public office said he planned to live in the white house but that his wife  melania  and their  year old son  barron  would not move in immediately  he said they would move from new york to the white house  very soon  right after he finishes school   while trump received lawmakers  politicians and business leaders behind closed doors over the weekend  he gave some hints about his thinking and possible cabinet choices on twitter   on sunday  he tweeted that  general james  mad dog  mattis  who is being considered for secretary of defense  was very impressive yesterday  a true general s general   from  to   mattis headed the u s  military s central command  which oversees operations stretching from the horn of africa through the middle east and into central asia including afghanistan and pakistan  during that time  he was at odds with the obama administration on the need to prepare for potential threats from iran and about resources for afghanistan  mattis    served as an american commander in the wars in iraq and afghanistan and was known to be popular among the troops  speaking on  fox news sunday   vice president elect mike pence  who now heads trump s transition team   said mattis had  a legendary military career   incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus said it was a  very real possibility  mattis would get the job  telling the abc program  this week    i know that president elect trump loves leaders like general mattis   pence said that trump and romney had a good meeting and  a warm and a substantive exchange    i can say that governor romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the united states   pence said on the cbs program  face the nation      romney  the unsuccessful  republican presidential nominee  was a leader of the republican establishment movement that tried to block trump from becoming the nominee this year  in march  romney called trump  a phony    a fraud  and  a con man   a source close to romney from his time as massachusetts governor expressed concern he might be  frozen out  by officials whose thinking appears to be closer to trump s  such as flynn  mattis  white house counselor steve bannon  and members of trump s family   how much influence and latitude he will have will be up to trump  and they don t appear to be on the same page about much   the source said  former texas governor rick perry  who made unsuccessful bids for the republican presidential nomination in  and   will meet with trump on monday and is being considered for cabinet posts including defense  energy and veterans affairs  trump s transition team said
