washington  reuters    donald trump s pick to lead the pentagon put russia at the top of a list of threats to u s  interests on thursday and told congress that america must be ready to confront moscow where necessary  even as he backed trump s bid for better relations   the remarks by retired marine general james mattis were the latest by one of trump s cabinet picks that veered away from the president elect s campaign rhetoric  which included praise for russian president vladimir putin and pledges to improve ties with him   secretary of state nominee rex tillerson on wednesday also  expressed views at odds with trump on key foreign policy issues like nuclear proliferation  trade deals  climate change and relations with mexico  mattis said russia  china and islamist militants were presenting the biggest challenge to the u s  led world order since world war two  and called for congress to lift spending caps undermining military readiness    i m all for engagement but we also have to recognize reality in what russia is up to   mattis said  adding there were a  decreasing number of areas  where the united states might cooperate with moscow   asked about the main threats to u s  interests  mattis said   i would consider the principle threats to start with russia    mattis said he wanted to meet with the new trump national security team to  craft a strategy to confront russia for what it s done   when questioned about the possibility of new u s  sanctions  due to enter the white house in eight days  trump on wednesday acknowledged that russia likely hacked the democratic national committee and emails of top democrats during the  presidential election campaign  a conclusion reached by u s  spy agencies  mattis cited russian involvement in hacking and information warfare among the challenges posed by moscow  others include treaty violations  destabilizing activities abroad and  alarming messages from moscow regarding the use of nuclear weapons    he also accused russia of trying to undermine nato  unlike trump  who appeared to question the alliance during his campaign  mattis strongly embraced it   calling nato central to america s defense   we recognize that he  putin  is trying to break the north atlantic alliance   mattis said  senator john mccain  the republican chairman of the committee  said he  could not be happier  about mattis  nomination  he warned sternly against optimism about engaging with putin   putin wants to be our enemy  he needs us as his enemy  he will never be our partner   mccain exclaimed  mattis also singled out china for its activities in the south china sea  where it has been building man made islands with anti aircraft and anti missile batteries  together with russian activities and the threats of islamist extremists  mattis said china was part of mounting assault on global stability  and the relationship with beijing needed to be carefully managed   i think it  the world order  is under the biggest attack since world war two  sir  and that is from russia  from terrorist groups  and with what china is doing in the south china sea   he said  mattis railed against defense spending caps imposed by congress and  when pressed  said he did not believe the u s  military was strong enough to properly deter potential adversaries  mattis  who retired from the military in   is technically ineligible for the job since he has not been a civilian for at least seven years  that means congress would need to grant him a waiver  something it has not done since   but appears inclined to do now   after mattis  testimony  the waiver cleared its first hurdle in congress when the senate armed services committee approved it  the full senate later backed the waiver by an overwhelming   vote  reflecting the strong support mattis enjoys in congress  mark cancian  a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies  said he expected bipartisan support for mattis would help him overcome limited opposition   the other thing he has going for him is that he may be a restraint on some of trump s more extreme impulses   cancian said   mattis    has tried to persuade trump privately against the use of waterboarding  which simulates drowning  as an interrogation tactic  top u s  officials  many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture    trump s pick for cia director took a similar line during his confirmation hearing on thursday  saying he would stand firm if necessary against trump on the issue of so called enhanced interrogation techniques      mattis was fiercely critical of iran  cautioning that tehran s  malign influence  in the region was growing   iran is the biggest destabilizing force in the middle east and its policies are contrary to our interests   mattis said in written responses to the committee  still  mattis did not echo trump s campaign threat to rip up a nuclear deal between iran and world powers  under which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions  mattis said the deal was imperfect but that the united states should uphold it    when america gives our word  we have to live up to it   mattis said
