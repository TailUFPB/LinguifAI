 reuters    republican john hammond iii had made no secret of his distaste for donald trump and his desire to halt his march to the party s presidential nomination  telling the indianapolis star newspaper in march that the mogul was  unfit  to lead the country  but the republican national committee member  a partner at law firm ice miller  said no anti trump group ever reached out to him  nor did he see any evidence that such groups were in the state until just a few days before voting in indiana s primary election  by the time some direct mail and tv ads popped up  it was  too late  to make a difference  he said   there was never really any early  stop trump  effort in indiana   he told reuters  trump became the republican party s presumptive nominee on tuesday with his resounding win in indiana s primary  which led his main rival u s  senator ted cruz of texas to drop out and heaped pressure on distant third place contender john kasich  the ohio governor  to do the same  in the process  trump dealt a seemingly fatal blow to the high profile effort known as  stop trump  or  never trump  launched by conservative republicans  the movement   led by the conservative anti tax nonprofit club for growth and the our principles pac   for months failed to significantly slow trump s momentum and now appears to be on death watch  political operatives and at least three officials involved in the movement say  it emerged over the u s  winter as initial skepticism over trump s chances turned to anxiety among conservatives  who view many of the manhattan real estate mogul s policy pledges as a liberal threat to their low tax  low spending principles  but from the start it was hobbled by poor coordination  the lack of a single  influential public leader  and the absence of an agreed upon alternative to trump  according to leaders in the movement as well as republican operatives familiar with it   you have to have a plan of action to deal with him   said republican strategist doug heye  a trump opponent who has ties to people in the movement   and it appears no one really did   publicly  leaders in the stop trump movement dispute the notion that they were ineffective  saying their efforts in wisconsin helped head off a trump win in april  they also say the groups communicate effectively with one another and that they will continue fighting despite the indiana results   we will continue to educate voters about trump until he  or another candidate  wins the support of a majority of delegates to the convention   katie packer  chair of the our principles pac said in a statement on tuesday   but  in private  three top officials associated with the movement conceded that indiana was a  do or die  moment  the movement suffered a major setback when republican mega donors declined to play the role of  trump slayers   both casino magnate sheldon adelson and the billionaire industrialist koch brothers  decided not to repeat their experience in   when they lavished hundreds of millions of dollars on republican candidates only to see no returns  deprived of such major financial backers  club for growth and our principles pac together spent only   million on anti trump messaging  according to federal election commission reports  democratic front runner hillary clinton s campaign and super pac have spent at least   million so far  according to fec reports   the groups and their associates focused their messaging over the winter and spring on television and social media ads and twitter blasts highlighting trump s comments about women being  bimbos    dogs  and  fat pigs   as well as his statements supporting universal health care and higher taxes   throughout their campaign  the two groups did not coordinate directly with one another or even converse on a regular basis  according to one club for growth official   it wasn t until last week that our principles pac and the stop trump effort in california  led by political consultant rob stutzman  even joined forces  officials at club for growth said they weren t aware of that california effort   some veteran republican operatives said our principles pac had been a waste of time and money    they ve had no leadership  they ve spent tens of millions of dollars by now and gotten zero message  zero movement   said one republican familiar with the workings of the movement   the whole thing has been a disaster from the beginning   many donors  like trump s rival candidates  underestimated the tycoon  believing he would burn out after his early successes  republican consultants say  those who did come forward publicly to support the stop trump movement  such as chicago cubs owners and our principles pac funders joe and marlene ricketts  were swiftly treated to trump s social media wrath    they better be careful   trump said of the ricketts in a tweet in february   they have a lot to hide    by march  other wealthy families who had donated to the cause were asking reporters not to identify them in stories anymore because they didn t want their spouses and children to face  abuse  from the trump campaign    i don t think you can underestimate how effective donald s bullying has been  even among wealthy donors   said one top official at club for growth  trump campaign manager corey lewandowski dismissed the notion that donors had been fearful  saying the identity of campaign contributors has long been public information
