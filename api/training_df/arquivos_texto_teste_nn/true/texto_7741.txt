 reuters    if donald trump were to challenge the outcome of next month s presidential election  as he has hinted he might  he would face a difficult and expensive fight  according to election attorneys and a review of voting laws in key battleground states  trump has said he is worried the nov   election might be rigged in favor of his opponent  hillary clinton  and in wednesday s debate he refused to say he would accept the outcome  but before any court challenge  trump probably would have to ask for a recount  said donald brey  a republican election lawyer in ohio  if the campaign did not pursue out of court options first  he said  a judge likely would dismiss the case  recount rules vary from state to state  north carolina  for example  doesn t allow a presidential candidate to request a recount at all if one candidate has a lead of more than   percent of the total votes cast  in wisconsin  the challenging candidate must pay the full expense of a recount if the vote in dispute is more than   percent  and in colorado if it is more than   percent  that can be expensive  officials in one wisconsin village put the cost of a local recount  in which about   votes were cast earlier this year  at nearly     said michael maistelman  a wisconsin election lawyer who represented the unsuccessful candidate  more than  million people voted in the  presidential election in wisconsin  deciding where to challenge the election would be complicated  trump  who trailed clinton by  percentage points nationwide in a reuters ipsos poll released last week  is fighting tight battles in some key states  in ohio  for example  an average of major opinion polls reviewed by the realclearpolitics website found trump to be leading by less than  percentage point  in iowa  he is leading by nearly  percent  in some other battleground states  polls suggest support for trump has eroded in recent weeks  according to the realclearpolitics website s poll tally  clinton has substantial leads in virginia  colorado and wisconsin  she leads trump by more than  percentage points in pennsylvania  nearly  points in florida and more than two points in north carolina  to maximize his chances of overturning a clinton win  trump might need to challenge the results in several states  said troy mccurry  a former republican national committee lawyer who was part of the party s recount team in   trump could try to bring a legal claim without first asking for recount by alleging  for instance  that an abuse of power by an election official  said mccurry  who s law firm represented ted cruz in the republican primary before mccurry joined the practice  but if trump s lawyers were unable to muster specific facts to support that premise  he said  a judge would dismiss the lawsuit  any lawsuit that withstood early challenges would face an uncertain future  with the u s  supreme court split  to  between liberal and conservative justices  state supreme courts or federal appeals courts could well make the final ruling in any election dispute   in pennsylvania  colorado and florida  where a majority of both state and federal appeals court judges have democratic affiliations  trump might face a more difficult road  meanwhile  appeals courts in ohio  wisconsin and iowa are more heavily republican   ohio election attorney brey  who said he dislikes but will vote for trump  believes a challenge in ohio would be a last ditch effort for the candidate   let s put it this way   he said   if ohio is close  trump s already lost   trump also might face obstacles from his own party  attorneys said  because it would be reluctant to challenge results in a state where  say  it lost the presidential race but won a close u s  senate race  numerous studies have shown u s  elections  which are decentralized and run by the states  are basically sound   mr  trump never mentions what criteria would be necessary for him to make a decision about a challenge   said stephen zack  an attorney who represented vice president al gore in the case that was brought to the supreme court over the election recount in florida in    basically it is left as   i ll see what it smells like and then i will surprise you    zack said   there are rule of law issues that pertain to elections that separate us from anywhere else in the world     election officials in several states rejected suggestions the balloting might be rigged  eric spencer  election director in arizona  said that while isolated incidents of voter fraud might occur and should be investigated  election workers come from all political parties and work with integrity    the notion that the election is rigged is preposterous if not insulting   spencer said  some election watchers question how serious trump is about a challenge   a lot of this is just posturing   mccurry said   at the end of the day i don t see how this happens
