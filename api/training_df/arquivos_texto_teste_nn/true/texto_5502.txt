washington  reuters    president donald trump s acceptance of beijing s demand that he re commit to a  one china  policy was heavily influenced by his new top diplomat  who argued behind the scenes that relations would remain on hold until trump cleared up doubts about a longtime bedrock of u s  china ties  officials said  the abrupt course adjustment  made public in a white house statement on thursday after a phone call between trump and chinese president xi jinping  followed white house meetings this week involving secretary of state rex tillerson  the u s  officials said  speaking on condition of anonymity  tillerson joined trump s national security adviser michael flynn and others in what one administration official described as a concerted effort to persuade the president that  this is the right way to go  this is right for the relationships and regional stability   and they won the day   the successful intervention by tillerson  a former exxon mobil chief executive with no previous diplomatic experience who was confirmed just nine days ago  suggests that in a white house dominated administration  the new secretary of state could help drive decisions on some geopolitical issues   tillerson s sway on other trump priorities  such as fighting islamic state  countering iran and improving ties with russia  remains to be seen  chinese anger toward trump has simmered since december when he spoke to the president of taiwan and said the united states did not have to stick to the  one china  policy  under which washington acknowledges the chinese position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of it  beijing considers self ruled taiwan a renegade province  china had signaled to washington that there would be no phone call between trump and xi and the relationship could not move forward until trump reaffirmed the  one china  policy  one of the u s  officials said  u s  based china experts said trump s change of tack should help ease tensions and open the way for discussions across the board  but they cautioned that this does not suggest  a softening of trump s stance over other issues  including the contested south china sea  his threat of high tariffs on chinese goods and his pressure on beijing to rein in north korea  but trump s acquiescence on an issue of extreme chinese nationalist sensitivity also  creates the risk that the chinese will conclude that trump is tough in his rhetoric but can be rolled if they apply sufficient pressure   said bonnie glaser at the center for strategic and international studies  the white house and state department had no immediate comment  speaking at a joint news conference with visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe  trump signaled on friday that he was pleased to have broken the ice with xi  describing the call as a  very  very warm conversation   but he also noted that he had long complained that china s currency was undervalued and predicted that  a level playing field  in terms of trade would be reached between the two countries sooner than many people think  tillerson s emerging role suggests that he could be a moderating influence with both friends and adversaries who have been unnerved at times by trump s rhetoric and unpredictability  the secretary of state played a role in crafting the  one china  statement but it was not immediately clear whether he or others met directly with trump to make the case for issuing it  another major player on the issue was flynn  who spoke by phone to china s top diplomat  yang jiechi  on feb    the sources said  as an oil executive  tillerson had a complicated history with china  he had regular dealings with china s state run oil companies over exxon mobil s longtime business interests there  but also developed oil exploration ties with vietnam  which has territorial disputes with beijing in the south china sea  during his senate confirmation hearings last month  tillerson raised chinese ire when he said china should be denied access to islands it is building in the south china sea  but in written responses to follow up questions from lawmakers that surfaced this week after his confirmation  tillerson softened his language  saying that in the event of an unspecified  contingency  the united states and its allies  must be capable of limiting china s access to and use of  those islands to pose a threat
