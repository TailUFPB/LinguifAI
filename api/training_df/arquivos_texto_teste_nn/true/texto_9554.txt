washington  reuters    u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump went on a charm offensive on thursday to try to win the party establishment s support for his insurgent candidacy  but top republican paul ryan stopped short of endorsing him  trump was on his best behavior on a day of meetings with republican lawmakers on capitol hill  he listened patiently as they raised concerns about his tone and the need to try to appeal to hispanic voters  he avoided strident language  like the frequent criticism he has lobbed from the campaign trail that many lawmakers are awestruck by the corridors of power and forget why they were sent to washington   the whole discussion was very solid  reasonable and a warm and winning discussion   said senator orrin hatch of utah   i think you re going to find he s going to be better and better all the time    the u s  budget deficit and debt were among the issues trump and ryan discussed  sources familiar with the meeting said  trump s day in washington was aimed at laying to rest some of the concerns that persist among republicans about his incendiary tone and some policy proposals at odds with party doctrine  the new york billionaire  who needs the party behind him to bolster his chances at winning the nov   election  has vowed to build a wall along the u s  border with mexico  deport  million illegal immigrants  temporarily ban muslims from entering the country and impose trade protectionist policies  trump held an hour long session with ryan  who as speaker of the house of representatives is the top u s  elected republican and can hold sway with many establishment republicans leery of trump   this was our first meeting  but it was a very positive step toward unification   ryan and trump said in a joint statement  trump told fox news in an interview that he had a  very  very good meeting  with ryan   i think paul felt the same way and everybody else did also   trump said  trump said he and ryan largely agree on issues of border security  trade and beefing up the u s  military   party leaders are normally eager to rally around a presidential nominee to combine forces for the battle leading up to the general election  but ryan has withheld his endorsement of trump out of concern over the businessman s conservative credentials  in remarks to reporters after the meeting  the congressman said he was encouraged by the session but that more work will be needed   there s no secret that donald trump and i have had our differences  we talked about those differences today   ryan said at his weekly news conference   i do believe we are planting the seeds in getting ourselves unified   ryan  who may harbor aspirations of running for president in  or later  noted that he represents a wing of the conservatives and that it is positive that trump is bringing new voters into the party  despite his problems in winning over senior republicans  trump received a boost on wednesday when a reuters ipsos national poll showed him pulling even with likely democratic nominee hillary clinton  the online survey found  percent of likely voters supporting clinton and  percent backing trump              later on thursday  trump went into a meeting with senate     republican leaders  where he posed for photos with them and heard concerns about his campaign rhetoric but appeared to make some progress in tempering concerns about him   everyone here wants you to win   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told him at the senate session  a source said  senator shelly moore capito of west virginia urged trump to be careful in his tone  senator rob portman of ohio  a former u s  trade representative  urged caution on his rhetoric against trade deals   the issue of tone did come up   said senator john cornyn of texas  who said he gave some advice to trump on  the importance of the hispanic vote and the whole idea of distinguishing between illegal immigration and legal immigration   in a meeting at a washington law firm  trump sat down with james baker  who served as secretary of state for republican president george h w  bush  earlier in the day  baker had testified to the senate foreign relations committee  under questioning from senator marco rubio  a former republican presidential candidate  baker said the world  would be far less stable  without a strong nato  a slap at trump s idea of reconfiguring the western alliance and getting european nations to foot more of the bill   secretary baker had a meeting with donald trump that was requested by his campaign   a baker spokesman said  even senator lindsey graham of south carolina softened a bit  graham dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year and had said the choice between trump and rival ted cruz was like trying to decide between being  shot or poisoned   graham said he had a  cordial  pleasant conversation  on the phone with trump on wednesday   i know mr  trump is reaching out to many people  throughout the party and the country  to solicit their advice and opinions   i believe this is a wise move on his part   said graham
