washington  reuters    u s  lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the zika virus on tuesday  as senate democrats blocked a republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the mosquito borne virus and hurt other health priorities  amid political recriminations by both parties  the republican plan to provide    billion in funding to combat zika  which had already passed the house of representatives  failed to get the  votes needed in the senate to clear a procedural hurdle  the vote was  in favor and  against on a mostly party line vote   it was unclear when congress would revisit the issue  democrats urged bipartisan talks  and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  said lawmakers would address the matter again sometime after the july  national holiday next week  both sides warned the other that there could be a political price to pay in an election year for stalling on zika funding  with the summer mosquito season under way and with it the threat of the virus spreading   here we are  in an utterly absurd position  playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country   mcconnell said  the zika virus  which has swept through the americas and caribbean since last fall  has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly  a rare birth defect  in brazil  as well as to neurological disorders  it has been declared a global health emergency by the world health organization  there have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the zika virus in the continental united states  but there have been  cases that were acquired from travel to areas with active zika outbreaks  or through sexual transmission  there have been more than   cases of zika infection reported in puerto rico  a u s  territory in the caribbean  health experts expect local transmission to occur in the continental united states with warmer weather  democrats have been urging republicans for months to agree to zika funding  the republican plan would have funded mosquito control efforts by the u s  centers for disease control  as well as vaccine research by the national institutes of health  and money for community health centers in areas that are experiencing the highest rates of zika transmission  but democrats complained that republicans locked them out of drafting the    billion funding plan  which would have made   million in budget cuts elsewhere  the republican plan  rushed through the house last week  would have taken money from battling the ebola virus as well as from funds set aside for implementing the obamacare health insurance program in u s  territories  the senate last month agreed to a bipartisan bill allocating the same amount      billion   to fight zika  but without cutting any other programs  democrats were especially angry that the republican proposal that failed on tuesday would not allow funding to go to private entities such as the women s healthcare provider planned parenthood  although the zika virus can be sexually transmitted   i don t know what universe  mcconnell  is living in  what does he think  we re all stupid  the american people are dumb  they re not  they understand what s going here   senate democratic leader harry reid declared after the vote  president barack obama  a democrat  had vowed to veto the plan  which falls short of his    billion request  if it ever arrived on his desk  republicans charged that the democrats were blocking the measure mainly because it included no funding for planned parenthood  a non profit group that democrats and republicans have been skirmishing over for years  it provides health exams  screening and contraception services to women  republicans have previously sought to cut off all federal funding to the group  which also provides abortions  planned parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its work  republican senator john thune  referring to planned parenthood  charged on monday that democrats were more interested in pleasing a what he called a special interest group than in acting on zika  u s  health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly  a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies  the who has said there is strong scientific consensus that zika can also cause guillain barre  a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults
