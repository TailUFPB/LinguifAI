 new york san francisco  reuters    president elect donald trump s transition team has been actively considering ways to revamp a temporary visa program used to bring foreign workers to the united states to fill high skilled jobs  according to sources familiar with the discussions   possibilities for reforming the distribution of h  visas  which are used largely by the tech industry  were discussed at a meeting last month with chief executives of tech companies at trump tower  said two sources  who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk about the closed door talks   don t miss pharma grapples with drug price backlash doj to examine fbi actions in clinton email probe trump senior policy adviser stephen miller proposed scrapping the existing lottery system used to award the visas  a possible replacement system would favor visa petitions for jobs that pay the highest salaries  according to the sources   h  visas are intended for foreign nationals in  specialty  occupations that generally require higher education  which according to u s  citizenship and immigration services  uscis  includes  but is not limited to  scientists  engineers or computer programmers  the government awards   every year   companies say they use them to recruit top talent  but a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms  sparking criticism by skeptics that say those firms use the visas to fill lower level information technology jobs  critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications   the h  visa program tends to be more critical to outsourcing firms than u s  tech firms  for instance  more than  percent of the u s  employees of indian outsourcing firm infosys  infy ns  are h  holders  and the company in its annual report has cited an increase in visa costs as among factors that could hurt its profitability   the top  recipients of h  visas in  were all outsourcing firms  according to government data compiled by the ieee usa  a professional organization representing u s  engineers   sixty five percent of h  petitions approved in the  fiscal year went to tech workers  mostly from india  according to uscis   in several high profile cases  american workers were asked to train h  holders to do their jobs before being laid off themselves   the idea advanced by miller in the tech meeting has also been pushed by the ieee usa   miller previously served as a staffer for senator jeff sessions  trump s pick for attorney general  who has been an outspoken critic of abuses of the h  program   trump  who has applied for h  visas to bring in foreign workers to his own businesses sent mixed messages about the program on the campaign trail  he assailed it for taking jobs from u s  workers  but during a republican debate last march said he was  softening  his position  because we have to have talented people in this country    he later issued a statement on his website saying he would  end forever the use of the h  as a cheap labor program    trump businesses  like trump national golf club and trump model management  have received permission to bring in more than two dozen foreign employees on h  visas since   according to department of labor data   during the meeting last month in new york  trump seemed to be searching for middle ground  and members of his transition team raised specific proposals  the two sources said  a third source familiar with the talks said the trump team has also discussed the plan to change the lottery system internally   there were more than a dozen top tech executives from some of the country s largest tech companies  including google  googl o   facebook  fb o  and apple  aapl o   present at the meeting   microsoft  msft o  ceo satya nadella said technology companies need to be able to recruit talent from abroad when necessary   trump seemed open to modifying the h  program  the sources said  he said he wanted to stop  bad people  from immigrating to the united states  not  great people   according to one account of the meeting   among proposals the group discussed was raising the cost of applications from large companies as a way to discourage bulk filing for the visas  asked by trump if they would object to that  none of the tech ceos said they would    in our view  the president elect is not hostile to h  visas   said one of the sources familiar with discussions at the meeting   while trump could initiate some changes to the visa program with executive action  significant shifts would likely need to go through a lengthy formal rulemaking process  said stephen yale loehr  an immigration expert at cornell law school  major changes would likely be subject to court challenges  he said   other reforms  like changing the visa cap or offering more green cards to high tech workers  could require congressional action  yale loehr said   a wide variety of companies  including thomson reuters  tri to   use the h  visa program to bring in employees from abroad
