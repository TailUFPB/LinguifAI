republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure  in remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast  clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and one liners to attack trump s policies and character  suggesting trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the white house simply because  somebody got under his very thin skin     donald trump s ideas are not just different  they are dangerously incoherent   she said to a room of supporters in san diego  california   they re not even really ideas  just a series of bizarre rants  personal feuds and outright lies   clinton  the front runner in the race to become the democratic presidential nominee  delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the nov   election against likely rival trump and away from bernie sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  who is continuing his long shot bid for the nomination  clinton was speaking in san diego ahead of california s june  primary election  democratic party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose trump  who managed to knock out all  rivals for the republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults  trump revels in referring to clinton as  crooked hillary  and dredging up the infidelities of her husband  bill clinton  the former president  clinton s remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toe to toe with him in scornful put downs   he says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the miss universe pageant in russia   she said as the crowd guffawed  and she suggested trump would run the u s  economy  like one of his casinos   during her speech  clinton predicted trump  who has been deeply critical of clinton s foreign policy record  would take to his twitter account to insult her  and he did   bad performance by crooked hillary clinton   ran one posting during the speech  which included a typo   reading poorly from the telepromter  she doesn t even look presidential   trump has said previously that clinton is distorting his actual policies  amid the laugh lines  clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state  in particular her role advising president barack obama during the mission to kill al qaeda leader osama bin laden  to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious   he praises dictators like vladimir putin and picks fights with our friends  including the british prime minister  the mayor of london  the german chancellor  the president of mexico and the pope   clinton said

and said he would ask members of the  nation nato alliance to  pay up  or  get out   he has said he would sit down with north korean leader kim jong un to try to stop pyongyang s nuclear program  clinton derided these and other positions  promising she would do a better job keeping the united states safe  standing in front of a backdrop of  large u s  flags  an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events  clinton painted the election as a choice between  two very different visions    one that s angry  afraid and based on the idea that america is fundamentally weak and in decline   she said  summing up trumpism   the other is hopeful  generous and confident in the knowledge that america is great  just like we always have been   trump has criticized clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her   stint as secretary of state  including the sept      attack by islamist militants on a u s  diplomatic facility in benghazi  libya  that killed the u s  ambassador and three other americans  he cites clinton s support for the war in iraq  launched by former republican president george w  bush  as another example of her shortcomings  democratic

reckless and irresponsible   sanders said in a statement  in criticizing clinton  sanders cited her vote for the war in iraq  calling it  the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history   and said  she has been a proponent of regime change  as in libya  without thinking through the consequences   in assailing each other s suitability for the white house  clinton and trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next month s party conventions that will choose the presidential nominees  both clinton and trump are facing record low favorability ratings  a reuters ipsos
