washington  reuters    officials in the u s  military s central command  which oversees combat operations in the middle east and south asia  were much more likely than counterparts elsewhere to believe superiors  distorted or suppressed their analyses  according to a government intelligence survey      results of the december  survey are likely to reinforce questions in congress and elsewhere about whether the administration is pressuring officials to make over optimistic claims about progress against islamic state and the taliban to help u s  president barack obama leave office in january on a high note      the office of the director of national intelligence  odni      survey  which had not been reported until now  was one of the main topics of a house intelligence committee hearing on thursday      in one of its more striking findings  only  percent of  central command officials surveyed said they were confident that their mid  and senior level managers were not deliberately distorting or suppressing their analyses  the average for the other eight u s  military commands  which include those in the pacific  africa and europe  was  percent  central command directs the american military missions in afghanistan  iraq  syria and elsewhere in the middle east and south asia  its analysts typically assess intelligence such as potential targets for bombing and an enemy s strength  asked if  anyone attempted to distort or suppress analysis on which you were working in the face of persuasive evidence    percent of the centcom respondents said yes  compared to an average of  percent  the survey found that when that question was asked   percent of the command s respondents said  politicization  was an issue    the data suggests respondents from central command believe their workplace adheres to objectivity standards relatively less than do workplaces of their ic counterparts   the report said  using an acronym for the u s  intelligence community   outgoing director of national intelligence james clapper said the situation at central command had improved in the  survey  clapper told a congressional intelligence hearing on thursday that centcom objectivity numbers were now similar to those in other combatant commands   i do think there is  by virtue of the change in commanders and    there  has been a change in the atmosphere there and so i ve been encouraged by the trends particularly this year   clapper said   centcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment  separately  clapper told the hearing that he had submitted his letter of resignation but would stay until the end of the obama administration  the survey has been conducted annually since  and about   analysts and managers responded to it  including  centcom analysts and managers  it cautions  however  that because responses were voluntary   care should be taken when broadly interpreting results  for each command          officials in other u s  intelligence agencies said the central command issues were not the product of pressure from white house or other senior officials  and played a minor role in the administration s public claims of progress against islamic state and the taliban  many of which have proved to be overly optimistic  that is true  these officials said  because much of the central command analysis consists of daily bomb damage assessments and other situation reports  not strategic intelligence  and constitutes only a small part of the material that finds its way from numerous other intelligence agencies  including the cia and the national security agency  into the president s daily intelligence briefing  nevertheless  the findings of the survey  which was posted with no notice last month on a remote part of the odni website  are likely to raise questions about intelligence assessments provided by central command  earlier this year  a u s  congressional report said central command painted too rosy a picture of the fight against islamic state in  and  compared with the reality on the ground and grimmer assessments by other analysts        the defense department inspector general is investigating the findings and is expected to issue a separate report  military officials said
