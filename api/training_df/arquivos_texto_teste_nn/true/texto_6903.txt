washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump indicated a tougher u s  approach to china by speaking to taiwan s president last week  but how far he will push a risky test of wills to wring concessions from beijing on issues from trade to north korea is unclear  the call between trump and tsai ing wen was the first by a u s  president elect or president with a taiwanese leader since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition to china from taiwan in   it prompted a diplomatic protest from china which the outgoing obama administration warned could undermine progress in relations with beijing  which has been carefully built up over decades by both republican and democratic administrations  analysts say it could provoke military confrontation with china if pressed too far  trump officials and vice president elect mike pence sought to play down the significance of the  minute conversation  saying it was a  courtesy  call and not intended to show a policy shift  however  trump fueled the fire on sunday by complaining about chinese economic and military policy on twitter  while on monday an economic adviser to trump  stephen moore  said if beijing did not like it   screw  em   analysts  including senior former u s  officials  said the call appeared to be at least an initial shot across china s bow to signal a tougher approach to beijing  which includes plans for a buildup in the u s  military  in part in response to china s growing power in the asia pacific region  jon huntsman  reportedly among the candidates to become trump s secretary of state  was quoted by the new york times as saying at the weekend that taiwan might prove a  useful leverage point  in dealings with china  trump adviser and china hawk peter navarro  and former u s  ambassador to the united nations john bolton  another in the mix for the top u s  diplomatic role  have both proposed using degrees of escalation on taiwan to pressure china to step back from its pursuit of territory in east asia  navarro  who has produced books and multipart television documentaries warning of the dangers of china s rise  has suggested stepped up engagement with taiwan  including assistance with a submarine development program   he argued that washington should stop referring to a  one china  policy  but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize taipei  saying  there is no need to unnecessarily poke the panda   bolton though  in an article in january  countenanced a  diplomatic ladder of escalation  that could start with receiving taiwanese diplomats officially at the state department and lead to restoring full diplomatic recognition  evan medeiros  a former official who served as president barack obama s top adviser on east asia  said this was a highly risky strategy   here s the reality  china let us all know very clearly in the mid  that the taiwan issue is a war and peace issue   medeiros said   is that a proposition that the u s  should test   the taiwan issue is so politically sensitive and ranks so high in chinese priorities of interest they are not going to begin trading anything away for it  and if the u s  decided to establish formal diplomatic relations with taiwan  it could easily precipitate a military crisis in northeast asia   he said  douglas paal  a white house official under republican administrations who served as u s  representative to taiwan from    said the approach of trump advisers seemed rooted in the   when china was much weaker and the united states in a better position to take a tougher line   the problem is that beijing decided in  on a  year  military  buildup so that it would never have to swallow such stuff again   paal said  he said chinese president xi jinping is seeking to cement his position at a congress of the ruling communist party next year    were he to look soft on something like making the u s  office in taipei into an official diplomatic outpost  xi would be devoured by his rivals  and he won t let that happen   paal said  chris murphy  a democratic member of the u s  senate foreign relations committee  said using taiwan as a way to pressure china to cooperate on north korea s nuclear program or on trade could be counterproductive   pressing china on taiwan won t likely bring them to the table on north korea and currency   he wrote on twitter   risks backing them into a dark  nasty corner   two sources familiar with the debate on china policy within the trump camp said bolton and other hard liners had encouraged taiwanese leaders to approach the president elect   however  former u s  secretary of state henry kissinger and others advising trump and his transition team have cautioned against an open break with the four decade  one china  policy  they said   as a result  trump first presented the request for a phone conversation as a personal matter rather than a harbinger of a shift in u s  policy  which left japan and other u s  asian allies unfazed  however  the sources said that after trump tweeted about chinese currency manipulation  import tariffs and the south china sea  some asian leaders were asking whether he was deliberately provoking china  potentially leading to a dangerous escalation of tensions  chas freeman  a former u s  diplomat who was then president richard nixon s interpreter on his historic trip to china in   said he thought chinese officials were waiting to see what trump s intentions were as president   they  chinese  don t want to humiliate mr  trump or get into an emotional confrontation with him   he said   so the immediate impact of this will be they will give him the benefit of the doubt  that he didn t know what he was doing  and didn t understand the significance of this  that perhaps he was manipulated by people around him
