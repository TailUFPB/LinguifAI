new york  reuters    democrat hillary clinton as president will have no policy mandate  even if elected by a wide margin  and would be wise to court congress for an easy win on a big dollar infrastructure bill  an economic aide to former republican president george w  bush said  keith hennessey  a former director of the white house national economic council and now professor at the stanford graduate business school  joined the global markets forum on tuesday as americans voted on a new president for the next four years  clinton led republican candidate donald trump   percent to  percent  in the last reuters ipsos national tracking poll before election day  here are excerpts from the conversation with hennessey  question  you see hillary clinton possibly scoring an outsized victory over donald trump in electoral college votes  so why wouldn t that be a mandate for her policies  answer  i m sure her team will want to claim a mandate  especially if the  electoral college vote  is high  but this has been a near zero policy election  so it s super hard to make that case with a straight face  q  there is wide agreement america needs to spend much more on highways  transport  airports and other fundamentals of modern society  how should a president clinton go about securing that  a  she makes phone calls to  congressional republican leaders paul  ryan and  mitch  mcconnell  she invites our members to the white house to meet her  she engages with them  asks them what s important to them  and listens  she could do an infrastructure bill first  that has potential to be an easy bipartisan win  q  what do you expect clinton s economic agenda to look like  a  she has taken an obama like position on debt  i m not prioritizing decreasing it  i m not prioritizing slowing the growth of it  but i m going to  pay for  all my new spending so my new proposals won t make the current policy path worse  if clinton wins the white house  i expect at most only relative modest moves on fiscal policy  probably          of gdp in the short run   nothing like the  initial obama fiscal stimulus  if that s right  i assume the fed stays on its current track on monetary policy
