london  reuters    new york real estate developer donald trump says he has  unlimited  personal wealth to fund his white house run  but a reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to election day  trump this week dismissed concerns about his campaign finances after electoral filings showed he raised just   million in individual contributions in may and had a war chest of only   million at the end of the month  his democratic rival  hillary clinton  raised   million and ended may with a war chest of   million   trump  the presumptive republican nominee who says he is worth about   billion  said in a statement on tuesday that  if need be  there could be unlimited  cash on hand  as i would put up my own money    trump had cash and other liquid investments   money in funds  equities and cash   worth   million to   million in may  according to his filings with the office of government ethics  the form does not require candidates to give precise values for their assets  only ranges  if president barack obama s spending in his successful re election bid in  election is any guide  then trump is a few hundred million dollars short  obama spent almost   million between june and november   according to federal election commission filings  trump s campaign declined to comment for this story but referred to his earlier statement  in which he said his white house bid costs less than a traditional one because it is  leaner and more efficient    if trump did decide to self finance his campaign  he could  in theory  tap the hundreds of millions dollars of revenue he says is generated annually by his businesses  but it s not clear how much of this revenue he could use  business owners can take money out of a business only after deducting operating costs and taxes  even then  much of an entrepreneur s corporate earnings are often used to invest in building their businesses and maintaining their property assets   trump s liquid assets stood at   million to   million in july last year  according to an earlier electoral filing  using the midpoint of the ranges  trump s liquid assets have fallen   million in the past year   the drop shows his campaign spending so far has already been funded in part by dipping into savings  rather than solely from his income   there is a real question about how much he has in terms of liquid assets   said norman ornstein  a political scholar and expert in political finance at the american enterprise institute  a conservative think tank in washington  citing the regulatory filings  which do not give a precise picture of trump s wealth   it s quite possible that he doesn t have anywhere near what he suggests he has and what he does have is tied up in real estate  and selling that is no easy task   he said   as a result  a more likely scenario would be trump trying to borrow the funds  which could be probably done more quickly than trying to sell one of his buildings  he added   jan baran  a former general counsel with the republican national committee  said trump may not need as much money as people think   he s breaking the mold on everything     he has proven that spending large sums of money does not guarantee success   baran said  referring to how trump defeated well funded republican rivals such as former florida governor jeb bush in the early nominating contests  or primaries  if trump does not use his own money  he can seek donations  the traditional fund raising route  individual donors can contribute    each to his general election campaign  trump has also signed a joint fundraising agreement with the  republican national committee  the rnc currently has   million in cash  money that will be used to help elect trump and republican lawmakers across the country   trump could also benefit if external groups like super pacs raise money to campaign on his behalf  however  trump has not yet blessed a super pac  trump has spent around   million so far in his presidential bid  including   million in loans he made to his campaign  ferc data shows   typically  television advertising and creating infrastructure at a state and local level to mobilize voters are the most expensive aspects of a u s  presidential campaign  tv networks charge high fees for prime time slots and many ground troops needed to bring out the voters must be paid   so far trump has not needed to spend much on television advertising   his fiery rhetoric on illegal immigrants and what he says are the security risks posed by refugees from the middle east have guaranteed him blanket media coverage   daniel weiner  a campaign finance expert at new york university s brennan center for justice said you can get only so far with free media in an election   tv advertising has been decreasing in importance for a long time  but the get out the vote stuff is crucial  particularly in an election that people perceive as being more about motivating their core voters  as opposed to winning over swing voters  and what we call  the ground game  is quite expensive   he said  trump has said he plans to outsource some of that ground game to the rnc  for example relying on their field staff in battleground states to help get out the vote  trump has significant real estate holdings  which he says have low debt on them  with election day on nov   now just four months away  some real estate experts say selling them to generate cash would be a challenge  but several bankers say trump could conceivably borrow hundreds of millions against them  despite his history of business bankruptcies and litigation with lenders  exactly how much he could borrow  how easily and at what interest rates depends on how much trump owns of the buildings that he cites as his own and how much debt he has   you have years of prosperity and you have all of these alternative lenders and you have banks that are hungry for loans   said one veteran banking executive  who was not permitted to speak on the record   if trump needs to borrow tens of millions of dollars  he probably can  the executive said   if it is hundreds of millions  that s another matter
