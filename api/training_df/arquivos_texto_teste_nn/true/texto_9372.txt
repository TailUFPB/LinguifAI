washington  reuters    the rancorous political debate over sexual identity unexpectedly prompted the republican controlled house of representatives to reject an energy and water spending bill on thursday after democrats attached an amendment to protect the rights of transgender people  the legislation  which would provide funds for the u s  army corps of engineers and the department of energy in the fiscal year that starts oct    failed on a   vote  with  republicans and  democrats opposing the legislation  the outcome was such a surprise that the house appropriations committee initially announced the bill had passed and was forced to retract the statement   democrats blamed republicans for opposing a democratic amendment to bar federal contractors from government work if they discriminate against the lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  community  democrats failed to attach the same measure to a separate house spending bill last week   in turning against a far reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for lgbt americans  republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement  but republicans accused democrats of working to sabotage the house appropriations process by voting   against the bill after they had succeeded in amending it  house speaker paul ryan said his own decision not to keep legislation under tight control had created conditions for  more amendments from both sides of the aisle     and  yes  more unpredictability      that s what happened here today  it s unfortunate  because this is a very good bill   ryan said  he vowed to continue pushing the energy and water bill  along with other appropriations measures  democrats said they opposed two republican amendments  one would prevent washington from witholding federal funds from north carolina over its law on lgbt bathroom use  the other would have stopped the democrats  lgbt amendment from affecting religious workplace exemptions  the white house had already threatened to veto the legislation over other provisions that democrats said would undermine the clean water act
