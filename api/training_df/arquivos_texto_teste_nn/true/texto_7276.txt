obama said on monday  in a news conference at the white house  obama said the freewheeling trump could not be as outspoken as he was during the long and bitter campaign that ended last week with the republican s surprise win over democrat hillary clinton      subdued and carefully choosing his words  obama gave what appeared to be dispassionate advice to his successor free of much of the partisan rancor that marked the election campaign   this office has a way of waking you up   obama said   those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don t match up with reality  he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself   the two men met in the oval office last week to begin the transition of power  obama said on monday he believed trump would be pragmatic in office and not approach the country s problems from an ideological perspective   there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well  unless he recognizes them and corrects them   obama said   because when you re a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial it has less impact than it does when you re president of the united states  everybody around the world is paying attention  markets move   he said  obama declined to wade into a controversy over trump s appointment of right wing firebrand stephen bannon as his chief strategist  saying it would  not be appropriate  for him to comment on trump s appointments  but obama  who criticized trump s temperament during the campaign  said it was important for trump to send signals of unity after the hard fought campaign  he said the political gifts that allowed the republican to upset clinton would be put to good use in the white house   i ve been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity  his interest in being president for all people   obama said   in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided  gestures

considered for the job of the nation s top diplomat  the source added  giuliani became one of trump s closest advisers during the campaign  functioning as his most vocal defender on cable news programs and introducing him at many rallies  giuliani has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general or homeland security secretary  a trump transition team official denied media reports on monday that trump was seeking security clearance for three of his children and his son in law  such clearance would allow trump to discuss matters of national security with his daughter ivanka  sons eric and donald jr  and son in law jared kushner  federal law prohibits him from hiring family members to serve in his administration  but all four played key advisory roles through the campaign  trump has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest  his children would run his sprawling business operations once he assumed the presidency  democrats  civil rights groups and even some republicans slammed trump for choosing bannon as a key aide  saying it would elevate the white nationalist movement into the top levels of the white house  making his first appointments since last week s upset win  trump picked bannon as his chief strategist and counselor  and washington insider reince priebus as his chief of staff on sunday  saying the two would share the task of steering his administration as  equal partners   the choice of priebus was seen as a conciliatory signal of trump s willingness to work with congress  but critics blasted the selection of bannon  who spearheaded a shift of the breitbart news website into a forum for the  alt right   a loose online group of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites   there should be no sugarcoating the truth here  donald trump just invited a white nationalist into the highest reaches of the government   said democratic senator jeff merkley  who called on trump to rescind the choice  the democratic leader in the house of representatives  nancy pelosi  said bannon s appointment sent  an alarming signal that president elect trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign   even

condemn the pick of  anti semite  bannon  john weaver  a top strategist for republican ohio governor john kasich  tweeted that the  racist  fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the oval office  be very vigilant america   kasich was one of  republican presidential hopefuls trump defeated in the party primaries   priebus defended bannon on monday  calling him a wise and well educated former naval officer and saying he had not encountered the sort of extremist or racist views that critics are assailing   he was a force for good on the campaign   priebus said on fox news  adding they were in agreement on  almost everything  in terms of advising the president elect  kellyanne conway  trump s former campaign manager and a senior adviser  told reporters in new york she was offended by the reaction to bannon  describing him as a  brilliant tactician   police in new york on monday were investigating two cases involving swastikas drawn or painted in public spaces  as civil
