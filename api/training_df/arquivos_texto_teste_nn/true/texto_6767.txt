washington  reuters    the central question facing exxon mobil corp  xom n  chief executive rex tillerson if he becomes u s  secretary of state is whether a lifelong oil man with close ties to russia can pivot from advancing corporate interests to serving the national interest  tillerson    got his start as a production engineer at exxon in  and has worked there ever since  running business units in yemen  thailand and russia before being named chief executive in   he was expected to retire next year  senior senators  both democrats and republicans  have expressed concern over tillerson  who emerged this weekend as  donald trump s expected pick for secretary of state  according to a source familiar with the situation  by choosing him  the president elect would add another   and presumably highly influential   person to his cabinet and circle of advisers who may favor a soft line toward moscow  among these is trump s choice for national security adviser  michael flynn  who raised eyebrows when he sat beside russian president vladimir putin at a moscow banquet last year and who has argued that the united states and russia should collaborate to end syria s civil war and to defeat islamic state militants  tillerson s links with russia came under fire from top lawmakers on sunday   it s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with vladimir putin and obviously they ve done enormous deals together  that would color his approach to vladimir putin and the russian threat   republican senator john mccain told cbs  mccain added that tillerson would  nonetheless  get a fair confirmation hearing  republican senator marco rubio  a former republican presidential rival to trump  was even more forthright   being a  friend of vladimir  is not an attribute i am hoping for from a  secretaryofstate   rubio said on his twitter account  many u s  officials are worried by russia s increasingly aggressive behavior  it annexed crimea from ukraine in   has supported syrian president bashar al assad in the syrian civil war and is accused of interfering in u s  domestic politics  u s  intelligence analysts have concluded that russia intervened in the  election to help trump defeat hillary clinton  and not just to undermine confidence in the u s  electoral system  a senior u s  official said  in his role at exxon  tillerson maintained close ties with putin and opposed u s  sanctions against russia for its incursion into crimea  daniel yergin  author of the pulitzer prize winning  the prize  the epic quest for oil  money  and power   said russia represented a relatively small portion of exxon s overall operations and played down its significance   it was a business relationship   yergin said       the whole russian thing is so much front and center now so it s inevitable that those questions be asked but  obviously  if you are a major oil company  you want to go to where your resources  are   you have to replace your reserves   he added   if he becomes secretary of state  the interests he will pursue will be u s  interests  this is an eagle scout kind of guy  he was president of the boy scouts   he said   he is a straight arrow  if that s his mission  that s what he ll do     trump praised tillerson  saying on his twitter account on saturday   whether i choose him or not for  state   rex tillerson  the chairman   ceo of exxonmobil  is a world class player and dealmaker  stay tuned   reince priebus  the republican national committee chairman who has been tapped to serve as white house chief of staff  praised tillerson s relationship with putin        the fact that he actually has a relationship with people like vladimir putin and others across the globe is something that     we shouldn t be embarrassed by it  it s something that i think could be a huge advantage to the united states   priebus said on abc this week  however  senator robert menendez of new jersey  a senior democratic member of the senate foreign relations committee that would weigh tillerson s nomination  was unsparing in his criticism of the possible appointment   reports that rex tillerson could be nominated to be our nation s top diplomat  are  alarming and absurd   he said   with rex tillerson as our secretary of state the trump administration would be guaranteeing russia has a willing accomplice in the president s cabinet guiding our nation s foreign policy   republicans will hold more seats    in the senate than the  they will need to confirm tillerson  but they will have only  of the  seats in the foreign relations committee  so it will only take one republican dissenter there to endanger the nomination  at least one republican committee member  rubio  has already expressed reservations   tillerson would be one of the few people selected for major roles in the trump administration to believe that human activity causes climate change  after trump s election  exxon came out in support of the paris climate agreement  it has also advocated for a carbon tax and internally factors in a theoretical price on carbon as it weighs manufacturing and exploration costs of projects   but some environmental groups are alarmed at the prospect of exxon s ceo as the country s top diplomat  exxon is under investigation by the new york attorney general s office for allegedly misleading investors  regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming   donald trump appears intent to undo a century of environmental and social progress and return america to the age of robber barons and corporate trusts   said carroll muffett  president of the center for international environmental law   who better to turn to than exxon  the granddaddy of them all
