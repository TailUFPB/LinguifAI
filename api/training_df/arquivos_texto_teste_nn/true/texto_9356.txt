 reuters    a lawsuit brought by texas and other states against the obama administration s policy on bathroom access may move the united states closer to a resolution on transgender rights by putting the issue on a trajectory for the supreme court  conservative officials from  states sued the federal government on wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth  the governor of a  state  mississippi  said he planned to join the lawsuit  the country s high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit  do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people  the plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts  the lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of republican president george w  bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering texas  if that appeals court ruled against the obama administration  the supreme court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in virginia  that ruling revived a transgender teen s lawsuit against his school district   the supreme court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts  and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights   the plaintiffs have accused the administration of president barack obama of overreaching its authority and said the u s  congress  or individual states  should set policy   at least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex  title vii of the civil rights act of   which covers employment  and title ix of the education amendments of    when lawmakers passed the education amendments  they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity  said jeremy tedesco  senior counsel at the alliance defending freedom  a conservative christian legal group   the  administration s  lawless interpretation ignores the will of congress in enacting title ix   tedesco said   it s a clear case of federal overreach   the obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity  including transgender status  it said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance  the states that sued have two paths to victory  tedesco said  a ruling that the obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations  which would leave the larger issue unsettled  or that its interpretation of title ix is inconsistent with the law  without clear guidance from the courts  the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies  meaning a future president could take the opposite view of obama  the republican controlled congress has the power to end the dispute immediately  either in favor of transgender rights or against them  but it has shown few signs of acting  especially with a democrat  obama  in the white house  a series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination  said jennifer levi  director of the transgender rights project at glbtq legal advocates   defenders  federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear  she said   to characterize  the administration s position  as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do   levi said  the states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice and comment procedure  a court could also find that the states  lawsuit was premature because the obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district  said arthur leonard  a professor at new york law school and an expert on lgbt law
