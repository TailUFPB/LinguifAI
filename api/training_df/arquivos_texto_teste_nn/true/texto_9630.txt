cleveland new york   bracing for a general election fight with donald trump  democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton and her allies are putting resources into industrial states such as ohio and pennsylvania to try to block trump from making inroads with working class voters there  labor leaders  progressive groups and democratic operatives told reuters in interviews that they took seriously trump s appeal with white working class voters and were studying how to respond to his promises to create jobs and negotiate better trade deals  the desire to stop the presumptive republican presidential nominee from wresting away the support of unionized workers has even led a group organized to back bernie sanders  labor for bernie  to consider its next steps if sanders does not win the democratic nomination   it may well be our task to work hard to reach out to our  labor union  members who support trump and begin an important dialogue   said rand wilson  a staunch sanders supporter and labor for bernie spokesman  the rust belt  which includes ohio  pennsylvania  michigan  illinois  wisconsin  indiana and west virginia  has suffered heavy job losses in sectors such as autos  coal and steel that have faced fierce competition from abroad  the region  home to many unionized workers  has been a stronghold for democrats  the exceptions are socially conservative west virginia  which has gone republican in the past four presidential elections  and indiana  which has gone democratic only twice since   ohio has switched back and forth  trump has aggressively courted working class voters ahead of the nov   election to succeed democratic president barack obama  he has criticized the north american free trade agreement  nafta  and promised to rip up the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade deal  he has also said he will consider raising the minimum wage and backing higher taxes on the wealthy   on monday  trump sought to backtrack from those comments on taxes   now if i increase it on the wealthy  that means they re still going to be paying less than they are paying now   he told cnn   i m talking about increasing it from my  original  tax proposal   trump campaign manager corey lewandowski told reuters the campaign was targeting industrial states like pennsylvania and michigan  which have voted democratic in presidential elections since   working america  an advocacy group affiliated with the afl cio labor federation  is expanding operations in states like ohio and pennsylvania and plans to open an office in wisconsin  its first mission is talking to voters about jobs and the economy and trying to gauge where they are leaning in the presidential race  later in the campaign  the group will work more aggressively to win over voters  in ohio  the democratic party has doubled its field operation over the past month  thanks to an infusion of cash raised by the clinton campaign for the national and state parties  clinton  who has a strong lead over sanders but has yet to secure the democratic nomination  has already hired state directors in ohio and pennsylvania  working america field director soren norris knocked on doors on the west side of cleveland last week as part of an effort to gauge voter sentiment  at the first house  tamara phillips    told norris she was not enthusiastic about either clinton or trump but that she would vote for the new york businessman if forced to choose  phillips  who works in publishing  said taxes on her commission income rose during former president bill clinton s administration  but she said she had reservations about trump s  gruff  demeanor  with an eye toward voters across the rust belt  clinton visited appalachia last week with stops in west virginia and ohio  she apologized for previous statements related to shutting down the coal industry and told protesters she was committed to solving their economic problems even if they did not support her  union activists said their strategy for undercutting trump s support would be pointing out discrepancies in his positions  his comment that he is open to raising the minimum wage comes after he said in a november debate that  wages are too high  and that an increase would hurt the economy  although trump rails against trade deals and businesses that move operations to mexico  critics say that items such as ties and suits in his clothing line were made in china   the best way to go after trump is to make him run against himself   said political strategist brad bannon  who advises labor unions  tom buffenbarger  a clinton surrogate to labor and the past president of the machinists  union  said democrats would have  a lot of fun  highlighting trump s inconsistencies  although he acknowledged the republican candidate presented a threat in some rust belt states   are we concerned about the industrial states in the upcoming election   buffenbarger said   yeah  donald trump s done a good job complaining about the trade deal while he continues to ship work from the u s  to china
