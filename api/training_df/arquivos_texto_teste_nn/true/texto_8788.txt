washington  reuters    puerto rico  the u s  commonwealth that recently declared a historic default  could be shut out of debt markets for two more years as it battles with fiscal challenges  the island s governor said on tuesday  governor alejandro garcia padilla said emergency fiscal measures in response to a   billion debt were not sustainable and that  puerto rico will not endure any more austerity     he said a new law enacted by washington allowing the federal government to appoint a control board would undercut self government  but added it would help the island confront its fiscal problems   our challenges are not over and prosperity will not return overnight   the governor said during a discussion at the brookings institution  a think tank in washington   it will take maybe two years until the market opens back to puerto rico if we do the right thing   garcia padilla said  adding the government had been producing fiscally sound budgets that would help win back creditors  the island has been shut out of debt markets for about a year  citing falling debt levels  he said it was a  moment of opportunity  in puerto rico  which has struggled with high debt loads and a weak economy for years   puerto rico defaulted on   million of constitutionally backed debt on july   among its most senior bonds  opting to pay for essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors   garcia padilla said the puerto rican government would take steps on its own to get its fiscal affairs in order  therefore minimizing meddling by the oversight board  for example  he said that if the island s government passed responsible budgets on its own  the control board would not need to impose its own fiscal plans  garcia padilla said  however  that while the government must become more efficient to improve its fiscal situation  that should be done through attrition rather than laying off workers  asked by a reporter about steps that could be taken to shore up the puerto rico electric power authority  or prepa  and the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority  or prasa  garcia padilla said   prepa is pretty advanced  we ll be able to reduce a lot the debt related to prepa  we want to do the same with prasa  i think we ll be able to do it
