new york  reuters    families of sept   victims and others who may seek to sue foreign governments accused of supporting terrorism in the united states still face significant legal hurdles  despite a boost from passage of a law allowing such cases to proceed   the new justice against sponsors of terrorism act  or jasta  grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u s  soil   passage of the law over a presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the sept     attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade ago against saudi arabia in new york federal court  still  it will be hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism  said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law  who expected drawn out legal wrangling   we may find that at the end of the day  after years of litigation  that the link is not sufficiently established even for saudi arabia   said curtis bradley  a law professor at duke university   the law says plaintiffs must show the foreign state  knowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources  to designated terrorist groups  not that the countries were simply negligent or looked the other way   congress on wednesday overwhelming voted to pass the law  overturning president barack obama s veto  before the law  american victims of terrorist acts could only sue countries designated by the u s  state department as state sponsors of terrorism  currently iran  syria and sudan  now  any country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known terrorists that carry out attacks on u s  soil   existing tort law requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a  substantial factor  in the victims  injuries  a high bar  said jimmy gurule an expert in international criminal law at the university of notre dame     this could be challenging in the sept   case since an independent commission on the  attacks did not find sufficient evidence of saudi involvement  al qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and most of the  hijackers were saudi nationals    we have a high degree of confidence we can meet that burden  the saudis think we can t   said jack quinn  co counsel for more than   family members of sept   victims   the families sued saudi arabia in   seeking to hold the country responsible  the proceedings have been stalled on the question of saudi arabia s immunity quinn said the plaintiffs will now ask the  u s  circuit court of appeals to reconsider the issue in light of the new law   if the court says the case can move forward  both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions of witnesses and experts    we will next attempt to complete the development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the basis of that  let the chips fall as they may   said quinn    but even under the new law  the white house can still request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits  the law allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if the united states says it  is engaged in good faith discussions  with the country to resolve the claims   the stay provision and other changes were added to address concerns raised by the white house  saudi arabia and companies like general electric and dow chemical co  obama is likely to request such a stay  said bradley  stephen vladeck of the university of texas school of law  said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bill s language   the next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the meaning of all these obstacles that congress snuck back into the bill at the last minute   said vladeck  even with the revisions  detractors of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the united states or u s  companies into court  some u s  lawmakers said congress may revisit the law to narrow it further   ultimately  though  if the victims of terrorist acts win a court  judgment against a foreign government  other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a slog  a reuters analysis last year found that in the  years following the sept   attacks  the number of lawsuits filed under the u s  anti terrorism act and similar laws more than tripled compared to the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of judgments in u s  courts   but judgments awarded against organizations or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets that can be claimed in the united states  their value often falls short of the award   reut rs
