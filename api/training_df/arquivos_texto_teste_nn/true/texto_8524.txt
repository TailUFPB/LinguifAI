green bay  wis  washington  reuters    republican donald trump acted to steer his white house campaign back into favor with his party s establishment on friday by endorsing u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan and two republican senators seeking re election  after expressing coolness toward them earlier this week   i need a republican senate and a house to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make   trump said during a rally in green bay  in northern wisconsin  ryan s home state  he also endorsed senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire  calling ayotte a  rising star    we will have disagreements  but we will disagree as friends   trump said   trump earlier this week refused to endorse ryan  telling the washington post he was  not quite there yet    nearly the same phrase ryan had used about trump before finally endorsing him  trump said in the same interview that mccain had not done enough for veterans and criticized ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign  ryan  the top u s  elected republican  had no plans to attend the wisconsin event  a sign of lingering frictions between the pair  even though trump s running mate  mike pence  did endorse him  ryan s republican primary challenger  businessman paul nehlen  did attend  according to a spokesman  ryan is expected to win the challenge for his house seat in next week s republican primary  and he is viewed by many republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future  the tension between ryan and trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers  trump s endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given democrat hillary clinton the advantage in the race to the nov   election  in the latest reuters ipsos poll released on friday  clinton s lead over trump narrowed to less than  percentage points  down from nearly  points on monday  trump said on friday he wanted a  big tent  party with multiple viewpoints welcome  he said he was endorsing the republican lawmakers due to their  shared mission to make america great again   trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy  the group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers  a group trump has railed against  there are no women on the team  trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in detroit on monday  an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected  trump economic adviser stephen moore told reuters that the candidate s plan would focus on four areas  tax  deregulation  energy policy and trade   it s going to be an all encompassing look at how we reform the economy   moore said  at events in des moines  iowa  and green bay  trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free wheeling rallies  calling clinton the  queen of corruption  and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the white house   all my life i ve been told   you have the greatest temperament    he said in des moines  he also said voters should consider supporting him because of pence  who appeared with him at both events   if you don t like me  that s okay  vote for pence because it s the same thing   trump said  trump bashed the media as well  saying reporters over hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in virginia   i love babies   he said   short circuited  clinton sought to take advantage of trump s dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in washington  where she pledged an all out fight for comprehensive immigration reform  and she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign  take questions from reporters  she addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign  the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was u s  secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness  clinton conceded that she had  short circuited  earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that fbi director james comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server   clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material  a finding that comey contradicted at the conclusion of the fbi s probe in july  when he rebuked her for  extremely careless  handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed  on friday  clinton maintained   i never sent or received anything marked classified   while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies  republicans have repeatedly charged that clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material  the email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that clinton is untrustworthy   i take it seriously   she said  still  as she has often done during her career  clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from republicans  trump s campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive dan dimicco  howard lorber  ceo of tobacco company vector group ltd  vgr n   and trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager steven mnuchin   hedge fund managers john paulson and steve feinberg  moore  the trump economic adviser  and david malpass  who has served in previous republican administrations  were also named  trump s moves came after many republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week  the real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a muslim  american soldier killed in iraq  the parents had criticized trump at last week s democratic national convention  many republicans  including ryan  mccain and ayotte  were critical of trump s insistent attacks on the pair
