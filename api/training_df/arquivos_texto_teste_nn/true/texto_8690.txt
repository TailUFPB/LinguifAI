cleveland  reuters    a staff writer for the trump organization took responsibility on wednesday for the  chaos  caused by a speech given by the wife of u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the party s convention this week  the writer  meredith mciver  apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with melania trump s speech on monday night  the republican convention in cleveland  which formally anointed trump on tuesday as the party nominee for the nov   presidential election  was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox white house candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign  but the accusations of plagiarism  and the trump campaign s responses to them  have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating democratic candidate hillary clinton in the nov   election  in a statement  mciver said she had inserted passages into the melania trump speech that resembled parts of a  speech by first lady michelle obama to the  democratic national convention  when barack obama was in his first campaign for the presidency  mciver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy  but trump and his family had rejected the offer   the trump organization is owned by donald trump  trump defended mciver in an abc news interview on wednesday  saying   she made a mistake  people make mistakes  you ve made mistakes  we all make mistakes   he said mciver had been with him for a long time and was a  good person   trump added   i thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said   look  it was a mistake that i made   she thought it was very unfair to melania   in her speech on monday  melania trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that  the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them    my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise  that you treat people with respect   melania trump told the cleveland convention  in denver eight years ago  michelle obama said she and her husband  barack   were raised with so many of the same values  that you work hard for what you want in life  that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do  that you treat people with dignity and respect       mciver said melania trump had read passages from michelle obama s speech over the phone to her as examples  mciver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became melania trump s speech  mciver said in her statement that michelle obama is a person melania trump  has always liked     i did not check mrs  obama s speeches  this was my mistake and i feel terrible for the chaos i have caused melania and the trumps  as well as to mrs  obama  no harm was meant   mciver said  nowhere in the statement by mciver and comments by trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the republican nominee was inspired by the words of michelle obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the republican convention  echoing trump  assailed her husband s policies  democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the trump campaign s various explanations over the ensuing  hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time  the charge was all the more embarrassing because trump has repeatedly slammed clinton as untrustworthy  white house spokesman josh earnest said on wednesday the similarities showed the country s values were largely shared  even if political leaders had differences   that certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late  about the country not being as divided as it might seem   earnest told reporters   questions have lingered over why the trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other people s words  and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem  republican strategist ted newton  president of gravity strategic communications and a staffer in republican mitt romney s failed  presidential campaign  said the trump campaign should have come clean much sooner   it sort of reflects the old adage  it s not the crime  it s the cover up   newton said   to have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her   if the campaign had admitted what happened sooner  newton said   it would have been a bump in the road   hours before giving the speech  melania trump  a slovenian born jewelry designer and former model  told nbc s  today  that she had written it with as little help as possible  but her husband s campaign manager  paul manafort  told cbs   this morning  on tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers  as late as wednesday  just hours before mciver s statement  manafort was pressed again on the issue on cnn  he did not say words had been lifted from the michelle obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech   the controversy that you re talking about is not meaningful at all   he said   mciver is listed as a writer on some of trump s most popular books  including  trump  how to get rich  and  trump  think like a billionaire   her author s biography in  how to get rich  says she was a ford foundation scholar who graduated from the university of utah  as well as a member of the trump organization
