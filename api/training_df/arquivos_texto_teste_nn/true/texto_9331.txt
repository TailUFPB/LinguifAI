new york  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday detailed    million in contributions he raised for military veterans  and staged a fiery news conference where he attacked reporters for questioning him for months about the money                   appearing at trump tower in manhattan  the billionaire accused the media of failing to give him credit for raising the funds at an event in january in iowa  his tirade  in which he called one reporter  a sleaze  and sarcastically described another as a  real beauty   overshadowed what otherwise should have been an upbeat event for the presumptive republican nominee   the press should be ashamed of themselves   he told reporters gathered before him   you make me look very bad  i ve never received such bad publicity for doing a good job   while trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media  questions about the donations to veterans touched a raw nerve with him as he tries to build a conservative base ahead of the nov   general election      reporters have been persistently asking whether trump in fact raised all the money he said he had in january and why it took so long to hand donations over to veterans groups  a number of veterans groups listed by trump on tuesday as recipients confirmed they had received the donation as listed  ranging from    to  in one case     million  which went to the marine corps law enforcement foundation  some of the donations arrived in february or march  some as recently as last week around the time a critical article appeared in the washington post  the money arrived in the form of a check from the donald j  trump foundation   we received a    gift early last week from the trump foundation  it was not restricted or earmarked in any way   said katherine fritz  director of development at america s vetdogs  trump s criticism of the media dashed the hopes of some republican leaders who want him to tone down his rhetoric and become more magnanimous now that he has sealed the republican presidential nomination  the washington post said trump only handed over a personal donation of   million last week   four months after announcing it   once the newspaper started asking about the money  trump said the news coverage of his veterans group donations had been close to libelous  asked whether he would maintain an adversarial stance with reporters if elected president  trump said   yeah  it s going to be like this   a reporter told trump he seemed resistant to the kind of scrutiny that comes with the office of u s  president  but ari fleischer  a former white house press secretary for president george w  bush  said the news media should stop fretting about how trump treats them   my advice to the press  stop interviewing yourselves about trump s attack on the press  don t worry about it  just do your jobs and be fair   he said  the contretemps took place on the same day documents were disclosed from a lawsuit involving trump university  a now defunct education program that ran a real estate training program  trump has attacked the presiding judge as hostile to him   the university documents showed trump university created a special class to teach students how to cash in on u s  mortgage foreclosures when the united states was struggling with an entrenched housing crisis in   democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton sought to take advantage of trump s discomfort over the media scrutiny he has faced  she told cnn that trump s tendency to attack his critics  is a recipe for gridlock in washington   clinton defended her own policy toward dealing with the news media  saying she has conducted  interviews this year alone  unlike trump  she rarely holds news conferences  her last one was last december  clinton leads trump by  percentage points in the latest reuters ipsos opinion poll  according to the may   survey of likely voters   percent support the former u s  secretary of state while  percent back trump    california governor jerry brown on tuesday endorsed clinton for the democratic nomination  saying it was the only way to  stop the dangerous candidacy of donald trump              at his news conference  trump also bristled at the possibility that republicans opposed to him might run a third party candidate as an alternative to trump or the expected democratic nominee clinton  he said a leader of that effort  bill kristol  editor of the weekly standard magazine   looks like such a fool    let me tell you these people are losers   said trump  adding that a third party candidacy would guarantee clinton wins the white house and deny republicans the chance to put conservatives on the supreme court   what you re going to do is lose the election for the republicans and therefore you lose the supreme court   he said  trump read out a list of veterans  organizations that had received money from the january event  which he attended instead of participating in a fox news sponsored candidates  debate  he said the money was benefiting  groups and that the total cash raised could climb as more comes in   he turned the microphone over briefly to al baldasaro  a trump supporter and a veteran from new hampshire who also skewered the news media  saying reporters should  get your head out of your butt  focus on the real issues
