new york  reuters    the drama started early at donald trump s first news conference as president elect  trump  who spent much of his u s  presidential campaign bashing the news media for what he called unfair coverage  kicked off with uncharacteristic praise for the new york times and other media organizations   the reason  the times  and others  had held back on reporting salacious and unsubstantiated allegations that suggested trump could be blackmailed by russia  the praise did not last long  for those organizations that he said had crossed the line   buzzfeed  which released an unsubstantiated memo about the allegations  and cnn  which was one of the first to report on the broader story   he delivered a  scathing critique    you are fake news   trump said to cnn correspondent jim acosta  calling his organization terrible and declining to take a question from him despite acosta s several attempts to shout one  that dust up was one of many theatrical moments at the first news conference in six months for trump  a businessman and reality tv star turned politician who enters the white house on jan    there was turbulence even before trump took the lectern in the lobby of his manhattan tower  the president elect s team had set out about  chairs  not nearly enough for the roughly  journalists who were present   trump s team created some suspense when beforehand four aides walked to the front of the room and placed thick stacks of paper on a table  trump would get to that later  when the president elect arrived  a group of staff and supporters standing in a space near the elevators in the trump tower lobby applauded  that group would act as trump s personal cheering section during the news conference  clapping and whooping whenever he made points they liked  the press does not normally cheer the president at such events  at the start  trump stood off to the side with his three oldest children while he had two introductions   one from his incoming press secretary  sean spicer  and one from his running mate  mike pence  both slammed media organizations for reporting the unsubstantiated allegations  cnn later released a statement about its reporting   cnn s decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different from buzzfeed s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos   it said   the trump team knows this   buzzfeed ceo jonah peretti in a memo to employees defended the decision to publish the dossier  referring to it as a  newsworthy document   trump stood in front of a row of american flags  using a presidential and patriotic display as a backdrop  as the questioning grew more intense  he brought up an attorney  who gave a long and detailed pitch on live television about how the business owner would attempt to avoid conflicts of interest   the lawyer s presentation acted as a brief intermission to the frenzied pace  once trump was ready to end  he pointed to the stacks of paper by the lectern  he said he was unsure it had been properly explained that they represented some of the paperwork he had filled out to begin placing his business in the hands of his sons so long as he is president  a maximum of eight years  if after eight years of running his business he found the sons had not done a good job  he would tell them   you re fired   trump said  using a catchphrase from  the apprentice   the reality tv show he hosted
