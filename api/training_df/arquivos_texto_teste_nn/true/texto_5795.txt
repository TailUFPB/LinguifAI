washington  reuters    president donald trump on tuesday nominated neil gorsuch for a lifetime job on the u s  supreme court  picking the  year old federal appeals court judge to restore the court s conservative majority and help shape rulings on divisive issues such as abortion  gun control  the death penalty and religious rights  the colorado native faces a potentially contentious confirmation battle in the u s  senate after republicans last year refused to consider democratic president barack obama s nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the february  death of conservative justice antonin scalia  the senate s top democrat  chuck schumer  indicated his party would mount a procedural hurdle requiring  votes in the  seat senate rather than a simple majority to approve gorsuch  and expressed  very serious doubts  about the nominee  liberal groups called for an all out fight to reject gorsuch while conservative groups and republican senators heaped praise on him like  outstanding    impressive  and a  home run   gorsuch  the son of a former reagan administration official  is the youngest nominee to the nation s highest court in more than a quarter century  and he could influence the direction of the court for decades  he is a judge on the denver based  u s  circuit court of appeals and was appointed to that post by republican president george w  bush in   announcing the selection to a nighttime crowd in the white house east room flanked by the judge and his wife  trump said gorsuch s resume is  as good as it gets   trump  who took office on jan   and has sparked numerous controversies  said he hopes republicans and democrats can come together on this nomination for the good of the country   judge gorsuch has outstanding legal skills  a brilliant mind  tremendous discipline  and has earned bipartisan support   trump told an audience that included scalia s widow   depending on their age  a justice can be active for  years  and his or her decisions can last a century or more  and can often be permanent   trump added  gorsuch is considered a conservative intellectual  known for backing religious rights and writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide  and is seen as very much in the mold of scalia  a leading conservative voice on the court for decades   i respect     the fact that in our legal order it is for congress and not the courts to write new laws   gorsuch said  as trump looked on   it is the role of judges to apply  not alter  the work of the people s representatives  a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge  stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands   a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the choice of gorsuch was seen by the white house as a significant departure from supreme court nominations from the recent past  given that many justices have come from the eastern united states  gorsuch lives in boulder  colorado  where he raises horses and is a life long outdoorsman  the official said a screening committee helped in the selection process that included vice president mike pence  white house counsel don mcgahn  chief of staff reince priebus and top strategist steve bannon  gorsuch became the youngest u s  supreme court nominee since republican president george h w  bush in  selected conservative clarence thomas  who was  at the time  gorsuch was in the same  graduating class from harvard law school as obama  the selection of gorsuch  who was on a list of about  judges suggested by conservative legal activists  unified republicans in a way not seen since trump s nov   election victory  with even critics within the party such as south carolina senator lindsey graham singing the nominee s praises  trump made his choice between two u s  appeals court judges  gorsuch and thomas hardiman of the philadelphia based  u s  circuit court of appeals  according to a source involved in the selection process  the senate confirmed gorsuch for his current judgeship in  by voice vote with no one voting against him  democrats signaled it may not be easy this time   judge gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people  demonstrated a hostility toward women s rights  and most troubling  hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong  independent justice on the court   schumer said  trump got the opportunity to name scalia s replacement only because the republican led senate  in an action with little precedent in u s  history  refused to consider obama s nominee for the post  appeals court judge merrick garland  obama nominated garland on march  but republican senators led by majority leader mitch mcconnell denied garland the customary confirmation hearings and vote   this is the first time in american history that one party has blockaded a nominee for almost a year in order to deliver a seat to a president of their own party  if this tactic is rewarded rather than resisted  it will set a dangerous new precedent in american governance   oregon democratic senator jeff merkley said  mcconnell said on tuesday he hoped the senate would show gorsuch  fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up or down vote on his nomination  just like the senate treated the four first term nominees of  democratic  presidents  bill  clinton and obama   a rally outside the supreme court building staged by liberal groups drew hundreds of demonstrators against gorsuch   michael keegan  president of the liberal advocacy group people for the american way  described gorsuch as an  ideological warrior who puts his own right wing politics above the constitution   gorsuch is the son of anne burford  the first woman to head the u s  environmental protection agency  she served in republican president ronald reagan s administration but resigned in  amid a fight with congress over documents on the epa s use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide  trump s selection was one of the most consequential appointments of his young presidency as he moved to restore a conservative majority on the supreme court that had been in place for decades until scalia died at age  on feb      trump s fellow republicans hold a   senate majority  meaning some democratic votes would be needed to confirm his pick under current rules  trump said last week he would favor senate republicans eliminating the procedural move that democrats have promised  called a filibuster  for supreme court nominees if democrats block his pick  such a change has been dubbed the  nuclear option    trump has said his promise to appoint a conservative justice was one of the reasons he won the nov   presidential election  with christian conservatives and others emphasizing the importance of the pick during the campaign  if confirmed  gorsuch would expand the court s conservative wing  made up of john roberts  anthony kennedy samuel alito and thomas  kennedy long has been considered the court s pivotal vote  sometimes siding with the liberals in key cases such as the june  ruling striking down abortion restrictions in texas  the court s restored conservative majority likely would be supportive toward the death penalty and gun rights and hostile toward campaign finance limits  scalia s replacement also could be pivotal in cases involving abortion  religious rights  presidential powers  transgender rights  voting rights  federal regulations others  gorsuch boasts ivy league credentials  attending columbia university and  like several of the other justices on the court  harvard law school  he also completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at oxford university  spent several years in private practice and worked in george w  bush s justice department  gorsuch joined an opinion in  saying that owners of private companies could object on religious grounds to a provision of the obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women  as long as kennedy and four liberals remain on the bench  the court is not expected to pare back abortion rights as many u s  conservatives fervently hope  the supreme court legalized abortion in the landmark  roe v  wade ruling  in june  the justices ruled   to strike down a texas law that restricted abortion access  with kennedy and the liberals in the majority  the current vacancy is the court s longest since a  day void from  to  during republican richard nixon s presidency  after abe fortas resigned from the court in may   the senate voted down two nominees put forward by nixon before confirming harry blackmun  who became a justice in june   aside from that one  no other supreme court vacancy since the u s  civil war years of the  has been as long as the current one  trump may get to make additional appointments  liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg  who trump called upon to resign last july after she called him  a faker   is  while kennedy is   stephen breyer  another liberal  is    corrects disciple to discipline in paragraph
