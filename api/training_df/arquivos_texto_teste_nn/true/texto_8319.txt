washington  reuters    republican u s  senators john mccain and marco rubio won their party s nominations on tuesday to seek re election in arizona and florida in november  as both of the high profile politicians defeated insurgent challengers  mccain  the  failed republican presidential candidate  now faces a spirited challenge in arizona from democrat ann kirkpatrick  who has served in the u s  house of representatives since  and wants to move to the senate  mccain has said this year s race could be the toughest of a political career spanning more than three decades  in advancing to the general election  the  year old mccain handily beat ex state senator kelli ward    a conservative tea party activist and a follower of republican presidential candidate donald trump  like mccain  rubio also is girding for a potentially tough challenge on nov    also in florida  u s  representative debbie wasserman schultz overcame a challenger   and the embarrassment of being stripped last month of her job as head of the democratic national committee   and will get a shot at a seventh house term in the nov   general elections  she beat law professor tim canova  an outspoken wall street critic aligned with u s  senator bernie sanders  the non traditional campaigns of trump and sanders  who exceeded expectations in his failed democratic white house bid  spurred speculation that other insurgent politicians could make an impact this year  but that didn t happen in either of the closely watched nominating races in florida and arizona  rubio  who abandoned his presidential campaign in march  cleared the initial hurdle in his battle for a second six year term in the u s  senate  he defeated novice politician carlos beruff  a millionaire homebuilder  who embraced trump  u s  representative patrick murphy  a democrat  won his party s senate nomination on tuesday  and is expected to give g rubio a tough fight  especially if democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton leads trump in florida  there is speculation that rubio might still harbor presidential ambitions after media reports this week that he had refused to commit to serving all six years of a senate term if he were re elected  trump has endorsed mccain and rubio in their re election bids even though he has rocky relations with both  how mccain and rubio fare could have a big say in whether republicans can defy expectations and maintain majority control of the senate after november s election   the balance of the senate and the outcome of the presidential election are all hanging on florida   rubio predicted in a fundraising appeal late on tuesday   trump offended mccain and many other republicans last year by suggesting the maverick senator was anything but a war hero because he was captured during the vietnam war after his airplane was shot down during a bombing mission  in march  trump ended rubio s presidential run by trouncing him in the florida primary to cap a race in which the new york businessman taunted the first term senator as  little marco   rubio fired back  insulting trump on everything from his hair color and the size of his hands to misspelled words in tweets  during their re election efforts  both mccain and rubio have offered support for trump as the party s white house nominee and steered clear of attacks on that might antagonize trump s core supporters  but they have tiptoed around trump  mainly out of concern that his provocative comments on illegal immigration  muslims and u s  support for nato could alienate moderate and independent voters in their states   this version of the story corrects mccain s failed presidential bid in second paragraph to   from
