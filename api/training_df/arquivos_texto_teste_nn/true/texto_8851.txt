washington  reuters    the fbi s harsh criticism of hillary clinton s use of a private email system as u s  secretary of state could make it difficult for some of her closest aides to keep or renew government security clearances  but it would not affect clinton herself if she is elected president  experts said  federal bureau of investigation director james comey said on tuesday an fbi investigation had found evidence that clinton  now the presumptive democratic presidential candidate  and her aides  were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information  at the state department   comey said he would not recommend that the justice department bring criminal charges   a recommendation accepted by attorney general loretta lynch on wednesday   but the fbi director noted that people found to have been similarly careless often face consequences in the form of  security or administrative sanctions    most administrative sanctions  anything from a reprimand to a dismissal  can t be imposed on clinton and three of her closest aides cheryl mills  jake sullivan and huma abedin as they have already left government  experts of the government s classified information regime said  but legal experts said that if clinton aides were found to have treated classified material with extreme carelessness that could give the government reason to consider denying them a security clearance in the future or suspending or revoking one they may currently have    if the system is fair and equitable  then they should all have difficulty maintaining or obtaining a security clearance in the future   said mark zaid  a washington d c  based attorney who specializes in national security matters  steven aftergood  a federation of american scientists expert on national security and classification policy  noted  however  that comey had highlighted what he called a problematic security culture at the state department   so it might be hard to penalize individuals for this episode if their entire agency embraced similar practices   aftergood said   a justice department spokesperson declined to elaborate on comey s statement  which did not name any of the aides  the clinton campaign did not respond to questions about the security clearances of clinton  mills  sullivan and abedin  nor did lawyers for the three aides   abedin  who has been a personal aide to clinton for about  years  and sullivan  clinton s policy director at the state department  sent information the government now says is classified to clinton s unauthorized private email account  according to email records released by the state department  it remains unclear if they sent any of the  emails that comey said contained information that was classified at the time they were written  the only author of such emails he identified was clinton herself  a small number of other department colleagues sent  information the government has since marked as classified to clinton s account less frequently  the records show  the government forbids handling classified government secrets outside secured channels it controls  clinton has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information through her private email server  both abedin and sullivan now hold senior roles in clinton s presidential campaign and are widely expected to join a clinton administration if she is elected on nov     mills  who also passed along information the government now deems classified  has continued to work as a lawyer for clinton but has no formal role in the campaign  it unclear if she will seek a role in a clinton administration  some presidential appointments require senate confirmation  and lawmakers could use any past criticism of an aide s handling of government secrets as a reason to block their appointment to a senate confirmed job  said william j  leonard  a former director of the federal government s information security oversight office  the state department declined to discuss individual cases and said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly disclose who has a security clearance  but it said it can apply security sanctions  such as putting a black mark on a person s permanent personnel file that would come up in future background checks  even against former employees  for those former officials who maintain an active security clearance  they could lose it   department policy is to maintain files on personnel who are found to have mishandled information to guide current and potential future decisions about employment and security clearances   john kirby  a department spokesman  said in a statement   without knowing precisely what the fbi found about the actions of specific clinton aides  it is impossible to say what  effect there may be on their current or future security clearances  paul ryan  the house speaker and the most senior elected republican official  said on wednesday that clinton should be denied the security clearance required to receive the customary intelligence briefing that government officials give to presidential nominees before the election  presidents and other elected national officeholders are not required to have background checks to receive government secrets  according to experts and the central intelligence agency   it would roil our system of representative democracy if a security official could say that the president     can t have a security clearance   said mcadoo gordon  an attorney with extensive experience in security clearance matters
