incheon  south korea  reuters    lpga chief mike whan says the tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the  us women s open at a course owned by presidential nominee donald trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women  the united states golf association  usga  is facing calls to move the event from trump national golf club in new jersey in nine months  time after a  video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent  whan told reuters in an interview on saturday at the lpga klpga co sanctioned keb hana bank championship in incheon that he was  lucky  not to have to make that kind of decision  the u s  women s open  the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf  is conducted by the usga    in a strange way i m lucky that the lpga has no direct dealings with donald trump or donald trump properties   he said   like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides  i m not here to be a politician  i know that what the players want is that i don t get so political as to limit opportunities for women   all i ve said to the usga is this   you have long since proven you support women s golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then we re right there with you    whan took over in  when the lpga tour was buckling from the fallout of the u s  recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuit s resurgence  one look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the women s game   the word  commissioner  emblazoned in english  korean  chinese and japanese  whan said he hoped the global flavor of the tour s  schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home   in the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio   he said of a tour which makes stops in china  japan  malaysia  korea and taiwan in a late season asian swing  more than a third of the circuit s tournaments are sponsored by asian firms or organizations   it used to be that one u s  economic downturn could really cripple the lpga   he added   i m not saying that wouldn t happen tomorrow  but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally   whan said now that the tour had been put on a solid footing  with  official money events this year compared to  in   the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones   i think we need to be playing for   million in purse money   he said of future targets   i said that back in  and people thought i was nuts  but that was when we were playing for   million   now we re play for   million and i think we ll get there   the decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule  the evian championship  was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the lpga but whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past   sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional   he added   if we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward  then we would have a real problem
