washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama warned on friday that occupying the oval office  is not a reality show   in a swipe at outspoken republican candidate donald trump who is vying to replace him in the white house   fighting with obama is a battle trump would likely relish as he tries to rally support within his own party  during hard fought republican primary campaigns  the billionaire delighted in responding to attacks from rivals and found that his support grew when he lashed out at his opponents  asked about trump at a media briefing in the white house  obama called on the press and public to weigh past statements by the republican but did not point to any specific issues or remarks    this is not entertainment   obama said  a reference to trump s television background   this is not a reality show  this is a contest for the presidency of the united states   he said  some top republican leaders   u s  house speaker paul ryan among them   are still expressing wariness about trump  who became the party s presumptive nominee this week when two republican rivals dropped out of the white house race  former florida governor jeb bush  who ran unsuccessfully for the republican nomination  posted on facebook that he will not vote for trump   one of the sharpest slights yet against the new york real estate mogul by a senior republican    donald trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character  he has not displayed a respect for the constitution  and  he is not a consistent conservative  these are all reasons why i cannot support his candidacy   bush wrote  adding that he would not vote for likely democratic nominee hillary clinton either  u s  senator lindsey graham from south carolina  who made an unsuccessful bid for president  joined a growing list of republicans who are refusing to support trump and he announced on friday he will also skip the republican convention in july  mitt romney  who won the republican nomination in   is also refusing to support trump  but trump on friday won the endorsement of another former republican presidential nominee  bob dole  who lost to bill clinton in   for trump  finding unifying enemies like obama and hillary clinton could help rally republicans back to his side ahead of the nov   general election      obama is likely to be the feature of much of trump s criticism in the general election  republicans have sought to paint clinton as an extension of the obama administration who would continue all of his policies  since effectively securing the nomination on tuesday  trump has begun testing themes to attack clinton  obama s former secretary of state   on friday  trump took aim at clinton for her use of a private email server while in office  clinton has said she did not send or receive information marked as classified  the fbi is investigating whether laws were broken   the email scandal should take her down but i don t think it s going to because i think she s being protected by the democrats   trump said on  fox   friends   a television news program that attracts a large conservative viewership  trump tried to cast clinton as weak on the economy  which is sure to be one of the main policy issues as the election approaches   if you look at what she s going to do  she s going to be so bad on jobs that wages are going to go down for workers   he said  early general election polls show clinton with a lead both nationally and in key states       clinton has a higher probability than trump of becoming the next president  but the gap between them narrowed this week  according to the online political stock market predictit      a key factor for trump in the general election will be whether he can rally the party behind him  trump has seen some top republicans who previously fought his candidacy now back him  including texas governor rick perry  former vice president dick cheney  whose daughter liz cheney is running for congress in wyoming  said he will support trump  a source close to him said on friday  paul manafort  a top trump adviser  told msnbc that republicans will rally behind the businessman because he has strengthened the party by attracting new supporters   we want to unify the party  but the important thing to remember is donald trump just won a historic victory among  other candidates   manafort said   he is a very strong nominee  his vision that he laid out is not something in question   republican national committee chairman reince priebus has already begun his efforts to rally the party behind trump  saying at an event hosted by politico that behind the scenes the candidate is  more gracious and personable than i think you see at rallies    i think there s work on tone to do   priebus said  adding that he has made that point to trump   i think he gets it  i think you re going to see it  i think you re going to see the change in tone   in addition to changing tone  trump also faces an uphill climb to bring the party together  ryan  the top elected republican in the united states  said on thursday he was not ready to support trump  a sign of lingering establishment concern about the candidate s position on immigration and trade  trump took issue with ryan    paul ryan said that i inherited something very special  the republican party   trump wrote on twitter   wrong  i didn t inherit it  i won it with millions of voters       ryan has invited trump to meet with house of representatives republican leaders next week  ryan s office said on friday  trump s attorney was quoted in media reports on friday as saying the candidate will testify after the november election in a class action lawsuit that accuses him and his now defunct trump university of defrauding people who paid up to    for real estate seminars  a federal judge ordered the trial in san diego to start on nov    which means he will not have to testify while he campaigns  the university case was one of the subjects trump s rivals used to attack him during presidential debates
