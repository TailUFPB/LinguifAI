washington  reuters    president donald trump on thursday vowed to free churches and other tax exempt institutions of a  u s  law banning political activity  drawing fire from critics who accused him of rewarding his evangelical christian supporters and turning houses of worship into political machines  as trump used a prayer breakfast to take aim at a long standing statutory barrier between politics and religion called the johnson amendment  civil liberties and gay rights groups expressed concern that he might consider an executive order to allow government agencies and businesses to deny services to gay people in the name of religious freedom  trump did not reference such an order in his remarks  but he lambasted the johnson amendment  which prohibits tax exempt organizations such as churches and other places of worship  charities and educational institutions from directly or indirectly participating in any political campaign in favor or against a political candidate    i will get rid of and totally destroy the johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution  i will do that  remember   trump told u s  politicians  religious leaders and guests including jordan s king abdullah at the annual national prayer breakfast  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters trump wanted to find ways to make sure people were not penalized for following through on their religious beliefs   a draft executive order on  religious freedom  circulating among advocacy groups would allow government officials to deny marriage licenses to gay couples and let businesses withhold services from gay people  activists said   the white house said it was not working on such an order  trump previously spoke out against the johnson amendment during the campaign and won the support of evangelical christian leaders including liberty university president jerry falwell jr  a change in the law would require action in the republican led u s  congress  and republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would reverse the policy  after trump s remarks  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan told reporters he has  always supported  eliminating the johnson amendment  critics including the group americans united for separation of church and state expressed alarm   president donald trump and his allies in the religious right seek to turn america s houses of worship into miniature political action committees   said the group s executive director  barry lynn   it would also lead some houses of worship to focus on supporting candidates in exchange for financial and other aid  that would be a disaster for both churches and politics in america   lynn said  peter montgomery of the liberal advocacy group people for the american way said trump wants to pay back religious conservatives who helped get him elected  by letting them turn their churches into political machines with tax exempt charitable dollars   scrapping the johnson amendment has been a goal of christian conservatives  who contend it violates free speech and religious freedom rights  the u s  constitution s first amendment guarantees freedom of religion and bars the government from establishing an official religion   we are encouraged to see that president trump understands the very real constitutional violation posed by the johnson amendment and that he is committed to restoring a pastor s right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government retribution   said erik stanley  senior counsel for the conservative christian legal group alliance defending freedom  trump used the opening moments of the usually solemn prayer breakfast to deride actor arnold schwarzenegger  his successor on a reality tv show  for his viewership ratings   trump said schwarzenegger  the republican former governor of california  had disastrous ratings on the nbc reality tv program  celebrity apprentice   which trump previously starred in   they hired a big  big movie star  arnold schwarzenegger  to take my place  and we know how that turned out   trump said   it s been a total disaster      and i want to just pray for arnold if we can  for those ratings  ok   schwarzenegger  who endorsed ohio governor john kasich over trump for the republican presidential nomination  shot back  alluding to the controversies of trump s first two weeks in office   hey donald  i have a great idea   schwarzenegger said in a video   why don t we switch jobs  you take over tv  because you re such an expert in ratings  and i take over your job  and then people can finally sleep comfortably again   spicer later called trump s remarks  light hearted  and part of an  absolutely beautiful  speech  trump a week ago put a  day halt on the u s  refugee program  barred syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a  day suspension on people from seven predominantly muslim countries  iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  trump defended his directive on thursday as crucial to ensuring religious freedom and tolerance in america  and said he wanted to prevent a  beachhead of intolerance  from spreading in the united states  he also called terrorism a fundamental threat to religious freedom   the world is in trouble  but we re going to straighten it out  ok  that s what i do  i fix things   trump said   when you hear about the tough phone calls i m having  don t worry about it   trump added  apparently referring to telephone conversations including one with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull   it s time we re going to be a little tough folks  we re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually  it s not going to happen anymore   trump said
