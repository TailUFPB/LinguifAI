over the course of the u s  presidential campaign  donald trump changed his mind on many issues  but he s been consistent on one foreign policy question  he wants to end american support for syrian opposition groups fighting bashar al assad s regime  trump argues that the united states should expend all of its efforts on fighting islamic state instead    i ve had an opposite view of many people regarding syria   trump told the wall street journal on nov    in his first interview after he won the white house   my attitude was you re fighting syria  syria is fighting isis  and you have to get rid of isis  russia is now totally aligned with syria  and now you have iran  which is becoming powerful  because of us  is aligned with syria    now we re backing rebels against syria  and we have no idea who these people are    even if trump goes ahead with his threat to cut off aid to syrian rebels fighting the assad regime   especially those supported by a covert cia program which provides training and anti tank missiles   the president elect will face another major test of his syria policy soon after he s inaugurated on jan    the united states is supporting two military campaigns simultaneously in syria  one against assad s government and the other against islamic state  trump has made clear that he doesn t view the fight against assad as a u s  priority  but will trump continue a separate pentagon support and training program for the syrian democratic forces  a coalition of rebel groups  which is leading a ground offensive to oust islamic state from the city of raqqa  capital of its self proclaimed caliphate   that campaign started on nov   with a mobilization of about   rebels to encircle raqqa and cut it off from all sides  to deny islamic state the ability to resupply weapons and fighters  the battle to push the jihadists out of raqqa could take months  if it falters under a fledging trump administration  islamic state would have a safe base from which it would unleash new attacks in syria and iraq  and against the west   u s  military planners pushed for the raqqa offensive to start soon after the long awaited invasion to recapture iraq s second largest city  mosul  from the militants began in mid october  pentagon officials say they fear that islamic state operatives  including some who fled the mosul offensive  will use raqqa to plot attacks against western targets   there s a sense of urgency about what we have to do here because we re just not sure what they re  up to  and where  and when   the top u s  military commander in iraq  lt  general stephen townsend  said at a news conference on oct    in baghdad   but we know that this plot planning is emanating from raqqa    trump says he wants to avoid direct u s  involvement in the syrian conflict  which has expanded into a regional proxy war  russia and iran  along with allied militias like lebanon s hezbollah  are helping assad consolidate control and recapture territory he lost to the rebels and jihadist groups  assad and his backers have rarely fought directly against islamic state  which controls raqqa and other parts of eastern syria  turkey  saudi arabia  qatar and the united states are backing various rebel factions that are fighting assad and his allies  and  at times  islamic state   under barack obama s administration  the cia has funneled up to   billion a year in weapons  including light arms  ammunition and anti tank missiles  to syrian rebel groups fighting the assad regime that were deemed moderate by u s  officials  but some of these rebels have been forced into battlefield alliances with jihadists  including al qaeda affiliated groups   while the offensive against islamic state in raqqa began in the waning days of the obama administration  it needs support from the incoming trump administration to bear fruit  but the raqqa operation is already alienating american allies  especially turkey  which is critical of the syrian democratic forces  the sdf is a coalition of kurdish  sunni arab  christian and turkmen rebel groups that is anchored by the people s protection units  known by its kurdish acronym  ypg   which includes thousands of syrian kurdish fighters   turkish leaders view the ypg and other syrian kurdish groups as allies of the kurdistan workers  party  known as the pkk   which has waged an insurgency against the turkish government since the   seeking autonomy for kurdish areas  turkish president recep tayyip erdogan insists that washington must not allow the ypg to take a leading role in expelling islamic state from raqqa  a largely sunni arab city   during the presidential campaign  trump argued the united states should arm and help kurdish factions  both in iraq and syria   i m a big fan of the kurdish forces   he said in july  if trump follows through on his praise of the kurds  that would be good news for the sdf and its largest militia  the ypg   but once in office  trump would also have to balance the objections of allies like turkey and erdogan  its increasingly autocratic president  among his first top appointments  trump named michael flynn  a retired general and former head of the defense intelligence agency  as his national security adviser  flynn  who once worked as a paid lobbyist for a prominent turkish businessman  has expressed strong support for erdogan s government and argued that washington should be more sympathetic to its concerns   in late august  turkey sent several hundred of its special forces into syria  and began carrying out air strikes to help rebel factions allied with ankara consolidate control of territory near the turkish syrian border  the turkish backed rebels have fought both islamic state jihadists and occasionally the u s  backed ypg militia   in october  erdogan said he told obama in a phone call that turkey was capable of ousting islamic state from raqqa on its own  other turkish officials argued that the campaign to retake raqqa should not begin until iraqi forces complete their offensive against islamic state in mosul  which has slowed in recent weeks   but u s  officials are keen to isolate raqqa and use syrian forces to encircle it  mainly because of worries about islamic state operatives fleeing from mosul and plotting new attacks against the west  that concern is genuine because the jihadist group   even as it was weakened over the past year  after intensive u s  led bombing and defeats by its opponents in iraq and syria   has shown a significant ability to adapt and inflict new terror   in the coming months  islamic state will find new ways to endure an american orchestrated offensive on raqqa  it will try to take advantage of the change in u s  administration  and once he s in office  trump will discover that fighting and containing islamic state inevitably means wading into syria s complicated war
