washington  reuters    representative ryan zinke of montana  president elect donald trump s nominee for secretary of interior  on tuesday said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure sensitive areas remain protected  the former navy seal sought to outline a measured approach to the job of managing america s national parks  forests and tribal lands during a four hour senate confirmation hearing that was mostly cordial  lacking some of the hot tempered grilling that has marked other sessions to vet trump s cabinet nominees   yes   he said in response to a question from republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska about whether he would review drilling curbs imposed by president barack obama s administration in her state  home to vast petroleum deposits both onshore and beneath arctic waters   i can guarantee you it is better to produce energy domestically under reasonable regulation than overseas with no regulation     we need an economy   but he added he was committed to protecting sensitive wildlife habitats and to keeping federal lands under federal control to ensure they are preserved for future generations  so  my granddaughter s children can look back and say that we did it right   the interior department oversees territories covering a fifth of the united states  surface from the arctic to the gulf of mexico  including rich deposits of oil  gas and coal and important pasturelands for ranchers  zinke  an avid hunter and angler  emerged as a surprise pick to head the department in part because he has embraced federal stewardship of public land  diverging from the republican party s official position to sell off acreage to states  but as a congressman he has also fought for increased energy development  a position that has worried conservationists and which fits neatly with trump s campaign vows to bolster the u s  energy sector by scaling back regulation  over the last eight years  the interior department has sought to limit industry access to federal lands and played a key role in obama s agenda to combat climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emitting industries  under obama  the department banned new coal mining leases on federal property early in   more recently the agency placed parts of the offshore arctic and atlantic off limits to drilling and declared national monuments that protect large parts of utah and nevada from development  zinke said he believed trump could  amend  obama s moves to declare millions of acres of federal property as national monuments  but he said that any move trump made to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged  he did not comment directly on whether he would seek to reverse obama s federal coal lease ban but said he believed coal plays an important part in the u s  energy mix and has previously pushed to end the moratorium  zinke was the first of three cabinet heads trump has chosen to oversee his environment and energy portfolio to face senate scrutiny this week  all three have opposed obama s measures to combat global climate change by targeting carbon dioxide emissions  trump s pick to lead the environmental protection agency  oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  was to testify on wednesday  and trump s choice for energy secretary  former texas governor rick perry  was to testify on thursday  zinke told committee members that he believes humans contribute to global climate change   a statement that appeared to clash with trump s views  before running for the white house  trump called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the chinese to weaken u s  businesses  a position he has since defended   i do not think it is a hoax   zinke said  but he added that he believed there is still debate over the degree to which humans have an impact  and what should be done about it  adding that regulations could sometimes hurt jobs without helping the environment   he said  for example  he would support efforts by the u s  congress to cancel recent regulation imposed by the interior department s bureau of land management aimed at preventing leaks of methane   another gas scientists blame for climate change   from oil and gas installations  in his opening remarks  zinke struck a moderate tone  saying that he recognizes that some federal lands require strong protection  he also called himself an  unapologetic admirer of teddy roosevelt   a former republican president who pioneered public land conservation  zinke also said he would tackle a multi billion dollar backlog in maintenance at national parks and promised to ensure greater sovereignty for tribes
