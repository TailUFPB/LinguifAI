washington  reuters    some republican senators tried on friday to craft a compromise bill to impose limited gun restrictions in the face of pressure from democrats and public rage over the orlando mass shooting  the deadliest in modern u s  history  a gunman killed  people at the orlando  florida  gay nightclub last sunday  sparking a scramble over competing gun measures in the u s  senate  while past gun control measures have failed to clear congress  the massacre  coupled with public pressure and a suggestion by republican presidential candidate donald trump that he can work with gun rights lobbyists to bring about change  may be changing the picture  republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on americans  right to bear arms as guaranteed under the u s  constitution  during a week long senate debate  democrats generally have criticized proposed republican measures as being ineffective  republicans and democrats have offered four separate proposals to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales for people on terrorism  watch lists   but they seem destined to fail because of partisan politics and a requirement that any proposal muster  of the  votes in the u s  senate  republican susan collins of maine  leading the new effort  is considering a more tailored approach  it would prevent the sale of guns to terrorism suspects whose names appear on either the government s  no fly  list  which bans them from boarding planes  or a so called  selectee  list that requires additional screening at airports  her office said in an emailed statement  these lists are much shorter than a broad terrorism watch list kept by the fbi   collins  measure also includes a five year  look back  provision that would notify the government if someone who had been on the  no fly  or  selectee  list in the last five years  but was dropped  purchases a gun   that would allow the fbi to put the individual under surveillance or take other appropriate action it deems necessary   collins  office said  the gun control issue is deeply divisive and there have been no major restrictions passed since   when congress imposed a ban on semi automatic assault weapons  that expired after  years  about  percent of americans  including eight out of  democrats and nearly six out of  republicans  favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns  according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted from monday to thursday  that was up from  percent in late  and late       vice president joe biden weighed in on the debate  urging a public groundswell in support of banning the type of weapons that have been used in mass shootings   assault weapons and high capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership   biden said on friday  both the gunman in the orlando attack  omar mateen  and the married couple who carried out a december mass shooting that killed  people in san bernardino  california  were thought to have been inspired by militant islamist groups abroad  collins  proposal likely would be offered in the republican led senate sometime next week  provided the four other gun control proposals fail to pass on monday  collins is working on the legislation with senator jeff flake of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire  she has also been talking to democrats  a senior democratic aide said that democrats have concerns that under collins  bill  some people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban  collins told reporters on thursday that barring everyone on terrorism watch lists from weapons purchases carried with it the risk of affecting people who have been swept onto the lists without good cause  u s  authorities maintain several watch lists   the federal bureau of investigation maintains three and the office of the director of national intelligence runs one database  people are placed on such lists based on the threat level they are believed to pose   what we re trying to do is not deny constitutional rights to a large group of individuals  who find themselves on watch lists despite the fact that there might not be credible evidence of potential criminal intentions  collins said  at least one senate democrat  heidi heitkamp of north dakota  has been involved in the talks  her spokeswoman said    i think she  collins  is sincerely committed to finding a way to work this out   said u s  senator chris murphy who  along with fellow democrats  set the u s  capitol abuzz by talking on the senate floor for nearly  straight hours this week to demand that congress act on gun control  murphy said it was too early to say whether any democrats would get on board with her approach  on friday  the largest lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender advocacy group in the united states  the human rights campaign  said it would push for curtailing access to assault style rifles  expanding background checks for firearms buyers and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists to purchase guns
