washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump formally withdrew the united states from the trans pacific partnership trade deal on monday  distancing america from its asian allies  as china s influence in the region rises  fulfilling a campaign pledge to end american involvement in the  pact  trump signed an executive order in the oval office pulling the united states out of the  nation tpp  trump  who wants to boost u s  manufacturing  said he would seek one on one trade deals with countries that would allow the united states to quickly terminate them in  days  if somebody misbehaves    we re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country   the republican president said as he met with union leaders in the white house s roosevelt room  the tpp accord  backed heavily by u s  business  was negotiated by former democratic president barack obama s administration but never approved by congress   obama had framed tpp  which excluded china  as an effort to write asia s trade rules before beijing could  establishing u s  economic leadership in the region as part of his  pivot to asia   china has proposed a free trade area of the asia pacific and has also championed the southeast asian backed regional comprehensive economic partnership   trump has sparked worries in japan and elsewhere in the asia pacific with his opposition to the tpp and his campaign demands for u s  allies to pay more for their security     his trade stance mirrors a growing feeling among americans that international trade deals have hurt the u s  job market  republicans have long held the view that free trade is a must  but that mood has been changing   it s going to be very difficult to fight that fight   said lanhee chen  a hoover institution fellow who was domestic policy adviser to  republican presidential nominee mitt romney   trump is reflecting a trend that has been apparent for many years   harry kazianis  director of defense studies at the center for the national interest think tank in washington  said trump must now find an alternative way to reassure allies in asia   this could include multiple bilateral trade agreements  japan  taiwan and vietnam should be approached first as they are key to any new asia strategy that president trump will enact   he said  trump is also working to renegotiate the north american free  trade agreement to provide more favorable terms to the united states  telling reporters he would meet leaders of nafta partners mexico and canada to get the process started  the new president met with a dozen american manufacturers at the white house on monday  pledging to slash regulations and cut corporate taxes   but warning them he would take action on trade deals he felt were unfair  trump  who took office on friday  has promised to bring factories back to the united states   an issue he said helped him win the nov   election  he has not hesitated to call out by name companies he thinks should bring outsourced production back home  he said those businesses that choose to move plants outside the country would pay a price   we are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when it comes in   trump said  he asked the group of chief executives from companies including ford motor co  dell technologies inc  tesla motors inc and others to make recommendations in  days to stimulate manufacturing  dow chemical co chief executive officer andrew liveris told reporters  liveris said the ceos discussed the border tax  quite a bit  with trump  explaining  the sorts of industry that might be helped or hurt by that    look  i would take the president at his word here  he s not going to do anything to harm competitiveness   liveris said   he s going to actually make us all more competitive   at part of the meeting observed by reporters  trump provided no details on how the border tax would work   the u s  dollar fell to a seven week low against a basket of other major world currencies on monday  and global stock markets were shaky amid investor concerns about trump s protectionist rhetoric   a company that wants to fire all of its people in the united states  and build some factory someplace else  and then thinks that that product is going to just flow across the border into the united states   that s not going to happen   he said  the president told the ceos he would like to cut corporate taxes to the  percent to  percent range  down from current statutory levels of  percent   a pledge that will require cooperation from the republican led u s  congress  but he said business leaders have told him that reducing regulations is even more important   we think we can cut regulations by  percent  maybe more   trump told business leaders    when you want to expand your plant  or when mark wants to come in and build a big massive plant  or when dell wants to come in and do something monstrous and special   you re going to have your approvals really fast   trump said  referring to mark fields  ceo of ford  fields said he was encouraged by the tone of the meeting   i know i come out with a lot of confidence that the president is very  very serious on making sure that the united states economy is going to be strong and have policies   tax  regulatory or trade   to drive that   he said  trump told the executives that companies were welcome to negotiate with governors to move production between states
