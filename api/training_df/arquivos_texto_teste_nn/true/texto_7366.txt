washington  reuters    republicans in the house of representatives hope to offer president elect donald trump an alternate plan to his proposed u s  mexico border wall  a first test by lawmakers from his own party of one of his key campaign promises  just a day after trump s stunning election victory over democrat hillary clinton  congressional aides told reuters the lawmakers wanted to meet with trump s advisers to discuss a less costly option to his  big  beautiful  powerful wall   the plan would involve more border fencing and additional border staffing with federal agents  many of whom belong to labor unions that supported trump s candidacy  the aides said  double layers of fencing would be extended along parts of the roughly   mile    km  border  rather than constructing a brick and mortar wall  according to the proposal  a house republican aide and a department of homeland security official said a wall was not realistic because it would block visibility for border agents and cut through rugged terrain  as well as bodies of water and private land  the house aide said house republicans working on the alternative plan were waiting for trump s transition team to be put in place before setting a date for the meeting  a spokesman for trump did not respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers  proposal or their desired meeting   mexico said on wednesday that it would not pay for a border wall  as trump has pledged  immigration was a central feature of the trump campaign  focusing on concerns among some voters about illegal immigrants and perceptions they take jobs and pose security risks   before the republican convention in july  party platform committee members successfully petitioned delegates to add language about the proposed wall to the platform statement   but u s  republican representative michael mccaul  chairman of the house homeland security committee  has called a wall along the entire border a  knee jerk  reaction and has not mentioned the idea in legislation on capitol hill   if congress stands up to trump  his wall may end up being a fence extension  said steve legomsky  professor emeritus and immigration law expert at washington university school of law   congress won t fund the kind of wall trump promised  and mexico won t pay for it  but to save face  president trump and congressional leaders will likely agree to a modest extension of the existing border fence   legomsky predicted  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters on wednesday that border security was an important agenda item that he wanted to achieve  in whatever way is the most effective   the national border patrol council  a union representing border agents  said the agency had already had a difficult time meeting hiring goals mandated by congress
