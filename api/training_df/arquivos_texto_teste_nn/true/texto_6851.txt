washington  reuters    u s  republican senators are leaning towards a plan to delay the effective date of an obamacare repeal for three years  a senior republican said on wednesday  but some conservatives in the house of representatives think that is too long to wait for the end of the affordable care act  as president barack obama s signature health insurance program is known   in the senate  there s consensus for three years   senator orrin hatch  chairman of the chamber s finance committee  told reporters  saying it could take that long to work out a replacement for obamacare   it takes time to do things around here   republicans in both the house and senate say they want to repeal obamacare early in   it will be the first order of business in the senate in january  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  said on tuesday  donald trump s election as u s  president last month means republicans will control the white house  senate and house of representatives in   the new congress goes to work on jan    trump will be sworn in on jan    but republicans have not agreed on how quickly the obamacare repeal should go into effect  a delay would give them time to work on a replacement  instead of throwing millions of americans out of their health insurance with no substitute  some house conservatives favor phasing out obamacare and getting a replacement within two years  because three years would not lapse until after the next congressional election  with the attendant uncertainty about who will be in the majority then   we don t think it s very wise to leave a long term plan like that up to a  future  congress that you can t necessarily control   said ben williamson  spokesman for representative mark meadows  the incoming leader of the freedom caucus  a group of about  house conservatives   there is a potential that some members of the freedom caucus might vote against repeal  if the replacement was going beyond two years   williamson said  the affordable care act has provided some  million previously uninsured americans with health coverage  republicans have repeatedly tried to dismantle the law  which they call a government overreach  another senior senator said some republicans are worried about whether they will have to raise taxes in three years to pay for an obamacare replacement  which could for example involve tax credits to subsidize health insurance   what republicans could be faced with in three years  is voting for a tax increase     and that s not exactly a place that republicans relish being   said senator bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee
