 reuters    here are some of the highlights of the reuters interview with u s  president donald trump on thursday  on his december tweet saying the united states should expand its nuclear capability  we ve fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity  and i am the first one that would like to see     nobody have nukes  but we re never going to fall behind any country even if it s a friendly country  we re never going to fall behind on nuclear power  and i did tweet that  it would be wonderful  a dream would be that no country would have nukes  but if countries are going to have nukes  we re going to be at the top of the pack    it s a one sided deal like all other deals we make  it s a one sided deal  it gave them things that we should have never allowed      just another bad deal that the country made  whether it s start  whether it s the iran deal  which is one of the bad deals ever made  our country only made bad deals  we don t make good deals  so we re going to start making good deals   on russia s deployment of a cruise missile in violation of arms control treaty   to me  it s a big deal     if i meet  putin   if and when we meet  i would bring it up  it s a big deal  because it s a violation of an agreement that we have    i know exactly what s going on between china and north korea and everybody else  but i don t like talking about military strategy in newspapers     i m not liking it  this didn t take place under the trump administration  this took place under the obama administration  many things took place that should not have been allowed  one of them is the building of a massive  you know  massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea  and don t forget i ve only been here for four weeks  this is something that took place and has been started three years ago and you were in a much better negotiating position three years ago  i am not happy about it    i think they re grand champions at manipulation of currency  so i haven t held back  we ll see what happens    well  we appreciate that  you know  i have a very  very good  i ve had very good phone calls with the president  president xi  and i ve had very  very good talks with him  and the call is a start  but we have a very big problem and a very dangerous problem for the world with north korea      i think china has tremendous control over north korea  whether they say so or not is up to them  but they have tremendous control over north korea  i think they could solve the problem very easily if they want to    it s very dangerous and something should have been done about it years ago  it s very dangerous and very unacceptable      and very unfair to japan   on talk of accelerating missile defense system for japan and south korea  there s talks of a lot more than that  we ll see what happens  but it s a very dangerous situation  and china can end it very quickly in my opinion      it s one of many things that can be done  missile defense is one of many things that can be done   on whether meeting with korean leader kim jong un is a possibility  i guess     i would never say no  it may be very late  it s very late in the picture right now      we re very angry at what he s done  and frankly this should have been taken care of during the obama administration   on the border adjustment tax promoted by republicans in congress  it could lead to a lot more jobs in the united states      i certainly support a form of tax on the border because everybody else does  we re the only country  we re one of the very few countries  possibly the only country  that has no border tax  and that s not a tax to the consumer  because that s going to be a tax to companies and it s going to be a tax to other countries much more so than it is to the consumer  that s a tax to other countries  and what will happen is  don t forget there is no tax if we make our product in the united states  so i don t consider it a tax  that s a tax if companies are buying their product outside of the united states  but     if they make their product in the united states  there is no tax  so what is going to happen is companies are going to come back here  they re going to build their factories and they re going to create a lot of jobs and there s no tax    we re going to have a corporate tax cut     anywhere from  to  percent  as a target for the corporate tax rate       we re going to have other things that are very good and we re going to have a tremendous regulatory cut because the regulations are piled up on top of each other and you ll have many regulations for the same thing within different industries and it s out of control  the regulations in this country are out of control  and it makes it hard for businesses to even open in the united states  we re going to get rid of a lot of the unnecessary regulations    we re going to submit legislation  we re going to be working with congress to do legislation  yes       we re mandated to do the healthcare first  we have to  and that s for budgetary reasons  so the healthcare will come first  it s moving along really well  i would say before the middle of march      we have a very  very good healthcare plan which will give great healthcare to great numbers of people  we have to also remember  obamacare is a disaster  it doesn t work  it just doesn t work  so we have a plan that will be a far better plan which will cost people less money  which will cost our country less money also  cause obamacare is very expensive for the country  and we will be submitting sometime during the month of march      it d be repeal and replace      the tax reform comes immediately thereafter    the economy  we have close to  million people that are not working  we re going to get the economy revving again through meetings like i had today with the biggest companies in the world and the biggest manufacturers in the world  through tax reform  and through regulatory reform  and it will take a little period of time  but yeah  we re going to have  i mean  we had massive deficits under obama  under president obama  massive deficits  and until it gets kicked in  there ll be some deficits but something which we can very easily handle    we have a   billion trade deficit with mexico  which is unacceptable  unacceptable  on top of the   billion  many of our jobs and companies have fled to mexico  and that  and they sell their product back in the united states  it s just not acceptable  so  hopefully  we ll be able to work something out with mexico  we ll see  maybe we will  maybe we won t      we have the right to do a lot of things that i haven t done yet  we have a lot of rights that people don t know about and they never did know about until i came along   on the two state solution in israel  i like the concept of the two state solution  people have been talking about it for so many years now  it so far hasn t worked  but i am satisfied with whatever makes both parties happy    i do  sure  i have very good relations with the eu  but i thought that the uk would pull out of brexit and i was right       but the eu  i m totally in favor of it  i think it s wonderful  if they re happy  if they re happy   i m in favor of it    remember the first time i talked about nato  i said they all owe money  the first time anyone ever asked me a question about nato     i said two things  it s obsolete because it doesn t cover terrorism  they have now opened up a division to cover terrorism  solely because of me  and experts on nato that do nothing but study it said   you know  trump is right   and i knew nothing about nato  i mean  i knew very little about nato      but you watch what s going to happen  they re paying  they re paying big league      they owe a lot of money  many countries owe a lot money  number one   percent is a low number  and number two  only five countries are paid up
