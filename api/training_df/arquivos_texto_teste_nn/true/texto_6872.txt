washington  reuters    the republican head of a house of representatives committee said on tuesday he was offering a bill to keep the u s  government funded through april  ahead of a friday deadline to keep agencies running  house appropriations chairman hal rogers said in a statement the short term continuing resolution would fund the federal government until april   and included money for emergency disaster relief  the move would give incoming republican president elect donald trump more of a say on budget and appropriations issues  allowing him to set funding priorities for the remainder of fiscal year   which ends on sept     the bill also contains a provision that will make it easier for trump s choice as defense secretary  general james mattis  to pass a bureaucratic hurdle to his appointment  since he retired only in   mattis will need congress to waive a requirement that he be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the pentagon  rogers expressed disappointment at having to offer the bill  which suspends months of work by lawmakers and their staffs on full scale appropriations bills congress had intended to enact before the end of the year   this type of short term spending absolutely should not be the final answer to funding the federal government for the year   he said in the statement   this legislation is just a band aid  but a critical one  it will give the next congress the time to complete the annual appropriations process  and in the meantime  take care of immediate national funding needs   rogers added  democrats and some republicans have said such a decision was a mistake that could lead to a more difficult appropriations task next year
