washington  reuters    the department of homeland security has prepared new guidance for immigration agents aimed at speeding up deportations by denying asylum claims earlier in the process   the new guidelines  contained in a draft memo dated february  but not yet sent to field offices  directs agents to only pass applicants who have a good chance of ultimately getting asylum  but does not give specific criteria for establishing credible fear of persecution if sent home    the guidance instructs asylum officers to  elicit all relevant information  in determining whether an applicant has  credible fear  of persecution if returned home  the first obstacle faced by migrants on the u s  mexico border requesting asylum   graphic  tmsnrt rs   three sources familiar with the drafting of the guidance said the goal of the new instructions is to raise the bar on initial screening in order to ease strain on the courts and reduce the number of immigrants allowed to stay in the united states  often for years  while they await a hearing  the administration s plan is to leave wide discretion to asylum officers by allowing them to determine which applications have a  significant possibility  of being approved by an immigration court  the sources said  the guidance was first reported and posted on the internet by mcclatchy news organization  in   just  percent of asylum applicants whose cases were ruled on by immigration judges were granted asylum  according to the justice department  applicants from countries with a high rate of political persecution have a higher chance of winning their asylum cases   a tougher approach to asylum seekers would be an element of president donald trump s promise to crack down on immigration and tighten border security  a cornerstone of his election campaign and a top priority of his first month in office  the guidelines are contained in two draft memos signed by homeland security secretary john kelly and currently under review by the white house  according to two people familiar with them  the memos also outlined plans for greatly expanding the categories of people that immigration agents target for deportation  and gives them wide discretion in deciding who to deport  previously  recent arrivals and convicted criminals were the prime targets  the new plan would include migrants who have been charged but not convicted of crimes  and would also apply to illegal immigrants who have been in the country for many years  the memos also call for quickly hiring   more immigration and customs enforcement agents as well as   more border patrol agents  the dhs declined to comment for this story  referring questions to the white house  which did not respond to a request for comment  under the immigration and nationality act  an applicant must generally demonstrate  a well founded fear of persecution on account of race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion     immigration lawyers say any applicants who appear to meet that criteria in their initial interviews should be allowed to make their cases in court  they oppose encouraging asylum officers to take a stricter stance on questioning claims and rejecting applications   interviews to assess credible fear are conducted almost immediately after an asylum request is made  often at the border or in detention facilities by immigration agents or asylum officers  and most applicants easily clear that hurdle  between july and september of   u s  asylum officers accepted nearly  percent of the claims of credible fear  according to u s  citizenship and immigration services data  asylum seekers who fail the credible fear test can be quickly deported unless they file an appeal  currently  those who pass the test are eventually released and allowed to remain in the united states awaiting hearings  which are often scheduled years into the future because of a backlog of more than   cases in immigration courts  between october  and april   nearly   migrants claimed credible fear   percent of whom were from honduras  el salvador  guatemala or mexico  according to statistics from uscis   the number of migrants from those three countries who passed credible fear and went to court to make their case for asylum rose sharply between  and   from   claims to    according to data from the justice department   former border patrol chief mike fisher credits that trend to advice from immigration lawyers who know  asylum officers are going to err on the side of caution and refer most cases to a judge    the new guidance on asylum seekers is for border personnel implementing trump s jan   executive order on tightening u s  border security   among other measures  the president s directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the united states and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected  some immigration officers familiar with the draft guidance say they are concerned that a rapid increase in deportations of asylum seekers could strain overcrowded detention facilities and create transportation problems   deportations take time and coordination  even when immigrants are quickly targeted for expulsion  u s  officials must get approval from a deportee s home country before repatriation can take place  and transportation can be complicated and expensive  immigrants from non contiguous countries are flown home by plane  while mexicans are often bused across the border    homeland security personnel who worked on the guidance say they hope to expand detention space by at least   beds  the money to pay for that would require congressional sign off  the extra beds  they say  would further the president s goal  expressed in his executive order on border security  of ending the practice known as  catch and release  in which migrants  including asylum seekers  are freed pending a court hearing  the new guidance calls for expanding detention  but acknowledges that ending the practice  may not be immediately possible    a congressional aide familiar with the administration s plans said dhs is considering expanding its contracts with private prison companies like geo group  geo n  and corecivic  cxw n   which currently hold most immigrant detainees  immigrants rights advocates say they fear that raising the bar on the credible fear test could screen out migrants with a rightful claim to asylum  because asylum officers may dismiss cases that could make it through court if the asylum seeker were given legal counsel  said marielena hincapie  executive director of the national immigration law center      asylum applicants have the right to appeal denials of credible fear claims and may request to see a judge to assert their claim to be in the united states for other reasons  such as family ties  for that reason  raising the bar on credible fear might not deter asylum seekers as much as the trump administration hopes  said former border patrol head fisher
