 washington  reuters    donald trump is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in the white house on friday to take the opening steps to crack down on immigration  build a wall on the u s  mexican border and roll back outgoing president barack obama s policies   trump  a republican elected on nov   to succeed democrat obama  arrived in washington on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the u s  capitol   aides said trump would not wait to wield one of the most powerful tools of his office  the presidential pen  to sign several executive actions that can be implemented without the input of congress    he is committed to not just day   but day   day  of enacting an agenda of real change  and i think that you re going to see that in the days and weeks to come   trump spokesman sean spicer said on thursday  telling reporters to expect activity on friday  during the weekend and early next week   more from reuters    trumponomics may be wrong medicine for u s  economy today    graphic  the presidential touch on markets    politics live  latest on trump s inauguration trump plans on saturday to visit the headquarters of the cia in langley  virginia  he has harshly criticized the agency and its outgoing chief  first questioning the cia s conclusion that russia was involved in cyber hacking during the u s  election campaign  before later accepting the verdict  trump also likened u s  intelligence agencies to nazi germany   trump s advisers vetted more than  potential executive orders for him to consider signing on healthcare  climate policy  immigration  energy and numerous other issues  but it was not clear how many orders he would initially approve  according to a member of the trump transition team who was not authorized to talk to the press   signing off on orders puts trump  who has presided over a sprawling business empire but has never before held public office  in a familiar place similar to the ceo role that made him famous  and will give him some early victories before he has to turn to the lumbering process of getting congress to pass bills   the strategy has been used by other presidents  including obama  in their first few weeks in office    he wants to show he will take action and not be stifled by washington gridlock   said princeton university presidential historian julian zelizer   trump is expected to impose a federal hiring freeze and take steps to delay a labor department rule due to take effect in april that would require brokers who give retirement advice to put their clients  best interests first   he also will give official notice he plans to withdraw from the  nation trans pacific partnership trade deal and renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico  spicer said   i think you will see those happen very shortly   spicer said   obama  ending eight years as president  made frequent use of his executive powers during his second term in office  when the republican controlled congress stymied his efforts to overhaul immigration and environmental laws  many of those actions are now ripe targets for trump to reverse   trump is expected to sign an executive order in his first few days to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with mexico  and actions to limit the entry of asylum seekers from latin america  among several immigration related steps his advisers have recommended   that includes rescinding obama s order that allowed more than   people brought into the united states illegally as children to stay in the country on a two year authorization to work and attend college  according to several people close to the presidential transition team   it is unlikely trump s order will result in an immediate roundup of these immigrants  sources told reuters  rather  he is expected to let the authorizations expire   the issue could set up a confrontation with obama  who told reporters on wednesday he would weigh in if he felt the new administration was unfairly targeting those immigrants   advisers to trump expect him to put restrictions on people entering the united states from certain countries until a system for  extreme vetting  for islamist extremists can be set up   during his presidential campaign  trump proposed banning non american muslims from entering the united states  but his executive order regarding immigration is expected to be based on nationality rather than religion   another proposed executive order would require all cabinet departments to disclose and pause current work being done in connection with obama s initiatives to curb carbon emissions to combat climate change   trump also is expected to extend prohibitions on future lobbying imposed on members of his transition team   washington was turned into a virtual fortress ahead of the inauguration  with police ready to step in to separate protesters from trump supporters at any sign of unrest   as obama packed up to leave the white house  trump and his family laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in arlington national cemetery and attended a concert at the lincoln memorial   trump spoke earlier to lawmakers and cabinet nominees at a luncheon in a ballroom at his hotel  down the street from the white house  announcing during brief remarks that he would pick woody johnson  owner of the new york jets of the national football league  as u s  ambassador to britain    we have a lot of smart people  i tell you what  one thing we ve learned  we have by far the highest iq of any cabinet ever assembled   trump said   trump has selected all  members of his cabinet  along with six other key positions requiring senate confirmation  the senate is expected on friday to vote to confirm retired general james mattis  trump s pick to lead the pentagon  and retired general john kelly  his homeland security choice   senate republicans had hoped to confirm as many as seven cabinet members on friday  but democrats balked at the pace  trump spokesman spicer accused senate democrats of  stalling tactics    also in place for monday will be   beachhead team members  at government agencies  vice president elect mike pence said  a small portion of the thousands of positions obama s appointees will vacate   trump has asked  obama staffers in critical posts to stay on until replacements can be found  including deputy defense secretary robert work and brett mcgurk  envoy to the u s  led coalition fighting islamic state   the list includes adam szubin  who has long served in an  acting  capacity in the treasury department s top anti terrorism job because his nomination has been held up by congressional republicans since obama named him to the job in april    the supreme court said u s  chief justice john roberts  who will administer the oath of office on friday  met with trump on thursday to discuss inauguration arrangements
