washington  reuters    u s  immigration enforcement officers are proposing that fingerprints be taken from all people claiming custody of children who have entered the united states illegally without an adult relative  a measure that opponents said could keep thousands of families apart  as a new wave of unaccompanied central american children pours across the u s  mexico border  the proposal underscores the sometimes conflicting goals of federal agencies in dealing with undocumented immigrants  a volatile issue on the presidential campaign trail  officials at the u s  department of health and human services  hhs   which is ultimately responsible for finding housing for migrant children  told reuters they have no plans to change fingerprinting policy  they said the proposal   made by u s  immigration and customs enforcement  ice  officials in an internal memo seen by reuters   would delay family reunions and infringe upon the parent child relationship   one of our goals is to place children with an appropriate sponsor as promptly as we can safely do so  and so any delay for placing the child with their parent is time that we re keeping a parent and child separated   said bobbie gregg  deputy director for children s services at hhs s office of refugee resettlement  the memo by ice officials  drafted in response to a february senate hearing  proposes expanding fingerprinting  now limited to non parents  to include parents  ice says that would allow fingerprints to be checked against an fbi database of criminals to verify the identities of people who say they are parents while ensuring that children do not go to parents who have criminal histories  the proposal is preliminary and could change  it was unclear whether it would ultimately win the backing of the white house  department of homeland security  dhs    which oversees ice   and the justice department advise hhs on its practices and have a role in enforcing overall immigration policy  the white house declined to comment on the proposal  asked about the documents that describe the fingerprinting proposal  a homeland security spokeswoman said the agency does not discuss internal deliberations  neither ice nor hhs would comment on whether they have had discussions on the proposal  from january  to april   more than   parents claimed children who entered the united states from el salvador  guatemala and honduras  according to a study by the government accountability office  gao   a congressional watchdog unit  they made up  percent of those who claimed children  with most of the rest claimed by other relatives  only  non relative sponsors claimed children  u s  authorities are required to find housing for illegal immigrant minors while they await a trial to determine whether they will be deported  a process that can take years  under current law  people who appear at child migrant holding facilities saying they are parents must show the child s birth certificate to prove the relationship  if that is not available  the parent and child must undergo a dna test  immigration advocates say the ice proposal would discourage parents from sending for their children and claiming them  fearing that ice would use fingerprinting to trace undocumented immigrants for possible deportation   it could keep parents away from their children if they think it is going to land them in a lock up somewhere   said david leopold  a cleveland lawyer who formerly headed the american immigration lawyers association  the ice officials also said in the memo that the agency supports expanding immigration status checks to all sponsors  including parents  ice acknowledged that conducting immigration checks on parents claiming children could  reduce the likelihood that sponsors would come forward to take custody of children   illegal entry into the united states by unaccompanied minors has surged in recent years  most are central american children who make the dangerous journey across mexico and the u s  border without their parents  fleeing poverty and violence  in the six months through march   almost   unaccompanied children were apprehended crossing into the united states  close to the record high number hit in the same period in    graphic on unaccompanied minor crossings and relationships to sponsors  tmsnrt rs   an investigation by the associated press in january found that hhs had placed some migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted  starved or forced into labor for no pay  none of the known abusers had claimed to be parents  a senate panel in february asked authorities to improve screening of adults claiming custody of child migrants   the document from ice is a draft of answers to questions senate judiciary chairman charles grassley submitted for the record following the hearing  after the ap investigation  hhs said it began doing  day follow up checks on households to which it had assigned a child  while also giving an emergency hotline phone number to all children before they are discharged from hhs custody but ice s response to grassley said hhs should go a step further  noting that many state and local child protective service agencies routinely fingerprint parents who reclaim children after periods of separation
