washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on friday ordered reviews of major banking rules that were put in place after the  financial crisis  drawing fire from democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with wall street bankers  though the order was short on specifics  financial markets embraced trump s signal that looser banking regulation is coming and pushed bank stocks higher  the dow jones u s  banks stocks index closed up   percent   djusbk   at a white house forum on friday with u s  business leaders  including jpmorgan chase s  jpm n  ceo jamie dimon  trump said his administration expects  to be cutting a lot out of dodd frank   that will involve a lot more than issuing an order  said former democratic congressman barney frank  co author of the  dodd frank wall street reform law that raised capital requirements for banks  restricted their trading by means of the  volcker rule   and created the consumer financial protection bureau to guard against predatory lending  trump  can t make any substantial change in the financial reform bill without congress   frank told reuters   the language in the order doesn t do anything  it tells the secretary of the treasury to give them something to read  the tone of it is to weaken the bill   trump and other critics of the dodd frank law say its regulations have hindered lending  at the meeting with ceo s on friday trump said   i have so many people  friends of mine  that have nice businesses that can t borrow money   because the banks just won t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in dodd frank   despite such criticisms  recent data from the federal reserve bank of st  louis showed u s  commercial bank lending at a  year high  climbing steadily since late   democratic senator elizabeth warren who lobbied for the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau accused trump of forsaking middle and lower income individuals to help banks   the wall street bankers and lobbyists whose greed and recklessness nearly destroyed this country may be toasting each other with champagne  but the american people have not forgotten the  financial crisis   and they will not forget what happened today   she said in a statement  trump s adviser leading the deregulation effort  national economic council director gary cohn  was previously a top official at goldman sachs  gs n   billionaire investor carl icahn  meanwhile  is counseling trump on regulation across the government  one order signed by trump requires the u s  treasury secretary to submit possible regulatory changes and legislation modifying dodd frank in  days  according to a white house official  trump s pick for treasury secretary  steve mnuchin  also a former goldman banker  has yet to be confirmed by the full senate  meanwhile  a memo tells the labor department to review a  fiduciary rule  for brokers offering retirement advice that was finalized in   while early reports said trump wanted to push off the rule s implementation  originally slated for april  by  days  the order did not mention any delay  the labor department late on friday said it was considering legal options for delaying   representatives of the six largest u s  banks   jpmorgan chase   co  jpm n   bank of america corp  bac n   citigroup inc  c n   wells fargo   co  wfc n   goldman sachs group inc  gs n  and morgan stanley  ms n    either declined to comment or did not have an immediate comment  bankers  lawyers and lobbyists privately said trump s order would not do much immediately  also they said that they would prefer less extensive modifications to dodd frank after spending billions of dollars complying with the law  many want to make it  a little bit more user friendly   said john kanas  chairman of bankunited  bku n   a lender with less than   billion in assets   house of representatives financial services committee chairman jeb hensarling  a republican  told reporters at the white house that trump s approach reflects legislation he has drafted to review dodd frank  hensarling is expected to re introduce his bill allowing banks to choose between complying with dodd frank and holding more capital later this month  trump could also make changes simply by appointing new personnel or not enforcing rules   a lot of the regulations of dodd frank required a bit of a cop on the beat if you will  to ensure enforcement and if you have a different cop on the beat  they enforce different rules  or they enforce the rules differently   said fbr   co financial policy analyst edward mills  many regulators  though  were appointed by trump s predecessor  president barack obama  and intend to complete their terms  trump cannot fire heads of independent agencies  including the three top bank regulators  federal reserve chair janet yellen  comptroller of the currency thomas curry  and federal deposit insurance corp chairman martin gruenberg   in addition  the term for richard cordray  the consumer financial protection bureau director  stretches into next year  republican lawmakers are pushing trump to fire cordray  but a federal court s decision allowing him to has been stayed pending appeal   meanwhile  some u s  financial policy leaders want to keep the law  chicago fed president charles evans said on friday dodd frank  has largely been helpful  and led to a banking system with  more and better capital
