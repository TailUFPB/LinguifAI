washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama and president elect donald trump met on thursday for the first time  setting aside the deep rancor that dominated the long campaign season to discuss the transition to the republican s inauguration on jan    their  minute meeting in the white house oval office  with no aides present  took place just two days after trump s stunning election victory over hillary clinton  obama s former secretary of state  obama  who vigorously campaigned for his fellow democrat to succeed him  had repeatedly called trump unfit for the president s office  while the businessman had often dubbed  obama s eight year tenure a  disaster   but in separate post election remarks on wednesday  both men appeared to seek to help the country heal from a bitterly divisive campaign  and that tone continued into the white house meeting   seated next to obama after their talks  trump told reporters   we really discussed a lot of situations  some wonderful  some difficulties   he said obama explained  some of the really great things that have been achieved   but did not elaborate   it was a great honor being with you and i look forward to being with you many  many more times in the future   trump said  with a tone of deference  trump  a real estate magnate who has never held political office  later met congressional leaders  including u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  a republican who has had a strained relationship with trump   a fantastic day in d c  met with president obama for first time  really good meeting  great chemistry   trump said on twitter late on thursday  amid the efforts to bury hatchets  there were protests in a string of u s  cities against trump for a second day on thursday as demonstrators expressed concern that trump s election would be a blow to civil rights   just had a very open and successful presidential election  now professional protesters  incited by the media  are protesting  very unfair   trump tweeted  obama said he had offered assistance to trump over the next couple of months  and urged the country to unite to face its challenges   we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed  then the country succeeds   obama said  adding he and trump discussed a range of domestic and foreign policy issues and details related to the transition period   the meeting might have been at least a little less awkward than some might have expected   white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters      the two men s relaxed  cordial demeanor in front of the cameras was in stark contrast to the months of harsh rhetoric during the campaign  trump used obama as a punching bag during his campaign speeches  repeatedly attacking the president s policies from healthcare to an iran nuclear deal  both obama and first lady michelle obama attacked trump as temperamentally unfit for the white house and dangerously unprepared to have access to u s  nuclear codes  asked at a white house briefing on thursday whether the meeting had eased any of the concerns about trump that obama expressed during the campaign  earnest said   the president was never in a position to choose a successor  the american people chose his successor            trump went from the white house to capitol hill for meetings with republican congressional leaders  most of whom had a frosty relationship with trump during a campaign where he tore into the washington establishment   republicans retained control of the senate and house in tuesday s election  meaning at least some of trump s agenda may find friendly terrain in congress  trump emerged from meeting ryan  along with vice president elect mike pence  to tell reporters   we re going to lower taxes as you know   he added  in reference to obama s signature healthcare reform of  that is a common target of trump and congressional republicans   we re going to fix healthcare and make it more affordable and better    ryan has sought to smooth over his relationship with trump and his spokeswoman  ashlee strong  said he was  excited for the potential for unified republican government and eager to get to work with mr  trump   trump also met for an hour with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  saying afterward that he had told the senator his top three priorities were better control of immigration and the borders  healthcare and jobs  in what seemed like a possible early pivot by trump  controversial campaign proposals  including his call to ban muslims from entering the united states  disappeared for a while on thursday from the president elect s campaign website  his campaign later blamed a technical problem and the statements were returned to the website   trump declined to respond when asked by reporters after meeting with mcconnell if he would ask congress to ban muslims from entering the country  on another trump campaign pledge  a top trump aide  former house speaker newt gingrich told npr he did not expect him to spend much time trying to make mexico pay for a proposed wall along the u s  southern border  but  it was a great campaign device   such proposals  along with his free wheeling tone and frequent insults of critics and rivals  earned trump the disapproval of not just democrats but many in the republican establishment during the election campaign  trump s camp also showed signs it was beginning building a government  with names for top cabinet positions being leaked  steve bannon  trump s campaign chief  and republican national committee chairman reince priebus could be named chief of staff  trump has long hinted that his treasury secretary could be campaign finance chair steven mnuchin  formerly of goldman sachs  but there were reports u s  representative jeb hensarling and j p  morgan s jamie dimon were also being considered  thursday s start at fence mending also included meetings between vice president joe biden and his future successor  pence  and between the current and future first ladies   michelle obama met privately with trump s wife  melania  in the white house residence  michelle obama has raised two daughters in the white house and the trumps have a son   year old barron  the two women discussed raising children at the white house  earnest said   melania liked mrs  o a lot    donald trump said on
