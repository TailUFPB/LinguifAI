  this january  story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph  to conocophillips  which is not an integrated oil company  by david morgan washington  reuters    big oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a republican proposal to tax imports  given that president elect donald trump s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices     trump s emerging leadership includes exxon mobil corp chief executive officer rex tillerson as secretary of state  former texas governor rick perry as energy secretary and  oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt as environmental protection agency administrator  trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector   and in congress  both republicans and democrats have close industry ties  including house tax panel chairman kevin brady  a texas republican whose district takes in the northern houston suburbs  house republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of u s  corporate overseas profits   but a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy  though intended to boost u s  manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax  the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports  because u s  oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline  diesel and other products  analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth  integrated oil companies such as exxon  chevron corp  bp plc and royal dutch shell plc could also be hit  depending on whether they are net importers    but the industry s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges  analysts say    i don t see this mix of leadership figures in the house  senate and the white house  doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices   said peter cohn  an energy analyst with height securities  a washington based investment firm  the danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries  including retailers and automakers  which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income  such a knock on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected   trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade        we hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of congress to consider the issues carefully   chet thompson  president of the american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers trade group  said in a statement  brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and  listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out   moreover  some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs  saying the dollar s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports  currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude  they predict   this argument by the oil industry is  frankly  all wrong   said douglas holtz eakin  former director of the nonpartisan congressional budget office  who now heads the american action forum think tank   refiners are going to be basically held harmless  they ll have a lower dollar price of oil  net cost is the same  and they go about their business  i m unsympathetic   he added  height securities  cohn said trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers   trump doesn t want to have refineries closing on his watch    oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the house republican plan  but they stand to gain more than they will lose  for instance  an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to  percent from the top headline rate of  percent  under the congressional republicans  plan  the corporate rate would be cut to  percent  under trump s plan  to  percent  similarly  companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments   then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries  congressional republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether  while trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate
